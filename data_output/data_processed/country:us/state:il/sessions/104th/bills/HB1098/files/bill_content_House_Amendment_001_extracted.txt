If the appointing authority has reason to 24conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 25minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 26authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve   10400HB1098ham001- 7 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 2the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 3either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 4register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 5highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 6of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 7eligibles is less than 5 people.8    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 9losing his or her position on the register of eligibles.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 5Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 6extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 7employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 8sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 9hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 10licensure.11    In the event that any applicant who has been found 12eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 13the final eligibility register provided for in this Division 1 14has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 15year after the date of his or her physical ability 16examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 17be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 18her appointment.

Original appointments; full-time fire 17department.18    (a) Applicability. Unless a commission elects to follow 19the provisions of Section 10-2.1-6.4, this Section shall apply 20to all original appointments to an affected full-time fire 21department. Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 22be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 23years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 2497-251).25    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law   10400HB1098ham001- 25 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 2department to which this Section applies shall be administered 3in the manner provided for in this Section. Provisions of the 4Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 5adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 6initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 7continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 8Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 9and any other law, this Section shall control.10    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 11administer its fire department process for original 12appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 13Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 14Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 15concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 16functions exercised by the State.17    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 18consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 19fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 20Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 21Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree.22    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 23(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 24than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 25    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 26to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of   10400HB1098ham001- 26 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1eligibles established in accordance with the processes 2established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 3the performance standards required by this Section shall be 4placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 5an affected fire department.6    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 7a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 8firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 9position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 10death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 11any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 12that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 13eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 14conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 15minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 16authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 17the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 18the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 19either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 20register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 21highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 22of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 23eligibles is less than 5 people.24    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 25losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 26candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list   10400HB1098ham001- 27 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 2not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 3future examinations, including an examination held during the 4time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 5eligibles.6    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 7shall be vested in the board of fire and police commissioners. 8All certificates of appointment issued to any officer or 9member of an affected department shall be signed by the 10chairperson and secretary, respectively, of the board upon 11appointment of such officer or member to the affected 12department by action of the board. After being selected from 13the register of eligibles to fill a vacancy in the affected 14department, each appointee shall be presented with his or her 15certificate of appointment on the day on which he or she is 16sworn in as a classified member of the affected department. 17Firefighters who were not issued a certificate of appointment 18when originally appointed shall be provided with a certificate 19within 10 days after making a written request to the 20chairperson of the board of fire and police commissioners. 21Each person who accepts a certificate of appointment and 22successfully completes his or her probationary period shall be 23enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular member of the fire 24department.25    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 26person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the   10400HB1098ham001- 28 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 2department or fire protection district or employed by a State 3university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 4duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 5persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 6reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call 7firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 8employees of a fire department or fire protection district who 9are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 10elected officials.11    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 12The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 13identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 14aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 15of members of the fire department in order to provide the 16highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 17applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 18department shall be subject to examination and testing which 19shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 20unless the municipality shall by ordinance limit applicants to 21residents of the municipality, county or counties in which the 22municipality is located, State, or nation. Any examination and 23testing procedure utilized under subsection (e) of this 24Section shall be supported by appropriate validation evidence 25and shall comply with all applicable State and federal laws. 26Municipalities may establish educational, emergency medical   10400HB1098ham001- 29 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1service licensure, and other prerequisites for participation 2in an examination or for hire as a firefighter. Any 3municipality may charge a fee to cover the costs of the 4application process.5    Residency requirements in effect at the time an individual 6enters the fire service of a municipality cannot be made more 7restrictive for that individual during his or her period of 8service for that municipality, or be made a condition of 9promotion, except for the rank or position of fire chief and 10for no more than 2 positions that rank immediately below that 11of the chief rank which are appointed positions pursuant to 12the Fire Department Promotion Act.13    No person who is 35 years of age or older shall be eligible 14to take an examination for a position as a firefighter unless 15the person has had previous employment status as a firefighter 16in the regularly constituted fire department of the 17municipality, except as provided in this Section.

The 14examinations shall be conducted by the commissioners of the 15municipality or their designees and agents.16    No municipality shall require that any firefighter 17appointed to the lowest rank serve a probationary employment 18period of longer than one year of actual active employment, 19which may exclude periods of training, or injury or illness 20leaves, including duty related leave, in excess of 30 calendar 21days. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 22Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 23extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 24employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 25sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 26hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic   10400HB1098ham001- 31 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1licensure.2    In the event that any applicant who has been found 3eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 4the final eligibility register provided for in this Section 5has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 6year after the date of his or her physical ability 7examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 8be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 9her appointment. If, after the second examination, the 10physical ability of the applicant shall be found to be less 11than the minimum standard fixed by the rules of the 12commission, the applicant shall not be appointed. The 13applicant's name may be retained upon the register of 14candidates eligible for appointment and when next reached for 15certification and appointment that applicant may be again 16examined as provided in this Section, and if the physical 17ability of that applicant is found to be less than the minimum 18standard fixed by the rules of the commission, the applicant 19shall not be appointed, and the name of the applicant shall be 20removed from the register.21    (d) Notice, examination, and testing components. Notice of 22the time, place, general scope, merit criteria for any 23subjective component, and fee of every examination shall be 24given by the commission, by a publication at least 2 weeks 25preceding the examination: (i) in one or more newspapers 26published in the municipality, or if no newspaper is published   10400HB1098ham001- 32 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1therein, then in one or more newspapers with a general 2circulation within the municipality, or (ii) on the 3municipality's Internet website. Additional notice of the 4examination may be given as the commission shall prescribe.5    The examination and qualifying standards for employment of 6firefighters shall be based on: mental aptitude, physical 7ability, preferences, moral character, and health. The mental 8aptitude, physical ability, and preference components shall 9determine an applicant's qualification for and placement on 10the final register of eligibles. The examination may also 11include a subjective component based on merit criteria as 12determined by the commission. Scores from the examination must 13be made available to the public.14    (e) Mental aptitude. No person who does not possess at 15least a high school diploma or an equivalent high school 16education shall be placed on a register of eligibles. 17Examination of an applicant's mental aptitude shall be based 18upon a written examination.

Written 22examinations shall be administered in a manner that ensures 23the security and accuracy of the scores achieved.24    (f) Physical ability. All candidates shall be required to 25undergo an examination of their physical ability to perform 26the essential functions included in the duties they may be   10400HB1098ham001- 33 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1called upon to perform as a member of a fire department. For 2the purposes of this Section, essential functions of the job 3are functions associated with duties that a firefighter may be 4called upon to perform in response to emergency calls. The 5frequency of the occurrence of those duties as part of the fire 6department's regular routine shall not be a controlling factor 7in the design of examination criteria or evolutions selected 8for testing. These physical examinations shall be open, 9competitive, and based on industry standards designed to test 10each applicant's physical abilities in the following 11dimensions:12        (1) Muscular strength to perform tasks and evolutions 13    that may be required in the performance of duties 14    including grip strength, leg strength, and arm strength. 15    Tests shall be conducted under anaerobic as well as 16    aerobic conditions to test both the candidate's speed and 17    endurance in performing tasks and evolutions.

Appointing 13authorities may create a preliminary eligibility register. A 14person shall be placed on the list based upon his or her 15passage of the written examination or the passage of the 16written examination and the physical ability component. 17Passage of the written examination means attaining the minimum 18score set by the commission. Minimum scores should be set by 19the commission so as to demonstrate a candidate's ability to 20perform the essential functions of the job. The minimum score 21set by the commission shall be supported by appropriate 22validation evidence and shall comply with all applicable State 23and federal laws. The appointing authority may conduct the 24physical ability component and any subjective components 25subsequent to the posting of the preliminary eligibility 26register.  10400HB1098ham001- 35 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1    The examination components for an initial eligibility 2register shall be graded on a 100-point scale.

The local appointing authority may prescribe 13the score to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 14register, but the score shall not be less than the minimum 15score set by the commission.16    The commission shall prepare and keep a register of 17persons whose total score is not less than the minimum score 18for passage and who have passed the physical ability 19examination. These persons shall take rank upon the register 20as candidates in the order of their relative excellence based 21on the highest to the lowest total points scored on the mental 22aptitude, subjective component, and preference components of 23the test administered in accordance with this Section. No more 24than 60 days after each examination, an initial eligibility 25list shall be posted by the commission. The list shall include 26the final grades of the candidates without reference to   10400HB1098ham001- 36 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1priority of the time of examination and subject to claim for 2preference credit.3    Commissions may conduct additional examinations, including 4without limitation a polygraph test, after a final eligibility 5register is established and before it expires with the 6candidates ranked by total score without regard to date of 7examination. No more than 60 days after each examination, an 8initial eligibility list shall be posted by the commission 9showing the final grades of the candidates without reference 10to priority of time of examination and subject to claim for 11preference credit.12    (h) Preferences.

Apprentice preference points may be added in 2    addition to other preference points awarded by the 3    commission. 4    No person entitled to any preference shall be required to 5claim the credit before any examination held under the 6provisions of this Section, but the preference may be given 7after the posting or publication of the initial eligibility 8list or register at the request of a person entitled to a 9credit before any certification or appointments are made from 10the eligibility register, upon the furnishing of verifiable 11evidence and proof of qualifying preference credit. Candidates 12who are eligible for preference credit may make a claim in 13writing within 10 days after the posting of the initial 14eligibility list, or the claim may be deemed waived. Final 15eligibility registers may be established after the awarding of 16verified preference points. However, apprentice preference 17credit earned subsequent to the establishment of the final 18eligibility register may be applied to the applicant's score 19upon certification by the Joint Apprenticeship Committee to 20the commission and the rank order of candidates on the final 21eligibility register shall be adjusted accordingly. All 22employment shall be subject to the commission's initial hire 23background review, including, but not limited to, criminal 24history, employment history, moral character, oral 25examination, and medical and psychological examinations, all 26on a pass-fail basis.

No temporary 23appointment of any one person shall be made more than twice in 24any calendar year.25    (k) A person who knowingly divulges or receives test 26questions or answers before a written examination, or   10400HB1098ham001- 44 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1otherwise knowingly violates or subverts any requirement of 2this Section, commits a violation of this Section and may be 3subject to charges for official misconduct.4    A person who is the knowing recipient of test information 5in advance of the examination shall be disqualified from the 6examination or discharged from the position to which he or she 7was appointed, as applicable, and otherwise subjected to 8disciplinary actions.9(Source: P.A. 101-489, eff. 8-23-19; 102-375, eff. 8-13-21; 10102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 115-13-22.) 12    Section 15. The Fire Protection District Act is amended by 13changing Section 16.06b as follows: 14    (70 ILCS 705/16.06b)15    Sec. 16.06b. Original appointments; full-time fire 16department.17    (a) Applicability. Unless a commission elects to follow 18the provisions of Section 16.06c, this Section shall apply to 19all original appointments to an affected full-time fire 20department. Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 21be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 22years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 2397-251).24    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law   10400HB1098ham001- 45 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 2department to which this Section applies shall be administered 3in a no less stringent manner than the manner provided for in 4this Section. Provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code, Fire 5Protection District Act, fire district ordinances, and rules 6adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 7initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 8continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 9Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 10and any other law, this Section shall control.11    A fire protection district that is operating under a court 12order or consent decree regarding original appointments to a 13full-time fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective 14date of Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of 15this Section for the duration of the court order or consent 16decree.17    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 18to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 19eligibles established in accordance with the processes 20required by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed the 21performance standards required by the Section shall be placed 22on a register of eligibles for original appointment to an 23affected fire department.24    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 25a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 26firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new   10400HB1098ham001- 46 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 2death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 3any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 4that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 5eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 6conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 7minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 8authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 9the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 10the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 11either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 12register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 13highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 14of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 15eligibles is less than 5 people.16    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 17losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 18candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 19by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 20not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 21future examinations, including an examination held during the 22time a candidate is already on the fire district's register of 23eligibles.24    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 25shall be vested in the board of fire commissioners, or board of 26trustees serving in the capacity of a board of fire   10400HB1098ham001- 47 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1commissioners. All certificates of appointment issued to any 2officer or member of an affected department shall be signed by 3the chairperson and secretary, respectively, of the commission 4upon appointment of such officer or member to the affected 5department by action of the commission. After being selected 6from the register of eligibles to fill a vacancy in the 7affected department, each appointee shall be presented with 8his or her certificate of appointment on the day on which he or 9she is sworn in as a classified member of the affected 10department. Firefighters who were not issued a certificate of 11appointment when originally appointed shall be provided with a 12certificate within 10 days after making a written request to 13the chairperson of the board of fire commissioners, or board 14of trustees serving in the capacity of a board of fire 15commissioners. Each person who accepts a certificate of 16appointment and successfully completes his or her probationary 17period shall be enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular 18member of the fire department.19    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 20person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the 21effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 22department or fire protection district or employed by a State 23university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 24duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 25persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 26reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call   10400HB1098ham001- 48 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 2employees of a fire department or fire protection district who 3are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 4elected officials.5    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 6The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 7identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 8aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 9of members of the fire department in order to provide the 10highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 11applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 12department shall be subject to examination and testing which 13shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 14unless the district shall by ordinance limit applicants to 15residents of the district, county or counties in which the 16district is located, State, or nation. Any examination and 17testing procedure utilized under subsection (e) of this 18Section shall be supported by appropriate validation evidence 19and shall comply with all applicable State and federal laws. 20Districts may establish educational, emergency medical service 21licensure, and other prerequisites for participation in an 22examination or for hire as a firefighter. Any fire protection 23district may charge a fee to cover the costs of the application 24process.25    Residency requirements in effect at the time an individual 26enters the fire service of a district cannot be made more   10400HB1098ham001- 49 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1restrictive for that individual during his or her period of 2service for that district, or be made a condition of 3promotion, except for the rank or position of fire chief and 4for no more than 2 positions that rank immediately below that 5of the chief rank which are appointed positions pursuant to 6the Fire Department Promotion Act.7    No person who is 35 years of age or older shall be eligible 8to take an examination for a position as a firefighter unless 9the person has had previous employment status as a firefighter 10in the regularly constituted fire department of the district, 11except as provided in this Section. The age limitation does 12not apply to:13        (1) any person previously employed as a full-time 14    firefighter in a regularly constituted fire department of 15    (i) any municipality or fire protection district located 16    in Illinois, (ii) a fire protection district whose 17    obligations were assumed by a municipality under Section 18    21 of the Fire Protection District Act, or (iii) a 19    municipality whose obligations were taken over by a fire 20    protection district;21        (2) any person who has served a fire district as a 22    regularly enrolled volunteer, paid-on-call, or part-time 23    firefighter; or24        (3) any person who turned 35 while serving as a member 25    of the active or reserve components of any of the branches 26    of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National   10400HB1098ham001- 50 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1    Guard of any state, whose service was characterized as 2    honorable or under honorable, if separated from the 3    military, and is currently under the age of 40. 4    No person who is under 18 21 years of age shall be eligible 5for employment as a firefighter.6    No applicant shall be examined concerning his or her 7political or religious opinions or affiliations. The 8examinations shall be conducted by the commissioners of the 9district or their designees and agents.10    No district shall require that any firefighter appointed 11to the lowest rank serve a probationary employment period of 12longer than one year of actual active employment, which may 13exclude periods of training, or injury or illness leaves, 14including duty related leave, in excess of 30 calendar days. 15Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the 16probationary employment period limitation may be extended for 17a firefighter who is required, as a condition of employment, 18to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the sole reason 19that a firefighter may be discharged without a hearing is for 20failing to meet the requirements for paramedic licensure.21    In the event that any applicant who has been found 22eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 23the final eligibility register provided for in this Section 24has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 25year after the date of his or her physical ability 26examination, the commission may cause a second examination to   10400HB1098ham001- 51 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 2her appointment. If, after the second examination, the 3physical ability of the applicant shall be found to be less 4than the minimum standard fixed by the rules of the 5commission, the applicant shall not be appointed. The 6applicant's name may be retained upon the register of 7candidates eligible for appointment and when next reached for 8certification and appointment that applicant may be again 9examined as provided in this Section, and if the physical 10ability of that applicant is found to be less than the minimum 11standard fixed by the rules of the commission, the applicant 12shall not be appointed, and the name of the applicant shall be 13removed from the register.14    (d) Notice, examination, and testing components. Notice of 15the time, place, general scope, merit criteria for any 16subjective component, and fee of every examination shall be 17given by the commission, by a publication at least 2 weeks 18preceding the examination: (i) in one or more newspapers 19published in the district, or if no newspaper is published 20therein, then in one or more newspapers with a general 21circulation within the district, or (ii) on the fire 22protection district's Internet website. Additional notice of 23the examination may be given as the commission shall 24prescribe.25    The examination and qualifying standards for employment of 26firefighters shall be based on: mental aptitude, physical   10400HB1098ham001- 52 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1ability, preferences, moral character, and health. The mental 2aptitude, physical ability, and preference components shall 3determine an applicant's qualification for and placement on 4the final register of eligibles. The examination may also 5include a subjective component based on merit criteria as 6determined by the commission. Scores from the examination must 7be made available to the public.8    (e) Mental aptitude. No person who does not possess at 9least a high school diploma or an equivalent high school 10education shall be placed on a register of eligibles. 11Examination of an applicant's mental aptitude shall be based 12upon a written examination.

Written 16examinations shall be administered in a manner that ensures 17the security and accuracy of the scores achieved.18    (f) Physical ability. All candidates shall be required to 19undergo an examination of their physical ability to perform 20the essential functions included in the duties they may be 21called upon to perform as a member of a fire department. For 22the purposes of this Section, essential functions of the job 23are functions associated with duties that a firefighter may be 24called upon to perform in response to emergency calls. The 25frequency of the occurrence of those duties as part of the fire 26department's regular routine shall not be a controlling factor   10400HB1098ham001- 53 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1in the design of examination criteria or evolutions selected 2for testing. These physical examinations shall be open, 3competitive, and based on industry standards designed to test 4each applicant's physical abilities in the following 5dimensions:6        (1) Muscular strength to perform tasks and evolutions 7    that may be required in the performance of duties 8    including grip strength, leg strength, and arm strength. 9    Tests shall be conducted under anaerobic as well as 10    aerobic conditions to test both the candidate's speed and 11    endurance in performing tasks and evolutions. Tasks tested 12    may be based on standards developed, or approved, by the 13    local appointing authority.14        (2) The ability to climb ladders, operate from 15    heights, walk or crawl in the dark along narrow and uneven 16    surfaces, and operate in proximity to hazardous 17    environments.18        (3) The ability to carry out critical, time-sensitive, 19    and complex problem solving during physical exertion in 20    stressful and hazardous environments.

Appointing 7authorities may create a preliminary eligibility register. A 8person shall be placed on the list based upon his or her 9passage of the written examination or the passage of the 10written examination and the physical ability component. 11Passage of the written examination means attaining the minimum 12score set by the commission. Minimum scores should be set by 13the appointing authorities so as to demonstrate a candidate's 14ability to perform the essential functions of the job. The 15minimum score set by the commission shall be supported by 16appropriate validation evidence and shall comply with all 17applicable State and federal laws. The appointing authority 18may conduct the physical ability component and any subjective 19components subsequent to the posting of the preliminary 20eligibility register.21    The examination components for an initial eligibility 22register shall be graded on a 100-point scale. A person's 23position on the list shall be determined by the following: (i) 24the person's score on the written examination, (ii) the person 25successfully passing the physical ability component, and (iii) 26the person's results on any subjective component as described   10400HB1098ham001- 55 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1in subsection (d). 2    In order to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 3register, an applicant's score on the written examination, 4before any applicable preference points or subjective points 5are applied, shall be at or above the minimum score set by the 6commission. The local appointing authority may prescribe the 7score to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 8register, but the score shall not be less than the minimum 9score set by the commission.10    The commission shall prepare and keep a register of 11persons whose total score is not less than the minimum score 12for passage and who have passed the physical ability 13examination. These persons shall take rank upon the register 14as candidates in the order of their relative excellence based 15on the highest to the lowest total points scored on the mental 16aptitude, subjective component, and preference components of 17the test administered in accordance with this Section. No more 18than 60 days after each examination, an initial eligibility 19list shall be posted by the commission. The list shall include 20the final grades of the candidates without reference to 21priority of the time of examination and subject to claim for 22preference credit.23    Commissions may conduct additional examinations, including 24without limitation a polygraph test, after a final eligibility 25register is established and before it expires with the 26candidates ranked by total score without regard to date of   10400HB1098ham001- 56 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1examination. No more than 60 days after each examination, an 2initial eligibility list shall be posted by the commission 3showing the final grades of the candidates without reference 4to priority of time of examination and subject to claim for 5preference credit.6    (h) Preferences.

The commission shall give 20    preference for original appointment to persons designated 21    in items (2) through (7) by adding the requisite number of 22    points to the final grade for each recognized preference 23    achieved. The numerical result thus attained shall be 24    applied by the commission in determining the final 25    eligibility list and appointment from the eligibility 26    list.

Original appointments; full-time fire 17department.18    (a) Applicability. Unless a commission elects to follow 19the provisions of Section 10-2.1-6.4, this Section shall apply 20to all original appointments to an affected full-time fire 21department. Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 22be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 23years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 2497-251).25    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law   10400HB1098ham001- 25 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 2department to which this Section applies shall be administered 3in the manner provided for in this Section. Provisions of the 4Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 5adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 6initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 7continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 8Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 9and any other law, this Section shall control.10    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 11administer its fire department process for original 12appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 13Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 14Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 15concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 16functions exercised by the State.17    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 18consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 19fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 20Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 21Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree.22    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 23(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 24than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 25    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 26to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of   10400HB1098ham001- 26 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1eligibles established in accordance with the processes 2established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 3the performance standards required by this Section shall be 4placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 5an affected fire department.6    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 7a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 8firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 9position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 10death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 11any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 12that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 13eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 14conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 15minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 16authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 17the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 18the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 19either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 20register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 21highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 22of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 23eligibles is less than 5 people.24    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 25losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 26candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list   10400HB1098ham001- 27 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 2not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 3future examinations, including an examination held during the 4time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 5eligibles.6    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 7shall be vested in the board of fire and police commissioners. 8All certificates of appointment issued to any officer or 9member of an affected department shall be signed by the 10chairperson and secretary, respectively, of the board upon 11appointment of such officer or member to the affected 12department by action of the board. After being selected from 13the register of eligibles to fill a vacancy in the affected 14department, each appointee shall be presented with his or her 15certificate of appointment on the day on which he or she is 16sworn in as a classified member of the affected department. 17Firefighters who were not issued a certificate of appointment 18when originally appointed shall be provided with a certificate 19within 10 days after making a written request to the 20chairperson of the board of fire and police commissioners. 21Each person who accepts a certificate of appointment and 22successfully completes his or her probationary period shall be 23enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular member of the fire 24department.25    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 26person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the   10400HB1098ham001- 28 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 2department or fire protection district or employed by a State 3university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 4duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 5persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 6reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call 7firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 8employees of a fire department or fire protection district who 9are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 10elected officials.11    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 12The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 13identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 14aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 15of members of the fire department in order to provide the 16highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 17applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 18department shall be subject to examination and testing which 19shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 20unless the municipality shall by ordinance limit applicants to 21residents of the municipality, county or counties in which the 22municipality is located, State, or nation. Any examination and 23testing procedure utilized under subsection (e) of this 24Section shall be supported by appropriate validation evidence 25and shall comply with all applicable State and federal laws. 26Municipalities may establish educational, emergency medical   10400HB1098ham001- 29 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1service licensure, and other prerequisites for participation 2in an examination or for hire as a firefighter. Any 3municipality may charge a fee to cover the costs of the 4application process.5    Residency requirements in effect at the time an individual 6enters the fire service of a municipality cannot be made more 7restrictive for that individual during his or her period of 8service for that municipality, or be made a condition of 9promotion, except for the rank or position of fire chief and 10for no more than 2 positions that rank immediately below that 11of the chief rank which are appointed positions pursuant to 12the Fire Department Promotion Act.13    No person who is 35 years of age or older shall be eligible 14to take an examination for a position as a firefighter unless 15the person has had previous employment status as a firefighter 16in the regularly constituted fire department of the 17municipality, except as provided in this Section. The age 18limitation does not apply to:19        (1) any person previously employed as a full-time 20    firefighter in a regularly constituted fire department of 21    (i) any municipality or fire protection district located 22    in Illinois, (ii) a fire protection district whose 23    obligations were assumed by a municipality under Section 24    21 of the Fire Protection District Act, or (iii) a 25    municipality whose obligations were taken over by a fire 26    protection district,  10400HB1098ham001- 30 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1        (2) any person who has served a municipality as a 2    regularly enrolled volunteer, paid-on-call, or part-time 3    firefighter, or4        (3) any person who turned 35 while serving as a member 5    of the active or reserve components of any of the branches 6    of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National 7    Guard of any state, whose service was characterized as 8    honorable or under honorable, if separated from the 9    military, and is currently under the age of 40. 10    No person who is under 18 21 years of age shall be eligible 11for employment as a firefighter.12    No applicant shall be examined concerning his or her 13political or religious opinions or affiliations. The 14examinations shall be conducted by the commissioners of the 15municipality or their designees and agents.16    No municipality shall require that any firefighter 17appointed to the lowest rank serve a probationary employment 18period of longer than one year of actual active employment, 19which may exclude periods of training, or injury or illness 20leaves, including duty related leave, in excess of 30 calendar 21days. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 22Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 23extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 24employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 25sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 26hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic   10400HB1098ham001- 31 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1licensure.2    In the event that any applicant who has been found 3eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 4the final eligibility register provided for in this Section 5has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 6year after the date of his or her physical ability 7examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 8be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 9her appointment. If, after the second examination, the 10physical ability of the applicant shall be found to be less 11than the minimum standard fixed by the rules of the 12commission, the applicant shall not be appointed. The 13applicant's name may be retained upon the register of 14candidates eligible for appointment and when next reached for 15certification and appointment that applicant may be again 16examined as provided in this Section, and if the physical 17ability of that applicant is found to be less than the minimum 18standard fixed by the rules of the commission, the applicant 19shall not be appointed, and the name of the applicant shall be 20removed from the register.21    (d) Notice, examination, and testing components. Notice of 22the time, place, general scope, merit criteria for any 23subjective component, and fee of every examination shall be 24given by the commission, by a publication at least 2 weeks 25preceding the examination: (i) in one or more newspapers 26published in the municipality, or if no newspaper is published   10400HB1098ham001- 32 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1therein, then in one or more newspapers with a general 2circulation within the municipality, or (ii) on the 3municipality's Internet website. Additional notice of the 4examination may be given as the commission shall prescribe.5    The examination and qualifying standards for employment of 6firefighters shall be based on: mental aptitude, physical 7ability, preferences, moral character, and health. The mental 8aptitude, physical ability, and preference components shall 9determine an applicant's qualification for and placement on 10the final register of eligibles. The examination may also 11include a subjective component based on merit criteria as 12determined by the commission. Scores from the examination must 13be made available to the public.14    (e) Mental aptitude. No person who does not possess at 15least a high school diploma or an equivalent high school 16education shall be placed on a register of eligibles. 17Examination of an applicant's mental aptitude shall be based 18upon a written examination.

The 5frequency of the occurrence of those duties as part of the fire 6department's regular routine shall not be a controlling factor 7in the design of examination criteria or evolutions selected 8for testing. These physical examinations shall be open, 9competitive, and based on industry standards designed to test 10each applicant's physical abilities in the following 11dimensions:12        (1) Muscular strength to perform tasks and evolutions 13    that may be required in the performance of duties 14    including grip strength, leg strength, and arm strength. 15    Tests shall be conducted under anaerobic as well as 16    aerobic conditions to test both the candidate's speed and 17    endurance in performing tasks and evolutions.

Appointing 13authorities may create a preliminary eligibility register. A 14person shall be placed on the list based upon his or her 15passage of the written examination or the passage of the 16written examination and the physical ability component. 17Passage of the written examination means attaining the minimum 18score set by the commission. Minimum scores should be set by 19the commission so as to demonstrate a candidate's ability to 20perform the essential functions of the job. The minimum score 21set by the commission shall be supported by appropriate 22validation evidence and shall comply with all applicable State 23and federal laws. The appointing authority may conduct the 24physical ability component and any subjective components 25subsequent to the posting of the preliminary eligibility 26register.  10400HB1098ham001- 35 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1    The examination components for an initial eligibility 2register shall be graded on a 100-point scale.

The local appointing authority may prescribe 13the score to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 14register, but the score shall not be less than the minimum 15score set by the commission.16    The commission shall prepare and keep a register of 17persons whose total score is not less than the minimum score 18for passage and who have passed the physical ability 19examination. These persons shall take rank upon the register 20as candidates in the order of their relative excellence based 21on the highest to the lowest total points scored on the mental 22aptitude, subjective component, and preference components of 23the test administered in accordance with this Section. No more 24than 60 days after each examination, an initial eligibility 25list shall be posted by the commission. The list shall include 26the final grades of the candidates without reference to   10400HB1098ham001- 36 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1priority of the time of examination and subject to claim for 2preference credit.3    Commissions may conduct additional examinations, including 4without limitation a polygraph test, after a final eligibility 5register is established and before it expires with the 6candidates ranked by total score without regard to date of 7examination. No more than 60 days after each examination, an 8initial eligibility list shall be posted by the commission 9showing the final grades of the candidates without reference 10to priority of time of examination and subject to claim for 11preference credit.12    (h) Preferences.

Unless a commission elects to follow 18the provisions of Section 16.06c, this Section shall apply to 19all original appointments to an affected full-time fire 20department. Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 21be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 22years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 2397-251).24    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law   10400HB1098ham001- 45 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 2department to which this Section applies shall be administered 3in a no less stringent manner than the manner provided for in 4this Section. Provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code, Fire 5Protection District Act, fire district ordinances, and rules 6adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 7initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 8continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 9Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 10and any other law, this Section shall control.11    A fire protection district that is operating under a court 12order or consent decree regarding original appointments to a 13full-time fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective 14date of Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of 15this Section for the duration of the court order or consent 16decree.17    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 18to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 19eligibles established in accordance with the processes 20required by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed the 21performance standards required by the Section shall be placed 22on a register of eligibles for original appointment to an 23affected fire department.24    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 25a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 26firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new   10400HB1098ham001- 46 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 2death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 3any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 4that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 5eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 6conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 7minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 8authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 9the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 10the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 11either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 12register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 13highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 14of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 15eligibles is less than 5 people.16    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 17losing his or her position on the register of eligibles.

Each person who accepts a certificate of 16appointment and successfully completes his or her probationary 17period shall be enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular 18member of the fire department.19    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 20person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the 21effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 22department or fire protection district or employed by a State 23university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 24duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 25persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 26reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call   10400HB1098ham001- 48 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 2employees of a fire department or fire protection district who 3are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 4elected officials.5    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 6The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 7identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 8aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 9of members of the fire department in order to provide the 10highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 11applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 12department shall be subject to examination and testing which 13shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 14unless the district shall by ordinance limit applicants to 15residents of the district, county or counties in which the 16district is located, State, or nation.

These physical examinations shall be open, 3competitive, and based on industry standards designed to test 4each applicant's physical abilities in the following 5dimensions:6        (1) Muscular strength to perform tasks and evolutions 7    that may be required in the performance of duties 8    including grip strength, leg strength, and arm strength. 9    Tests shall be conducted under anaerobic as well as 10    aerobic conditions to test both the candidate's speed and 11    endurance in performing tasks and evolutions.

Minimum scores should be set by 13the appointing authorities so as to demonstrate a candidate's 14ability to perform the essential functions of the job. The 15minimum score set by the commission shall be supported by 16appropriate validation evidence and shall comply with all 17applicable State and federal laws. The appointing authority 18may conduct the physical ability component and any subjective 19components subsequent to the posting of the preliminary 20eligibility register.21    The examination components for an initial eligibility 22register shall be graded on a 100-point scale.

The local appointing authority may prescribe the 7score to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 8register, but the score shall not be less than the minimum 9score set by the commission.10    The commission shall prepare and keep a register of 11persons whose total score is not less than the minimum score 12for passage and who have passed the physical ability 13examination. These persons shall take rank upon the register 14as candidates in the order of their relative excellence based 15on the highest to the lowest total points scored on the mental 16aptitude, subjective component, and preference components of 17the test administered in accordance with this Section. No more 18than 60 days after each examination, an initial eligibility 19list shall be posted by the commission. The list shall include 20the final grades of the candidates without reference to 21priority of the time of examination and subject to claim for 22preference credit.23    Commissions may conduct additional examinations, including 24without limitation a polygraph test, after a final eligibility 25register is established and before it expires with the 26candidates ranked by total score without regard to date of   10400HB1098ham001- 56 -LRB104 04060 RPS 23850 a1examination.
