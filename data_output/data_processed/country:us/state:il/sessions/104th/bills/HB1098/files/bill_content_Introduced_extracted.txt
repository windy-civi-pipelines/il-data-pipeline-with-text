Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 13be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 14years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 1597-251).16    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law 17to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 18department to which this Section applies shall be administered 19in the manner provided for in this Section. Provisions of the 20Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 21adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 22initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 23continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this   HB1098- 2 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 2and any other law, this Section shall control.3    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 4administer its fire department process for original 5appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 6Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 7Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 8concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 9functions exercised by the State.10    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 11consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 12fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 13Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 14Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree. 15    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 16(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 17than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 18    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 19to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 20eligibles established in accordance with the processes 21established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 22the performance standards required by this Section shall be 23placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 24an affected fire department.25    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 26a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a   HB1098- 3 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 2position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 3death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 4any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 5that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 6eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 7conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 8minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 9authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 10the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 11the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 12either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 13register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 14highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 15of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 16eligibles is less than 5 people.17    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 18losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 19candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 20by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 21not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 22future examinations, including an examination held during the 23time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 24eligibles.25    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 26shall be vested in the Civil Service Commission. All   HB1098- 4 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1certificates of appointment issued to any officer or member of 2an affected department shall be signed by the chairperson and 3secretary, respectively, of the commission upon appointment of 4such officer or member to the affected department by the 5commission. After being selected from the register of 6eligibles to fill a vacancy in the affected department, each 7appointee shall be presented with his or her certificate of 8appointment on the day on which he or she is sworn in as a 9classified member of the affected department. Firefighters who 10were not issued a certificate of appointment when originally 11appointed shall be provided with a certificate within 10 days 12after making a written request to the chairperson of the Civil 13Service Commission. Each person who accepts a certificate of 14appointment and successfully completes his or her probationary 15period shall be enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular 16member of the fire department.17    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 18person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the 19effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 20department or fire protection district or employed by a State 21university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 22duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 23persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 24reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call 25firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 26employees of a fire department or fire protection district who   HB1098- 5 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 2elected officials.3    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 4The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 5identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 6aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 7of members of the fire department in order to provide the 8highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 9applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 10department shall be subject to examination and testing which 11shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 12unless the municipality shall by ordinance limit applicants to 13residents of the municipality, county or counties in which the 14municipality is located, State, or nation. Any examination and 15testing procedure utilized under subsection (e) of this 16Section shall be supported by appropriate validation evidence 17and shall comply with all applicable State and federal laws. 18Municipalities may establish educational, emergency medical 19service licensure, and other prerequisites for participation 20in an examination or for hire as a firefighter. Any 21municipality may charge a fee to cover the costs of the 22application process.23    Residency requirements in effect at the time an individual 24enters the fire service of a municipality cannot be made more 25restrictive for that individual during his or her period of 26service for that municipality, or be made a condition of   HB1098- 6 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1promotion, except for the rank or position of fire chief and 2for no more than 2 positions that rank immediately below that 3of the chief rank which are appointed positions pursuant to 4the Fire Department Promotion Act.5    No person who is 35 years of age or older shall be eligible 6to take an examination for a position as a firefighter unless 7the person has had previous employment status as a firefighter 8in the regularly constituted fire department of the 9municipality, except as provided in this Section. The age 10limitation does not apply to:11        (1) any person previously employed as a full-time 12    firefighter in a regularly constituted fire department of 13    (i) any municipality or fire protection district located 14    in Illinois, (ii) a fire protection district whose 15    obligations were assumed by a municipality under Section 16    21 of the Fire Protection District Act, or (iii) a 17    municipality whose obligations were taken over by a fire 18    protection district,19        (2) any person who has served a municipality as a 20    regularly enrolled volunteer, paid-on-call, or part-time 21    firefighter, or22        (3) any person who turned 35 while serving as a member 23    of the active or reserve components of any of the branches 24    of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National 25    Guard of any state, whose service was characterized as 26    honorable or under honorable, if separated from the   HB1098- 7 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1    military, and is currently under the age of 40. 2    No person who is under 18 21 years of age shall be eligible 3for employment as a firefighter.4    No applicant shall be examined concerning his or her 5political or religious opinions or affiliations. The 6examinations shall be conducted by the commissioners of the 7municipality or their designees and agents.8    No municipality shall require that any firefighter 9appointed to the lowest rank serve a probationary employment 10period of longer than one year of actual active employment, 11which may exclude periods of training, or injury or illness 12leaves, including duty related leave, in excess of 30 calendar 13days. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 14Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 15extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 16employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 17sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 18hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 19licensure.20    In the event that any applicant who has been found 21eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 22the final eligibility register provided for in this Division 1 23has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 24year after the date of his or her physical ability 25examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 26be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or   HB1098- 8 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1her appointment.

The mental 26aptitude, physical ability, and preference components shall   HB1098- 9 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1determine an applicant's qualification for and placement on 2the final register of eligibles.

All candidates shall be required to 17undergo an examination of their physical ability to perform 18the essential functions included in the duties they may be 19called upon to perform as a member of a fire department. For 20the purposes of this Section, essential functions of the job 21are functions associated with duties that a firefighter may be 22called upon to perform in response to emergency calls. The 23frequency of the occurrence of those duties as part of the fire 24department's regular routine shall not be a controlling factor 25in the design of examination criteria or evolutions selected 26for testing. These physical examinations shall be open,   HB1098- 10 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1competitive, and based on industry standards designed to test 2each applicant's physical abilities in the following 3dimensions:4        (1) Muscular strength to perform tasks and evolutions 5    that may be required in the performance of duties 6    including grip strength, leg strength, and arm strength. 7    Tests shall be conducted under anaerobic as well as 8    aerobic conditions to test both the candidate's speed and 9    endurance in performing tasks and evolutions.

Minimum scores should be set by 11the commission so as to demonstrate a candidate's ability to 12perform the essential functions of the job. The minimum score 13set by the commission shall be supported by appropriate 14validation evidence and shall comply with all applicable State 15and federal laws.

Unless a commission elects to follow 3the provisions of Section 10-2.1-6.4, this Section shall apply 4to all original appointments to an affected full-time fire 5department. Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 6be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 7years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 897-251).9    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law 10to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 11department to which this Section applies shall be administered 12in the manner provided for in this Section. Provisions of the 13Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 14adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 15initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 16continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 17Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 18and any other law, this Section shall control.19    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 20administer its fire department process for original 21appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 22Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 23Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 24concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 25functions exercised by the State.26    A municipality that is operating under a court order or   HB1098- 22 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 2fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 3Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 4Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree.5    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 6(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 7than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 8    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 9to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 10eligibles established in accordance with the processes 11established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 12the performance standards required by this Section shall be 13placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 14an affected fire department.15    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 16a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 17firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 18position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 19death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 20any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 21that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 22eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 23conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 24minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 25authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 26the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has   HB1098- 23 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 2either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 3register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 4highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 5of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 6eligibles is less than 5 people.7    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 8losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 9candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 10by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 11not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 12future examinations, including an examination held during the 13time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 14eligibles.15    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 16shall be vested in the board of fire and police commissioners. 17All certificates of appointment issued to any officer or 18member of an affected department shall be signed by the 19chairperson and secretary, respectively, of the board upon 20appointment of such officer or member to the affected 21department by action of the board. After being selected from 22the register of eligibles to fill a vacancy in the affected 23department, each appointee shall be presented with his or her 24certificate of appointment on the day on which he or she is 25sworn in as a classified member of the affected department. 26Firefighters who were not issued a certificate of appointment   HB1098- 24 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1when originally appointed shall be provided with a certificate 2within 10 days after making a written request to the 3chairperson of the board of fire and police commissioners. 4Each person who accepts a certificate of appointment and 5successfully completes his or her probationary period shall be 6enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular member of the fire 7department.8    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 9person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the 10effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 11department or fire protection district or employed by a State 12university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 13duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 14persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 15reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call 16firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 17employees of a fire department or fire protection district who 18are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 19elected officials.20    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 21The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 22identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 23aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 24of members of the fire department in order to provide the 25highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 26applicants for original appointment to an affected fire   HB1098- 25 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1department shall be subject to examination and testing which 2shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 3unless the municipality shall by ordinance limit applicants to 4residents of the municipality, county or counties in which the 5municipality is located, State, or nation. Any examination and 6testing procedure utilized under subsection (e) of this 7Section shall be supported by appropriate validation evidence 8and shall comply with all applicable State and federal laws. 9Municipalities may establish educational, emergency medical 10service licensure, and other prerequisites for participation 11in an examination or for hire as a firefighter. Any 12municipality may charge a fee to cover the costs of the 13application process.14    Residency requirements in effect at the time an individual 15enters the fire service of a municipality cannot be made more 16restrictive for that individual during his or her period of 17service for that municipality, or be made a condition of 18promotion, except for the rank or position of fire chief and 19for no more than 2 positions that rank immediately below that 20of the chief rank which are appointed positions pursuant to 21the Fire Department Promotion Act.22    No person who is 35 years of age or older shall be eligible 23to take an examination for a position as a firefighter unless 24the person has had previous employment status as a firefighter 25in the regularly constituted fire department of the 26municipality, except as provided in this Section. The age   HB1098- 26 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1limitation does not apply to:2        (1) any person previously employed as a full-time 3    firefighter in a regularly constituted fire department of 4    (i) any municipality or fire protection district located 5    in Illinois, (ii) a fire protection district whose 6    obligations were assumed by a municipality under Section 7    21 of the Fire Protection District Act, or (iii) a 8    municipality whose obligations were taken over by a fire 9    protection district,10        (2) any person who has served a municipality as a 11    regularly enrolled volunteer, paid-on-call, or part-time 12    firefighter, or13        (3) any person who turned 35 while serving as a member 14    of the active or reserve components of any of the branches 15    of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National 16    Guard of any state, whose service was characterized as 17    honorable or under honorable, if separated from the 18    military, and is currently under the age of 40. 19    No person who is under 18 21 years of age shall be eligible 20for employment as a firefighter.21    No applicant shall be examined concerning his or her 22political or religious opinions or affiliations. The 23examinations shall be conducted by the commissioners of the 24municipality or their designees and agents.25    No municipality shall require that any firefighter 26appointed to the lowest rank serve a probationary employment   HB1098- 27 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1period of longer than one year of actual active employment, 2which may exclude periods of training, or injury or illness 3leaves, including duty related leave, in excess of 30 calendar 4days. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 5Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 6extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 7employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 8sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 9hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 10licensure.11    In the event that any applicant who has been found 12eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 13the final eligibility register provided for in this Section 14has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 15year after the date of his or her physical ability 16examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 17be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 18her appointment. If, after the second examination, the 19physical ability of the applicant shall be found to be less 20than the minimum standard fixed by the rules of the 21commission, the applicant shall not be appointed. The 22applicant's name may be retained upon the register of 23candidates eligible for appointment and when next reached for 24certification and appointment that applicant may be again 25examined as provided in this Section, and if the physical 26ability of that applicant is found to be less than the minimum   HB1098- 28 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1standard fixed by the rules of the commission, the applicant 2shall not be appointed, and the name of the applicant shall be 3removed from the register.4    (d) Notice, examination, and testing components. Notice of 5the time, place, general scope, merit criteria for any 6subjective component, and fee of every examination shall be 7given by the commission, by a publication at least 2 weeks 8preceding the examination: (i) in one or more newspapers 9published in the municipality, or if no newspaper is published 10therein, then in one or more newspapers with a general 11circulation within the municipality, or (ii) on the 12municipality's Internet website. Additional notice of the 13examination may be given as the commission shall prescribe.14    The examination and qualifying standards for employment of 15firefighters shall be based on: mental aptitude, physical 16ability, preferences, moral character, and health. The mental 17aptitude, physical ability, and preference components shall 18determine an applicant's qualification for and placement on 19the final register of eligibles. The examination may also 20include a subjective component based on merit criteria as 21determined by the commission. Scores from the examination must 22be made available to the public.23    (e) Mental aptitude. No person who does not possess at 24least a high school diploma or an equivalent high school 25education shall be placed on a register of eligibles. 26Examination of an applicant's mental aptitude shall be based   HB1098- 29 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1upon a written examination. The examination shall be practical 2in character and relate to those matters that fairly test the 3capacity of the persons examined to discharge the duties 4performed by members of a fire department. Written 5examinations shall be administered in a manner that ensures 6the security and accuracy of the scores achieved.7    (f) Physical ability. All candidates shall be required to 8undergo an examination of their physical ability to perform 9the essential functions included in the duties they may be 10called upon to perform as a member of a fire department. For 11the purposes of this Section, essential functions of the job 12are functions associated with duties that a firefighter may be 13called upon to perform in response to emergency calls. The 14frequency of the occurrence of those duties as part of the fire 15department's regular routine shall not be a controlling factor 16in the design of examination criteria or evolutions selected 17for testing. These physical examinations shall be open, 18competitive, and based on industry standards designed to test 19each applicant's physical abilities in the following 20dimensions:21        (1) Muscular strength to perform tasks and evolutions 22    that may be required in the performance of duties 23    including grip strength, leg strength, and arm strength. 24    Tests shall be conducted under anaerobic as well as 25    aerobic conditions to test both the candidate's speed and 26    endurance in performing tasks and evolutions. Tasks tested   HB1098- 30 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1    may be based on standards developed, or approved, by the 2    local appointing authority.3        (2) The ability to climb ladders, operate from 4    heights, walk or crawl in the dark along narrow and uneven 5    surfaces, and operate in proximity to hazardous 6    environments.7        (3) The ability to carry out critical, time-sensitive, 8    and complex problem solving during physical exertion in 9    stressful and hazardous environments. The testing 10    environment may be hot and dark with tightly enclosed 11    spaces, flashing lights, sirens, and other distractions.12    The tests utilized to measure each applicant's 13capabilities in each of these dimensions may be tests based on 14industry standards currently in use or equivalent tests 15approved by the Joint Labor-Management Committee of the Office 16of the State Fire Marshal. 17    Physical ability examinations administered under this 18Section shall be conducted with a reasonable number of 19proctors and monitors, open to the public, and subject to 20reasonable regulations of the commission.21    (g) Scoring of examination components. Appointing 22authorities may create a preliminary eligibility register. A 23person shall be placed on the list based upon his or her 24passage of the written examination or the passage of the 25written examination and the physical ability component. 26Passage of the written examination means attaining the minimum   HB1098- 31 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1score set by the commission. Minimum scores should be set by 2the commission so as to demonstrate a candidate's ability to 3perform the essential functions of the job. The minimum score 4set by the commission shall be supported by appropriate 5validation evidence and shall comply with all applicable State 6and federal laws. The appointing authority may conduct the 7physical ability component and any subjective components 8subsequent to the posting of the preliminary eligibility 9register.10    The examination components for an initial eligibility 11register shall be graded on a 100-point scale. A person's 12position on the list shall be determined by the following: (i) 13the person's score on the written examination, (ii) the person 14successfully passing the physical ability component, and (iii) 15the person's results on any subjective component as described 16in subsection (d). 17    In order to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 18register, an applicant's score on the written examination, 19before any applicable preference points or subjective points 20are applied, shall be at or above the minimum score as set by 21the commission. The local appointing authority may prescribe 22the score to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 23register, but the score shall not be less than the minimum 24score set by the commission.25    The commission shall prepare and keep a register of 26persons whose total score is not less than the minimum score   HB1098- 32 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1for passage and who have passed the physical ability 2examination. These persons shall take rank upon the register 3as candidates in the order of their relative excellence based 4on the highest to the lowest total points scored on the mental 5aptitude, subjective component, and preference components of 6the test administered in accordance with this Section. No more 7than 60 days after each examination, an initial eligibility 8list shall be posted by the commission. The list shall include 9the final grades of the candidates without reference to 10priority of the time of examination and subject to claim for 11preference credit.12    Commissions may conduct additional examinations, including 13without limitation a polygraph test, after a final eligibility 14register is established and before it expires with the 15candidates ranked by total score without regard to date of 16examination. No more than 60 days after each examination, an 17initial eligibility list shall be posted by the commission 18showing the final grades of the candidates without reference 19to priority of time of examination and subject to claim for 20preference credit.21    (h) Preferences.

Original appointments; full-time fire   HB1098- 41 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1department.2    (a) Applicability. Unless a commission elects to follow 3the provisions of Section 16.06c, this Section shall apply to 4all original appointments to an affected full-time fire 5department. Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 6be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 7years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 897-251).9    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law 10to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 11department to which this Section applies shall be administered 12in a no less stringent manner than the manner provided for in 13this Section. Provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code, Fire 14Protection District Act, fire district ordinances, and rules 15adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 16initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 17continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 18Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 19and any other law, this Section shall control.20    A fire protection district that is operating under a court 21order or consent decree regarding original appointments to a 22full-time fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective 23date of Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of 24this Section for the duration of the court order or consent 25decree.26    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made   HB1098- 42 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 2eligibles established in accordance with the processes 3required by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed the 4performance standards required by the Section shall be placed 5on a register of eligibles for original appointment to an 6affected fire department.7    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 8a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 9firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 10position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 11death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 12any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 13that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 14eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 15conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 16minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 17authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 18the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 19the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 20either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 21register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 22highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 23of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 24eligibles is less than 5 people.25    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 26losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any   HB1098- 43 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 2by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 3not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 4future examinations, including an examination held during the 5time a candidate is already on the fire district's register of 6eligibles.7    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 8shall be vested in the board of fire commissioners, or board of 9trustees serving in the capacity of a board of fire 10commissioners. All certificates of appointment issued to any 11officer or member of an affected department shall be signed by 12the chairperson and secretary, respectively, of the commission 13upon appointment of such officer or member to the affected 14department by action of the commission. After being selected 15from the register of eligibles to fill a vacancy in the 16affected department, each appointee shall be presented with 17his or her certificate of appointment on the day on which he or 18she is sworn in as a classified member of the affected 19department. Firefighters who were not issued a certificate of 20appointment when originally appointed shall be provided with a 21certificate within 10 days after making a written request to 22the chairperson of the board of fire commissioners, or board 23of trustees serving in the capacity of a board of fire 24commissioners. Each person who accepts a certificate of 25appointment and successfully completes his or her probationary 26period shall be enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular   HB1098- 44 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1member of the fire department.2    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 3person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the 4effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 5department or fire protection district or employed by a State 6university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 7duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 8persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 9reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call 10firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 11employees of a fire department or fire protection district who 12are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 13elected officials.14    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 15The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 16identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 17aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 18of members of the fire department in order to provide the 19highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 20applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 21department shall be subject to examination and testing which 22shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 23unless the district shall by ordinance limit applicants to 24residents of the district, county or counties in which the 25district is located, State, or nation.

The age limitation does 21not apply to:22        (1) any person previously employed as a full-time 23    firefighter in a regularly constituted fire department of 24    (i) any municipality or fire protection district located 25    in Illinois, (ii) a fire protection district whose 26    obligations were assumed by a municipality under Section   HB1098- 46 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1    21 of the Fire Protection District Act, or (iii) a 2    municipality whose obligations were taken over by a fire 3    protection district;4        (2) any person who has served a fire district as a 5    regularly enrolled volunteer, paid-on-call, or part-time 6    firefighter; or7        (3) any person who turned 35 while serving as a member 8    of the active or reserve components of any of the branches 9    of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National 10    Guard of any state, whose service was characterized as 11    honorable or under honorable, if separated from the 12    military, and is currently under the age of 40. 13    No person who is under 18 21 years of age shall be eligible 14for employment as a firefighter.15    No applicant shall be examined concerning his or her 16political or religious opinions or affiliations.

If, after the second examination, the 12physical ability of the applicant shall be found to be less 13than the minimum standard fixed by the rules of the 14commission, the applicant shall not be appointed. The 15applicant's name may be retained upon the register of 16candidates eligible for appointment and when next reached for 17certification and appointment that applicant may be again 18examined as provided in this Section, and if the physical 19ability of that applicant is found to be less than the minimum 20standard fixed by the rules of the commission, the applicant 21shall not be appointed, and the name of the applicant shall be 22removed from the register.23    (d) Notice, examination, and testing components.

Additional notice of 6the examination may be given as the commission shall 7prescribe.8    The examination and qualifying standards for employment of 9firefighters shall be based on: mental aptitude, physical 10ability, preferences, moral character, and health. The mental 11aptitude, physical ability, and preference components shall 12determine an applicant's qualification for and placement on 13the final register of eligibles. The examination may also 14include a subjective component based on merit criteria as 15determined by the commission. Scores from the examination must 16be made available to the public.17    (e) Mental aptitude. No person who does not possess at 18least a high school diploma or an equivalent high school 19education shall be placed on a register of eligibles. 20Examination of an applicant's mental aptitude shall be based 21upon a written examination.

All candidates shall be required to 2undergo an examination of their physical ability to perform 3the essential functions included in the duties they may be 4called upon to perform as a member of a fire department. For 5the purposes of this Section, essential functions of the job 6are functions associated with duties that a firefighter may be 7called upon to perform in response to emergency calls. The 8frequency of the occurrence of those duties as part of the fire 9department's regular routine shall not be a controlling factor 10in the design of examination criteria or evolutions selected 11for testing. These physical examinations shall be open, 12competitive, and based on industry standards designed to test 13each applicant's physical abilities in the following 14dimensions:15        (1) Muscular strength to perform tasks and evolutions 16    that may be required in the performance of duties 17    including grip strength, leg strength, and arm strength. 18    Tests shall be conducted under anaerobic as well as 19    aerobic conditions to test both the candidate's speed and 20    endurance in performing tasks and evolutions. Tasks tested 21    may be based on standards developed, or approved, by the 22    local appointing authority.23        (2) The ability to climb ladders, operate from 24    heights, walk or crawl in the dark along narrow and uneven 25    surfaces, and operate in proximity to hazardous 26    environments.  HB1098- 50 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1        (3) The ability to carry out critical, time-sensitive, 2    and complex problem solving during physical exertion in 3    stressful and hazardous environments.

Minimum scores should be set by 22the appointing authorities so as to demonstrate a candidate's 23ability to perform the essential functions of the job. The 24minimum score set by the commission shall be supported by 25appropriate validation evidence and shall comply with all 26applicable State and federal laws. The appointing authority   HB1098- 51 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1may conduct the physical ability component and any subjective 2components subsequent to the posting of the preliminary 3eligibility register.4    The examination components for an initial eligibility 5register shall be graded on a 100-point scale.

Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 13be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 14years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 1597-251).16    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law 17to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 18department to which this Section applies shall be administered 19in the manner provided for in this Section. Provisions of the 20Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 21adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 22initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 23continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this   HB1098- 2 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 2and any other law, this Section shall control.3    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 4administer its fire department process for original 5appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 6Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 7Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 8concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 9functions exercised by the State.10    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 11consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 12fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 13Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 14Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree. 15    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 16(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 17than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 18    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 19to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 20eligibles established in accordance with the processes 21established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 22the performance standards required by this Section shall be 23placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 24an affected fire department.25    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 26a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a   HB1098- 3 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 2position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 3death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 4any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 5that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 6eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 7conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 8minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 9authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 10the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 11the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 12either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 13register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 14highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 15of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 16eligibles is less than 5 people.17    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 18losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 19candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 20by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 21not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 22future examinations, including an examination held during the 23time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 24eligibles.25    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 26shall be vested in the Civil Service Commission. All   HB1098- 4 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1certificates of appointment issued to any officer or member of 2an affected department shall be signed by the chairperson and 3secretary, respectively, of the commission upon appointment of 4such officer or member to the affected department by the 5commission. After being selected from the register of 6eligibles to fill a vacancy in the affected department, each 7appointee shall be presented with his or her certificate of 8appointment on the day on which he or she is sworn in as a 9classified member of the affected department. Firefighters who 10were not issued a certificate of appointment when originally 11appointed shall be provided with a certificate within 10 days 12after making a written request to the chairperson of the Civil 13Service Commission. Each person who accepts a certificate of 14appointment and successfully completes his or her probationary 15period shall be enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular 16member of the fire department.17    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 18person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the 19effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 20department or fire protection district or employed by a State 21university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 22duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 23persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 24reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call 25firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 26employees of a fire department or fire protection district who   HB1098- 5 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 2elected officials.3    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 4The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 5identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 6aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 7of members of the fire department in order to provide the 8highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 9applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 10department shall be subject to examination and testing which 11shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 12unless the municipality shall by ordinance limit applicants to 13residents of the municipality, county or counties in which the 14municipality is located, State, or nation. Any examination and 15testing procedure utilized under subsection (e) of this 16Section shall be supported by appropriate validation evidence 17and shall comply with all applicable State and federal laws. 18Municipalities may establish educational, emergency medical 19service licensure, and other prerequisites for participation 20in an examination or for hire as a firefighter. Any 21municipality may charge a fee to cover the costs of the 22application process.23    Residency requirements in effect at the time an individual 24enters the fire service of a municipality cannot be made more 25restrictive for that individual during his or her period of 26service for that municipality, or be made a condition of   HB1098- 6 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1promotion, except for the rank or position of fire chief and 2for no more than 2 positions that rank immediately below that 3of the chief rank which are appointed positions pursuant to 4the Fire Department Promotion Act.5    No person who is 35 years of age or older shall be eligible 6to take an examination for a position as a firefighter unless 7the person has had previous employment status as a firefighter 8in the regularly constituted fire department of the 9municipality, except as provided in this Section. The age 10limitation does not apply to:11        (1) any person previously employed as a full-time 12    firefighter in a regularly constituted fire department of 13    (i) any municipality or fire protection district located 14    in Illinois, (ii) a fire protection district whose 15    obligations were assumed by a municipality under Section 16    21 of the Fire Protection District Act, or (iii) a 17    municipality whose obligations were taken over by a fire 18    protection district,19        (2) any person who has served a municipality as a 20    regularly enrolled volunteer, paid-on-call, or part-time 21    firefighter, or22        (3) any person who turned 35 while serving as a member 23    of the active or reserve components of any of the branches 24    of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National 25    Guard of any state, whose service was characterized as 26    honorable or under honorable, if separated from the   HB1098- 7 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1    military, and is currently under the age of 40. 2    No person who is under 18 21 years of age shall be eligible 3for employment as a firefighter.4    No applicant shall be examined concerning his or her 5political or religious opinions or affiliations. The 6examinations shall be conducted by the commissioners of the 7municipality or their designees and agents.8    No municipality shall require that any firefighter 9appointed to the lowest rank serve a probationary employment 10period of longer than one year of actual active employment, 11which may exclude periods of training, or injury or illness 12leaves, including duty related leave, in excess of 30 calendar 13days. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 14Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 15extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 16employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 17sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 18hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 19licensure.20    In the event that any applicant who has been found 21eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 22the final eligibility register provided for in this Division 1 23has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 24year after the date of his or her physical ability 25examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 26be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or   HB1098- 8 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1her appointment.

All candidates shall be required to 17undergo an examination of their physical ability to perform 18the essential functions included in the duties they may be 19called upon to perform as a member of a fire department. For 20the purposes of this Section, essential functions of the job 21are functions associated with duties that a firefighter may be 22called upon to perform in response to emergency calls. The 23frequency of the occurrence of those duties as part of the fire 24department's regular routine shall not be a controlling factor 25in the design of examination criteria or evolutions selected 26for testing. These physical examinations shall be open,   HB1098- 10 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1competitive, and based on industry standards designed to test 2each applicant's physical abilities in the following 3dimensions:4        (1) Muscular strength to perform tasks and evolutions 5    that may be required in the performance of duties 6    including grip strength, leg strength, and arm strength. 7    Tests shall be conducted under anaerobic as well as 8    aerobic conditions to test both the candidate's speed and 9    endurance in performing tasks and evolutions.

Minimum scores should be set by 11the commission so as to demonstrate a candidate's ability to 12perform the essential functions of the job. The minimum score 13set by the commission shall be supported by appropriate 14validation evidence and shall comply with all applicable State 15and federal laws.

Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 6be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 7years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 897-251).9    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law 10to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 11department to which this Section applies shall be administered 12in the manner provided for in this Section. Provisions of the 13Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 14adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 15initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 16continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 17Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 18and any other law, this Section shall control.19    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 20administer its fire department process for original 21appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 22Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 23Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 24concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 25functions exercised by the State.26    A municipality that is operating under a court order or   HB1098- 22 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 2fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 3Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 4Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree.5    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 6(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 7than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 8    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 9to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 10eligibles established in accordance with the processes 11established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 12the performance standards required by this Section shall be 13placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 14an affected fire department.15    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 16a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 17firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 18position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 19death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 20any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 21that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 22eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 23conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 24minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 25authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 26the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has   HB1098- 23 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 2either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 3register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 4highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 5of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 6eligibles is less than 5 people.7    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 8losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 9candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 10by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 11not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 12future examinations, including an examination held during the 13time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 14eligibles.15    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 16shall be vested in the board of fire and police commissioners. 17All certificates of appointment issued to any officer or 18member of an affected department shall be signed by the 19chairperson and secretary, respectively, of the board upon 20appointment of such officer or member to the affected 21department by action of the board. After being selected from 22the register of eligibles to fill a vacancy in the affected 23department, each appointee shall be presented with his or her 24certificate of appointment on the day on which he or she is 25sworn in as a classified member of the affected department. 26Firefighters who were not issued a certificate of appointment   HB1098- 24 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1when originally appointed shall be provided with a certificate 2within 10 days after making a written request to the 3chairperson of the board of fire and police commissioners. 4Each person who accepts a certificate of appointment and 5successfully completes his or her probationary period shall be 6enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular member of the fire 7department.8    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 9person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the 10effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 11department or fire protection district or employed by a State 12university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 13duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 14persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 15reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call 16firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 17employees of a fire department or fire protection district who 18are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 19elected officials.20    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 21The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 22identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 23aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 24of members of the fire department in order to provide the 25highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 26applicants for original appointment to an affected fire   HB1098- 25 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1department shall be subject to examination and testing which 2shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 3unless the municipality shall by ordinance limit applicants to 4residents of the municipality, county or counties in which the 5municipality is located, State, or nation. Any examination and 6testing procedure utilized under subsection (e) of this 7Section shall be supported by appropriate validation evidence 8and shall comply with all applicable State and federal laws. 9Municipalities may establish educational, emergency medical 10service licensure, and other prerequisites for participation 11in an examination or for hire as a firefighter. Any 12municipality may charge a fee to cover the costs of the 13application process.14    Residency requirements in effect at the time an individual 15enters the fire service of a municipality cannot be made more 16restrictive for that individual during his or her period of 17service for that municipality, or be made a condition of 18promotion, except for the rank or position of fire chief and 19for no more than 2 positions that rank immediately below that 20of the chief rank which are appointed positions pursuant to 21the Fire Department Promotion Act.22    No person who is 35 years of age or older shall be eligible 23to take an examination for a position as a firefighter unless 24the person has had previous employment status as a firefighter 25in the regularly constituted fire department of the 26municipality, except as provided in this Section. The age   HB1098- 26 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1limitation does not apply to:2        (1) any person previously employed as a full-time 3    firefighter in a regularly constituted fire department of 4    (i) any municipality or fire protection district located 5    in Illinois, (ii) a fire protection district whose 6    obligations were assumed by a municipality under Section 7    21 of the Fire Protection District Act, or (iii) a 8    municipality whose obligations were taken over by a fire 9    protection district,10        (2) any person who has served a municipality as a 11    regularly enrolled volunteer, paid-on-call, or part-time 12    firefighter, or13        (3) any person who turned 35 while serving as a member 14    of the active or reserve components of any of the branches 15    of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National 16    Guard of any state, whose service was characterized as 17    honorable or under honorable, if separated from the 18    military, and is currently under the age of 40. 19    No person who is under 18 21 years of age shall be eligible 20for employment as a firefighter.21    No applicant shall be examined concerning his or her 22political or religious opinions or affiliations. The 23examinations shall be conducted by the commissioners of the 24municipality or their designees and agents.25    No municipality shall require that any firefighter 26appointed to the lowest rank serve a probationary employment   HB1098- 27 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1period of longer than one year of actual active employment, 2which may exclude periods of training, or injury or illness 3leaves, including duty related leave, in excess of 30 calendar 4days. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 5Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 6extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 7employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 8sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 9hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 10licensure.11    In the event that any applicant who has been found 12eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 13the final eligibility register provided for in this Section 14has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 15year after the date of his or her physical ability 16examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 17be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 18her appointment. If, after the second examination, the 19physical ability of the applicant shall be found to be less 20than the minimum standard fixed by the rules of the 21commission, the applicant shall not be appointed. The 22applicant's name may be retained upon the register of 23candidates eligible for appointment and when next reached for 24certification and appointment that applicant may be again 25examined as provided in this Section, and if the physical 26ability of that applicant is found to be less than the minimum   HB1098- 28 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1standard fixed by the rules of the commission, the applicant 2shall not be appointed, and the name of the applicant shall be 3removed from the register.4    (d) Notice, examination, and testing components. Notice of 5the time, place, general scope, merit criteria for any 6subjective component, and fee of every examination shall be 7given by the commission, by a publication at least 2 weeks 8preceding the examination: (i) in one or more newspapers 9published in the municipality, or if no newspaper is published 10therein, then in one or more newspapers with a general 11circulation within the municipality, or (ii) on the 12municipality's Internet website. Additional notice of the 13examination may be given as the commission shall prescribe.14    The examination and qualifying standards for employment of 15firefighters shall be based on: mental aptitude, physical 16ability, preferences, moral character, and health. The mental 17aptitude, physical ability, and preference components shall 18determine an applicant's qualification for and placement on 19the final register of eligibles. The examination may also 20include a subjective component based on merit criteria as 21determined by the commission. Scores from the examination must 22be made available to the public.23    (e) Mental aptitude. No person who does not possess at 24least a high school diploma or an equivalent high school 25education shall be placed on a register of eligibles. 26Examination of an applicant's mental aptitude shall be based   HB1098- 29 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1upon a written examination. The examination shall be practical 2in character and relate to those matters that fairly test the 3capacity of the persons examined to discharge the duties 4performed by members of a fire department. Written 5examinations shall be administered in a manner that ensures 6the security and accuracy of the scores achieved.7    (f) Physical ability. All candidates shall be required to 8undergo an examination of their physical ability to perform 9the essential functions included in the duties they may be 10called upon to perform as a member of a fire department. For 11the purposes of this Section, essential functions of the job 12are functions associated with duties that a firefighter may be 13called upon to perform in response to emergency calls. The 14frequency of the occurrence of those duties as part of the fire 15department's regular routine shall not be a controlling factor 16in the design of examination criteria or evolutions selected 17for testing. These physical examinations shall be open, 18competitive, and based on industry standards designed to test 19each applicant's physical abilities in the following 20dimensions:21        (1) Muscular strength to perform tasks and evolutions 22    that may be required in the performance of duties 23    including grip strength, leg strength, and arm strength. 24    Tests shall be conducted under anaerobic as well as 25    aerobic conditions to test both the candidate's speed and 26    endurance in performing tasks and evolutions. Tasks tested   HB1098- 30 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1    may be based on standards developed, or approved, by the 2    local appointing authority.3        (2) The ability to climb ladders, operate from 4    heights, walk or crawl in the dark along narrow and uneven 5    surfaces, and operate in proximity to hazardous 6    environments.7        (3) The ability to carry out critical, time-sensitive, 8    and complex problem solving during physical exertion in 9    stressful and hazardous environments. The testing 10    environment may be hot and dark with tightly enclosed 11    spaces, flashing lights, sirens, and other distractions.12    The tests utilized to measure each applicant's 13capabilities in each of these dimensions may be tests based on 14industry standards currently in use or equivalent tests 15approved by the Joint Labor-Management Committee of the Office 16of the State Fire Marshal. 17    Physical ability examinations administered under this 18Section shall be conducted with a reasonable number of 19proctors and monitors, open to the public, and subject to 20reasonable regulations of the commission.21    (g) Scoring of examination components. Appointing 22authorities may create a preliminary eligibility register. A 23person shall be placed on the list based upon his or her 24passage of the written examination or the passage of the 25written examination and the physical ability component. 26Passage of the written examination means attaining the minimum   HB1098- 31 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1score set by the commission. Minimum scores should be set by 2the commission so as to demonstrate a candidate's ability to 3perform the essential functions of the job. The minimum score 4set by the commission shall be supported by appropriate 5validation evidence and shall comply with all applicable State 6and federal laws. The appointing authority may conduct the 7physical ability component and any subjective components 8subsequent to the posting of the preliminary eligibility 9register.10    The examination components for an initial eligibility 11register shall be graded on a 100-point scale. A person's 12position on the list shall be determined by the following: (i) 13the person's score on the written examination, (ii) the person 14successfully passing the physical ability component, and (iii) 15the person's results on any subjective component as described 16in subsection (d). 17    In order to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 18register, an applicant's score on the written examination, 19before any applicable preference points or subjective points 20are applied, shall be at or above the minimum score as set by 21the commission. The local appointing authority may prescribe 22the score to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 23register, but the score shall not be less than the minimum 24score set by the commission.25    The commission shall prepare and keep a register of 26persons whose total score is not less than the minimum score   HB1098- 32 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1for passage and who have passed the physical ability 2examination. These persons shall take rank upon the register 3as candidates in the order of their relative excellence based 4on the highest to the lowest total points scored on the mental 5aptitude, subjective component, and preference components of 6the test administered in accordance with this Section. No more 7than 60 days after each examination, an initial eligibility 8list shall be posted by the commission. The list shall include 9the final grades of the candidates without reference to 10priority of the time of examination and subject to claim for 11preference credit.12    Commissions may conduct additional examinations, including 13without limitation a polygraph test, after a final eligibility 14register is established and before it expires with the 15candidates ranked by total score without regard to date of 16examination. No more than 60 days after each examination, an 17initial eligibility list shall be posted by the commission 18showing the final grades of the candidates without reference 19to priority of time of examination and subject to claim for 20preference credit.21    (h) Preferences.

The numerical result thus attained shall be 4    applied by the commission in determining the final 5    eligibility list and appointment from the eligibility 6    list. The local appointing authority may prescribe the 7    total number of preference points awarded under this 8    Section, but the total number of preference points, except 9    item (7.5), shall not be less than 10 points or more than 10    30 points.

Provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code, Fire 14Protection District Act, fire district ordinances, and rules 15adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 16initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 17continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 18Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 19and any other law, this Section shall control.20    A fire protection district that is operating under a court 21order or consent decree regarding original appointments to a 22full-time fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective 23date of Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of 24this Section for the duration of the court order or consent 25decree.26    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made   HB1098- 42 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 2eligibles established in accordance with the processes 3required by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed the 4performance standards required by the Section shall be placed 5on a register of eligibles for original appointment to an 6affected fire department.7    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 8a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 9firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 10position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 11death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 12any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 13that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 14eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 15conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 16minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 17authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 18the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 19the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 20either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 21register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 22highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 23of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 24eligibles is less than 5 people.25    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 26losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any   HB1098- 43 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 2by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 3not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 4future examinations, including an examination held during the 5time a candidate is already on the fire district's register of 6eligibles.7    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 8shall be vested in the board of fire commissioners, or board of 9trustees serving in the capacity of a board of fire 10commissioners. All certificates of appointment issued to any 11officer or member of an affected department shall be signed by 12the chairperson and secretary, respectively, of the commission 13upon appointment of such officer or member to the affected 14department by action of the commission. After being selected 15from the register of eligibles to fill a vacancy in the 16affected department, each appointee shall be presented with 17his or her certificate of appointment on the day on which he or 18she is sworn in as a classified member of the affected 19department. Firefighters who were not issued a certificate of 20appointment when originally appointed shall be provided with a 21certificate within 10 days after making a written request to 22the chairperson of the board of fire commissioners, or board 23of trustees serving in the capacity of a board of fire 24commissioners. Each person who accepts a certificate of 25appointment and successfully completes his or her probationary 26period shall be enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular   HB1098- 44 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1member of the fire department.2    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 3person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the 4effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 5department or fire protection district or employed by a State 6university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 7duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 8persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 9reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call 10firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 11employees of a fire department or fire protection district who 12are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 13elected officials.14    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 15The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 16identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 17aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 18of members of the fire department in order to provide the 19highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 20applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 21department shall be subject to examination and testing which 22shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 23unless the district shall by ordinance limit applicants to 24residents of the district, county or counties in which the 25district is located, State, or nation.

The age limitation does 21not apply to:22        (1) any person previously employed as a full-time 23    firefighter in a regularly constituted fire department of 24    (i) any municipality or fire protection district located 25    in Illinois, (ii) a fire protection district whose 26    obligations were assumed by a municipality under Section   HB1098- 46 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1    21 of the Fire Protection District Act, or (iii) a 2    municipality whose obligations were taken over by a fire 3    protection district;4        (2) any person who has served a fire district as a 5    regularly enrolled volunteer, paid-on-call, or part-time 6    firefighter; or7        (3) any person who turned 35 while serving as a member 8    of the active or reserve components of any of the branches 9    of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National 10    Guard of any state, whose service was characterized as 11    honorable or under honorable, if separated from the 12    military, and is currently under the age of 40. 13    No person who is under 18 21 years of age shall be eligible 14for employment as a firefighter.15    No applicant shall be examined concerning his or her 16political or religious opinions or affiliations. The 17examinations shall be conducted by the commissioners of the 18district or their designees and agents.19    No district shall require that any firefighter appointed 20to the lowest rank serve a probationary employment period of 21longer than one year of actual active employment, which may 22exclude periods of training, or injury or illness leaves, 23including duty related leave, in excess of 30 calendar days. 24Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the 25probationary employment period limitation may be extended for 26a firefighter who is required, as a condition of employment,   HB1098- 47 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the sole reason 2that a firefighter may be discharged without a hearing is for 3failing to meet the requirements for paramedic licensure.4    In the event that any applicant who has been found 5eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 6the final eligibility register provided for in this Section 7has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 8year after the date of his or her physical ability 9examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 10be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 11her appointment. If, after the second examination, the 12physical ability of the applicant shall be found to be less 13than the minimum standard fixed by the rules of the 14commission, the applicant shall not be appointed. The 15applicant's name may be retained upon the register of 16candidates eligible for appointment and when next reached for 17certification and appointment that applicant may be again 18examined as provided in this Section, and if the physical 19ability of that applicant is found to be less than the minimum 20standard fixed by the rules of the commission, the applicant 21shall not be appointed, and the name of the applicant shall be 22removed from the register.23    (d) Notice, examination, and testing components.

Additional notice of 6the examination may be given as the commission shall 7prescribe.8    The examination and qualifying standards for employment of 9firefighters shall be based on: mental aptitude, physical 10ability, preferences, moral character, and health. The mental 11aptitude, physical ability, and preference components shall 12determine an applicant's qualification for and placement on 13the final register of eligibles. The examination may also 14include a subjective component based on merit criteria as 15determined by the commission. Scores from the examination must 16be made available to the public.17    (e) Mental aptitude. No person who does not possess at 18least a high school diploma or an equivalent high school 19education shall be placed on a register of eligibles. 20Examination of an applicant's mental aptitude shall be based 21upon a written examination.

Written 25examinations shall be administered in a manner that ensures 26the security and accuracy of the scores achieved.  HB1098- 49 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1    (f) Physical ability. All candidates shall be required to 2undergo an examination of their physical ability to perform 3the essential functions included in the duties they may be 4called upon to perform as a member of a fire department. For 5the purposes of this Section, essential functions of the job 6are functions associated with duties that a firefighter may be 7called upon to perform in response to emergency calls. The 8frequency of the occurrence of those duties as part of the fire 9department's regular routine shall not be a controlling factor 10in the design of examination criteria or evolutions selected 11for testing. These physical examinations shall be open, 12competitive, and based on industry standards designed to test 13each applicant's physical abilities in the following 14dimensions:15        (1) Muscular strength to perform tasks and evolutions 16    that may be required in the performance of duties 17    including grip strength, leg strength, and arm strength. 18    Tests shall be conducted under anaerobic as well as 19    aerobic conditions to test both the candidate's speed and 20    endurance in performing tasks and evolutions. Tasks tested 21    may be based on standards developed, or approved, by the 22    local appointing authority.23        (2) The ability to climb ladders, operate from 24    heights, walk or crawl in the dark along narrow and uneven 25    surfaces, and operate in proximity to hazardous 26    environments.  HB1098- 50 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1        (3) The ability to carry out critical, time-sensitive, 2    and complex problem solving during physical exertion in 3    stressful and hazardous environments.

Minimum scores should be set by 22the appointing authorities so as to demonstrate a candidate's 23ability to perform the essential functions of the job. The 24minimum score set by the commission shall be supported by 25appropriate validation evidence and shall comply with all 26applicable State and federal laws. The appointing authority   HB1098- 51 -LRB104 04060 RTM 14084 b1may conduct the physical ability component and any subjective 2components subsequent to the posting of the preliminary 3eligibility register.4    The examination components for an initial eligibility 5register shall be graded on a 100-point scale.
