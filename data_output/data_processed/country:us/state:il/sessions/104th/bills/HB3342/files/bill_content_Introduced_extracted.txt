To ensure 4that real property sold, conveyed, or leased under this 5subsection is used in accordance with this Act, the Commission 6shall inquire into and satisfy itself concerning the financial 7ability of the purchaser, conveyee, or lessee to complete the 8project for which the real property is sold, conveyed, or 9leased in accordance with a written plan to be submitted by the 10purchaser, conveyee, or lessee to the Commission.

Upon the finding 9being made, the Commission may cause the real property to be 10conveyed free of a reverter provision if at least 7 11commissioners vote in favor of the sale, conveyance, or lease 12without the reverter provision. The Commission may also 13include, in the sales agreement, conveyance, lease agreement, 14or other documentation, provisions for notice of the 15violations or default and how to cure violations or default 16for the benefit of any lender or mortgagee as the Commission 17may determine is appropriate. 18    If, at a regularly scheduled meeting, the Commission 19resolves that a parcel of real estate conveyed or leased by it, 20or in which it has sold the fee simple title or any lesser 21estate, is not being used for the purposes prescribed in this 22Act or has been unused for a period of at least one year, the 23Commission may file a lawsuit in the Cook County Circuit Court 24to enforce the terms of the sale, conveyance, or lease. If a 25reverter of title to any property is ordered by the court under 26the terms of this Act, the interest of the Commission shall be   HB3342- 12 -LRB104 06571 JRC 16607 b1subject to any then existing, valid mortgage or trust deed in 2the nature of a mortgage, but if the title is acquired through 3foreclosure of that mortgage or trust deed or by deed in lieu 4of foreclosure of that mortgage or trust deed, then the title 5to the property shall not revert, but shall be subject to the 6restrictions as to use, but not any penalty for nonuse, 7contained in this Act with respect to any mortgagee in 8possession or its successor or assigns.9    (b) If, at a regularly scheduled meeting, the Commission 10resolves that a parcel of real estate that is owned by the 11Commission is no longer needed for District purposes, the 12Commission may authorize the sale or public auction of the 13parcel. The resolution shall direct the sale to be conducted 14by (i) the staff of the Commission, (ii) listing with local 15licensed real estate agencies, in which case the terms of the 16agent's compensation shall be included in the resolution, 17(iii) or public auction.

If a 25reverter of title to any property is ordered by the court under 26the terms of this Act, the interest of the Commission shall be   HB3342- 12 -LRB104 06571 JRC 16607 b1subject to any then existing, valid mortgage or trust deed in 2the nature of a mortgage, but if the title is acquired through 3foreclosure of that mortgage or trust deed or by deed in lieu 4of foreclosure of that mortgage or trust deed, then the title 5to the property shall not revert, but shall be subject to the 6restrictions as to use, but not any penalty for nonuse, 7contained in this Act with respect to any mortgagee in 8possession or its successor or assigns.9    (b) If, at a regularly scheduled meeting, the Commission 10resolves that a parcel of real estate that is owned by the 11Commission is no longer needed for District purposes, the 12Commission may authorize the sale or public auction of the 13parcel. The resolution shall direct the sale to be conducted 14by (i) the staff of the Commission, (ii) listing with local 15licensed real estate agencies, in which case the terms of the 16agent's compensation shall be included in the resolution, 17(iii) or public auction. The resolution shall be published at 18the first opportunity following its passage in a newspaper 19published in the District or, if none, then in a newspaper 20published in the county where the District is located. The 21resolution shall also contain pertinent information concerning 22the size, use, and zoning of the parcel and the terms of sale.23    (c) The Commission may not sell, convey, or lease any 24property pursuant to this Section before a comprehensive 25master plan has been approved under Section 60.    HB3342- 13 -LRB104 06571 JRC 16607 b1    Section 40.
