This Act may be referred to as the 8Nelson Mandela Act.  9    Section 5. Findings. 10    (a) The General Assembly finds that:11        (1) Nelson Mandela, should be honored and recognized 12    as the first and former President of South Africa, who 13    after release from 27 years of imprisonment, much of which 14    was spent in isolated confinement, became a world leader 15    in his commitment to democracy and international human 16    rights.17        (2) Mandela was repeatedly subjected to isolated 18    confinement. 19        (3) Mandela's isolation began with 23 hours a day of 20    isolated confinement with just 2 30-minute exercise 21    periods allowed a day. Such hours were spent in a cell 22    measuring 8 feet by 7 feet, with walls of concrete, 23    without windows, and furnished with a single light bulb to   SB0065- 2 -LRB104 06036 RLC 16069 b1    substitute natural light.2        (4) Mandela described isolated confinement as "the 3    most forbidding aspect of prison life", with no end and no 4    beginning.5        (5) After 27 years of incarceration under the South 6    African government, Mandela went on to receive a Nobel 7    Peace Prize and numerous other honors as a global icon of 8    democracy and social justice.9        (6) In an attempt to ensure that no one else would be 10    subjected to the inhumane treatment Mandela survived, the 11    United Nations adopted the Mandela Rules establishing 12    Standard Minimum Rules of the Treatment of Prisoners, on 13    December 17, 2015. Those rules finalized a set of 14    principles that provides all people who are in prison with 15    respect and protection from torture, and other cruel, 16    inhuman, or degrading treatments or punishments.17        (7) Rule 1 of the Mandela Rules sets the guiding 18    principle for these standards, requiring that: "All 19    prisoners shall be treated with the respect due to their 20    inherent dignity and value as human beings".21        (8) The Mandela Rules provides that, "the prison 22    system shall not, except as incidental to justifiable 23    separation or the maintenance of discipline, aggravate the 24    suffering inherent in such a situation" involving the 25    deprivation of liberty.26        (9) As a result of these requirements and recognizing   SB0065- 3 -LRB104 06036 RLC 16069 b1    the horrific consequences of Mandela's prolonged 2    isolation, the Mandela Rules specifically prohibit 3    prolonged confinement placement in a cell.4        (10) Rule 44 of the Mandela Rules specifically states 5    "solitary confinement shall refer to the confinement of 6    prisoners for 22 hours or more a day without meaningful 7    human contact. Prolonged solitary confinement shall refer 8    to solitary confinement for a time period in excess of 15 9    consecutive days".10        11) Nelson Mandela stated: "No one truly knows a 11    nation until one has been inside its jails. A nation 12    should not be judged by how it treats its highest 13    citizens, but its lowest ones".14        (12) To be judged as a worldwide leader, Illinois must 15    recognize the horrific consequences that Nelson Mandela 16    and other incarcerated individuals have experienced from 17    being confined to a cell for prolonged periods and comply 18    with the international mandates required by the Mandela 19    Rules.20        (13) It is therefore in Illinois' best interests to 21    operate its prisons in compliance with internationally 22    recognized minimum standards.23    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to enact the 24Nelson Mandela Act.  25    Section 10.
