However, the 17    camera must be turned on when the officer has reason to 18    believe that the person on whose behalf the officer is 19    performing a community caretaking function has committed 20    or is in the process of committing a crime.

In the event any 25        recording made with an officer-worn body camera is 26        altered, erased, or destroyed prior to the expiration   HB3380- 6 -LRB104 07732 RTM 17777 b1        of the 90-day storage period, the law enforcement 2        agency shall maintain, for a period of one year, a 3        written record including (i) the name of the 4        individual who made such alteration, erasure, or 5        destruction, and (ii) the reason for any such 6        alteration, erasure, or destruction. 7            (B) Following the 90-day storage period, any and 8        all recordings made with an officer-worn body camera 9        must be destroyed, unless any encounter captured on 10        the recording has been flagged.

If the flagged 11        recording was used in a criminal, civil, or 12        administrative proceeding, the recording shall not be 13        destroyed except upon a final disposition and order 14        from the court.15            (D) Nothing in this Act prohibits law enforcement 16        agencies from labeling officer-worn body camera video 17        within the recording medium; provided that the 18        labeling does not alter the actual recording of the 19        incident captured on the officer-worn body camera. The 20        labels, titles, and tags shall not be construed as 21        altering the officer-worn body camera video in any 22        way. 23        (8) Following the 90-day storage period, recordings 24    may be retained if a supervisor at the law enforcement 25    agency designates the recording for training purposes. If 26    the recording is designated for training purposes, the   HB3380- 8 -LRB104 07732 RTM 17777 b1    recordings may be viewed by officers, in the presence of a 2    supervisor or training instructor, for the purposes of 3    instruction, training, or ensuring compliance with agency 4    policies. 5        (9) Recordings shall not be used to discipline law 6    enforcement officers unless:7            (A) a formal or informal complaint of misconduct 8        has been made;9            (B) a use of force incident has occurred;10            (C) the encounter on the recording could result in 11        a formal investigation under the Uniform Peace 12        Officers' Disciplinary Act; or13            (D) as corroboration of other evidence of 14        misconduct.15        Nothing in this paragraph (9) shall be construed to 16    limit or prohibit a law enforcement officer from being 17    subject to an action that does not amount to discipline.18        (10) The law enforcement agency shall ensure proper 19    care and maintenance of officer-worn body cameras. Upon 20    becoming aware, officers must as soon as practical 21    document and notify the appropriate supervisor of any 22    technical difficulties, failures, or problems with the 23    officer-worn body camera or associated equipment. Upon 24    receiving notice, the appropriate supervisor shall make 25    every reasonable effort to correct and repair any of the 26    officer-worn body camera equipment.  HB3380- 9 -LRB104 07732 RTM 17777 b1        (11) No officer may hinder or prohibit any person, not 2    a law enforcement officer, from recording a law 3    enforcement officer in the performance of his or her 4    duties in a public place or when the officer has no 5    reasonable expectation of privacy. The law enforcement 6    agency's written policy shall indicate the potential 7    criminal penalties, as well as any departmental 8    discipline, which may result from unlawful confiscation or 9    destruction of the recording medium of a person who is not 10    a law enforcement officer. However, an officer may take 11    reasonable action to maintain safety and control, secure 12    crime scenes and accident sites, protect the integrity and 13    confidentiality of investigations, and protect the public 14    safety and order.15    (b) Recordings made with the use of an officer-worn body 16camera are not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of 17Information Act, except that:18        (1) if the subject of the encounter has a reasonable 19    expectation of privacy, at the time of the recording, any 20    recording which is flagged, due to the filing of a 21    complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of force, arrest or 22    detention, or resulting death or bodily harm, shall be 23    disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information 24    Act if:25            (A) the subject of the encounter captured on the 26        recording is a victim or witness; and  HB3380- 10 -LRB104 07732 RTM 17777 b1            (B) the law enforcement agency obtains written 2        permission of the subject or the subject's legal 3        representative;4        (2) except as provided in paragraph (1) of this 5    subsection (b), upon request, any recording which is 6    flagged due to the filing of a complaint, discharge of a 7    firearm, use of force, arrest or detention, or resulting 8    death or bodily harm shall be disclosed in accordance with 9    the Freedom of Information Act if the request is made by:10            (A) court order;11            (B) a person involved in the encounter that 12        resulted in the recording being flagged;13            (C) a legal representative of a person involved in 14        the encounter that resulted in the recording being 15        flagged;16            (D) a witness of the encounter that resulted in 17        the recording being flagged;18            (E) a legal representative of a witness of the 19        encounter that resulted in the recording being 20        flagged; or21            (F) a representative of news media, as defined in 22        subsection (f) of Section 2 of the Freedom of 23        Information Act; and24        (3) upon request, the law enforcement agency shall 25    disclose, in accordance with the Freedom of Information 26    Act, the recording to the subject of the encounter   HB3380- 11 -LRB104 07732 RTM 17777 b1    captured on the recording or to the subject's attorney, or 2    the officer or his or her legal representative.3    For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection (b), 4the subject of the encounter does not have a reasonable 5expectation of privacy if the subject was arrested as a result 6of the encounter. For purposes of subparagraph (A) of 7paragraph (1) of this subsection (b), "witness" does not 8include a person who is a victim or who was arrested as a 9result of the encounter. 10    Only recordings or portions of recordings responsive to 11the request shall be available for inspection or reproduction. 12Any recording disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act 13shall be redacted to remove identification of any person that 14appears on the recording and is not the officer, a subject of 15the encounter, or directly involved in the encounter.
