The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 9    of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing 10    to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. 11    Failure to provide service of process to the Commission 12    shall render a judgment or order void as to the 13    Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.14    B.

A cure of the default does not relieve the 5    offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred 6    during the period of default.7        3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be 8    imposed only after all other means of securing compliance 9    have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or 10    terminate shall be given by the Commission to the 11    governor, the majority and minority leaders of the 12    defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member 13    states.14        4.

The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its 13    discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this 14    Compact.15        2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal 16    action in the United States District Court for the 17    District of Columbia or the federal district where the 18    Commission has its principal offices against a member 19    state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions 20    of the Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The 21    relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 22    damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 23    the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such 24    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.25        3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive 26    remedies of the Commission.

Any member state may withdraw from this Compact by 20enacting a statute repealing the same.21        1. A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect 22    until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing 23    statute.24        2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing 25    requirement of the withdrawing state's physical therapy   HB3420- 32 -LRB104 09723 AAS 19789 b1    licensing board to comply with the investigative and 2    adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to 3    the effective date of withdrawal.4    D.

Oversight21        1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches 22    of state government in each member state shall enforce 23    this Compact and take all actions necessary and 24    appropriate to effectuate the Compact's purposes and 25    intent.

All courts shall take judicial notice of the 4    Compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative 5    proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject 6    matter of this Compact which may affect the powers, 7    responsibilities or actions of the Commission.8        3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 9    of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing 10    to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. 11    Failure to provide service of process to the Commission 12    shall render a judgment or order void as to the 13    Commission, this Compact, or promulgated rules.14    B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination15        1. If the Commission determines that a member state 16    has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 17    responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated 18    rules, the Commission shall:19            a. Provide written notice to the defaulting state 20        and other member states of the nature of the default, 21        the proposed means of curing the default and/or any 22        other action to be taken by the Commission; and23            b. Provide remedial training and specific 24        technical assistance regarding the default.25        2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the 26    defaulting state may be terminated from the Compact upon   HB3420- 29 -LRB104 09723 AAS 19789 b1    an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, 2    and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this 3    Compact may be terminated on the effective date of 4    termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 5    offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred 6    during the period of default.7        3. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be 8    imposed only after all other means of securing compliance 9    have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or 10    terminate shall be given by the Commission to the 11    governor, the majority and minority leaders of the 12    defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member 13    states.14        4. A state that has been terminated is responsible for 15    all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred 16    through the effective date of termination, including 17    obligations that extend beyond the effective date of 18    termination.19        5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to 20    a state that is found to be in default or that has been 21    terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing 22    between the Commission and the defaulting state.23        6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the 24    Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the 25    District of Columbia or the federal district where the 26    Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing   HB3420- 30 -LRB104 09723 AAS 19789 b1    member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, 2    including reasonable attorney's fees.3    C. Dispute Resolution4        1. Upon request by a member state, the Commission 5    shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact 6    that arise among member states and between member and 7    non-member states.8        2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing 9    for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for 10    disputes as appropriate.11    D. Enforcement12        1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its 13    discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this 14    Compact.15        2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal 16    action in the United States District Court for the 17    District of Columbia or the federal district where the 18    Commission has its principal offices against a member 19    state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions 20    of the Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The 21    relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 22    damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 23    the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such 24    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.25        3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive 26    remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any   HB3420- 31 -LRB104 09723 AAS 19789 b1    other remedies available under federal or state law. 2    SECTION 11.

Any rule that has been previously 17adopted by the Commission shall have the full force and effect 18of law on the day the Compact becomes law in that state.19    C. Any member state may withdraw from this Compact by 20enacting a statute repealing the same.21        1. A member state's withdrawal shall not take effect 22    until six (6) months after enactment of the repealing 23    statute.24        2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing 25    requirement of the withdrawing state's physical therapy   HB3420- 32 -LRB104 09723 AAS 19789 b1    licensing board to comply with the investigative and 2    adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to 3    the effective date of withdrawal.4    D.
