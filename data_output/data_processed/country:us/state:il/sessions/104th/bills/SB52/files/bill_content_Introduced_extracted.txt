In enacting this Act, it 8is the purpose and intent of the State to further protect 9consumers' rights, including the constitutional right of 10privacy. The implementation of this Act shall be guided by the 11following principles:12        (1) Consumers should know who is collecting their 13    personal information and that of their children, how it is 14    being used, and to whom it is disclosed so that they have 15    the information necessary to exercise meaningful control 16    over businesses' use of their personal information and 17    that of their children.18        (2) Consumers should be able to control the use of 19    their personal information, including limiting the use of 20    their sensitive personal information, the unauthorized use 21    or disclosure of which creates a heightened risk of harm 22    to the consumer, and they should have meaningful options   SB0052- 2 -LRB104 03756 JRC 13780 b1    over how it is collected, used, and disclosed.2        (3) Consumers should have access to their personal 3    information and should be able to correct it, delete it, 4    and take it with them from one business to another.5        (4) Consumers or their authorized agents should be 6    able to exercise these options through easily accessible 7    self-serve tools.8        (5) Consumers should be able to exercise these rights 9    without being penalized for doing so.10        (6) Consumers should be able to hold businesses 11    accountable for failing to take reasonable precautions to 12    protect their most sensitive personal information from 13    hackers and security breaches.14        (7) Consumers should benefit from businesses' use of 15    their personal information.16        (8) The privacy interests of employees and independent 17    contractors should also be protected, taking into account 18    the differences in the relationship between employees or 19    independent contractors and businesses as compared to the 20    relationship between consumers and businesses. This Act is 21    not intended to interfere with the right to organize and 22    collective bargaining under the federal National Labor 23    Relations Act. 24        (9) Businesses should specifically and clearly inform 25    consumers about how they collect and use personal 26    information and how they can exercise their rights and   SB0052- 3 -LRB104 03756 JRC 13780 b1    choice.2        (10) Businesses should only collect consumers' 3    personal information for specific, explicit, and 4    legitimate disclosed purposes and should not further 5    collect, use, or disclose consumers' personal information 6    for reasons incompatible with those purposes.7        (11) Businesses should collect consumers' personal 8    information only to the extent that it is relevant and 9    limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes 10    for which it is being collected, used, and shared.11        (12) Businesses should provide consumers or their 12    authorized agents with easily accessible means to allow 13    consumers and their children to obtain their personal 14    information, to delete it or correct it, to opt out of its 15    sale and sharing across business platforms, services, 16    businesses, and devices, and to limit the use of their 17    sensitive personal information.18        (13) Businesses should not penalize consumers for 19    exercising these rights.20        (14) Businesses should take reasonable precautions to 21    protect consumers' personal information from a security 22    breach.23        (15) Businesses should be held accountable when they 24    violate consumers' privacy rights, and the penalties 25    should be higher when the violation affects children.26        (16) The rights of consumers and the responsibilities   SB0052- 4 -LRB104 03756 JRC 13780 b1    of businesses should be implemented with the goal of 2    strengthening consumer privacy while giving attention to 3    the impact on business and innovation. Consumer privacy 4    and the development of beneficial new products and 5    services are not necessarily incompatible goals. Strong 6    consumer privacy rights create incentives to innovate and 7    develop new products that are privacy protective.8        (17) Businesses and consumers should be provided with 9    clear guidance about their responsibilities and rights.10        (18) The law should place the consumer in a position 11    to knowingly and freely negotiate with a business over the 12    business' use of the personal information.13        (19) The law should adjust to technological changes, 14    help consumers exercise their rights, and assist 15    businesses with compliance with the continuing goal of 16    strengthening consumer privacy.17        (20) The law should enable proconsumer new products 18    and services and promote efficiency of implementation for 19    business as long as the law does not compromise or weaken 20    consumer privacy.21        (21) The law should be amended, if necessary, to 22    improve its operation, as long as the amendments do not 23    compromise or weaken consumer privacy, while giving 24    attention to the impact on business and innovation.25        (22) Businesses should be held accountable for 26    violating the law through vigorous administrative and   SB0052- 5 -LRB104 03756 JRC 13780 b1    civil enforcement.2        (23) To the extent it advances consumer privacy and 3    business compliance, the law should be compatible with 4    privacy laws in other jurisdictions. 5    Section 5-10.

Nothing in this Act shall be interpreted to serve as the   SB0052- 74 -LRB104 03756 JRC 13780 b1basis for a private right of action under any other law. This 2shall not be construed to relieve any party from any duties or 3obligations imposed under other law or the United States or 4Illinois Constitution. 5    Section 10-65.
