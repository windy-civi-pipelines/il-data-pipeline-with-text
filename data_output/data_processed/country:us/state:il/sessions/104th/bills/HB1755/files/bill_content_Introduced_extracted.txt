Reductions in payment 14levels may be accomplished by emergency rule under Section 155-45 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, except that 16the limitation on the number of emergency rules that may be 17adopted in a 24-month period shall not apply and the 18provisions of Sections 5-115 and 5-125 of the Illinois 19Administrative Procedure Act shall not apply. Increases in 20payment levels shall be accomplished only in accordance with 21Section 5-40 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act. 22Before any rule to increase payment levels promulgated under 23this Section shall become effective, a joint resolution 24approving the rule must be adopted by a roll call vote by a 25majority of the members elected to each chamber of the General 26Assembly.  HB1755- 57 -LRB104 05853 KTG 15884 b1(Source: P.A. 101-103, eff. 7-19-19.) 2    (305 ILCS 5/6-1.2)  (from Ch. 23, par. 6-1.2)3    Sec. 6-1.2.

The General Assembly finds:3    (1) Senior citizens identify pharmaceutical assistance as 4the single most critical factor to their health, well-being, 5and continued independence.6    (2) The State of Illinois currently operates one 2 7pharmaceutical assistance programs that benefit seniors: (i) 8the program of pharmaceutical assistance under the Senior 9Citizens and Persons with Disabilities Property Tax Relief Act 10and (ii) the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled program under 11the Illinois Public Aid Code. The State has been given 12authority to establish a third program, SeniorRx Care, through 13a federal Medicaid waiver.14    (3) Each year, numerous pieces of legislation are filed 15seeking to establish additional pharmaceutical assistance 16benefits for seniors or to make changes to the existing 17programs.18    (4) Establishment of a pharmaceutical assistance review 19committee will ensure proper coordination of benefits, 20diminish the likelihood of duplicative benefits, and ensure 21that the best interests of seniors are served.22    (5) In addition to the State pharmaceutical assistance 23programs, several private entities, such as drug manufacturers 24and pharmacies, also offer prescription drug discount or 25coverage programs.26    (6) Many seniors are unaware of the myriad of public and   HB1755- 67 -LRB104 05853 KTG 15884 b1private programs available to them.2    (7) Establishing a pharmaceutical clearinghouse with a 3toll-free hot-line and local outreach workers will educate 4seniors about the vast array of options available to them and 5enable seniors to make an educated and informed choice that is 6best for them.7    (8) Estimates indicate that almost one-third of senior 8citizens lack prescription drug coverage. The federal 9government, states, and the pharmaceutical industry each have 10a role in helping these uninsured seniors gain access to 11life-saving medications.12    (9) The State of Illinois has recognized its obligation to 13assist Illinois' neediest seniors in purchasing prescription 14medications, and it is now time for pharmaceutical 15manufacturers to recognize their obligation to make their 16medications affordable to seniors.17(Source: P.A. 99-143, eff. 7-27-15.) 18    Section 55.

The General Assembly finds:3    (1) Senior citizens identify pharmaceutical assistance as 4the single most critical factor to their health, well-being, 5and continued independence.6    (2) The State of Illinois currently operates one 2 7pharmaceutical assistance programs that benefit seniors: (i) 8the program of pharmaceutical assistance under the Senior 9Citizens and Persons with Disabilities Property Tax Relief Act 10and (ii) the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled program under 11the Illinois Public Aid Code. The State has been given 12authority to establish a third program, SeniorRx Care, through 13a federal Medicaid waiver.14    (3) Each year, numerous pieces of legislation are filed 15seeking to establish additional pharmaceutical assistance 16benefits for seniors or to make changes to the existing 17programs.18    (4) Establishment of a pharmaceutical assistance review 19committee will ensure proper coordination of benefits, 20diminish the likelihood of duplicative benefits, and ensure 21that the best interests of seniors are served.22    (5) In addition to the State pharmaceutical assistance 23programs, several private entities, such as drug manufacturers 24and pharmacies, also offer prescription drug discount or 25coverage programs.26    (6) Many seniors are unaware of the myriad of public and   HB1755- 67 -LRB104 05853 KTG 15884 b1private programs available to them.2    (7) Establishing a pharmaceutical clearinghouse with a 3toll-free hot-line and local outreach workers will educate 4seniors about the vast array of options available to them and 5enable seniors to make an educated and informed choice that is 6best for them.7    (8) Estimates indicate that almost one-third of senior 8citizens lack prescription drug coverage. The federal 9government, states, and the pharmaceutical industry each have 10a role in helping these uninsured seniors gain access to 11life-saving medications.12    (9) The State of Illinois has recognized its obligation to 13assist Illinois' neediest seniors in purchasing prescription 14medications, and it is now time for pharmaceutical 15manufacturers to recognize their obligation to make their 16medications affordable to seniors.17(Source: P.A. 99-143, eff. 7-27-15.) 18    Section 55.
