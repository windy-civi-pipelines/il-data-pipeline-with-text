Chemical and other tests.   SB1889- 12 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1    (a) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or 2proceeding arising out of an arrest for an offense as defined 3in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or proceedings 4pursuant to Section 2-118.1, evidence of the concentration of 5alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or 6compounds, or any combination thereof in a person's blood or 7breath at the time alleged, as determined by analysis of the 8person's blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance, 9shall be admissible. Where such test is made the following 10provisions shall apply:11        1. Chemical analyses of the person's blood, urine, 12    breath, or other bodily substance to be considered valid 13    under the provisions of this Section shall have been 14    performed according to standards promulgated by the 15    Illinois State Police by a licensed physician, registered 16    nurse, trained phlebotomist, licensed paramedic, or other 17    individual possessing a valid permit issued by that 18    Department for this purpose. The Director of the Illinois 19    State Police is authorized to approve satisfactory 20    techniques or methods, to ascertain the qualifications and 21    competence of individuals to conduct such analyses, to 22    issue permits which shall be subject to termination or 23    revocation at the discretion of that Department and to 24    certify the accuracy of breath testing equipment. The 25    Illinois State Police shall prescribe regulations as 26    necessary to implement this Section.  SB1889- 13 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1        2. When a person in this State shall submit to a blood 2    test at the request of a law enforcement officer under the 3    provisions of Section 11-501.1, only a physician 4    authorized to practice medicine, a licensed physician 5    assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, 6    a registered nurse, trained phlebotomist, or licensed 7    paramedic, or other qualified person approved by the 8    Illinois State Police may withdraw blood for the purpose 9    of determining the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug 10    content therein. This limitation shall not apply to the 11    taking of breath, other bodily substance, or urine 12    specimens.13        When a blood test of a person who has been taken to an 14    adjoining state for medical treatment is requested by an 15    Illinois law enforcement officer, the blood may be 16    withdrawn only by a physician authorized to practice 17    medicine in the adjoining state, a licensed physician 18    assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, 19    a registered nurse, a trained phlebotomist acting under 20    the direction of the physician, or licensed paramedic. The 21    law enforcement officer requesting the test shall take 22    custody of the blood sample, and the blood sample shall be 23    analyzed by a laboratory certified by the Illinois State 24    Police for that purpose.25        3. The person tested may have a physician, or a 26    qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other   SB1889- 14 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1    qualified person of their own choosing administer a 2    chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at 3    the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or 4    inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall 5    not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the 6    test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement 7    officer.8        4. Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a 9    chemical test or tests at the request of a law enforcement 10    officer, full information concerning the test or tests 11    shall be made available to the person or such person's 12    attorney.13        5. Alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of 14    alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol 15    per 210 liters of breath.16        6. "Free tetrahydrocannabinol Tetrahydrocannabinol 17    concentration" means the amount of parent 18    delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol detected in blood or another 19    bodily substance, excluding urine either 5 nanograms or 20    more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of 21    whole blood or 10 nanograms or more of 22    delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of other 23    bodily substance. 24    (a-5) Law enforcement officials may use validated roadside 25chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests approved 26by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration when   SB1889- 15 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1conducting investigations of a violation of Section 11-501 or 2similar local ordinance by drivers suspected of driving under 3the influence of cannabis. The General Assembly finds that (i) 4validated roadside chemical tests are effective means to 5determine if a person is under the influence of cannabis and 6(ii) standardized field sobriety tests approved by the 7National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are divided 8attention tasks that are intended to determine if a person is 9under the influence of cannabis. The purpose of these tests is 10to determine the effect of the use of cannabis on a person's 11capacity to think and act with ordinary care and therefore 12operate a motor vehicle safely. Therefore, the results of 13these validated roadside chemical tests and standardized field 14sobriety tests, appropriately administered, shall be 15admissible in the trial of any civil or criminal action or 16proceeding arising out of an arrest for a cannabis-related 17offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local 18ordinance or proceedings under Section 2-118.1 or 2-118.2. 19Where a test is made the following provisions shall apply: 20        1. The person tested may have a physician, or a 21    qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other 22    qualified person of their own choosing administer a 23    chemical test or tests in addition to the standardized 24    field sobriety test or tests administered at the direction 25    of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to 26    obtain an additional test by a person does not preclude   SB1889- 16 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1    the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests 2    taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer. 3        2. Upon the request of the person who shall submit to 4    validated roadside chemical tests or a standardized field 5    sobriety test or tests at the request of a law enforcement 6    officer, full information concerning the test or tests 7    shall be made available to the person or the person's 8    attorney. 9        3. At the trial of any civil or criminal action or 10    proceeding arising out of an arrest for an offense as 11    defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or 12    proceedings under Section 2-118.1 or 2-118.2 in which the 13    results of these validated roadside chemical tests or 14    standardized field sobriety tests are admitted, the person 15    may present and the trier of fact may consider evidence 16    that the person lacked the physical capacity to perform 17    the validated roadside chemical tests or standardized 18    field sobriety tests. 19    (b) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or 20proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed 21by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a 22vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the 23concentration of alcohol in the person's blood or breath at 24the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person's blood, 25urine, breath, or other bodily substance shall give rise to 26the following presumptions:  SB1889- 17 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1        1. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration 2    of 0.05 or less, it shall be presumed that the person was 3    not under the influence of alcohol.4        2. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration 5    in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08, such facts shall not 6    give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not 7    under the influence of alcohol, but such fact may be 8    considered with other competent evidence in determining 9    whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.10        3. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration 11    of 0.08 or more, it shall be presumed that the person was 12    under the influence of alcohol.13        4. The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not 14    be construed as limiting the introduction of any other 15    relevant evidence bearing upon the question whether the 16    person was under the influence of alcohol.17    (b-5) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or 18proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed 19by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a 20vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, other drug or 21drugs, intoxicating compound or compounds or any combination 22thereof, the concentration of cannabis in the person's whole 23blood or other bodily substance at the time alleged as shown by 24analysis of the person's blood or other bodily substance shall 25give rise to the following presumptions:26        1. If there was a free tetrahydrocannabinol   SB1889- 18 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1    concentration, as defined in this Section, of 5 nanograms 2    or more per milliliter in whole blood or 10 nanograms or 3    more per milliliter in another an other bodily substance, 4    excluding urine as defined in this Section, it shall be 5    presumed that the person was under the influence of 6    cannabis.7        2. If there was at that time a free 8    tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of less than 5 9    nanograms per milliliter in whole blood or less than 10 10    nanograms per milliliter in another an other bodily 11    substance, excluding urine, such facts shall not give rise 12    to any presumption that the person was or was not under the 13    influence of cannabis, but such fact may be considered 14    with other competent evidence in determining whether the 15    person was under the influence of cannabis. 16    (c) 1.

Chemical and other tests.   SB1889- 12 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1    (a) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or 2proceeding arising out of an arrest for an offense as defined 3in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or proceedings 4pursuant to Section 2-118.1, evidence of the concentration of 5alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or 6compounds, or any combination thereof in a person's blood or 7breath at the time alleged, as determined by analysis of the 8person's blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance, 9shall be admissible. Where such test is made the following 10provisions shall apply:11        1. Chemical analyses of the person's blood, urine, 12    breath, or other bodily substance to be considered valid 13    under the provisions of this Section shall have been 14    performed according to standards promulgated by the 15    Illinois State Police by a licensed physician, registered 16    nurse, trained phlebotomist, licensed paramedic, or other 17    individual possessing a valid permit issued by that 18    Department for this purpose. The Director of the Illinois 19    State Police is authorized to approve satisfactory 20    techniques or methods, to ascertain the qualifications and 21    competence of individuals to conduct such analyses, to 22    issue permits which shall be subject to termination or 23    revocation at the discretion of that Department and to 24    certify the accuracy of breath testing equipment. The 25    Illinois State Police shall prescribe regulations as 26    necessary to implement this Section.  SB1889- 13 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1        2. When a person in this State shall submit to a blood 2    test at the request of a law enforcement officer under the 3    provisions of Section 11-501.1, only a physician 4    authorized to practice medicine, a licensed physician 5    assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, 6    a registered nurse, trained phlebotomist, or licensed 7    paramedic, or other qualified person approved by the 8    Illinois State Police may withdraw blood for the purpose 9    of determining the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug 10    content therein. This limitation shall not apply to the 11    taking of breath, other bodily substance, or urine 12    specimens.13        When a blood test of a person who has been taken to an 14    adjoining state for medical treatment is requested by an 15    Illinois law enforcement officer, the blood may be 16    withdrawn only by a physician authorized to practice 17    medicine in the adjoining state, a licensed physician 18    assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, 19    a registered nurse, a trained phlebotomist acting under 20    the direction of the physician, or licensed paramedic. The 21    law enforcement officer requesting the test shall take 22    custody of the blood sample, and the blood sample shall be 23    analyzed by a laboratory certified by the Illinois State 24    Police for that purpose.25        3. The person tested may have a physician, or a 26    qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other   SB1889- 14 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1    qualified person of their own choosing administer a 2    chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at 3    the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or 4    inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall 5    not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the 6    test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement 7    officer.8        4. Upon the request of the person who shall submit to a 9    chemical test or tests at the request of a law enforcement 10    officer, full information concerning the test or tests 11    shall be made available to the person or such person's 12    attorney.13        5. Alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of 14    alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol 15    per 210 liters of breath.16        6. "Free tetrahydrocannabinol Tetrahydrocannabinol 17    concentration" means the amount of parent 18    delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol detected in blood or another 19    bodily substance, excluding urine either 5 nanograms or 20    more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of 21    whole blood or 10 nanograms or more of 22    delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of other 23    bodily substance. 24    (a-5) Law enforcement officials may use validated roadside 25chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests approved 26by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration when   SB1889- 15 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1conducting investigations of a violation of Section 11-501 or 2similar local ordinance by drivers suspected of driving under 3the influence of cannabis. The General Assembly finds that (i) 4validated roadside chemical tests are effective means to 5determine if a person is under the influence of cannabis and 6(ii) standardized field sobriety tests approved by the 7National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are divided 8attention tasks that are intended to determine if a person is 9under the influence of cannabis. The purpose of these tests is 10to determine the effect of the use of cannabis on a person's 11capacity to think and act with ordinary care and therefore 12operate a motor vehicle safely. Therefore, the results of 13these validated roadside chemical tests and standardized field 14sobriety tests, appropriately administered, shall be 15admissible in the trial of any civil or criminal action or 16proceeding arising out of an arrest for a cannabis-related 17offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local 18ordinance or proceedings under Section 2-118.1 or 2-118.2. 19Where a test is made the following provisions shall apply: 20        1. The person tested may have a physician, or a 21    qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other 22    qualified person of their own choosing administer a 23    chemical test or tests in addition to the standardized 24    field sobriety test or tests administered at the direction 25    of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to 26    obtain an additional test by a person does not preclude   SB1889- 16 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1    the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests 2    taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer. 3        2. Upon the request of the person who shall submit to 4    validated roadside chemical tests or a standardized field 5    sobriety test or tests at the request of a law enforcement 6    officer, full information concerning the test or tests 7    shall be made available to the person or the person's 8    attorney. 9        3. At the trial of any civil or criminal action or 10    proceeding arising out of an arrest for an offense as 11    defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or 12    proceedings under Section 2-118.1 or 2-118.2 in which the 13    results of these validated roadside chemical tests or 14    standardized field sobriety tests are admitted, the person 15    may present and the trier of fact may consider evidence 16    that the person lacked the physical capacity to perform 17    the validated roadside chemical tests or standardized 18    field sobriety tests. 19    (b) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or 20proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed 21by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a 22vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the 23concentration of alcohol in the person's blood or breath at 24the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person's blood, 25urine, breath, or other bodily substance shall give rise to 26the following presumptions:  SB1889- 17 -LRB104 08304 LNS 18355 b1        1. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration 2    of 0.05 or less, it shall be presumed that the person was 3    not under the influence of alcohol.4        2.
