Counting procedures for provisional   SB2222- 4 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1ballots cast in an incorrect precinct within the same election 2authority's jurisdiction.3    (a) The election authority shall:4        (1) transmit to the State Board of Elections the 5    provisional voter's identifying information and voting 6    jurisdiction within 2 calendar days. Following that, and 7    subject to paragraph (2) below, if the election authority 8    having jurisdiction over the provisional voter determines 9    that the voter has cast a provisional ballot in an 10    incorrect precinct, the ballot shall still be counted 11    using the procedures established in subsection (b) of this 12    Section or Section 18A-218.30 if applicable. Jurisdictions 13    that use election machines authorized pursuant to Article 14    24C of this Code for casting provisional ballots may vary 15    procedures of this Section and Section 18A-218.30 as 16    appropriate for the counting of provisional ballots cast 17    on those machines.18        (2) determine whether the voter was entitled to cast a 19    provisional ballot. The voter is entitled to cast a 20    provisional ballot if:21            (A) the affidavit executed by the voter contains, 22        at a minimum, the provisional voter's first and last 23        name, house number and street name, and signature or 24        mark;25            (B) the provisional voter is a registered voter 26        based on information available to the county clerk or   SB2222- 5 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1        board of election commissioners provided by or 2        obtained from the provisional voter, an election 3        judge, the Statewide voter registration database 4        maintained by the State Board of Elections, the 5        records of the county clerk or board of election 6        commissioners' database, or the records of the 7        Secretary of State or the voter is attempting to 8        register but lacks the necessary documentation; and9            (C) the provisional voter did not vote using the 10        vote by mail ballot and did not vote during the period 11        for early voting.12    (b) Once it has been determined by the election authority 13that the voter was entitled to vote a provisional ballot, even 14though it had been cast in an incorrect precinct, the election 15authority shall select a team or teams of 2 duly commissioned 16election judges, one from each of the two leading established 17political parties in Illinois, to count the votes that are 18eligible to be cast on the provisional ballot. In those 19jurisdictions that use election officials as defined in 20subsection (h) of Section 18A-15 of this Code, these duties 21may be performed by those election officials.22        (1) Votes cast for Statewide offices, the Office of 23    President of the United States (including votes cast in 24    the Presidential Preference Primary), and United States 25    Senate shall be counted on all provisional ballots cast in 26    the incorrect precinct.  SB2222- 6 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1        (2) Votes cast for Representative in Congress, 2    delegate or alternate delegate to a national nominating 3    convention, State Senator, State Representative, or 4    countywide, citywide, villagewide, or township office 5    shall be counted if it is determined by the election 6    judges or officials that the voter would have been 7    entitled to vote for one or more of these offices had the 8    voter voted in the precinct in which he or she is 9    registered to vote (the correct precinct) and had the 10    voter voted a ballot of the correct ballot style 11    containing all the offices and candidates for which the 12    voter was entitled to cast a ballot (the correct ballot 13    style). This determination shall be made by comparing a 14    sample ballot of the correct ballot style with the actual 15    provisional ballot cast by the voter. If the same office 16    (including the same district number for a Congressional, 17    Legislative or Representative district) appears on both 18    the correct ballot style sample ballot and the provisional 19    ballot cast by the voter, votes for that office shall be 20    counted. All votes cast for any remaining offices (offices 21    for which the voter would not have been entitled to vote 22    had he or she voted in the correct precinct) shall not be 23    counted.24        (3) No votes shall be counted for an office when the 25    voter voted for more candidates than he or she was 26    allowed.  SB2222- 7 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1        (4) Once it has been determined which offices are to 2    be counted and the provisional ballot contains no other 3    votes, the provisional ballot shall be counted pursuant to 4    the procedures set forth in this subsection (b).5        (5) If a provisional ballot does not contain any valid 6    votes, the provisional ballot shall be marked invalid and 7    shall not be counted.8        (6) Any provisional voting verification system 9    established by an election authority shall inform the 10    provisional voter that his or her provisional ballot was 11    partially counted because it was cast in an incorrect 12    precinct.13        (7) If a provisional ballot only contains votes cast 14    for eligible offices, and does not contain any votes cast 15    for ineligible offices, the ballot may be tabulated 16    without having to be remade.17        (8) If a provisional ballot contains both valid votes 18    that must be counted and invalid votes that cannot be 19    counted, : (A) the election judges, consisting in each 20    case of at least one of each of the 2 leading political 21    parties, shall, if the provisional ballot was cast on a 22    paper ballot sheet, proceed to remake the voted ballot 23    onto a blank ballot that includes all of the offices for 24    which valid votes were cast, transferring only valid 25    votes. The original provisional ballot shall be marked 26    "Original Provisional Ballot" with a serial number   SB2222- 8 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1    commencing at "1" and continuing consecutively for ballots 2    of that kind in the precinct. The duplicate provisional 3    ballot shall be marked "Duplicate Provisional Ballot" and 4    be given the same serial number as the original ballot 5    from which it was duplicated. The duplicate provisional 6    ballot shall then be treated in the same manner as other 7    provisional ballots.8            (B) if the provisional ballot was cast on a direct 9        recording electronic voting device, the election 10        judges shall mark the original provisional ballot as a 11        partially counted defective electronic provisional 12        ballot because it was cast in the incorrect precinct 13        (or bear some similar notation) and proceed to either:14                (i) remake the voted ballot by transferring 15            all valid votes to a duplicate paper ballot sheet 16            of the correct ballot style, marking the duplicate 17            ballot "Duplicate Electronic Provisional Ballot" 18            and then counting the duplicate provisional ballot 19            in the same manner as the other provisional 20            ballots marked on paper ballot sheets; or21                (ii) transfer, or cause to be transferred, all 22            valid votes electronically to the correct 23            precinct, which shall be counted and added to the 24            vote totals for the correct precinct, excluding 25            any votes that cannot be counted. If this method 26            is used, a permanent paper record must be   SB2222- 9 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1            generated for both the defective provisional 2            ballot and the duplicate electronic provisional 3            ballot.4    (c) For provisional ballots cast at a partisan primary 5election, the judges shall use a duplicate ballot of the 6correct ballot style for the same political party as the 7ballot chosen by the voter.8    (d) At least one qualified pollwatcher for each candidate, 9political party, and civic organization, as authorized by 10Section 17-23 of this Code, shall be permitted to observe the 11ballot remaking process. 12(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 13    (10 ILCS 5/19A-25.5)14    Sec. 19A-25.5.

Counting procedures for provisional   SB2222- 4 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1ballots cast in an incorrect precinct within the same election 2authority's jurisdiction.3    (a) The election authority shall:4        (1) transmit to the State Board of Elections the 5    provisional voter's identifying information and voting 6    jurisdiction within 2 calendar days. Following that, and 7    subject to paragraph (2) below, if the election authority 8    having jurisdiction over the provisional voter determines 9    that the voter has cast a provisional ballot in an 10    incorrect precinct, the ballot shall still be counted 11    using the procedures established in subsection (b) of this 12    Section or Section 18A-218.30 if applicable. Jurisdictions 13    that use election machines authorized pursuant to Article 14    24C of this Code for casting provisional ballots may vary 15    procedures of this Section and Section 18A-218.30 as 16    appropriate for the counting of provisional ballots cast 17    on those machines.18        (2) determine whether the voter was entitled to cast a 19    provisional ballot. The voter is entitled to cast a 20    provisional ballot if:21            (A) the affidavit executed by the voter contains, 22        at a minimum, the provisional voter's first and last 23        name, house number and street name, and signature or 24        mark;25            (B) the provisional voter is a registered voter 26        based on information available to the county clerk or   SB2222- 5 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1        board of election commissioners provided by or 2        obtained from the provisional voter, an election 3        judge, the Statewide voter registration database 4        maintained by the State Board of Elections, the 5        records of the county clerk or board of election 6        commissioners' database, or the records of the 7        Secretary of State or the voter is attempting to 8        register but lacks the necessary documentation; and9            (C) the provisional voter did not vote using the 10        vote by mail ballot and did not vote during the period 11        for early voting.12    (b) Once it has been determined by the election authority 13that the voter was entitled to vote a provisional ballot, even 14though it had been cast in an incorrect precinct, the election 15authority shall select a team or teams of 2 duly commissioned 16election judges, one from each of the two leading established 17political parties in Illinois, to count the votes that are 18eligible to be cast on the provisional ballot. In those 19jurisdictions that use election officials as defined in 20subsection (h) of Section 18A-15 of this Code, these duties 21may be performed by those election officials.22        (1) Votes cast for Statewide offices, the Office of 23    President of the United States (including votes cast in 24    the Presidential Preference Primary), and United States 25    Senate shall be counted on all provisional ballots cast in 26    the incorrect precinct.  SB2222- 6 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1        (2) Votes cast for Representative in Congress, 2    delegate or alternate delegate to a national nominating 3    convention, State Senator, State Representative, or 4    countywide, citywide, villagewide, or township office 5    shall be counted if it is determined by the election 6    judges or officials that the voter would have been 7    entitled to vote for one or more of these offices had the 8    voter voted in the precinct in which he or she is 9    registered to vote (the correct precinct) and had the 10    voter voted a ballot of the correct ballot style 11    containing all the offices and candidates for which the 12    voter was entitled to cast a ballot (the correct ballot 13    style). This determination shall be made by comparing a 14    sample ballot of the correct ballot style with the actual 15    provisional ballot cast by the voter. If the same office 16    (including the same district number for a Congressional, 17    Legislative or Representative district) appears on both 18    the correct ballot style sample ballot and the provisional 19    ballot cast by the voter, votes for that office shall be 20    counted. All votes cast for any remaining offices (offices 21    for which the voter would not have been entitled to vote 22    had he or she voted in the correct precinct) shall not be 23    counted.24        (3) No votes shall be counted for an office when the 25    voter voted for more candidates than he or she was 26    allowed.  SB2222- 7 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1        (4) Once it has been determined which offices are to 2    be counted and the provisional ballot contains no other 3    votes, the provisional ballot shall be counted pursuant to 4    the procedures set forth in this subsection (b).5        (5) If a provisional ballot does not contain any valid 6    votes, the provisional ballot shall be marked invalid and 7    shall not be counted.8        (6) Any provisional voting verification system 9    established by an election authority shall inform the 10    provisional voter that his or her provisional ballot was 11    partially counted because it was cast in an incorrect 12    precinct.13        (7) If a provisional ballot only contains votes cast 14    for eligible offices, and does not contain any votes cast 15    for ineligible offices, the ballot may be tabulated 16    without having to be remade.17        (8) If a provisional ballot contains both valid votes 18    that must be counted and invalid votes that cannot be 19    counted, : (A) the election judges, consisting in each 20    case of at least one of each of the 2 leading political 21    parties, shall, if the provisional ballot was cast on a 22    paper ballot sheet, proceed to remake the voted ballot 23    onto a blank ballot that includes all of the offices for 24    which valid votes were cast, transferring only valid 25    votes. The original provisional ballot shall be marked 26    "Original Provisional Ballot" with a serial number   SB2222- 8 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1    commencing at "1" and continuing consecutively for ballots 2    of that kind in the precinct. The duplicate provisional 3    ballot shall be marked "Duplicate Provisional Ballot" and 4    be given the same serial number as the original ballot 5    from which it was duplicated. The duplicate provisional 6    ballot shall then be treated in the same manner as other 7    provisional ballots.8            (B) if the provisional ballot was cast on a direct 9        recording electronic voting device, the election 10        judges shall mark the original provisional ballot as a 11        partially counted defective electronic provisional 12        ballot because it was cast in the incorrect precinct 13        (or bear some similar notation) and proceed to either:14                (i) remake the voted ballot by transferring 15            all valid votes to a duplicate paper ballot sheet 16            of the correct ballot style, marking the duplicate 17            ballot "Duplicate Electronic Provisional Ballot" 18            and then counting the duplicate provisional ballot 19            in the same manner as the other provisional 20            ballots marked on paper ballot sheets; or21                (ii) transfer, or cause to be transferred, all 22            valid votes electronically to the correct 23            precinct, which shall be counted and added to the 24            vote totals for the correct precinct, excluding 25            any votes that cannot be counted. If this method 26            is used, a permanent paper record must be   SB2222- 9 -LRB104 05586 SPS 15616 b1            generated for both the defective provisional 2            ballot and the duplicate electronic provisional 3            ballot.4    (c) For provisional ballots cast at a partisan primary 5election, the judges shall use a duplicate ballot of the 6correct ballot style for the same political party as the 7ballot chosen by the voter.8    (d) At least one qualified pollwatcher for each candidate, 9political party, and civic organization, as authorized by 10Section 17-23 of this Code, shall be permitted to observe the 11ballot remaking process. 12(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 13    (10 ILCS 5/19A-25.5)14    Sec. 19A-25.5.
