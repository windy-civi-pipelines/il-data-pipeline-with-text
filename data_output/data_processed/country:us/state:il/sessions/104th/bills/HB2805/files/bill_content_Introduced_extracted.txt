If an 10accident and health insurer has made written request, or had 11one made on its behalf by a national organization, for 12determination by the Office of Health Care Technology 13Assessment within the Agency for Health Care Policy and 14Research within the federal Department of Health and Human 15Services as to whether a specific organ transplantation 16procedure is clinically acceptable and said organization fails 17to respond to such a request within a period of 90 days, the 18failure to act may be deemed a determination that the 19procedure is deemed to be experimental or investigational.20    (14) Whenever a claim for benefits by an insured under a 21dental prepayment program is denied or reduced, based on the 22review of x-ray films, such review must be performed by a 23dentist.24(Source: P.A. 96-1551, eff. 7-1-11; 97-1150, eff. 1-25-13.) 25    Section 99.
