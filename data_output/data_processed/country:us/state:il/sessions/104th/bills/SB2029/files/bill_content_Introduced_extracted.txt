Purchase and sale by county; distribution of 9proceeds. 10    (a) When any property is offered for sale under any of the 11provisions of this Code, the county board of the county in 12which the property is located, in its discretion, may bid, or, 13in the case of forfeited property, may apply to purchase it or 14otherwise acquire the tax lien or certificate in the name of 15the county as trustee for all taxing districts having an 16interest in the property's taxes or special assessments for 17the nonpayment of which the property is sold. The presiding 18officer of the county board, with the advice and consent of the 19board, may appoint on its behalf some officer, person, or 20entity to attend such sales, bid on tax liens or certificates, 21and act on behalf of the county when exercising its authority 22under this Section, with reasonable costs and fees for such 23services paid from redemption interest and sales proceeds   SB2029- 2 -LRB104 11227 HLH 21309 b1arising from county certificates. The county shall apply on 2the bid or purchase the unpaid taxes and special assessments 3due upon the property. No cash need be paid. Under Sections 421-110, 21-115, 21-120, and 21-190, a county may bid or 5purchase tax certificates only in the absence of other 6bidders. 7    (b) The county, as trustee for all taxing districts having 8an interest in the property's taxes or special assessments, 9shall be the designated holder of all tax liens or 10certificates that are forfeited to the State or county. No 11cash need be paid for the forfeited tax lien or certificate. 12    (c) For any tax lien or certificate acquired under 13subsection (a) or (b) of this Section, the county may take 14steps necessary to acquire title to the property, including a 15final right of first refusal or final bid at the close of any 16public auction or judicial sale conveying title to the 17property, and may manage and operate the property, including, 18but not limited to, mowing of grass, removal of nuisance 19greenery, removal of garbage, waste, debris or other 20materials, or the demolition, repair, or remediation of unsafe 21structures. When a county, or other taxing district within the 22county, is a petitioner for a tax deed, no filing fee shall be 23required. When a county or other taxing district within the 24county is the petitioner for a tax deed, one petition may be 25filed including all parcels that are tax delinquent within the 26county or taxing district, and any publication made under   SB2029- 3 -LRB104 11227 HLH 21309 b1Section 22-20 of this Code may combine all such parcels within 2a single notice. The notice may include the property street 3address as listed on the most recent available tax bills, if 4available, and shall list the Property Index Number of the 5parcels for informational purposes. The county, as tax 6creditor and as trustee for other tax creditors, or other 7taxing district within the county, shall not be required to 8allege and prove that all taxes and special assessments which 9become due and payable after the sale or forfeiture to the 10county have been paid nor shall the county be required to pay 11the subsequently accruing taxes or special assessments at any 12time. The county board or its designee may prohibit the county 13collector from including the property in the tax sale of one or 14more subsequent years. The lien of taxes and special 15assessments which become due and payable after a sale to a 16county shall merge in the fee title of the county, or other 17taxing district within the county, on the issuance of a deed.18    The county may sell any property acquired with authority 19provided in this Section, or assign any tax certificate to any 20person or entity party, including, but not limited to, taxing 21districts, municipalities, land banks created pursuant to 22Illinois law, or non-profit developers focused on constructing 23affordable housing. 24    The assigned tax certificate shall be void with no further 25rights given to the assignee, including no right to refund or 26reimbursement, if a tax deed has not been recorded within 4   SB2029- 4 -LRB104 11227 HLH 21309 b1years after the date of the assignment unless a court extends 2the assignment period as provided in this Section. Upon a 3motion by the assignee, a court may toll the 4-year deadline 4for a specified period of time if the court finds the assignee 5is prevented from obtaining or recording a deed by injunction 6or order of any court, by the refusal or inability of any court 7to act upon the application for a tax deed, by a municipality's 8refusal to issue necessary transfer stamps or approvals for 9recording, or by the refusal of the clerk to execute the deed. 10If an assigned tax certificate is void under this Section, it 11shall be forfeited to the county and held as a valid 12certificate of sale in the county's name pursuant to this 13Section 21-90.

The presiding 18officer of the county board, with the advice and consent of the 19board, may appoint on its behalf some officer, person, or 20entity to attend such sales, bid on tax liens or certificates, 21and act on behalf of the county when exercising its authority 22under this Section, with reasonable costs and fees for such 23services paid from redemption interest and sales proceeds   SB2029- 2 -LRB104 11227 HLH 21309 b1arising from county certificates. The county shall apply on 2the bid or purchase the unpaid taxes and special assessments 3due upon the property. No cash need be paid. Under Sections 421-110, 21-115, 21-120, and 21-190, a county may bid or 5purchase tax certificates only in the absence of other 6bidders. 7    (b) The county, as trustee for all taxing districts having 8an interest in the property's taxes or special assessments, 9shall be the designated holder of all tax liens or 10certificates that are forfeited to the State or county. No 11cash need be paid for the forfeited tax lien or certificate. 12    (c) For any tax lien or certificate acquired under 13subsection (a) or (b) of this Section, the county may take 14steps necessary to acquire title to the property, including a 15final right of first refusal or final bid at the close of any 16public auction or judicial sale conveying title to the 17property, and may manage and operate the property, including, 18but not limited to, mowing of grass, removal of nuisance 19greenery, removal of garbage, waste, debris or other 20materials, or the demolition, repair, or remediation of unsafe 21structures. When a county, or other taxing district within the 22county, is a petitioner for a tax deed, no filing fee shall be 23required. When a county or other taxing district within the 24county is the petitioner for a tax deed, one petition may be 25filed including all parcels that are tax delinquent within the 26county or taxing district, and any publication made under   SB2029- 3 -LRB104 11227 HLH 21309 b1Section 22-20 of this Code may combine all such parcels within 2a single notice.
