The State 10    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 11    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 12    that the exemption holder has made a material 13    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 14    or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000 15    gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 16    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 17    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 18    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 19    spirits.20        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 21    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 22    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 23    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 24    production and sales information of a self-distribution 25    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 26    such information to any person.  SB1622- 14 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 2    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 3    this Section and this Act.4        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 5    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 6    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 7    licensed Illinois distributor.8        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 9    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 10    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 11    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 12    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 13    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 14    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small 15    for distributor or importing distributor business 16    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 17    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 18    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 19    integrity of the 3-tier system. 20        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be 21    either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer 22    and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of 23    beer, may make application to the State Commission for a 24    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 25    than 232,500 gallons per year of the exemption holder's 26    beer to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers,   SB1622- 15 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of 2    Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or any 3    combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries.4        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 5    penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall 6    state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of 7    beer manufactured and sold for each year since its 8    establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor 9    relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 10    necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) 11    that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and 12    revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any 13    other state where it is licensed.14        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 15    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 16    action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 17    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 18    if the class 1 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with 19    the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is 20    not a member of any affiliated group that manufactures, 21    directly or indirectly, more than 930,000 gallons of beer 22    per annum, 25,000 gallons of wine per annum, or 50,000 23    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) shall not annually 24    manufacture for sale more than 930,000 gallons of beer, 25    25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; (4) 26    shall not annually sell more than 232,500 gallons of its   SB1622- 16 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    beer to retail licensees and class 3 brewers and to 2    brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, 3    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 4    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 5    non-licensees at their breweries; and (5) has relinquished 6    any brew pub license held by the licensee, including any 7    ownership interest it held in the licensed brew pub.8        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 9    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 10    of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated 11    manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months. The 12    State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 13    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 14    that the exemption holder has made a material 15    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 16    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 17    manufacture of 930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of 18    wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits in any calendar year or 19    became part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than 20    930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 21    gallons of spirits.22        (E) The State Commission shall issue rules and 23    regulations governing self-distribution exemptions 24    consistent with this Act.25        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (18) shall prohibit a 26    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or   SB1622- 17 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 2    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 3    If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a 4    distribution agreement and has assigned distribution 5    rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then 6    the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution 7    rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a 8    reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.9        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (18) to promote 10    and continue orderly markets.

The State Commission may also 18    prescribe the forms of accounts to be kept by all retail 19    licensees having more than 4 employees, including, but not 20    limited to, accounts of earnings and expenses and any 21    distribution, payment, or other distribution of earnings 22    or assets, and any other forms, records, and memoranda 23    which in the judgment of the commission may be necessary 24    or appropriate to carry out any of the provisions of this 25    Act, including, but not limited to, such forms, records, 26    and memoranda as will readily and accurately disclose at   SB1622- 8 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    all times the beneficial ownership of such retail licensed 2    business.

As part of its report, the State 13    Commission shall provide all of the following information:14            (A) The amount of State excise and sales tax 15        revenues generated.16            (B) The amount of licensing fees received.17            (C) The number of cases of wine shipped from 18        inside and outside of this State directly to residents 19        of this State.20            (D) The number of alcohol compliance operations 21        conducted.22            (E) The number of winery shipper's licenses 23        issued.24            (F) The number of each of the following: reported 25        violations; cease and desist notices issued by the 26        Commission; notices of violations issued by the   SB1622- 11 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1        Commission and to the Department of Revenue; and 2        notices and complaints of violations to law 3        enforcement officials, including, without limitation, 4        the Illinois Attorney General and the U.S. Department 5        of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade 6        Bureau.7        (15) As a means to reduce the underage consumption of 8    alcoholic liquors, the State Commission shall conduct 9    alcohol compliance operations to investigate whether 10    businesses that are soliciting, selling, and shipping wine 11    from inside or outside of this State directly to residents 12    of this State are licensed by this State or are selling or 13    attempting to sell wine to persons under 21 years of age in 14    violation of this Act.15        (16) The State Commission shall, in addition to 16    notifying any appropriate law enforcement agency, submit 17    notices of complaints or violations of Sections 6-29 and 18    6-29.1 by persons who do not hold a winery shipper's 19    license under this Act to the Illinois Attorney General 20    and to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Alcohol and 21    Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.22        (17)(A) A person licensed to make wine under the laws 23    of another state who has a winery shipper's license under 24    this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of 25    wine or a person who has a first-class or second-class 26    wine manufacturer's license, a first-class or second-class   SB1622- 12 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    wine-maker's license, or a limited wine manufacturer's 2    license under this Act and annually produces less than 3    25,000 gallons of wine may make application to the 4    Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the 5    sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the exemption 6    holder's wine to retail licensees per year and to sell 7    cider, mead, or both cider and mead to brewers, class 1 8    brewers, class 2 brewers, and class 3 brewers that, 9    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 10    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 11    non-licensees at their breweries.12        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 13    penalty of perjury, such person shall state (1) the date 14    it was established; (2) its volume of production and sales 15    for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to 16    establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 17    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 18    marketing of its wine; and (5) that it will comply with the 19    liquor and revenue laws of the United States, this State, 20    and any other state where it is licensed.21        (C) The State Commission shall approve the application 22    for a self-distribution exemption if such person: (1) is 23    in compliance with State revenue and liquor laws; (2) is 24    not a member of any affiliated group that produces 25    directly or indirectly more than 25,000 gallons of wine 26    per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 50,000   SB1622- 13 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) will not annually 2    produce for sale more than 25,000 gallons of wine, 930,000 3    gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; and (4) 4    will not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its wine 5    to retail licensees.6        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 7    annually certify to the State Commission its production of 8    wine in the previous 12 months and its anticipated 9    production and sales for the next 12 months. The State 10    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 11    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 12    that the exemption holder has made a material 13    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 14    or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000 15    gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 16    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 17    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 18    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 19    spirits.20        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 21    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 22    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 23    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 24    production and sales information of a self-distribution 25    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 26    such information to any person.  SB1622- 14 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 2    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 3    this Section and this Act.4        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 5    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 6    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 7    licensed Illinois distributor.8        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 9    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 10    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 11    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 12    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 13    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 14    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small 15    for distributor or importing distributor business 16    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 17    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 18    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 19    integrity of the 3-tier system. 20        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be 21    either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer 22    and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of 23    beer, may make application to the State Commission for a 24    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 25    than 232,500 gallons per year of the exemption holder's 26    beer to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers,   SB1622- 15 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of 2    Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or any 3    combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries.4        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 5    penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall 6    state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of 7    beer manufactured and sold for each year since its 8    establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor 9    relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 10    necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) 11    that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and 12    revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any 13    other state where it is licensed.14        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 15    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 16    action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 17    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 18    if the class 1 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with 19    the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is 20    not a member of any affiliated group that manufactures, 21    directly or indirectly, more than 930,000 gallons of beer 22    per annum, 25,000 gallons of wine per annum, or 50,000 23    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) shall not annually 24    manufacture for sale more than 930,000 gallons of beer, 25    25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; (4) 26    shall not annually sell more than 232,500 gallons of its   SB1622- 16 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    beer to retail licensees and class 3 brewers and to 2    brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, 3    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 4    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 5    non-licensees at their breweries; and (5) has relinquished 6    any brew pub license held by the licensee, including any 7    ownership interest it held in the licensed brew pub.8        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 9    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 10    of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated 11    manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months. The 12    State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 13    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 14    that the exemption holder has made a material 15    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 16    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 17    manufacture of 930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of 18    wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits in any calendar year or 19    became part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than 20    930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 21    gallons of spirits.22        (E) The State Commission shall issue rules and 23    regulations governing self-distribution exemptions 24    consistent with this Act.25        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (18) shall prohibit a 26    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or   SB1622- 17 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 2    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 3    If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a 4    distribution agreement and has assigned distribution 5    rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then 6    the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution 7    rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a 8    reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.9        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (18) to promote 10    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 11    that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 12    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 13    exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and 14    allow such smaller manufacturers of beer access to the 15    marketplace in order to develop a customer base without 16    impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system. 17        (19)(A) A class 1 craft distiller licensee or a 18    non-resident dealer who manufactures less than 50,000 19    gallons of distilled spirits per year may make application 20    to the State Commission for a self-distribution exemption 21    to allow the sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the 22    exemption holder's spirits to retail licensees per year. 23        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 24    penalty of perjury, the class 1 craft distiller licensee 25    or non-resident dealer shall state (1) the date it was 26    established; (2) its volume of spirits manufactured and   SB1622- 18 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    sold for each year since its establishment; (3) its 2    efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 3    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 4    marketing of its spirits; and (5) that it will comply with 5    the alcoholic beverage and revenue laws of the United 6    States, this State, and any other state where it is 7    licensed. 8        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 9    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 10    action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 11    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 12    if the applicant: (1) is in compliance with State revenue 13    and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is not a member of any 14    affiliated group that produces more than 50,000 gallons of 15    spirits per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 16    25,000 gallons of wine per annum; (3) does not annually 17    manufacture for sale more than 50,000 gallons of spirits, 18    930,000 gallons of beer, or 25,000 gallons of wine; and 19    (4) does not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its 20    spirits to retail licensees. 21        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 22    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 23    of spirits during the previous 12 months and its 24    anticipated manufacture and sales of spirits for the next 25    12 months. The State Commission may fine, suspend, or 26    revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it   SB1622- 19 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    finds that the exemption holder has made a material 2    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 3    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 4    manufacture of 50,000 gallons of spirits, 930,000 gallons 5    of beer, or 25,000 gallons of wine in any calendar year, or 6    has become part of an affiliated group manufacturing more 7    than 50,000 gallons of spirits, 930,000 gallons of beer, 8    or 25,000 gallons of wine. 9        (E) The State Commission shall adopt rules governing 10    self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act. 11        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (19) shall prohibit a 12    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 13    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 14    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 15        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (19) to promote 16    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 17    that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 18    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 19    exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and 20    allow such smaller manufacturers of spirits access to the 21    marketplace in order to develop a customer base without 22    impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system. 23        (20)(A) A class 3 brewer licensee who must manufacture 24    less than 465,000 gallons of beer in the aggregate and not 25    more than 155,000 gallons at any single brewery premises 26    may make application to the State Commission for a   SB1622- 20 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 2    than 77,500 6,200 gallons of beer from each in-state or 3    out-of-state class 3 brewery premises, which shall not 4    exceed 232,500 18,600 gallons annually in the aggregate, 5    that is manufactured at a wholly owned class 3 brewer's 6    in-state or out-of-state licensed premises to retail 7    licensees and class 3 brewers and to brewers, class 1 8    brewers, class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) 9    of Section 6-4, sell beer, cider, or both beer and cider to 10    non-licensees at their licensed breweries.11        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 12    penalty of perjury, the class 3 brewer licensee shall 13    state:14            (1) the date it was established;15            (2) its volume of beer manufactured and sold for 16        each year since its establishment;17            (3) its efforts to establish distributor 18        relationships;19            (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 20        necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and21            (5) that it will comply with the alcoholic 22        beverage and revenue laws of the United States, this 23        State, and any other state where it is licensed.24        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 25    State Commission's website at least 45 days before action 26    by the State Commission. The State Commission shall   SB1622- 21 -LRB104 11847 RPS 21937 b1    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 2    if the class 3 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with 3    the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is 4    not a member of any affiliated group that manufacturers, 5    directly or indirectly, more than 465,000 gallons of beer 6    per annum; (3) shall not annually manufacture for sale 7    more than 465,000 gallons of beer or more than 155,000 8    gallons at any single brewery premises; and (4) shall not 9    annually sell more than 77,500 6,200 gallons of beer from 10    each in-state or out-of-state class 3 brewery premises, 11    and shall not exceed 232,500 18,600 gallons annually in 12    the aggregate, to retail licensees and class 3 brewers and 13    to brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, 14    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 15    sell beer, cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees 16    at their breweries.17        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 18    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 19    of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated 20    manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months.
