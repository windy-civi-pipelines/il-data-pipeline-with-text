This Act may be referred to as the Educational 5Choice for Illinois Children Act. 6    Section 2. Findings.

However, the 12    State has failed to meet this goal. According to the 2024 13    National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), 62% of 14    4th graders in the State were below proficient in 15    mathematics, and 68% of 8th graders in the State were 16    below proficient in mathematics. In reading, 70% of 4th 17    graders were below proficient, and 67% of 8th graders were 18    below proficient.19        (2) H.R. 1 of the 119th Congress, the One Big 20    Beautiful Bill Act, was recently signed into law. It 21    offers a federal tax credit of up to $1,700 for 22    individuals who donate to scholarship granting 23    organizations, thereby increasing funding for these   HB4099- 2 -LRB104 14781 LNS 27923 b1    organizations to help families pay for their children to 2    attend the kindergarten through grade 12 school of their 3    choice.

According to the 11    Department of Revenue, over 40,940 scholarships were 12    awarded during the time that the Invest in Kids Act was 13    active. Failure to opt into the provisions of the One Big 14    Beautiful Bill Act would place this State at a competitive 15    disadvantage with surrounding states that are likely to 16    opt into the school choice provisions of the One Big 17    Beautiful Bill Act.18        (4) The ability to choose where a child goes to school 19    should not be a privilege reserved for the wealthy. Too 20    many students are trapped in an educational learning 21    environment that fails to meet their needs, and the 22    financial burden of attending a different school is too 23    often out of reach. Scholarships from scholarship granting 24    organizations under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act can 25    help alleviate this financial burden for families that 26    could not otherwise afford private school and would result   HB4099- 3 -LRB104 14781 LNS 27923 b1    in no additional cost to the State.2        (5) It is the purpose of this Act to support school 3    choice in this State by directing the State Board of 4    Education to develop a list of scholarship granting 5    organizations to which qualified contributions may be made 6    under Section 25F of the Internal Revenue Code. 7    Section 5.
