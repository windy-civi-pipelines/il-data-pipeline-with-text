Execution of a Document. 8    (a) An individual of sound mind and having reached the age 9of majority or having obtained the status of an emancipated 10person pursuant to the Emancipation of Minors Act, as now or 11hereafter amended, may execute a document directing that if he 12is suffering from a terminal condition, then death delaying 13procedures shall not be utilized for the prolongation of his 14life.15    (b) The declaration must be signed by the declarant, or 16another at the declarant's direction, and witnessed by 2   10400SB1411sam001- 2 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1individuals 18 years of age or older.2    (c) The declaration of a qualified patient diagnosed as 3pregnant by the attending physician shall be given no force 4and effect as long as in the opinion of the attending physician 5it is possible that the fetus could develop to the point of 6live birth with the continued application of death delaying 7procedures.8    (d) If the patient is able, it shall be the responsibility 9of the patient to provide for notification to his or her 10attending physician of the existence of a declaration, to 11provide the declaration to the physician and to ask the 12attending physician whether he or she is willing to comply 13with its provisions. An attending physician who is so notified 14shall make the declaration, or copy of the declaration, a part 15of the patient's medical records. If the physician is at any 16time unwilling to comply with its provisions, the physician 17shall promptly so advise the declarant. If the physician is 18unwilling to comply with its provisions and the patient is 19able, it is the patient's responsibility to initiate the 20transfer to another physician of the patient's choosing. If 21the physician is unwilling to comply with its provisions and 22the patient is at any time not able to initiate the transfer, 23then the attending physician shall without delay notify the 24person with the highest priority, as set forth in this 25subsection, who is available, able, and willing to make 26arrangements for the transfer of the patient and the   10400SB1411sam001- 3 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1appropriate medical records to another physician for the 2effectuation of the patient's declaration. The order of 3priority is as follows: (1) the patient's surrogate 4decision-maker under the Health Care Surrogate Act, (2) (1) 5any person authorized by the patient to make such 6arrangements, (2) a guardian of the person of the patient, 7without the necessity of obtaining a court order to do so, and 8(3) any member of the patient's family.9    (e) The declaration may, but need not, be in the following 10form, and in addition may include other specific directions. 11Should any specific direction be determined to be invalid, 12such invalidity shall not affect other directions of the 13declaration which can be given effect without the invalid 14direction, and to this end the directions in the declaration 15are severable.16DECLARATION17    This declaration is made this ............. day of 18............. (month, year). I, .................., being of 19sound mind, willfully and voluntarily make known my desires 20that my moment of death shall not be artificially postponed.21    If at any time I should have an incurable and irreversible 22injury, disease, or illness judged to be a terminal condition 23by my attending physician who has personally examined me and 24has determined that my death is imminent except for death 25delaying procedures, I direct that such procedures which would 26only prolong the dying process be withheld or withdrawn, and   10400SB1411sam001- 4 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1that I be permitted to die naturally with only the 2administration of medication, sustenance, or the performance 3of any medical procedure deemed necessary by my attending 4physician to provide me with comfort care.5    In the absence of my ability to give directions regarding 6the use of such death delaying procedures, it is my intention 7that this declaration shall be honored by my family and 8physician as the final expression of my legal right to refuse 9medical or surgical treatment and accept the consequences from 10such refusal.11Signed ....................12City, County and State of Residence .........................13    The declarant is personally known to me and I believe him 14or her to be of sound mind. I saw the declarant sign the 15declaration in my presence (or the declarant acknowledged in 16my presence that he or she had signed the declaration) and I 17signed the declaration as a witness in the presence of the 18declarant. I did not sign the declarant's signature above for 19or at the direction of the declarant. At the date of this 20instrument, I am not entitled to any portion of the estate of 21the declarant according to the laws of intestate succession 22or, to the best of my knowledge and belief, under any will of 23declarant or other instrument taking effect at declarant's 24death, or directly financially responsible for declarant's 25medical care.26Witness ..................  10400SB1411sam001- 5 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1Witness ..................2(Source: P.A. 95-331, eff. 8-21-07.) 3    (755 ILCS 35/3.5 new)4    Sec. 3.5. Applicability. Section 4-11 of the Illinois 5Power of Attorney Act governs the applicability of this Act if 6a patient has a health care agency. 7    Section 10. The Health Care Surrogate Act is amended by 8changing Sections 15 and 20 as follows: 9    (755 ILCS 40/15)  (from Ch. 110 1/2, par. 851-15)10    Sec. 15. Applicability. This Act applies to patients who 11lack decisional capacity or who have a qualifying condition. 12This Act does not apply to instances in which the patient has 13an operative and unrevoked living will under the Illinois 14Living Will Act, an operative and unrevoked declaration for 15mental health treatment under the Mental Health Treatment 16Preferences Declaration Act, or an authorized agent under a 17power of attorney for health care under the Illinois Power of 18Attorney Act and the patient's condition falls within the 19coverage of the living will, the declaration for mental health 20treatment, or the power of attorney for health care. In those 21instances, the living will, declaration for mental health 22treatment, or power of attorney for health care, as the case 23may be, shall be given effect according to its terms. This Act   10400SB1411sam001- 6 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1does apply in circumstances in which a patient has a 2qualifying condition but the patient's condition does not fall 3within the coverage of the living will, the declaration for 4mental health treatment, or the power of attorney for health 5care.6    Each health care facility shall maintain any advance 7directives proffered by the patient or other authorized 8person, including a do not resuscitate order, a living will, a 9declaration for mental health treatment, a declaration of a 10potential surrogate or surrogates should the person become 11incapacitated or impaired, or a power of attorney for health 12care, in the patient's medical records. This Act does apply to 13patients without a qualifying condition. If a patient is an 14adult with decisional capacity, then the right to refuse 15medical treatment or life-sustaining treatment does not 16require the presence of a qualifying condition.17(Source: P.A. 96-448, eff. 1-1-10; 96-492, eff. 8-14-09; 1896-1000, eff. 7-2-10.) 19    (755 ILCS 40/20)  (from Ch. 110 1/2, par. 851-20)20    Sec. 20. Private decision making process. 21    (a) Decisions whether to forgo life-sustaining or any 22other form of medical treatment involving an adult patient 23with decisional capacity may be made by that adult patient. 24    (b) Decisions whether to forgo life-sustaining treatment 25on behalf of a patient without decisional capacity are lawful,   10400SB1411sam001- 7 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1without resort to the courts or legal process, if the patient 2has a qualifying condition and if the decisions are made in 3accordance with one of the following paragraphs in this 4subsection and otherwise meet the requirements of this Act: 5        (1) Decisions whether to forgo life-sustaining 6    treatment on behalf of a minor or an adult patient who 7    lacks decisional capacity may be made by a surrogate 8    decision maker or makers in consultation with the 9    attending physician, in the order or priority provided in 10    Section 25. A surrogate decision maker shall make 11    decisions for the adult patient conforming as closely as 12    possible to what the patient would have done or intended 13    under the circumstances, taking into account evidence that 14    includes, but is not limited to, any operative and 15    unrevoked living will, the patient's personal, 16    philosophical, religious and moral beliefs and ethical 17    values relative to the purpose of life, sickness, medical 18    procedures, suffering, and death. A surrogate's decision 19    whether to forgo life-sustaining treatment shall be 20    consistent with the patient's directions in any operative 21    and unrevoked living will. Where possible, the surrogate 22    shall determine how the patient would have weighed the 23    burdens and benefits of initiating or continuing 24    life-sustaining treatment against the burdens and benefits 25    of that treatment. In the event an unrevoked advance 26    directive, such as a living will, a declaration for mental   10400SB1411sam001- 8 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1    health treatment, or a power of attorney for health care, 2    is no longer valid due to a technical deficiency or is not 3    applicable to the patient's condition, that document may 4    be used as evidence of a patient's wishes. The absence of a 5    living will, declaration for mental health treatment, or 6    power of attorney for health care shall not give rise to 7    any presumption as to the patient's preferences regarding 8    the initiation or continuation of life-sustaining 9    procedures. If the adult patient's wishes are unknown and 10    remain unknown after reasonable efforts to discern them or 11    if the patient is a minor, the decision shall be made on 12    the basis of the patient's best interests as determined by 13    the surrogate decision maker. In determining the patient's 14    best interests, the surrogate shall weigh the burdens on 15    and benefits to the patient of initiating or continuing 16    life-sustaining treatment against the burdens and benefits 17    of that treatment and shall take into account any other 18    information, including the views of family and friends, 19    that the surrogate decision maker believes the patient 20    would have considered if able to act for herself or 21    himself. 22        (2) Decisions whether to forgo life-sustaining 23    treatment on behalf of a minor or an adult patient who 24    lacks decisional capacity, but without any surrogate 25    decision maker or guardian being available determined 26    after reasonable inquiry by the health care provider, may   10400SB1411sam001- 9 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1    be made by a court appointed guardian. A court appointed 2    guardian shall be treated as a surrogate for the purposes 3    of this Act. 4    (b-5) Decisions concerning medical treatment on behalf of 5a patient without decisional capacity are lawful, without 6resort to the courts or legal process, if the patient does not 7have a qualifying condition and if decisions are made in 8accordance with one of the following paragraphs in this 9subsection and otherwise meet the requirements of this Act: 10        (1) Decisions concerning medical treatment on behalf 11    of a minor or adult patient who lacks decisional capacity 12    may be made by a surrogate decision maker or makers in 13    consultation with the attending physician, in the order of 14    priority provided in Section 25 with the exception that 15    decisions to forgo life-sustaining treatment may be made 16    only when a patient has a qualifying condition. A 17    surrogate decision maker shall make decisions for the 18    patient conforming as closely as possible to what the 19    patient would have done or intended under the 20    circumstances, taking into account evidence that includes, 21    but is not limited to, any operative and unrevoked living 22    will, the patient's personal, philosophical, religious, 23    and moral beliefs and ethical values relative to the 24    purpose of life, sickness, medical procedures, suffering, 25    and death. In the event an unrevoked advance directive, 26    such as a living will, a declaration for mental health   10400SB1411sam001- 10 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1    treatment, or a power of attorney for health care, is no 2    longer valid due to a technical deficiency or is not 3    applicable to the patient's condition, that document may 4    be used as evidence of a patient's wishes. The absence of a 5    living will, declaration for mental health treatment, or 6    power of attorney for health care shall not give rise to 7    any presumption as to the patient's preferences regarding 8    any process. If the adult patient's wishes are unknown and 9    remain unknown after reasonable efforts to discern them or 10    if the patient is a minor, the decision shall be made on 11    the basis of the patient's best interests as determined by 12    the surrogate decision maker. In determining the patient's 13    best interests, the surrogate shall weigh the burdens on 14    and benefits to the patient of the treatment against the 15    burdens and benefits of that treatment and shall take into 16    account any other information, including the views of 17    family and friends, that the surrogate decision maker 18    believes the patient would have considered if able to act 19    for herself or himself. 20        (2) Decisions concerning medical treatment on behalf 21    of a minor or adult patient who lacks decisional capacity, 22    but without any surrogate decision maker or guardian being 23    available as determined after reasonable inquiry by the 24    health care provider, may be made by a court appointed 25    guardian. A court appointed guardian shall be treated as a 26    surrogate for the purposes of this Act.   10400SB1411sam001- 11 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1    (c) For the purposes of this Act, a patient or surrogate 2decision maker is presumed to have decisional capacity in the 3absence of actual notice to the contrary without regard to 4advanced age. With respect to a patient, a diagnosis of mental 5illness or an intellectual disability, of itself, is not a bar 6to a determination of decisional capacity. A determination 7that an adult patient lacks decisional capacity shall be made 8by the attending physician to a reasonable degree of medical 9certainty. The determination shall be in writing in the 10patient's medical record and shall set forth the attending 11physician's opinion regarding the cause, nature, and duration 12of the patient's lack of decisional capacity. Before 13implementation of a decision by a surrogate decision maker to 14forgo life-sustaining treatment, at least one other qualified 15health care practitioner must concur in the determination that 16an adult patient lacks decisional capacity. The concurring 17determination shall be made in writing in the patient's 18medical record after personal examination of the patient. The 19attending physician shall inform the patient that it has been 20determined that the patient lacks decisional capacity and that 21a surrogate decision maker will be making life-sustaining 22treatment decisions on behalf of the patient. Moreover, the 23patient shall be informed of the identity of the surrogate 24decision maker and any decisions made by that surrogate. If 25the person identified as the surrogate decision maker is not a 26court appointed guardian and the patient objects to the   10400SB1411sam001- 12 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1statutory surrogate decision maker or any decision made by 2that surrogate decision maker, then the provisions of this Act 3shall not apply. 4    (d) A surrogate decision maker acting on behalf of the 5patient shall express decisions to forgo life-sustaining 6treatment to the attending physician and one adult witness who 7is at least 18 years of age. This decision and the substance of 8any known discussion before making the decision shall be 9documented by the attending physician in the patient's medical 10record and signed by the witness. 11    (e) The existence of a qualifying condition shall be 12documented in writing in the patient's medical record by the 13attending physician and shall include its cause and nature, if 14known. The written concurrence of another qualified health 15care practitioner is also required. 16    (f) Once the provisions of this Act are complied with, the 17attending physician shall thereafter promptly implement the 18decision to forgo life-sustaining treatment on behalf of the 19patient unless he or she believes that the surrogate decision 20maker is not acting in accordance with his or her 21responsibilities under this Act, or is unable to do so for 22reasons of conscience or other personal views or beliefs. 23    (g) In the event of a patient's death as determined by a 24physician, all life-sustaining treatment and other medical 25care is to be terminated, unless the patient is an organ donor, 26in which case appropriate organ donation treatment may be   10400SB1411sam001- 13 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1applied or continued temporarily. 2    (h) A surrogate decision maker may execute a POLST 3portable medical orders form to forgo life-sustaining 4treatment consistent with this Section. 5(Source: P.A. 102-140, eff. 1-1-22.)".

The Health Care Surrogate Act is amended by 8changing Sections 15 and 20 as follows: 9    (755 ILCS 40/15)  (from Ch. 110 1/2, par. 851-15)10    Sec. 15. Applicability. This Act applies to patients who 11lack decisional capacity or who have a qualifying condition. 12This Act does not apply to instances in which the patient has 13an operative and unrevoked living will under the Illinois 14Living Will Act, an operative and unrevoked declaration for 15mental health treatment under the Mental Health Treatment 16Preferences Declaration Act, or an authorized agent under a 17power of attorney for health care under the Illinois Power of 18Attorney Act and the patient's condition falls within the 19coverage of the living will, the declaration for mental health 20treatment, or the power of attorney for health care. In those 21instances, the living will, declaration for mental health 22treatment, or power of attorney for health care, as the case 23may be, shall be given effect according to its terms.

This Act does apply to 13patients without a qualifying condition.

Private decision making process. 21    (a) Decisions whether to forgo life-sustaining or any 22other form of medical treatment involving an adult patient 23with decisional capacity may be made by that adult patient. 24    (b) Decisions whether to forgo life-sustaining treatment 25on behalf of a patient without decisional capacity are lawful,   10400SB1411sam001- 7 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1without resort to the courts or legal process, if the patient 2has a qualifying condition and if the decisions are made in 3accordance with one of the following paragraphs in this 4subsection and otherwise meet the requirements of this Act: 5        (1) Decisions whether to forgo life-sustaining 6    treatment on behalf of a minor or an adult patient who 7    lacks decisional capacity may be made by a surrogate 8    decision maker or makers in consultation with the 9    attending physician, in the order or priority provided in 10    Section 25. A surrogate decision maker shall make 11    decisions for the adult patient conforming as closely as 12    possible to what the patient would have done or intended 13    under the circumstances, taking into account evidence that 14    includes, but is not limited to, any operative and 15    unrevoked living will, the patient's personal, 16    philosophical, religious and moral beliefs and ethical 17    values relative to the purpose of life, sickness, medical 18    procedures, suffering, and death. A surrogate's decision 19    whether to forgo life-sustaining treatment shall be 20    consistent with the patient's directions in any operative 21    and unrevoked living will. Where possible, the surrogate 22    shall determine how the patient would have weighed the 23    burdens and benefits of initiating or continuing 24    life-sustaining treatment against the burdens and benefits 25    of that treatment. In the event an unrevoked advance 26    directive, such as a living will, a declaration for mental   10400SB1411sam001- 8 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1    health treatment, or a power of attorney for health care, 2    is no longer valid due to a technical deficiency or is not 3    applicable to the patient's condition, that document may 4    be used as evidence of a patient's wishes. The absence of a 5    living will, declaration for mental health treatment, or 6    power of attorney for health care shall not give rise to 7    any presumption as to the patient's preferences regarding 8    the initiation or continuation of life-sustaining 9    procedures. If the adult patient's wishes are unknown and 10    remain unknown after reasonable efforts to discern them or 11    if the patient is a minor, the decision shall be made on 12    the basis of the patient's best interests as determined by 13    the surrogate decision maker. In determining the patient's 14    best interests, the surrogate shall weigh the burdens on 15    and benefits to the patient of initiating or continuing 16    life-sustaining treatment against the burdens and benefits 17    of that treatment and shall take into account any other 18    information, including the views of family and friends, 19    that the surrogate decision maker believes the patient 20    would have considered if able to act for herself or 21    himself. 22        (2) Decisions whether to forgo life-sustaining 23    treatment on behalf of a minor or an adult patient who 24    lacks decisional capacity, but without any surrogate 25    decision maker or guardian being available determined 26    after reasonable inquiry by the health care provider, may   10400SB1411sam001- 9 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1    be made by a court appointed guardian. A court appointed 2    guardian shall be treated as a surrogate for the purposes 3    of this Act. 4    (b-5) Decisions concerning medical treatment on behalf of 5a patient without decisional capacity are lawful, without 6resort to the courts or legal process, if the patient does not 7have a qualifying condition and if decisions are made in 8accordance with one of the following paragraphs in this 9subsection and otherwise meet the requirements of this Act: 10        (1) Decisions concerning medical treatment on behalf 11    of a minor or adult patient who lacks decisional capacity 12    may be made by a surrogate decision maker or makers in 13    consultation with the attending physician, in the order of 14    priority provided in Section 25 with the exception that 15    decisions to forgo life-sustaining treatment may be made 16    only when a patient has a qualifying condition. A 17    surrogate decision maker shall make decisions for the 18    patient conforming as closely as possible to what the 19    patient would have done or intended under the 20    circumstances, taking into account evidence that includes, 21    but is not limited to, any operative and unrevoked living 22    will, the patient's personal, philosophical, religious, 23    and moral beliefs and ethical values relative to the 24    purpose of life, sickness, medical procedures, suffering, 25    and death. In the event an unrevoked advance directive, 26    such as a living will, a declaration for mental health   10400SB1411sam001- 10 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1    treatment, or a power of attorney for health care, is no 2    longer valid due to a technical deficiency or is not 3    applicable to the patient's condition, that document may 4    be used as evidence of a patient's wishes. The absence of a 5    living will, declaration for mental health treatment, or 6    power of attorney for health care shall not give rise to 7    any presumption as to the patient's preferences regarding 8    any process. If the adult patient's wishes are unknown and 9    remain unknown after reasonable efforts to discern them or 10    if the patient is a minor, the decision shall be made on 11    the basis of the patient's best interests as determined by 12    the surrogate decision maker. In determining the patient's 13    best interests, the surrogate shall weigh the burdens on 14    and benefits to the patient of the treatment against the 15    burdens and benefits of that treatment and shall take into 16    account any other information, including the views of 17    family and friends, that the surrogate decision maker 18    believes the patient would have considered if able to act 19    for herself or himself. 20        (2) Decisions concerning medical treatment on behalf 21    of a minor or adult patient who lacks decisional capacity, 22    but without any surrogate decision maker or guardian being 23    available as determined after reasonable inquiry by the 24    health care provider, may be made by a court appointed 25    guardian. A court appointed guardian shall be treated as a 26    surrogate for the purposes of this Act.   10400SB1411sam001- 11 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1    (c) For the purposes of this Act, a patient or surrogate 2decision maker is presumed to have decisional capacity in the 3absence of actual notice to the contrary without regard to 4advanced age. With respect to a patient, a diagnosis of mental 5illness or an intellectual disability, of itself, is not a bar 6to a determination of decisional capacity. A determination 7that an adult patient lacks decisional capacity shall be made 8by the attending physician to a reasonable degree of medical 9certainty. The determination shall be in writing in the 10patient's medical record and shall set forth the attending 11physician's opinion regarding the cause, nature, and duration 12of the patient's lack of decisional capacity. Before 13implementation of a decision by a surrogate decision maker to 14forgo life-sustaining treatment, at least one other qualified 15health care practitioner must concur in the determination that 16an adult patient lacks decisional capacity. The concurring 17determination shall be made in writing in the patient's 18medical record after personal examination of the patient. The 19attending physician shall inform the patient that it has been 20determined that the patient lacks decisional capacity and that 21a surrogate decision maker will be making life-sustaining 22treatment decisions on behalf of the patient. Moreover, the 23patient shall be informed of the identity of the surrogate 24decision maker and any decisions made by that surrogate. If 25the person identified as the surrogate decision maker is not a 26court appointed guardian and the patient objects to the   10400SB1411sam001- 12 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1statutory surrogate decision maker or any decision made by 2that surrogate decision maker, then the provisions of this Act 3shall not apply. 4    (d) A surrogate decision maker acting on behalf of the 5patient shall express decisions to forgo life-sustaining 6treatment to the attending physician and one adult witness who 7is at least 18 years of age. This decision and the substance of 8any known discussion before making the decision shall be 9documented by the attending physician in the patient's medical 10record and signed by the witness. 11    (e) The existence of a qualifying condition shall be 12documented in writing in the patient's medical record by the 13attending physician and shall include its cause and nature, if 14known. The written concurrence of another qualified health 15care practitioner is also required. 16    (f) Once the provisions of this Act are complied with, the 17attending physician shall thereafter promptly implement the 18decision to forgo life-sustaining treatment on behalf of the 19patient unless he or she believes that the surrogate decision 20maker is not acting in accordance with his or her 21responsibilities under this Act, or is unable to do so for 22reasons of conscience or other personal views or beliefs. 23    (g) In the event of a patient's death as determined by a 24physician, all life-sustaining treatment and other medical 25care is to be terminated, unless the patient is an organ donor, 26in which case appropriate organ donation treatment may be   10400SB1411sam001- 13 -LRB104 07373 JRC 23564 a1applied or continued temporarily. 2    (h) A surrogate decision maker may execute a POLST 3portable medical orders form to forgo life-sustaining 4treatment consistent with this Section. 5(Source: P.A. 102-140, eff. 1-1-22.)".
