If the laws, policies, or procedures of the other 24state prohibit the foregoing or if the parent or guardian 25otherwise provides proof of at least one satisfactory attempt 26to enroll the child but is refused by the other state, the   HB1861 Engrossed- 3 -LRB104 07629 LNS 17673 b1child shall continue to be deemed a resident of the last school 2district in which the child was enrolled. This process must be 3conducted when the student is placed in the facility and every 43 years from the date of placement. 5(Source: P.A. 95-844, eff. 8-15-08.) 6    (105 ILCS 5/14-1.11a)  (from Ch. 122, par. 14-1.11a)7    Sec. 14-1.11a.

Homeless students include individuals as defined in 13the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act.14    (c) The State Superintendent of Education may determine 15that the location of the parent or guardian of a student is 16unknown after considering information submitted from the 17school district that last enrolled the student or from the 18school or special education facility providing special 19education and related services to meet the needs of the 20student.

In those instances in which a district receives a block 5grant pursuant to Article 1D of this Code, the district's 6financial responsibility is limited to the actual educational 7costs of the placement, which must be paid by the district from 8its block grant appropriation. Resident district financial 9responsibility and reimbursement applies for both residential 10facilities that are approved by the State Board of Education 11and non-approved facilities, subject to the requirements of 12this Section. The Illinois placing agency or court remains 13responsible for funding the residential portion of the 14placement and for notifying the resident district prior to the 15placement, except in emergency situations.

The residential facility shall require the   HB1861 Engrossed- 7 -LRB104 07629 LNS 17673 b1    parent or guardian of the child to sign a contract upon 2    placement in the residential facility affirming that the 3    parent or guardian understands the parent's or guardian's 4    obligations under State law, including the obligation to 5    enroll the child in the appropriate school district of 6    residence at time of placement or upon the child reaching 7    the age of 3. The identified school district of residence 8    under this Article may not deny enrollment on the basis of 9    the child's placement.10        (2) For the 2025-2026 school year and every school 11    year thereafter, for a child with an out-of-state resident 12    district whose out-of-state resident district has refused 13    to enroll the child in the district, despite being 14    contacted by both the nonpublic school within the 15    applicable facility and the State Board of Education, the 16    resident district shall be the student's most recent 17    resident district in Illinois and that resident district 18    shall be the responsible payor. The reimbursement of 19    receipts paid under these circumstances shall be paid out 20    of the line item as found in Section 18-3 of this Code.21        (3) For fiscal year 2027 only, subject to 22    appropriation, the equivalent of each applicable child's 23    tuition receipts for the 2025-2026 school year, as found 24    in paragraph (1), shall be paid to the resident district 25    determined by this Section.

Failure of the 5placing agency or court to notify the resident district prior 6to the placement does not absolve the resident district of 7financial responsibility for the educational costs of the 8placement; however, the resident district shall not become 9financially responsible unless and until it receives written 10notice of the placement by either the placing agency, court, 11or residential facility. The placing agency or parent shall 12request an individualized education program (IEP) meeting from 13the resident district if the placement would entail additional 14educational services beyond the student's current IEP. The 15district of residence shall retain control of the IEP process, 16and any changes to the IEP must be done in compliance with the 17federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 18    Prior to the placement of a child in an out-of-state 19special education residential facility, the placing agency or 20court must refer to the child or the child's parent or guardian 21the option to place the child in a special education 22residential facility located within this State, if any, that 23provides treatment and services comparable to those provided 24by the out-of-state special education residential facility. 25The placing agency or court must review annually the placement 26of a child in an out-of-state special education residential   HB1861 Engrossed- 9 -LRB104 07629 LNS 17673 b1facility.

A school district is under no obligation to pay 17such a residential facility unless and until such proof is 18provided to the State Board's satisfaction. 19    When a dispute arises over the determination of the 20district of residence under this Section, any person or 21entity, including without limitation a school district or 22residential facility, may make a written request for a 23residency decision to the State Superintendent of Education, 24who, upon review of materials submitted and any other items of 25information he or she may request for submission, shall issue 26his or her decision in writing.
