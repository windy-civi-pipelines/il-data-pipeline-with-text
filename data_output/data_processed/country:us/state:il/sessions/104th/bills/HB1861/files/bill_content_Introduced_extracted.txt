Resident district financial 8responsibility and reimbursement applies for both residential 9facilities that are approved by the State Board of Education 10and non-approved facilities, subject to the requirements of 11this Section.

Failure of the 3placing agency or court to notify the resident district prior 4to the placement does not absolve the resident district of 5financial responsibility for the educational costs of the 6placement; however, the resident district shall not become 7financially responsible unless and until it receives written 8notice of the placement by either the placing agency, court, 9or residential facility. The placing agency or parent shall 10request an individualized education program (IEP) meeting from 11the resident district if the placement would entail additional 12educational services beyond the student's current IEP. The 13district of residence shall retain control of the IEP process, 14and any changes to the IEP must be done in compliance with the 15federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. 16    Prior to the placement of a child in an out-of-state 17special education residential facility, the placing agency or 18court must refer to the child or the child's parent or guardian 19the option to place the child in a special education 20residential facility located within this State, if any, that 21provides treatment and services comparable to those provided 22by the out-of-state special education residential facility. 23The placing agency or court must review annually the placement 24of a child in an out-of-state special education residential 25facility. As a part of the review, the placing agency or court 26must refer to the child or the child's parent or guardian the   HB1861- 9 -LRB104 07629 LNS 17673 b1option to place the child in a comparable special education 2residential facility located within this State, if any.3    Payments shall be made by the resident district to the 4entity providing the educational services, whether the entity 5is the residential facility or the school district wherein the 6facility is located, no less than once per quarter unless 7otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties.8    A residential facility providing educational services 9within the facility, but not approved by the State Board of 10Education, is required to demonstrate proof to the State Board 11of (i) appropriate licensure of teachers for the student 12population, (ii) age-appropriate curriculum, (iii) enrollment 13and attendance data, and (iv) the ability to implement the 14child's IEP. A school district is under no obligation to pay 15such a residential facility unless and until such proof is 16provided to the State Board's satisfaction. 17    When a dispute arises over the determination of the 18district of residence under this Section, any person or 19entity, including without limitation a school district or 20residential facility, may make a written request for a 21residency decision to the State Superintendent of Education, 22who, upon review of materials submitted and any other items of 23information he or she may request for submission, shall issue 24his or her decision in writing.
