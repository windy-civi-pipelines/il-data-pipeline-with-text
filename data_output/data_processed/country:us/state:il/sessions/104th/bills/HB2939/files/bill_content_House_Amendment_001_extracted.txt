Nothing in this Compact shall be construed to be a 12    waiver of sovereign immunity by the Participating States 13    or by the Commission. 14    SECTION 8. DATA SYSTEM15    A. The Commission shall provide for the development, 16maintenance, operation, and utilization of a coordinated 17database and reporting system containing licensure, Adverse 18Action, and the presence of Significant Investigative 19Information on all Licensees and applicants for a License in 20Participating States.21    B.

RULEMAKING18    A. The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in 19order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer 20the purposes and provisions of the Compact. A Commission Rule 21shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of 22competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because 23the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner 24that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the 25powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable   10400HB2939ham001- 33 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1standard of review.2    B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law 3in each Participating State, provided however that where the 4Rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the 5Participating State that establish the Participating State's 6Scope of Practice as held by a court of competent 7jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective 8in that State to the extent of the conflict.9    C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers 10pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the 11Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding as of the 12date specified by the Commission for each Rule.13    D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Participating 14States rejects a Commission Rule or portion of a Commission 15Rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same 16manner used to adopt the Compact, within four (4) years of the 17date of adoption of the Rule, then such Rule shall have no 18further force and effect in any Participating State or to any 19State applying to participate in the Compact.20    E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting 21of the Commission.22    F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission 23shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral 24and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.25    G. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule by the Commission, 26and at least thirty (30) days in advance of the meeting at   10400HB2939ham001- 34 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1which the Commission will hold a public hearing on the 2proposed Rule, the Commission shall provide a Notice of 3Proposed Rulemaking:4        1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly 5    accessible platform; 6        2. To persons who have requested notice of the 7    Commission's notices of proposed rulemaking; and8        3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule 9    specify.10    H. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:11        1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing 12    at which the Commission will hear public comments on the 13    proposed Rule and, if different, the time, date, and 14    location of the meeting where the Commission will consider 15    and vote on the proposed Rule;16        2. If the hearing is held via telecommunication, video 17    conference, or other electronic means, the Commission 18    shall include the mechanism for access to the hearing in 19    the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking;20        3. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason 21    therefor;22        4. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from 23    any interested person; and24        5. The manner in which interested persons may submit 25    written comments.26    I. All hearings will be recorded. A copy of the recording   10400HB2939ham001- 35 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1and all written comments and documents received by the 2Commission in response to the proposed Rule shall be available 3to the public.4    J. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring 5a separate hearing on each Commission Rule. Rules may be 6grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings 7required by this section.8    K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all 9Commissioners, take final action on the proposed Rule based on 10the rulemaking record.11        1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed 12    Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original 13    purpose of the proposed Rule.14        2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the 15    reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule 16    as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that 17    were recommended by commenters.18        3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable 19    effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as 20    provided in subsection L, the effective date of the Rule 21    shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days after the 22    Commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended 23    the Rule. 24    L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 25Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 24 26hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the   10400HB2939ham001- 36 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in 2this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as 3soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety 4(90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the 5purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must 6be adopted immediately in order to:7        1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, 8    or welfare;9        2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State 10    funds;11        3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that 12    is established by federal law or rule; or13        4. Protect public health and safety.14    M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the 15Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule 16for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in 17format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public 18notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the 19Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any 20person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The 21revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision 22results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be 23made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to the 24end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision 25will take effect without further action. If the revision is 26challenged, the revision may not take effect without the   10400HB2939ham001- 37 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1approval of the Commission.2    N. No Participating State's rulemaking requirements shall 3apply under this Compact. 4    SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT5    A. Oversight6        1. The executive and judicial branches of State 7    government in each Participating State shall enforce this 8    Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to 9    implement the Compact.10        2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or 11    against the Commission shall be brought solely and 12    exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the 13    principal office of the Commission is located. The 14    Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to 15    the extent it adopts or consents to participate in 16    alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein 17    shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue 18    in any action against a Licensee for professional 19    malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.20        3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 21    of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 22    interpretation of the Compact or Commission Rule and shall 23    have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all 24    purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of 25    process shall render a judgment or order void as to the   10400HB2939ham001- 38 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1    Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.2    B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination3        1. If the Commission determines that a Participating 4    State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations 5    or responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated 6    Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the 7    defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the 8    default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any 9    other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer 10    training and specific technical assistance regarding the 11    default.12        2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice 13    of default to the other Participating States.14    C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the 15defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an 16affirmative vote of a majority of the Commissioners, and all 17rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that State by 18this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of 19termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 20offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during 21the period of default.22    D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall be 23imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have 24been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall 25be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and 26minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the   10400HB2939ham001- 39 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1defaulting State's State Licensing Authority or Authorities, 2as applicable, and each of the Participating States' State 3Licensing Authority or Authorities, as applicable.4    E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all 5assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the 6effective date of termination, including obligations that 7extend beyond the effective date of termination.8    F. Upon the termination of a State's participation in this 9Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all 10Licensees of the State, including Licensees of other 11Participating States issued a Compact Privilege to practice 12within that State, of such termination. The terminated State 13shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges then in 14effect in that State for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) 15days after the date of said notice of termination.16    G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a 17State that is found to be in default or that has been 18terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing 19between the Commission and the defaulting State.20    H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the 21Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the 22District of Columbia or the federal district where the 23Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party 24shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 25reasonable attorney's fees.26    I. Dispute Resolution  10400HB2939ham001- 40 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1        1. Upon request by a Participating State, the 2    Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to 3    the Compact that arise among Participating States and 4    between Participating States and non-Participating States.5        2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing 6    for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for 7    disputes as appropriate.8    J. Enforcement9        1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its 10    discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact 11    and the Commission's Rules.12        2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal 13    action against a Participating State in default in the 14    United States District Court for the District of Columbia 15    or the federal district where the Commission has its 16    principal offices to enforce compliance with the 17    provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The 18    relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 19    damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 20    the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 21    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. The 22    remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the 23    Commission. The Commission may pursue any other remedies 24    available under federal or the defaulting Participating 25    State's law.26        3. A Participating State may initiate legal action   10400HB2939ham001- 41 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1    against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the 2    District of Columbia or the federal district where the 3    Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance 4    with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated 5    Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive 6    relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is 7    necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs 8    of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.9        4. No individual or entity other than a Participating 10    State may enforce this Compact against the Commission. 11    SECTION 11. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT12    A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which 13the Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh 14Participating State. 15        1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the 16    Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each 17    of the States that enacted the Compact prior to the 18    Commission convening ("Charter Participating States") to 19    determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter 20    Participating State is materially different than the Model 21    Compact.22            a. A Charter Participating State whose enactment 23        is found to be materially different from the Model 24        Compact shall be entitled to the default process set 25        forth in Section 10.  10400HB2939ham001- 42 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1            b. If any Participating State is later found to be 2        in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the 3        Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and 4        the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number 5        of Participating States should be less than seven (7). 6        2. Participating States enacting the Compact 7    subsequent to the Charter Participating States shall be 8    subject to the process set forth in Section 7.C.23 to 9    determine if their enactments are materially different 10    from the Model Compact and whether they qualify for 11    participation in the Compact.12        3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission 13    or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of 14    the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or 15    the Commission coming into existence shall be considered 16    to be actions of the Commission unless specifically 17    repudiated by the Commission. 18        4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the 19    Commission's initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws 20    shall be subject to the Commission's Rules and bylaws as 21    they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in 22    that State. Any Rule that has been previously adopted by 23    the Commission shall have the full force and effect of law 24    on the day the Compact becomes law in that State.25    B. Any Participating State may withdraw from this Compact 26by enacting a statute repealing that State's enactment of the   10400HB2939ham001- 43 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1Compact.2        1.

A Commission Rule 21shall be invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of 22competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because 23the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner 24that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the 25powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable   10400HB2939ham001- 33 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1standard of review.2    B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law 3in each Participating State, provided however that where the 4Rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the 5Participating State that establish the Participating State's 6Scope of Practice as held by a court of competent 7jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be ineffective 8in that State to the extent of the conflict.9    C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers 10pursuant to the criteria set forth in this section and the 11Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding as of the 12date specified by the Commission for each Rule.13    D.

Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting 21of the Commission.22    F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission 23shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral 24and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.25    G.

Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring 5a separate hearing on each Commission Rule. Rules may be 6grouped for the convenience of the Commission at hearings 7required by this section.8    K.

The Commission shall determine a reasonable 19    effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as 20    provided in subsection L, the effective date of the Rule 21    shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days after the 22    Commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended 23    the Rule. 24    L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 25Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 24 26hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the   10400HB2939ham001- 36 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1usual rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in 2this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as 3soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety 4(90) days after the effective date of the Rule.

Public 18notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the 19Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any 20person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting.

A challenge shall be 23made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to the 24end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision 25will take effect without further action. If the revision is 26challenged, the revision may not take effect without the   10400HB2939ham001- 37 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1approval of the Commission.2    N. No Participating State's rulemaking requirements shall 3apply under this Compact. 4    SECTION 10. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT5    A. Oversight6        1.

Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or 11    against the Commission shall be brought solely and 12    exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the 13    principal office of the Commission is located. The 14    Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to 15    the extent it adopts or consents to participate in 16    alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein 17    shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue 18    in any action against a Licensee for professional 19    malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.20        3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 21    of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 22    interpretation of the Compact or Commission Rule and shall 23    have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all 24    purposes. Failure to provide the Commission service of 25    process shall render a judgment or order void as to the   10400HB2939ham001- 38 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1    Commission, this Compact, or promulgated Rules.2    B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination3        1.

The notice of default shall describe the 8    default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any 9    other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer 10    training and specific technical assistance regarding the 11    default.12        2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice 13    of default to the other Participating States.14    C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the 15defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an 16affirmative vote of a majority of the Commissioners, and all 17rights, privileges and benefits conferred on that State by 18this Compact may be terminated on the effective date of 19termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 20offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during 21the period of default.22    D. Termination of participation in the Compact shall be 23imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have 24been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall 25be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and 26minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the   10400HB2939ham001- 39 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1defaulting State's State Licensing Authority or Authorities, 2as applicable, and each of the Participating States' State 3Licensing Authority or Authorities, as applicable.4    E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all 5assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the 6effective date of termination, including obligations that 7extend beyond the effective date of termination.8    F. Upon the termination of a State's participation in this 9Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all 10Licensees of the State, including Licensees of other 11Participating States issued a Compact Privilege to practice 12within that State, of such termination. The terminated State 13shall continue to recognize all Compact Privileges then in 14effect in that State for a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) 15days after the date of said notice of termination.16    G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a 17State that is found to be in default or that has been 18terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing 19between the Commission and the defaulting State.20    H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the 21Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the 22District of Columbia or the federal district where the 23Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party 24shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 25reasonable attorney's fees.26    I. Dispute Resolution  10400HB2939ham001- 40 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1        1. Upon request by a Participating State, the 2    Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to 3    the Compact that arise among Participating States and 4    between Participating States and non-Participating States.5        2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing 6    for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for 7    disputes as appropriate.8    J. Enforcement9        1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its 10    discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact 11    and the Commission's Rules.12        2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal 13    action against a Participating State in default in the 14    United States District Court for the District of Columbia 15    or the federal district where the Commission has its 16    principal offices to enforce compliance with the 17    provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The 18    relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 19    damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 20    the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 21    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.

The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which 13the Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh 14Participating State. 15        1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the 16    Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each 17    of the States that enacted the Compact prior to the 18    Commission convening ("Charter Participating States") to 19    determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter 20    Participating State is materially different than the Model 21    Compact.22            a. A Charter Participating State whose enactment 23        is found to be materially different from the Model 24        Compact shall be entitled to the default process set 25        forth in Section 10.  10400HB2939ham001- 42 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1            b. If any Participating State is later found to be 2        in default, or is terminated or withdraws from the 3        Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and 4        the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number 5        of Participating States should be less than seven (7). 6        2. Participating States enacting the Compact 7    subsequent to the Charter Participating States shall be 8    subject to the process set forth in Section 7.C.23 to 9    determine if their enactments are materially different 10    from the Model Compact and whether they qualify for 11    participation in the Compact.12        3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission 13    or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of 14    the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or 15    the Commission coming into existence shall be considered 16    to be actions of the Commission unless specifically 17    repudiated by the Commission. 18        4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the 19    Commission's initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws 20    shall be subject to the Commission's Rules and bylaws as 21    they exist on the date on which the Compact becomes law in 22    that State.

A Participating State's withdrawal shall not take 3    effect until one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment 4    of the repealing statute.5        2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing 6    requirement of the withdrawing State's Licensing Authority 7    or Authorities to comply with the investigative and 8    Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact 9    prior to the effective date of withdrawal.10        3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from 11    this Compact, the State shall immediately provide notice 12    of such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State. 13    Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the 14    contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to 15    recognize all Compact Privileges to practice within that 16    State granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of 17    one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of such 18    notice of withdrawal. 19    C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to 20invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other 21cooperative arrangement between a Participating State and a 22non-Participating State that does not conflict with the 23provisions of this Compact.24    D. This Compact may be amended by the Participating 25States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective 26and binding upon any Participating State until it is enacted   10400HB2939ham001- 44 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1into the laws of all Participating States. 2    SECTION 12. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY3    A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority 4shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, 5and the implementation and administration of the Compact. 6Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring 7the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the 8Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.9    B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and 10if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact 11is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to 12the constitution of any Participating State, a State seeking 13participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the 14applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or 15circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 16competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this 17Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 18agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. 19    C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the 20Commission may deny a State's participation in the Compact or, 21in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.B, terminate 22a Participating State's participation in the Compact, if it 23determines that a constitutional requirement of a 24Participating State is a material departure from the Compact. 25Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to be contrary to the   10400HB2939ham001- 45 -LRB104 09205 RTM 23583 a1constitution of any Participating State, the Compact shall 2remain in full force and effect as to the remaining 3Participating States and in full force and effect as to the 4Participating State affected as to all severable matters. 5    SECTION 13.
