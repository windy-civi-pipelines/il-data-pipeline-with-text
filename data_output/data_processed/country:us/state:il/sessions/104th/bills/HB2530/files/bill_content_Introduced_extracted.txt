In all other 16counties, the amount of the exemption is as follows: (i) 17through taxable year 2005 and for taxable year 2007 and 18thereafter, the amount of this exemption shall be the 19equalized assessed value of the residence in the taxable year 20for which application is made minus the base amount; and (ii) 21for taxable year 2006, the amount of the exemption is as 22follows:23        (1) For an applicant who has a household income of 24    $45,000 or less, the amount of the exemption is the 25    equalized assessed value of the residence in the taxable 26    year for which application is made minus the base amount.  HB2530- 7 -LRB104 09381 HLH 19440 b1        (2) For an applicant who has a household income 2    exceeding $45,000 but not exceeding $46,250, the amount of 3    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 4    residence in the taxable year for which application is 5    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.8.6        (3) For an applicant who has a household income 7    exceeding $46,250 but not exceeding $47,500, the amount of 8    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 9    residence in the taxable year for which application is 10    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.6.11        (4) For an applicant who has a household income 12    exceeding $47,500 but not exceeding $48,750, the amount of 13    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 14    residence in the taxable year for which application is 15    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.4.16        (5) For an applicant who has a household income 17    exceeding $48,750 but not exceeding $50,000, the amount of 18    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 19    residence in the taxable year for which application is 20    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.2. 21    When the applicant is a surviving spouse of an applicant 22for a prior year for the same residence for which an exemption 23under this Section has been granted, the base year and base 24amount for that residence are the same as for the applicant for 25the prior year.26    Each year at the time the assessment books are certified   HB2530- 8 -LRB104 09381 HLH 19440 b1to the County Clerk, the Board of Review or Board of Appeals 2shall give to the County Clerk a list of the assessed values of 3improvements on each parcel qualifying for this exemption that 4were added after the base year for this parcel and that 5increased the assessed value of the property.6    In the case of land improved with an apartment building 7owned and operated as a cooperative or a building that is a 8life care facility that qualifies as a cooperative, the 9maximum reduction from the equalized assessed value of the 10property is limited to the sum of the reductions calculated 11for each unit occupied as a residence by a person or persons 12(i) 65 years of age or older, (ii) with a household income that 13does not exceed the maximum income limitation, (iii) who is 14liable, by contract with the owner or owners of record, for 15paying real property taxes on the property, and (iv) who is an 16owner of record of a legal or equitable interest in the 17cooperative apartment building, other than a leasehold 18interest. In the instance of a cooperative where a homestead 19exemption has been granted under this Section, the cooperative 20association or its management firm shall credit the savings 21resulting from that exemption only to the apportioned tax 22liability of the owner who qualified for the exemption. Any 23person who willfully refuses to credit that savings to an 24owner who qualifies for the exemption is guilty of a Class B 25misdemeanor.26    When a homestead exemption has been granted under this   HB2530- 9 -LRB104 09381 HLH 19440 b1Section and an applicant then becomes a resident of a facility 2licensed under the Assisted Living and Shared Housing Act, the 3Nursing Home Care Act, the Specialized Mental Health 4Rehabilitation Act of 2013, the ID/DD Community Care Act, or 5the MC/DD Act, the exemption shall be granted in subsequent 6years so long as the residence (i) continues to be occupied by 7the qualified applicant's spouse or (ii) if remaining 8unoccupied, is still owned by the qualified applicant for the 9homestead exemption.10    Beginning January 1, 1997, when an individual dies who 11would have qualified for an exemption under this Section, and 12the surviving spouse does not independently qualify for this 13exemption because of age, the exemption under this Section 14shall be granted to the surviving spouse for the taxable year 15preceding and the taxable year of the death, provided that, 16except for age, the surviving spouse meets all other 17qualifications for the granting of this exemption for those 18years.19    When married persons maintain separate residences, the 20exemption provided for in this Section may be claimed by only 21one of such persons and for only one residence.22    For taxable year 1994 only, in counties having less than 233,000,000 inhabitants, to receive the exemption, a person 24shall submit an application by February 15, 1995 to the Chief 25County Assessment Officer of the county in which the property 26is located.

Each 25application shall contain or be verified by a written 26declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury. A   HB2530- 11 -LRB104 09381 HLH 19440 b1taxpayer's signing a fraudulent application under this Act is 2perjury, as defined in Section 32-2 of the Criminal Code of 32012. The applications shall be clearly marked as applications 4for the Low-Income Senior Citizens Assessment Freeze Homestead 5Exemption and must contain a notice that any taxpayer who 6receives the exemption is subject to an audit by the Chief 7County Assessment Officer.8    Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, in 9counties having fewer than 3,000,000 inhabitants, if an 10applicant fails to file the application required by this 11Section in a timely manner and this failure to file is due to a 12mental or physical condition sufficiently severe so as to 13render the applicant incapable of filing the application in a 14timely manner, the Chief County Assessment Officer may extend 15the filing deadline for a period of 30 days after the applicant 16regains the capability to file the application, but in no case 17may the filing deadline be extended beyond 3 months of the 18original filing deadline.

In order to receive the extension provided in this 12paragraph, the applicant shall provide the Chief County 13Assessment Officer with a signed statement from the 14applicant's physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or 15physician assistant stating the nature and extent of the 16condition, and that, in the physician's, advanced practice 17registered nurse's, or physician assistant's opinion, the 18condition was so severe that it rendered the applicant 19incapable of filing the application in a timely manner.20    In counties having less than 3,000,000 inhabitants, if an 21applicant was denied an exemption in taxable year 1994 and the 22denial occurred due to an error on the part of an assessment 23official, or his or her agent or employee, then beginning in 24taxable year 1997 the applicant's base year, for purposes of 25determining the amount of the exemption, shall be 1993 rather 26than 1994. In addition, in taxable year 1997, the applicant's   HB2530- 13 -LRB104 09381 HLH 19440 b1exemption shall also include an amount equal to (i) the amount 2of any exemption denied to the applicant in taxable year 1995 3as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, as the base year, 4(ii) the amount of any exemption denied to the applicant in 5taxable year 1996 as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, 6as the base year, and (iii) the amount of the exemption 7erroneously denied for taxable year 1994.8    For purposes of this Section, a person who will be 65 years 9of age during the current taxable year shall be eligible to 10apply for the homestead exemption during that taxable year. 11Application shall be made during the application period in 12effect for the county of his or her residence. 13    The Chief County Assessment Officer may determine the 14eligibility of a life care facility that qualifies as a 15cooperative to receive the benefits provided by this Section 16by use of an affidavit, application, visual inspection, 17questionnaire, or other reasonable method in order to insure 18that the tax savings resulting from the exemption are credited 19by the management firm to the apportioned tax liability of 20each qualifying resident. The Chief County Assessment Officer 21may request reasonable proof that the management firm has so 22credited that exemption.23    Except as provided in this Section, all information 24received by the chief county assessment officer or the 25Department from applications filed under this Section, or from 26any investigation conducted under the provisions of this   HB2530- 14 -LRB104 09381 HLH 19440 b1Section, shall be confidential, except for official purposes 2or pursuant to official procedures for collection of any State 3or local tax or enforcement of any civil or criminal penalty or 4sanction imposed by this Act or by any statute or ordinance 5imposing a State or local tax. Any person who divulges any such 6information in any manner, except in accordance with a proper 7judicial order, is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.8    Nothing contained in this Section shall prevent the 9Director or chief county assessment officer from publishing or 10making available reasonable statistics concerning the 11operation of the exemption contained in this Section in which 12the contents of claims are grouped into aggregates in such a 13way that information contained in any individual claim shall 14not be disclosed.15    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for taxable 16year 2017 and thereafter, in counties of 3,000,000 or more 17inhabitants, the amount of the exemption shall be the greater 18of (i) the amount of the exemption otherwise calculated under 19this Section or (ii) $2,000. 20    (c-5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each 21chief county assessment officer may approve this exemption for 22the 2020 taxable year, without application, for any property 23that was approved for this exemption for the 2019 taxable 24year, provided that: 25        (1) the county board has declared a local disaster as 26    provided in the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act   HB2530- 15 -LRB104 09381 HLH 19440 b1    related to the COVID-19 public health emergency; 2        (2) the owner of record of the property as of January 3    1, 2020 is the same as the owner of record of the property 4    as of January 1, 2019; 5        (3) the exemption for the 2019 taxable year has not 6    been determined to be an erroneous exemption as defined by 7    this Code; and 8        (4) the applicant for the 2019 taxable year has not 9    asked for the exemption to be removed for the 2019 or 2020 10    taxable years. 11    Nothing in this subsection shall preclude or impair the 12authority of a chief county assessment officer to conduct 13audits of any taxpayer claiming an exemption under this 14Section to verify that the taxpayer is eligible to receive the 15exemption as provided elsewhere in this Section. 16    (c-10) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each 17chief county assessment officer may approve this exemption for 18the 2021 taxable year, without application, for any property 19that was approved for this exemption for the 2020 taxable 20year, if:21        (1) the county board has declared a local disaster as 22    provided in the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act 23    related to the COVID-19 public health emergency;24        (2) the owner of record of the property as of January 25    1, 2021 is the same as the owner of record of the property 26    as of January 1, 2020;  HB2530- 16 -LRB104 09381 HLH 19440 b1        (3) the exemption for the 2020 taxable year has not 2    been determined to be an erroneous exemption as defined by 3    this Code; and4        (4) the taxpayer for the 2020 taxable year has not 5    asked for the exemption to be removed for the 2020 or 2021 6    taxable years.7    Nothing in this subsection shall preclude or impair the 8authority of a chief county assessment officer to conduct 9audits of any taxpayer claiming an exemption under this 10Section to verify that the taxpayer is eligible to receive the 11exemption as provided elsewhere in this Section. 12    (d) Each Chief County Assessment Officer shall annually 13publish a notice of availability of the exemption provided 14under this Section.
