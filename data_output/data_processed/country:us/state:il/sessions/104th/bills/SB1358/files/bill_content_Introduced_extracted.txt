Effective immediately.LRB104 09465 BAB 19526 b  A BILL FOR SB1358LRB104 09465 BAB 19526 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Findings; purpose. 5    (a) The General Assembly finds the following: 6        (1) Positron emission tomography (PET) scans have been 7    proven as the most effective form of medical imaging for 8    detecting both tumors and cancer. Studies show that PET 9    scans have an almost 92.5% chance to successfully diagnose 10    malignancies. 11        (2) The risk of cancer and cancer diagnoses starts to 12    exponentially increase beginning at the age of 45 in both 13    men and women. 14        (3) PET scans are not covered as screening tests 15    unless the individual has Medicare or a physician orders a 16    PET scan. Because a person must be at least age 65 to be 17    eligible for Medicare and because many cancers are hard to 18    detect based on symptoms, thousands of cases of cancer are 19    undetected. 20        (4) By the time an individual is eligible to receive a 21    PET scan, the cancer is often too far progressed and 22    difficult to treat. 23    (b) The purposes of this Act are to: 24        (1) mandate insurance companies to cover the full cost   SB1358- 2 -LRB104 09465 BAB 19526 b1    of an annual PET scan to better public health; and2        (2) protect the health and welfare of older 3    constituents who are at a higher risk of cancer. 4    Section 5.
