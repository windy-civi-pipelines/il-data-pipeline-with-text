The referendum shall be 13substantially in the following form: 14------------------------------------------------------------- 15    Shall (name of the municipality) 16establish a redevelopment project 17area within (general description of 18the redevelopment project area) for 19(the purposes of the redevelopment 20project area)? 21-------------------------------------------------------------22    The votes shall be recorded as "Yes" or "No".

The board shall consist of 3a representative selected by each community college district, 4local elementary school district and high school district or 5each local community unit school district, park district, 6library district, township, fire protection district, and 7county that will have the authority to directly levy taxes on 8the property within the proposed redevelopment project area at 9the time that the proposed redevelopment project area is 10approved, a representative selected by the municipality and a 11public member. The public member shall first be selected and 12then the board's chairperson shall be selected by a majority 13of the board members present and voting.14    For redevelopment project areas with redevelopment plans 15or proposed redevelopment plans that would result in the 16displacement of residents from 10 or more inhabited 17residential units or that include 75 or more inhabited 18residential units, the public member shall be a person who 19resides in the redevelopment project area. If, as determined 20by the housing impact study provided for in paragraph (5) of 21subsection (n) of Section 11-74.4-3, or if no housing impact 22study is required then based on other reasonable data, the 23majority of residential units are occupied by very low, low, 24or moderate income households, as defined in Section 3 of the 25Illinois Affordable Housing Act, the public member shall be a 26person who resides in very low, low, or moderate income   HB1142- 8 -LRB104 04065 RTM 14089 b1housing within the redevelopment project area. Municipalities 2with fewer than 15,000 residents shall not be required to 3select a person who lives in very low, low, or moderate income 4housing within the redevelopment project area, provided that 5the redevelopment plan or project will not result in 6displacement of residents from 10 or more inhabited units, and 7the municipality so certifies in the plan. If no person 8satisfying these requirements is available or if no qualified 9person will serve as the public member, then the joint review 10board is relieved of this paragraph's selection requirements 11for the public member.12    Within 90 days of the effective date of this amendatory 13Act of the 91st General Assembly, each municipality that 14designated a redevelopment project area for which it was not 15required to convene a joint review board under this Section 16shall convene a joint review board to perform the duties 17specified under paragraph (e) of this Section.18    All board members shall be appointed and the first board 19meeting shall be held at least 14 days but not more than 28 20days after the mailing of notice by the municipality to the 21taxing districts as required by Section 11-74.4-6(c). 22Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a municipality that 23adopted either a public hearing resolution or a feasibility 24resolution between July 1, 1999 and July 1, 2000 that called 25for the meeting of the joint review board within 14 days of 26notice of public hearing to affected taxing districts is   HB1142- 9 -LRB104 04065 RTM 14089 b1deemed to be in compliance with the notice, meeting, and 2public hearing provisions of the Act. Such notice shall also 3advise the taxing bodies represented on the joint review board 4of the time and place of the first meeting of the board. 5Additional meetings of the board shall be held upon the call of 6any member. The municipality seeking designation of the 7redevelopment project area shall provide administrative 8support to the board.9    The board shall review (i) the public record, planning 10documents and proposed ordinances approving the redevelopment 11plan and project and (ii) proposed amendments to the 12redevelopment plan or additions of parcels of property to the 13redevelopment project area to be adopted by the municipality. 14As part of its deliberations, the board may hold additional 15hearings on the proposal. A board's recommendation shall be an 16advisory, non-binding recommendation. The recommendation shall 17be adopted by a majority of those members present and voting. 18The recommendations shall be submitted to the municipality 19within 30 days after convening of the board. Failure of the 20board to submit its report on a timely basis shall not be cause 21to delay the public hearing or any other step in the process of 22designating or amending the redevelopment project area but 23shall be deemed to constitute approval by the joint review 24board of the matters before it.25    The board shall base its recommendation to approve or 26disapprove the redevelopment plan and the designation of the   HB1142- 10 -LRB104 04065 RTM 14089 b1redevelopment project area or the amendment of the 2redevelopment plan or addition of parcels of property to the 3redevelopment project area on the basis of the redevelopment 4project area and redevelopment plan satisfying the plan 5requirements, the eligibility criteria defined in Section 611-74.4-3, and the objectives of this Act.7    The board shall issue a written report describing why the 8redevelopment plan and project area or the amendment thereof 9meets or fails to meet one or more of the objectives of this 10Act and both the plan requirements and the eligibility 11criteria defined in Section 11-74.4-3. In the event the Board 12does not file a report it shall be presumed that these taxing 13bodies find the redevelopment project area and redevelopment 14plan satisfy the objectives of this Act and the plan 15requirements and eligibility criteria.16    If the board recommends rejection of the matters before 17it, the municipality will have 30 days within which to 18resubmit the plan or amendment. During this period, the 19municipality will meet and confer with the board and attempt 20to resolve those issues set forth in the board's written 21report that led to the rejection of the plan or amendment.22    Notwithstanding the resubmission set forth above, the 23municipality may commence the scheduled public hearing and 24either adjourn the public hearing or continue the public 25hearing until a date certain. Prior to continuing any public 26hearing to a date certain, the municipality shall announce   HB1142- 11 -LRB104 04065 RTM 14089 b1during the public hearing the time, date, and location for the 2reconvening of the public hearing. Any changes to the 3redevelopment plan necessary to satisfy the issues set forth 4in the joint review board report shall be the subject of a 5public hearing before the hearing is adjourned if the changes 6would (1) substantially affect the general land uses proposed 7in the redevelopment plan, (2) substantially change the nature 8of or extend the life of the redevelopment project, or (3) 9increase the number of inhabited residential units to be 10displaced from the redevelopment project area, as measured 11from the time of creation of the redevelopment project area, 12to a total of more than 10. Changes to the redevelopment plan 13necessary to satisfy the issues set forth in the joint review 14board report shall not require any further notice or convening 15of a joint review board meeting, except that any changes to the 16redevelopment plan that would add additional parcels of 17property to the proposed redevelopment project area shall be 18subject to the notice, public hearing, and joint review board 19meeting requirements established for such changes by 20subsection (a) of Section 11-74.4-5.21    In the event that the municipality and the board are 22unable to resolve these differences, or in the event that the 23resubmitted plan or amendment is rejected by the board, the 24municipality may proceed with the plan or amendment, but only 25upon a three-fifths vote of the corporate authority 26responsible for approval of the plan or amendment, excluding   HB1142- 12 -LRB104 04065 RTM 14089 b1positions of members that are vacant and those members that 2are ineligible to vote because of conflicts of interest.3    (c) After a municipality has by ordinance approved a 4redevelopment plan and designated a redevelopment project 5area, the plan may be amended and additional properties may be 6added to the redevelopment project area only as herein 7provided.

Such notice shall also 3advise the taxing bodies represented on the joint review board 4of the time and place of the first meeting of the board. 5Additional meetings of the board shall be held upon the call of 6any member. The municipality seeking designation of the 7redevelopment project area shall provide administrative 8support to the board.9    The board shall review (i) the public record, planning 10documents and proposed ordinances approving the redevelopment 11plan and project and (ii) proposed amendments to the 12redevelopment plan or additions of parcels of property to the 13redevelopment project area to be adopted by the municipality. 14As part of its deliberations, the board may hold additional 15hearings on the proposal. A board's recommendation shall be an 16advisory, non-binding recommendation. The recommendation shall 17be adopted by a majority of those members present and voting. 18The recommendations shall be submitted to the municipality 19within 30 days after convening of the board. Failure of the 20board to submit its report on a timely basis shall not be cause 21to delay the public hearing or any other step in the process of 22designating or amending the redevelopment project area but 23shall be deemed to constitute approval by the joint review 24board of the matters before it.25    The board shall base its recommendation to approve or 26disapprove the redevelopment plan and the designation of the   HB1142- 10 -LRB104 04065 RTM 14089 b1redevelopment project area or the amendment of the 2redevelopment plan or addition of parcels of property to the 3redevelopment project area on the basis of the redevelopment 4project area and redevelopment plan satisfying the plan 5requirements, the eligibility criteria defined in Section 611-74.4-3, and the objectives of this Act.7    The board shall issue a written report describing why the 8redevelopment plan and project area or the amendment thereof 9meets or fails to meet one or more of the objectives of this 10Act and both the plan requirements and the eligibility 11criteria defined in Section 11-74.4-3. In the event the Board 12does not file a report it shall be presumed that these taxing 13bodies find the redevelopment project area and redevelopment 14plan satisfy the objectives of this Act and the plan 15requirements and eligibility criteria.16    If the board recommends rejection of the matters before 17it, the municipality will have 30 days within which to 18resubmit the plan or amendment. During this period, the 19municipality will meet and confer with the board and attempt 20to resolve those issues set forth in the board's written 21report that led to the rejection of the plan or amendment.22    Notwithstanding the resubmission set forth above, the 23municipality may commence the scheduled public hearing and 24either adjourn the public hearing or continue the public 25hearing until a date certain. Prior to continuing any public 26hearing to a date certain, the municipality shall announce   HB1142- 11 -LRB104 04065 RTM 14089 b1during the public hearing the time, date, and location for the 2reconvening of the public hearing. Any changes to the 3redevelopment plan necessary to satisfy the issues set forth 4in the joint review board report shall be the subject of a 5public hearing before the hearing is adjourned if the changes 6would (1) substantially affect the general land uses proposed 7in the redevelopment plan, (2) substantially change the nature 8of or extend the life of the redevelopment project, or (3) 9increase the number of inhabited residential units to be 10displaced from the redevelopment project area, as measured 11from the time of creation of the redevelopment project area, 12to a total of more than 10. Changes to the redevelopment plan 13necessary to satisfy the issues set forth in the joint review 14board report shall not require any further notice or convening 15of a joint review board meeting, except that any changes to the 16redevelopment plan that would add additional parcels of 17property to the proposed redevelopment project area shall be 18subject to the notice, public hearing, and joint review board 19meeting requirements established for such changes by 20subsection (a) of Section 11-74.4-5.21    In the event that the municipality and the board are 22unable to resolve these differences, or in the event that the 23resubmitted plan or amendment is rejected by the board, the 24municipality may proceed with the plan or amendment, but only 25upon a three-fifths vote of the corporate authority 26responsible for approval of the plan or amendment, excluding   HB1142- 12 -LRB104 04065 RTM 14089 b1positions of members that are vacant and those members that 2are ineligible to vote because of conflicts of interest.3    (c) After a municipality has by ordinance approved a 4redevelopment plan and designated a redevelopment project 5area, the plan may be amended and additional properties may be 6added to the redevelopment project area only as herein 7provided. Amendments which (1) add additional parcels of 8property to the proposed redevelopment project area, (2) 9substantially affect the general land uses proposed in the 10redevelopment plan, (3) substantially change the nature of the 11redevelopment project, (4) increase the total estimated 12redevelopment project costs set out in the redevelopment plan 13by more than 5% after adjustment for inflation from the date 14the plan was adopted, (5) add additional redevelopment project 15costs to the itemized list of redevelopment project costs set 16out in the redevelopment plan, or (6) increase the number of 17inhabited residential units to be displaced from the 18redevelopment project area, as measured from the time of 19creation of the redevelopment project area, to a total of more 20than 10, shall be made only after the municipality gives 21notice, convenes a joint review board, and conducts a public 22hearing pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Section 23and in Section 11-74.4-6 of this Act.
