The 22Commission shall receive funding for the scholarships through 23appropriations from the Optometric Licensing and Disciplinary 24Board Fund. If in any year the number of qualified applicants 25exceeds the number of scholarships to be awarded, the 26Commission shall give priority in awarding scholarships to   HB2791- 33 -LRB104 10549 LNS 20625 b1students demonstrating exceptional merit and who are in 2financial need. A scholarship shall be in the amount of $5,000 3each year applicable to tuition and fees.4    (d) The total amount of scholarship assistance awarded by 5the Commission under this Section to an individual in any 6given fiscal year, when added to other financial assistance 7awarded to that individual for that year, shall not exceed the 8cost of attendance at the institution at which the student is 9enrolled.10    (e) A recipient may receive up to 8 semesters or 12 11quarters of scholarship assistance under this Section.12    (f) Subject to a separate appropriation made for such 13purposes, payment of any scholarship awarded under this 14Section shall be determined by the Commission.

If funds 7are insufficient to provide all qualified applicants with a 8scholarship as authorized by this Section, the Commission 9shall allocate the available scholarship funds for that fiscal 10year to qualified applicants who submit a complete application 11on or before a date specified by the Commission, based on the 12following order of priority:13        (1) firstly, to students who received a scholarship 14    under this Section in the prior academic year and who 15    remain eligible for a scholarship under this Section;16        (2) secondly, to new, qualified applicants who are 17    members of a racial minority, as defined in subsection 18    (c); and19        (3) finally, to other new, qualified applicants in 20    accordance with this Section. 21    (c) Scholarships awarded under this Section shall be 22issued pursuant to rules adopted by the Commission. In 23awarding scholarships, the Commission shall give priority to 24those applicants who are members of a racial minority. Racial 25minorities are underrepresented as school social workers in 26elementary and secondary schools in this State, and the   HB2791- 37 -LRB104 10549 LNS 20625 b1General Assembly finds that it is in the interest of this State 2to provide them with priority consideration for programs that 3encourage their participation in this field and thereby foster 4a profession that is more reflective of the diversity of 5Illinois students and the parents they will serve. A more 6reflective workforce in school social work allows improved 7outcomes for students and a better utilization of services. 8Therefore, the Commission shall give priority to those 9applicants who are members of a racial minority. In this 10subsection (c), "racial minority" means a person who is a 11citizen of the United States or a lawful permanent resident of 12the United States and who is:13        (1) Black (a person having origins in any of the black 14    racial groups in Africa);15        (2) Hispanic (a person of Spanish or Portuguese 16    culture with origins in Mexico, South or Central America, 17    or the Caribbean Islands, regardless of race);18        (3) Asian American (a person having origins in any of 19    the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the 20    Indian Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands); or21        (4) American Indian or Alaskan Native (a person having 22    origins in any of the original peoples of North America). 23    (d) Each scholarship shall be applied to the payment of 24tuition and mandatory fees at the University of Illinois, 25Southern Illinois University, Chicago State University, 26Eastern Illinois University, Governors State University,   HB2791- 38 -LRB104 10549 LNS 20625 b1Illinois State University, Northeastern Illinois University, 2Northern Illinois University, and Western Illinois University. 3Each scholarship may be applied to pay tuition and mandatory 4fees required to obtain an Illinois Professional Educator 5License with an endorsement in School Social Work.6    (e) The Commission shall make tuition and fee payments 7directly to the qualified institution of higher learning that 8the applicant attends.9    (f) Any person accepting who has accepted a scholarship 10under this Section must sign an agreement pledging (i) that, 11within one year after graduation or termination of enrollment 12in a Post-Master of Social Work Professional Education License 13with an endorsement in School Social Work program, the 14recipient will begin working as a school social worker at a 15public or nonpublic not-for-profit preschool, elementary 16school, or secondary school located in this State for at least 172 of the 5 years immediately following that graduation or 18termination and (ii) that the recipient shall, upon request of 19the Commission, provide the Commission with evidence that the 20recipient is fulfilling or has fulfilled the terms of the work 21agreement provided for in this subsection. , excluding, 22however, from the computation of that 5-year period: (i) any 23time up to 3 years spent in the military service, whether such 24service occurs before or after the person graduates; (ii) the 25time that person is a person with a temporary total disability 26for a period of time not to exceed 3 years, as established by   HB2791- 39 -LRB104 10549 LNS 20625 b1the sworn affidavit of a qualified physician; and (iii) the 2time that person is seeking and unable to find full-time 3employment as a school social worker at a State public or 4nonpublic not-for-profit preschool, elementary school, or 5secondary school.6    (g) (Blank).

If in any year the number of qualified applicants 25exceeds the number of scholarships to be awarded, the 26Commission shall give priority in awarding scholarships to   HB2791- 33 -LRB104 10549 LNS 20625 b1students demonstrating exceptional merit and who are in 2financial need. A scholarship shall be in the amount of $5,000 3each year applicable to tuition and fees.4    (d) The total amount of scholarship assistance awarded by 5the Commission under this Section to an individual in any 6given fiscal year, when added to other financial assistance 7awarded to that individual for that year, shall not exceed the 8cost of attendance at the institution at which the student is 9enrolled.10    (e) A recipient may receive up to 8 semesters or 12 11quarters of scholarship assistance under this Section.12    (f) Subject to a separate appropriation made for such 13purposes, payment of any scholarship awarded under this 14Section shall be determined by the Commission.

If funds 7are insufficient to provide all qualified applicants with a 8scholarship as authorized by this Section, the Commission 9shall allocate the available scholarship funds for that fiscal 10year to qualified applicants who submit a complete application 11on or before a date specified by the Commission, based on the 12following order of priority:13        (1) firstly, to students who received a scholarship 14    under this Section in the prior academic year and who 15    remain eligible for a scholarship under this Section;16        (2) secondly, to new, qualified applicants who are 17    members of a racial minority, as defined in subsection 18    (c); and19        (3) finally, to other new, qualified applicants in 20    accordance with this Section. 21    (c) Scholarships awarded under this Section shall be 22issued pursuant to rules adopted by the Commission.

A more 6reflective workforce in school social work allows improved 7outcomes for students and a better utilization of services. 8Therefore, the Commission shall give priority to those 9applicants who are members of a racial minority. In this 10subsection (c), "racial minority" means a person who is a 11citizen of the United States or a lawful permanent resident of 12the United States and who is:13        (1) Black (a person having origins in any of the black 14    racial groups in Africa);15        (2) Hispanic (a person of Spanish or Portuguese 16    culture with origins in Mexico, South or Central America, 17    or the Caribbean Islands, regardless of race);18        (3) Asian American (a person having origins in any of 19    the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the 20    Indian Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands); or21        (4) American Indian or Alaskan Native (a person having 22    origins in any of the original peoples of North America). 23    (d) Each scholarship shall be applied to the payment of 24tuition and mandatory fees at the University of Illinois, 25Southern Illinois University, Chicago State University, 26Eastern Illinois University, Governors State University,   HB2791- 38 -LRB104 10549 LNS 20625 b1Illinois State University, Northeastern Illinois University, 2Northern Illinois University, and Western Illinois University. 3Each scholarship may be applied to pay tuition and mandatory 4fees required to obtain an Illinois Professional Educator 5License with an endorsement in School Social Work.6    (e) The Commission shall make tuition and fee payments 7directly to the qualified institution of higher learning that 8the applicant attends.9    (f) Any person accepting who has accepted a scholarship 10under this Section must sign an agreement pledging (i) that, 11within one year after graduation or termination of enrollment 12in a Post-Master of Social Work Professional Education License 13with an endorsement in School Social Work program, the 14recipient will begin working as a school social worker at a 15public or nonpublic not-for-profit preschool, elementary 16school, or secondary school located in this State for at least 172 of the 5 years immediately following that graduation or 18termination and (ii) that the recipient shall, upon request of 19the Commission, provide the Commission with evidence that the 20recipient is fulfilling or has fulfilled the terms of the work 21agreement provided for in this subsection. , excluding, 22however, from the computation of that 5-year period: (i) any 23time up to 3 years spent in the military service, whether such 24service occurs before or after the person graduates; (ii) the 25time that person is a person with a temporary total disability 26for a period of time not to exceed 3 years, as established by   HB2791- 39 -LRB104 10549 LNS 20625 b1the sworn affidavit of a qualified physician; and (iii) the 2time that person is seeking and unable to find full-time 3employment as a school social worker at a State public or 4nonpublic not-for-profit preschool, elementary school, or 5secondary school.6    (g) (Blank).
