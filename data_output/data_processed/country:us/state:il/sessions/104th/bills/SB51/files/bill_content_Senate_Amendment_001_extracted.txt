The response period may be extended once by 45 22    additional days if reasonably necessary, taking into 23    consideration the complexity and number of the consumer's 24    requests, as long as the controller informs the consumer 25    of any extension within the initial 45-day response 26    period, together with the reason for the extension;   10400SB0051sam001- 15 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1        (2) if a controller declines to take action regarding 2    the consumer's request, the controller shall inform the 3    consumer without undue delay, but no later than 45 days 4    after receipt of the request of the justification for 5    declining to take action and instructions on how to appeal 6    that decision; 7        (3) information provided in response to a consumer 8    request shall be provided by a controller free of charge, 9    up to twice annually per consumer. If requests from a 10    consumer are excessive, repetitive, technically 11    infeasible, or manifestly unfounded, the controller may 12    charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the 13    administrative costs of complying with the request or 14    decline to act on the request. The controller bears the 15    burden of demonstrating the excessive, repetitive, 16    technically infeasible, or manifestly unfounded nature of 17    the request; 18        (4) if a controller is unable to authenticate the 19    request using commercially reasonable efforts, the 20    controller is not required to comply with a request to 21    initiate an action under this Section and may request that 22    the consumer provide additional information reasonably 23    necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's 24    request; and 25        (5) a controller that has obtained personal data about 26    a consumer from a source other than the consumer is deemed   10400SB0051sam001- 16 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    in compliance with a consumer's request to delete such 2    data under this Section by: 3            (A) retaining a record of the deletion request and 4        the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring 5        the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the 6        business' records and not using the retained data for 7        any other purpose under the provisions of this Act; or 8            (B) opting the consumer out of the processing of 9        the personal data for any other purpose unless 10        authorized elsewhere in this Act. 11    (d) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer 12to appeal the controller's refusal to take action on a request 13within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's 14receipt of the decision under of this Section. The appeal 15process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the 16process for submitting requests to initiate action under this 17Section. Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, a controller 18shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not 19taken in response to the appeal, including a written 20explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is 21denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an 22online mechanism, if available, or other method through which 23the consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a 24complaint. 25    Section 20. Controller's duties and responsibilities.   10400SB0051sam001- 17 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    (a) A controller shall: 2        (1) limit the collection of personal data to what is 3    adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation 4    to the purposes for which the data is processed as 5    disclosed to the consumer; 6        (2) except as otherwise provided in this Section, not 7    process personal data for purposes that are neither 8    reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed 9    purposes for which the personal data is processed as 10    disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains 11    the consumer's consent; 12        (3) establish, implement, and maintain reasonable 13    administrative, technical, and physical data security 14    practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and 15    accessibility of personal data. The data security 16    practices shall be appropriate to the volume and nature of 17    the personal data at issue; 18        (4) not process personal data in violation of State 19    and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination 20    against consumers. A controller shall not discriminate 21    against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer 22    rights contained this Act, including denying goods or 23    services, charging different prices or rates for goods or 24    services, or providing a different level of quality of 25    goods and services to the consumer. Nothing in this 26    paragraph may be construed to require a controller to   10400SB0051sam001- 18 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    provide a product or service that requires the personal 2    data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or 3    maintain or to prohibit a controller from offering a 4    different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of 5    goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods 6    or services for no fee, if the offer is related to a 7    consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, 8    rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card 9    program; and 10        (5) not process sensitive data concerning a consumer 11    without obtaining the consumer's consent, or, in the case 12    of the processing of sensitive data collected from a known 13    child, process the data in accordance with the federal 14    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. 15    (b) Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind 16that purports to waive or limit in any way consumer rights 17under this Act is deemed contrary to public policy and is void 18and unenforceable. 19    (c) Controllers shall provide consumers with a reasonably 20accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that 21includes: 22        (1) the categories of personal data processed by the 23    controller; 24        (2) the purpose for processing personal data; 25        (3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights 26    under this Act, including how a consumer may appeal a   10400SB0051sam001- 19 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    controller's decision regarding a consumer's request; 2        (4) the categories of personal data that the 3    controller shares with third parties, if any; and 4        (5) the categories of third parties, if any, with whom 5    the controller shares personal data. 6    (d) If a controller sells personal data to third parties 7or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the 8controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such 9activity, as well as the manner in which a consumer may 10exercise the right to opt out of processing. 11    (e) A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a 12privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for 13consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer 14rights under this Act. The different ways to submit a request 15by a consumer must consider the ways in which consumers 16normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and 17reliable communication of the requests, and the ability of the 18controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making 19the request. Controllers may not require a consumer to create 20a new account to exercise consumer rights under this Act but 21may require a consumer to use an existing account. 22    Section 25. Processor duties and responsibilities. 23    (a) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a 24controller and shall assist the controller in meeting its 25obligations under this Act. This assistance shall include:   10400SB0051sam001- 20 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1        (1) supporting the controller's obligation to respond 2    to consumer rights requests under this Act by taking into 3    account the nature of processing and the information 4    available to the processor using appropriate technical and 5    organizational measures as reasonably practicable; 6        (2) assisting the controller in meeting the 7    controller's obligations for the security of processing 8    the personal data and for the notification of a breach of 9    the security of the system of the processor under 10    applicable State law by taking into account the nature of 11    processing and the information available to the processor; 12    and 13        (3) providing necessary information to enable the 14    controller to conduct and document data protection 15    assessments under this Act. 16    (b) A contract between a controller and a processor 17governs the processor's data processing procedures for 18processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract 19shall be binding and shall clearly set forth instructions for 20processing personal data, the nature and purpose of 21processing, the type of data subject to processing, the 22duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both 23parties. The contract shall also include requirements that the 24processor shall: 25        (1) ensure that each person processing personal data 26    is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to   10400SB0051sam001- 21 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    the data; 2        (2) at the controller's direction, delete or return 3    all personal data to the controller as requested at the 4    end of the provision of services, unless retention of the 5    personal data is required by law; 6        (3) upon the reasonable request of the controller, 7    make available to the controller all information in its 8    possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's 9    compliance with the obligations in this Act; 10        (4) allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by 11    the controller or the controller's designated assessor. 12    Alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified 13    and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the 14    processor's policies and technical and organizational 15    measures in support of the obligations in this Act using 16    an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework 17    and assessment procedure for assessments. The processor 18    shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller 19    upon request; and 20        (5) engage any subcontractor under a written contract 21    under this Section that requires the subcontractor to meet 22    the obligations of the processor for personal data. 23    (c) Nothing in this Section may be construed to relieve a 24controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on it by 25virtue of its role in a processing relationship as required 26under this Act.   10400SB0051sam001- 22 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    (d) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller 2or processor for a specific processing of data is a fact-based 3determination that depends upon the context in which personal 4data is to be processed. A processor that continues to adhere 5to a controller's instructions for a specific processing of 6personal data remains a processor. 7    Section 30. Required data protection impact assessment. 8    (a) Controllers shall conduct and document a data 9protection impact assessment of each of the following 10processing activities involving personal data: 11        (1) the processing of personal data for the purposes 12    of targeted advertising; 13        (2) the processing of personal data for the purposes 14    of selling of personal data; 15        (3) the processing of personal data for the purposes 16    of profiling, if the profiling presents a reasonably 17    foreseeable risk of: 18            (A) unfair or deceptive treatment of consumers or 19        disparate impact on consumers; 20            (B) financial, physical, or reputational injury to 21        consumers; 22            (C) a physical or other intrusion upon consumers' 23        solitude or seclusion or their private affairs or 24        concerns if an intrusion would be offensive to a 25        reasonable person; or   10400SB0051sam001- 23 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1            (D) other substantial injury to consumers; 2        (4) the processing of sensitive data; and 3        (5) any processing of personal data that presents a 4    heightened risk of harm to consumers. 5    (b) Data protection impact assessments conducted under 6this Section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may 7flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing, to the 8controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public 9against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer 10associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards 11that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risk. The 12use of deidentified data and the reasonable expectations of 13consumers, as well as the context of the processing of 14personal data and the relationship between the controller and 15the consumer whose personal data will be processed, shall be 16factored into this assessment by the controller. 17    (c) The Attorney General may request that a controller 18disclose any data protection impact assessment that is 19relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney 20General, and the controller shall make the data protection 21impact assessment available to the Attorney General.

Nothing in this Act may be construed to prevent a 6controller or processor from providing personal data 7concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary 8privilege under State laws as part of a privileged 9communication. 10    (d) A controller or processor that discloses personal data 11to a third-party controller or processor, in compliance with 12the requirements of this Act, is not in violation of this Act 13if the third-party controller or processor that receives and 14processes such personal data is in violation of this Act; 15provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal data, 16the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual 17knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a violation. A 18third-party controller or processor receiving personal data 19from a controller or processor in compliance with the 20requirements of this Act is also not in violation of this Act 21for the transgressions of the controller or processor from 22which it receives such personal data. 23    (e) Nothing in this Act may be construed as an obligation 24imposed on controllers and processors that adversely affects 25the privacy or other rights or freedoms of any persons, 26including, but not limited to, the right of free speech under   10400SB0051sam001- 30 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or 2applies to the processing of personal data by a person in the 3course of a purely personal or household activity. 4    (f) Personal data processed by a controller under this 5Section may not be processed for any purpose other than those 6expressly listed unless otherwise allowed by this Act. 7Personal data processed by a controller under this Section may 8be processed to the extent that such processing is: 9        (1) reasonably necessary and proportionate to the 10    purposes listed in this Section; and 11        (2) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is 12    necessary for the specific purposes listed in this 13    Section. Personal data collected, used, or retained under 14    this Section shall, if applicable, take into account the 15    nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use, or 16    retention. The data shall be subject to reasonable 17    administrative, technical, and physical measures to 18    protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility 19    of personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable 20    risks of harm to consumers relating to the collection, 21    use, or retention of personal data. 22    (g) If a controller processes personal data under an 23exemption in this Section, the controller bears the burden of 24demonstrating that the processing qualifies for the exemption 25and complies with the requirements in this Section. 26    (h) Processing personal data for the purposes expressly   10400SB0051sam001- 31 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1identified in this Section does not by itself make an entity a 2controller with respect to such processing. 3    Section 45.

16        (9) information used only for public health activities 17    and purposes as authorized by HIPAA; 18        (10) the collection, maintenance, disclosure, sale, 19    communication, or use of any personal information bearing 20    on a consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, credit 21    capacity, character, general reputation, personal 22    characteristics, or mode of living by a consumer reporting 23    agency, furnisher, or user that provides information for 24    use in a consumer report, and by a user of a consumer 25    report, but only to the extent that the activity is 26    regulated by and authorized under the federal Fair Credit   10400SB0051sam001- 12 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    Reporting Act; 2        (11) personal data collected, processed, sold, or 3    disclosed in compliance with the federal Driver's Privacy 4    Protection Act of 1994; 5        (12) personal data regulated by the federal Family 6    Educational Rights and Privacy Act;

15            (B) as the emergency contact information of an 16        individual used for emergency contact purposes; or 17            (C) that is necessary to administer benefits for 18        another individual and used for the purposes of 19        administering those benefits; 20        (15) data processed by a public utility, an affiliate 21    of a public utility, or a holding company system organized 22    specifically for the purpose of providing goods or 23    services to a public utility. For purposes of this 24    paragraph, "holding company system" means 2 or more 25    affiliated persons, one or more of which is a public 26    utility; and   10400SB0051sam001- 13 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1        (16) personal data collected and used for purposes of 2    federal policy under the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic 3    Act of 2005. 4    (d) Controllers and processors that comply with the 5verifiable parental consent requirements of the Children's 6Online Privacy Protection Act are deemed compliant with any 7obligation to obtain parental consent under this Act. 8    Section 15. Consumer rights and remedies. 9    (a) A consumer may invoke the consumer rights authorized 10under this Section at any time by submitting a request to a 11controller, via the means specified by the controller under 12Section 20, specifying the consumer rights the consumer wishes 13to invoke. A child's parent or legal guardian may invoke these 14consumer rights on behalf of the child regarding processing 15personal data belonging to the child. 16    (b) A controller shall comply with an authenticated 17consumer request to exercise the right to: 18        (1) confirm whether a controller is processing the 19    consumer's personal data and to access the personal data, 20    unless the confirmation and access would require the 21    controller to reveal a trade secret; 22        (2) correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal 23    data, taking into account the nature of the personal data 24    and the purposes of processing the data; 25        (3) delete personal data provided by or obtained about   10400SB0051sam001- 14 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    the consumer; 2        (4) obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data that 3    the consumer previously provided to the controller in a 4    portable and, to the extent technically practicable, 5    readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit 6    the data to another controller without hindrance, if the 7    processing is carried out by automated means. The 8    controller may not be required to reveal any trade 9    secrets; and 10        (5) opt out of the processing of personal data for 11    purposes of targeted advertising, the sale of personal 12    data, or profiling in furtherance of decisions that 13    produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning 14    the consumer. 15    (c) Except as otherwise provided in this Act, a controller 16shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise the 17consumer rights under this Section as follows: 18        (1) a controller shall respond to the consumer without 19    undue delay, but in all cases within 45 days of receipt of 20    the request submitted under the methods described in this 21    Section. The response period may be extended once by 45 22    additional days if reasonably necessary, taking into 23    consideration the complexity and number of the consumer's 24    requests, as long as the controller informs the consumer 25    of any extension within the initial 45-day response 26    period, together with the reason for the extension;   10400SB0051sam001- 15 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1        (2) if a controller declines to take action regarding 2    the consumer's request, the controller shall inform the 3    consumer without undue delay, but no later than 45 days 4    after receipt of the request of the justification for 5    declining to take action and instructions on how to appeal 6    that decision; 7        (3) information provided in response to a consumer 8    request shall be provided by a controller free of charge, 9    up to twice annually per consumer. If requests from a 10    consumer are excessive, repetitive, technically 11    infeasible, or manifestly unfounded, the controller may 12    charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the 13    administrative costs of complying with the request or 14    decline to act on the request. The controller bears the 15    burden of demonstrating the excessive, repetitive, 16    technically infeasible, or manifestly unfounded nature of 17    the request; 18        (4) if a controller is unable to authenticate the 19    request using commercially reasonable efforts, the 20    controller is not required to comply with a request to 21    initiate an action under this Section and may request that 22    the consumer provide additional information reasonably 23    necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's 24    request; and 25        (5) a controller that has obtained personal data about 26    a consumer from a source other than the consumer is deemed   10400SB0051sam001- 16 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    in compliance with a consumer's request to delete such 2    data under this Section by: 3            (A) retaining a record of the deletion request and 4        the minimum data necessary for the purpose of ensuring 5        the consumer's personal data remains deleted from the 6        business' records and not using the retained data for 7        any other purpose under the provisions of this Act; or 8            (B) opting the consumer out of the processing of 9        the personal data for any other purpose unless 10        authorized elsewhere in this Act. 11    (d) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer 12to appeal the controller's refusal to take action on a request 13within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's 14receipt of the decision under of this Section. The appeal 15process shall be conspicuously available and similar to the 16process for submitting requests to initiate action under this 17Section. Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, a controller 18shall inform the consumer in writing of any action taken or not 19taken in response to the appeal, including a written 20explanation of the reasons for the decisions. If the appeal is 21denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an 22online mechanism, if available, or other method through which 23the consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a 24complaint. 25    Section 20. Controller's duties and responsibilities.   10400SB0051sam001- 17 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    (a) A controller shall: 2        (1) limit the collection of personal data to what is 3    adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation 4    to the purposes for which the data is processed as 5    disclosed to the consumer; 6        (2) except as otherwise provided in this Section, not 7    process personal data for purposes that are neither 8    reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed 9    purposes for which the personal data is processed as 10    disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains 11    the consumer's consent; 12        (3) establish, implement, and maintain reasonable 13    administrative, technical, and physical data security 14    practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and 15    accessibility of personal data. The data security 16    practices shall be appropriate to the volume and nature of 17    the personal data at issue; 18        (4) not process personal data in violation of State 19    and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination 20    against consumers. A controller shall not discriminate 21    against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer 22    rights contained this Act, including denying goods or 23    services, charging different prices or rates for goods or 24    services, or providing a different level of quality of 25    goods and services to the consumer. Nothing in this 26    paragraph may be construed to require a controller to   10400SB0051sam001- 18 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    provide a product or service that requires the personal 2    data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or 3    maintain or to prohibit a controller from offering a 4    different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of 5    goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods 6    or services for no fee, if the offer is related to a 7    consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, 8    rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card 9    program; and 10        (5) not process sensitive data concerning a consumer 11    without obtaining the consumer's consent, or, in the case 12    of the processing of sensitive data collected from a known 13    child, process the data in accordance with the federal 14    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. 15    (b) Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind 16that purports to waive or limit in any way consumer rights 17under this Act is deemed contrary to public policy and is void 18and unenforceable. 19    (c) Controllers shall provide consumers with a reasonably 20accessible, clear, and meaningful privacy notice that 21includes: 22        (1) the categories of personal data processed by the 23    controller; 24        (2) the purpose for processing personal data; 25        (3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights 26    under this Act, including how a consumer may appeal a   10400SB0051sam001- 19 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    controller's decision regarding a consumer's request; 2        (4) the categories of personal data that the 3    controller shares with third parties, if any; and 4        (5) the categories of third parties, if any, with whom 5    the controller shares personal data. 6    (d) If a controller sells personal data to third parties 7or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the 8controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose such 9activity, as well as the manner in which a consumer may 10exercise the right to opt out of processing. 11    (e) A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a 12privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for 13consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer 14rights under this Act. The different ways to submit a request 15by a consumer must consider the ways in which consumers 16normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and 17reliable communication of the requests, and the ability of the 18controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making 19the request. Controllers may not require a consumer to create 20a new account to exercise consumer rights under this Act but 21may require a consumer to use an existing account. 22    Section 25. Processor duties and responsibilities. 23    (a) A processor shall adhere to the instructions of a 24controller and shall assist the controller in meeting its 25obligations under this Act. This assistance shall include:   10400SB0051sam001- 20 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1        (1) supporting the controller's obligation to respond 2    to consumer rights requests under this Act by taking into 3    account the nature of processing and the information 4    available to the processor using appropriate technical and 5    organizational measures as reasonably practicable; 6        (2) assisting the controller in meeting the 7    controller's obligations for the security of processing 8    the personal data and for the notification of a breach of 9    the security of the system of the processor under 10    applicable State law by taking into account the nature of 11    processing and the information available to the processor; 12    and 13        (3) providing necessary information to enable the 14    controller to conduct and document data protection 15    assessments under this Act. 16    (b) A contract between a controller and a processor 17governs the processor's data processing procedures for 18processing performed on behalf of the controller. The contract 19shall be binding and shall clearly set forth instructions for 20processing personal data, the nature and purpose of 21processing, the type of data subject to processing, the 22duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both 23parties. The contract shall also include requirements that the 24processor shall: 25        (1) ensure that each person processing personal data 26    is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to   10400SB0051sam001- 21 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    the data; 2        (2) at the controller's direction, delete or return 3    all personal data to the controller as requested at the 4    end of the provision of services, unless retention of the 5    personal data is required by law; 6        (3) upon the reasonable request of the controller, 7    make available to the controller all information in its 8    possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's 9    compliance with the obligations in this Act; 10        (4) allow and cooperate with reasonable assessments by 11    the controller or the controller's designated assessor. 12    Alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified 13    and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the 14    processor's policies and technical and organizational 15    measures in support of the obligations in this Act using 16    an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework 17    and assessment procedure for assessments. The processor 18    shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller 19    upon request; and 20        (5) engage any subcontractor under a written contract 21    under this Section that requires the subcontractor to meet 22    the obligations of the processor for personal data. 23    (c) Nothing in this Section may be construed to relieve a 24controller or processor from the liabilities imposed on it by 25virtue of its role in a processing relationship as required 26under this Act.   10400SB0051sam001- 22 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    (d) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller 2or processor for a specific processing of data is a fact-based 3determination that depends upon the context in which personal 4data is to be processed. A processor that continues to adhere 5to a controller's instructions for a specific processing of 6personal data remains a processor. 7    Section 30. Required data protection impact assessment. 8    (a) Controllers shall conduct and document a data 9protection impact assessment of each of the following 10processing activities involving personal data: 11        (1) the processing of personal data for the purposes 12    of targeted advertising; 13        (2) the processing of personal data for the purposes 14    of selling of personal data; 15        (3) the processing of personal data for the purposes 16    of profiling, if the profiling presents a reasonably 17    foreseeable risk of: 18            (A) unfair or deceptive treatment of consumers or 19        disparate impact on consumers; 20            (B) financial, physical, or reputational injury to 21        consumers; 22            (C) a physical or other intrusion upon consumers' 23        solitude or seclusion or their private affairs or 24        concerns if an intrusion would be offensive to a 25        reasonable person; or   10400SB0051sam001- 23 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1            (D) other substantial injury to consumers; 2        (4) the processing of sensitive data; and 3        (5) any processing of personal data that presents a 4    heightened risk of harm to consumers. 5    (b) Data protection impact assessments conducted under 6this Section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may 7flow, directly and indirectly, from the processing, to the 8controller, the consumer, other stakeholders, and the public 9against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer 10associated with such processing, as mitigated by safeguards 11that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risk. The 12use of deidentified data and the reasonable expectations of 13consumers, as well as the context of the processing of 14personal data and the relationship between the controller and 15the consumer whose personal data will be processed, shall be 16factored into this assessment by the controller. 17    (c) The Attorney General may request that a controller 18disclose any data protection impact assessment that is 19relevant to an investigation conducted by the Attorney 20General, and the controller shall make the data protection 21impact assessment available to the Attorney General. The 22Attorney General may evaluate the data protection impact 23assessments for compliance with the requirements of this Act. 24    (d) Data protection impact assessments are confidential 25and exempt from disclosure, public inspection, and copying 26under the Freedom of Information Act.   10400SB0051sam001- 24 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    (e) The disclosure of a data protection impact assessment 2under a request from the Attorney General under this Section 3does not constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege 4or work product protection of the assessment and any 5information contained in the assessment. 6    (f) A single data protection assessment may address a 7comparable set of processing operations that include similar 8activities. 9    (g) Data protection assessments conducted by a controller 10for the purpose of compliance with other laws or regulations 11may comply under this Section if the assessments have a 12reasonably comparable scope and effect. 13    (h) Data protection assessment requirements apply to 14processing activities created or generated on or after June 1, 152027. 16    Section 35. Controller in possession of de-identified 17data. 18    (a) The controller in possession of deidentified data 19shall: 20        (1) take reasonable measures to ensure the data cannot 21    be associated with a natural person; 22        (2) publicly commit to maintaining and using 23    deidentified data without attempting to reidentify the 24    data; and 25        (3) contractually obligate any recipients of the   10400SB0051sam001- 25 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    deidentified data to comply with this Act. 2    (b) Nothing in this Act may be construed to require a 3controller or processor to: 4        (1) reidentify deidentified data or pseudonymous data; 5    or 6        (2) maintain data in identifiable form or collect, 7    obtain, retain, or access any data or technology to be 8    capable of associating an authenticated consumer request 9    with personal data. 10    (c) Nothing in this Act may be construed to require a 11controller or processor to comply with an authenticated 12consumer rights request under Section 15 if: 13        (1) the controller is not reasonably capable of 14    associating the request with the personal data or it would 15    be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate 16    the request with the personal data; 17        (2) the controller does not use the personal data to 18    recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the 19    subject of the personal data, or associate the personal 20    data with other personal data about the same specific 21    consumer; and 22        (3) the controller does not sell the personal data to 23    any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the 24    personal data to any third party other than a processor, 25    except as otherwise permitted in this Section. 26    (d) The consumer rights contained in this Act do not apply   10400SB0051sam001- 26 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1to pseudonymous data in cases in which the controller is able 2to demonstrate any information necessary to identify the 3consumer is kept separately and is subject to appropriate 4technical and organizational measures to ensure that the 5personal data is not attributed to an identified or 6identifiable natural person. 7    (e) A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or 8de-identified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to 9monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which 10the pseudonymous data or deidentified data is subject and take 11appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual 12commitments. 13    Section 40. Exceptions for controllers and processors. 14    (a) Nothing in this Act may be construed to restrict a 15controller's or processor's ability to: 16        (1) comply with federal, State, or local laws or 17    regulations; 18        (2) comply with a civil, criminal, or regulatory 19    inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons by federal, 20    State, local, or other governmental authorities; 21        (3) cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning 22    conduct or activity that the controller or processor 23    reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, 24    State, or local laws, rules, or regulations; 25        (4) investigate, establish, exercise, prepare for, or   10400SB0051sam001- 27 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    defend legal claims; 2        (5) provide a product or service specifically 3    requested by a consumer or a parent or guardian of a known 4    child; 5        (6) perform a contract to which the consumer or parent 6    or guardian of a known child is a party, including 7    fulfilling the terms of a written warranty; 8        (7) take steps at the request of the consumer or 9    parent or guardian of a known child before entering into a 10    contract; 11        (8) take immediate steps to protect an interest that 12    is essential for the life or physical safety of the 13    consumer or of another natural person; 14        (9) prevent, detect, protect against, or respond to 15    security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, 16    malicious or deceptive activities, or any illegal 17    activity; preserve the integrity or security of systems; 18    or investigate, report, or prosecute those responsible for 19    any such action; 20        (10) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or 21    statistical research in the public interest that adheres 22    to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws and is 23    approved, monitored, and governed by an institutional 24    review board or similar independent oversight entities 25    that determine: 26            (A) if the deletion of the information is likely   10400SB0051sam001- 28 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1        to provide substantial benefits that do not 2        exclusively accrue to the controller; 3            (B) the expected benefits of the research outweigh 4        the privacy risks; and 5            (C) if the controller has implemented reasonable 6        safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with 7        research, including any risks associated with 8        reidentification; or 9        (11) assist another controller, processor, or third 10    party with any of the obligations under this Section. 11    (b) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors 12under this Act do not restrict a controller's or processor's 13ability to collect, use, or retain data to: 14        (1) conduct internal research to develop, improve, or 15    repair products, services, or technology; 16        (2) effectuate a product recall; 17        (3) identify and repair technical errors that impair 18    existing or intended functionality; or 19        (4) perform internal operations that are reasonably 20    aligned with the expectations of the consumer or 21    reasonably anticipated based on the consumer's existing 22    relationship with the controller or are otherwise 23    compatible with processing data in furtherance of the 24    provision of a product or service specifically requested 25    by a consumer or a parent or guardian of a known child or 26    the performance of a contract to which the consumer or a   10400SB0051sam001- 29 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1    parent or guardian of a known child is a party. 2    (c) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors 3under this Act do not apply to a controller or processor if 4compliance would violate an evidentiary privilege under State 5law. Nothing in this Act may be construed to prevent a 6controller or processor from providing personal data 7concerning a consumer to a person covered by an evidentiary 8privilege under State laws as part of a privileged 9communication. 10    (d) A controller or processor that discloses personal data 11to a third-party controller or processor, in compliance with 12the requirements of this Act, is not in violation of this Act 13if the third-party controller or processor that receives and 14processes such personal data is in violation of this Act; 15provided that, at the time of disclosing the personal data, 16the disclosing controller or processor did not have actual 17knowledge that the recipient intended to commit a violation. A 18third-party controller or processor receiving personal data 19from a controller or processor in compliance with the 20requirements of this Act is also not in violation of this Act 21for the transgressions of the controller or processor from 22which it receives such personal data. 23    (e) Nothing in this Act may be construed as an obligation 24imposed on controllers and processors that adversely affects 25the privacy or other rights or freedoms of any persons, 26including, but not limited to, the right of free speech under   10400SB0051sam001- 30 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or 2applies to the processing of personal data by a person in the 3course of a purely personal or household activity. 4    (f) Personal data processed by a controller under this 5Section may not be processed for any purpose other than those 6expressly listed unless otherwise allowed by this Act. 7Personal data processed by a controller under this Section may 8be processed to the extent that such processing is: 9        (1) reasonably necessary and proportionate to the 10    purposes listed in this Section; and 11        (2) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is 12    necessary for the specific purposes listed in this 13    Section. Personal data collected, used, or retained under 14    this Section shall, if applicable, take into account the 15    nature and purpose or purposes of such collection, use, or 16    retention. The data shall be subject to reasonable 17    administrative, technical, and physical measures to 18    protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility 19    of personal data and to reduce reasonably foreseeable 20    risks of harm to consumers relating to the collection, 21    use, or retention of personal data. 22    (g) If a controller processes personal data under an 23exemption in this Section, the controller bears the burden of 24demonstrating that the processing qualifies for the exemption 25and complies with the requirements in this Section. 26    (h) Processing personal data for the purposes expressly   10400SB0051sam001- 31 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1identified in this Section does not by itself make an entity a 2controller with respect to such processing. 3    Section 45. Enforcement by the Attorney General. 4    (a) The Attorney General has exclusive authority to 5enforce violations of this Act. The Attorney General may 6enforce this Act by bringing an action in the name of the State 7of Illinois on behalf of persons residing in this State. The 8Attorney General has all powers and duties granted to the 9Attorney General under State law to investigate and prosecute 10any violation of this Act. The Attorney General may demand any 11information, documents, or physical evidence from any 12controller or processor believed to be engaged in, or about to 13engage in, any violation of this Act. 14    (b) Before initiating any action for a violation of this 15Act, the Attorney General shall provide a controller or 16processor 30 days' written notice identifying the specific 17provisions of this Act that the Attorney General alleges have 18been or are being violated. If within the 30 days the 19controller or processor cures the noticed violation and 20provides the Attorney General an express written statement 21that the alleged violations have been cured and that no 22further violations will occur, no action for damages under 23this Section may be initiated against the controller or 24processor. 25    (c) If a controller or processor continues to violate this   10400SB0051sam001- 32 -LRB104 03750 JRC 23882 a1Act following the cure period under this Section or breaches 2an express written statement provided to the Attorney General 3under this Section, the Attorney General may initiate an 4action and seek damages for up to $7,500 for each continued 5violation under this Act. 6    (d) Nothing in this Act or any other law, regulation, or 7the equivalent may be construed as providing the basis for, or 8give rise to, a private right of action for violations of this 9Act. 10    (e) The Attorney General may recover reasonable expenses 11incurred in investigating and preparing the case, court costs, 12attorney's fees, and any other relief ordered by the court of 13any action initiated under this Act. 14    Section 50.
