Amend Senate Bill 1331 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 5. The Transitions in Education Act is amended by 5changing Section 130-5 as follows: 6    (110 ILCS 180/130-5)7    Sec. 130-5. Findings; policies. 8    (a) The General Assembly finds the following:9        (1) Teachers are the single most important in-school 10    factor in supporting student outcomes and success; yet, 11    Illinois is suffering from a profound teacher shortage 12    across the State.13        (2) To reverse this shortage, Illinois needs to 14    develop and invest in a robust and diverse educator 15    pipeline, addressing any barriers or gaps that limit high 16    quality candidates, particularly candidates of color, from   10400SB1331ham001- 2 -LRB104 07500 LNS 26983 a1    becoming teachers.2        (3) Illinois loses many high quality, diverse educator 3    candidates in postsecondary programs due to confusion or 4    lack of course transfer credits and course articulation 5    from Illinois's 2-year to 4-year institutions.6        (4) Lack of alignment and transferability of course 7    credits may often force candidates to spend additional 8    time and money to earn a degree or lead to an inability to 9    complete a degree.10        (5) In 1993, the Board of Higher Education, the 11    Illinois Community College Board, and the Transfer 12    Coordinators of Illinois Colleges and Universities brought 13    together faculty from public and independent, associate, 14    and baccalaureate degree-granting institutions across the 15    State to develop the Illinois Articulation Initiative 16    (IAI).17        (6) The goal of IAI is to facilitate the transfer of 18    courses from one participating college or university to 19    another in order to complete a baccalaureate degree.20        (7) The Student Transfer Achievement Reform (STAR) 21    Act, as mandated by subsection (b) of Section 25 of the 22    Act, is designed to facilitate transfer among Illinois 23    public institutions, particularly for students with a 24    completed Associate of Arts or an Associate of Science 25    degree.26        (8) While Illinois is a leading state for college   10400SB1331ham001- 3 -LRB104 07500 LNS 26983 a1    completion rates for adult learners and transfer students 2    from community colleges, it needs to increase the number 3    of high-quality postsecondary teaching credentials to meet 4    the demands of our schools and education workforce.5        (9) With the rising costs of higher education for 6    Illinois students and families, the State needs to ensure 7    to the maximize extent possible that community college 8    courses will transfer with full credit for the student and 9    be accepted at an Illinois public or private institution 10    as they pursue a baccalaureate degree in education.11        (10) Illinois can do this by improving transitions all 12    along the education pipeline; for postsecondary education, 13    this means strengthening articulation through stable 14    funding and the expansion of transfer tools, such as 15    Transferology and the IAI through development of an 16    objective measure of transfer and acceptance of credits in 17    education degrees.18        (11) The IAI Education Pathway can be modeled off of 19    existing IAI major pathways like Early Childhood Education 20    and Criminal Justice. 21    (b) The General Assembly encourages the Board of Higher 22Education, the State Board of Education, and the Illinois 23Community College Board, as part of the IAI, to do the 24following:25        (1) The Board of Higher Education, the State Board of 26    Education, and the Illinois Community College Board are   10400SB1331ham001- 4 -LRB104 07500 LNS 26983 a1    encouraged to jointly establish a task force for a Major 2    Panel in Education and identify respective recommended 3    major courses that would be accepted as credit toward the 4    education major at the receiving institutions.5        (2) As part of the report on the status of the Illinois 6    Articulation Initiative pursuant to Section 25 of the 7    Illinois Articulation Initiative Act, the Board of Higher 8    Education and the Illinois Community College Board are 9    encouraged to include in the annual report to the General 10    Assembly, the Governor, and the Illinois P-20 Council the 11    progress made on the task force on the Education Major 12    Panel.13        (3) The Board of Higher Education, the State Board of 14    Education, and the Illinois Community College Board are 15    encouraged to further promote and encourage the enrollment 16    of minority students into educator preparation programs, 17    such as the annual information session about the Minority 18    Teachers of Illinois scholarship program pursuant to 19    subsection (q) of Section 50 of the Higher Education 20    Student Assistance Act.21(Source: P.A. 101-654, eff. 3-8-21.) 22    "Section 10.

Amend Senate Bill 1331 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 5. The Transitions in Education Act is amended by 5changing Section 130-5 as follows: 6    (110 ILCS 180/130-5)7    Sec. 130-5. Findings; policies. 8    (a) The General Assembly finds the following:9        (1) Teachers are the single most important in-school 10    factor in supporting student outcomes and success; yet, 11    Illinois is suffering from a profound teacher shortage 12    across the State.13        (2) To reverse this shortage, Illinois needs to 14    develop and invest in a robust and diverse educator 15    pipeline, addressing any barriers or gaps that limit high 16    quality candidates, particularly candidates of color, from   10400SB1331ham001- 2 -LRB104 07500 LNS 26983 a1    becoming teachers.2        (3) Illinois loses many high quality, diverse educator 3    candidates in postsecondary programs due to confusion or 4    lack of course transfer credits and course articulation 5    from Illinois's 2-year to 4-year institutions.6        (4) Lack of alignment and transferability of course 7    credits may often force candidates to spend additional 8    time and money to earn a degree or lead to an inability to 9    complete a degree.10        (5) In 1993, the Board of Higher Education, the 11    Illinois Community College Board, and the Transfer 12    Coordinators of Illinois Colleges and Universities brought 13    together faculty from public and independent, associate, 14    and baccalaureate degree-granting institutions across the 15    State to develop the Illinois Articulation Initiative 16    (IAI).17        (6) The goal of IAI is to facilitate the transfer of 18    courses from one participating college or university to 19    another in order to complete a baccalaureate degree.20        (7) The Student Transfer Achievement Reform (STAR) 21    Act, as mandated by subsection (b) of Section 25 of the 22    Act, is designed to facilitate transfer among Illinois 23    public institutions, particularly for students with a 24    completed Associate of Arts or an Associate of Science 25    degree.26        (8) While Illinois is a leading state for college   10400SB1331ham001- 3 -LRB104 07500 LNS 26983 a1    completion rates for adult learners and transfer students 2    from community colleges, it needs to increase the number 3    of high-quality postsecondary teaching credentials to meet 4    the demands of our schools and education workforce.5        (9) With the rising costs of higher education for 6    Illinois students and families, the State needs to ensure 7    to the maximize extent possible that community college 8    courses will transfer with full credit for the student and 9    be accepted at an Illinois public or private institution 10    as they pursue a baccalaureate degree in education.11        (10) Illinois can do this by improving transitions all 12    along the education pipeline; for postsecondary education, 13    this means strengthening articulation through stable 14    funding and the expansion of transfer tools, such as 15    Transferology and the IAI through development of an 16    objective measure of transfer and acceptance of credits in 17    education degrees.18        (11) The IAI Education Pathway can be modeled off of 19    existing IAI major pathways like Early Childhood Education 20    and Criminal Justice. 21    (b) The General Assembly encourages the Board of Higher 22Education, the State Board of Education, and the Illinois 23Community College Board, as part of the IAI, to do the 24following:25        (1) The Board of Higher Education, the State Board of 26    Education, and the Illinois Community College Board are   10400SB1331ham001- 4 -LRB104 07500 LNS 26983 a1    encouraged to jointly establish a task force for a Major 2    Panel in Education and identify respective recommended 3    major courses that would be accepted as credit toward the 4    education major at the receiving institutions.5        (2) As part of the report on the status of the Illinois 6    Articulation Initiative pursuant to Section 25 of the 7    Illinois Articulation Initiative Act, the Board of Higher 8    Education and the Illinois Community College Board are 9    encouraged to include in the annual report to the General 10    Assembly, the Governor, and the Illinois P-20 Council the 11    progress made on the task force on the Education Major 12    Panel.13        (3) The Board of Higher Education, the State Board of 14    Education, and the Illinois Community College Board are 15    encouraged to further promote and encourage the enrollment 16    of minority students into educator preparation programs, 17    such as the annual information session about the Minority 18    Teachers of Illinois scholarship program pursuant to 19    subsection (q) of Section 50 of the Higher Education 20    Student Assistance Act.21(Source: P.A. 101-654, eff. 3-8-21.) 22    "Section 10. The Diversifying Higher Education Faculty in 23Illinois Act is amended by changing Sections 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 2410, and 11 and by adding Sections 7.5, 8.5, 11.10, and 11.15 as 25follows:   10400SB1331ham001- 5 -LRB104 07500 LNS 26983 a1    (110 ILCS 930/2)  (from Ch. 144, par. 2302)2    Sec. 2.
