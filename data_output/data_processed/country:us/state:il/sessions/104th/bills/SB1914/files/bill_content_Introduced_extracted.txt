Any action brought to extinguish the lien of 8    the association shall include the association as a party.9        (2) With respect to encumbrances executed prior to 10    August 30, 1984 or encumbrances executed subsequent to 11    August 30, 1984 which are neither bonafide first mortgages 12    nor trust deeds and which encumbrances contain a statement 13    of a mailing address in the State of Illinois where notice 14    may be mailed to the encumbrancer thereunder, if and 15    whenever and as often as the manager or board of managers 16    shall send, by United States certified or registered mail, 17    return receipt requested, to any such encumbrancer at the 18    mailing address set forth in the recorded encumbrance a 19    statement of the amounts and due dates of the unpaid 20    common expenses with respect to the encumbered unit, then, 21    unless otherwise provided in the declaration or bylaws, 22    the prior recorded encumbrance shall be subject to the 23    lien of all unpaid common expenses with respect to the 24    unit which become due and payable within a period of 90 25    days after the date of mailing of each such notice.26        (3) The purchaser of a condominium unit at a judicial   SB1914- 7 -LRB104 09871 JRC 19939 b1    foreclosure sale, or a mortgagee who receives title to a 2    unit by deed in lieu of foreclosure or judgment by common 3    law strict foreclosure or otherwise takes possession 4    pursuant to court order under the Illinois Mortgage 5    Foreclosure Law, shall have the duty to pay the unit's 6    proportionate share of the common expenses for the unit 7    assessed from and after the first day of the month after 8    the date of the judicial foreclosure sale, delivery of the 9    deed in lieu of foreclosure, entry of a judgment in common 10    law strict foreclosure, or taking of possession pursuant 11    to such court order. Such payment confirms the 12    extinguishment of any lien created pursuant to paragraph 13    (1) or (2) of this subsection (g) by virtue of the failure 14    or refusal of a prior unit owner to make payment of common 15    expenses, where the judicial foreclosure sale has been 16    confirmed by order of the court, a deed in lieu thereof has 17    been accepted by the lender, or a consent judgment has 18    been entered by the court.19        (4) The purchaser of a condominium unit at a judicial 20    foreclosure sale, other than a mortgagee, who takes 21    possession of a condominium unit pursuant to a court order 22    or a purchaser who acquires title from a mortgagee shall 23    have the duty to pay the proportionate share, if any, of 24    the common expenses for the unit which would have become 25    due in the absence of any assessment acceleration during 26    the 6 months immediately preceding institution of an   SB1914- 8 -LRB104 09871 JRC 19939 b1    action to enforce the collection of assessments, and which 2    remain unpaid by the owner during whose possession the 3    assessments accrued.

Any 17encumbrancer holding a lien on a unit may pay any unpaid common 18expenses payable with respect to the unit, and upon payment 19the encumbrancer shall have a lien on the unit for the amounts 20paid at the same rank as the lien of his encumbrance.21    (k) Nothing in Public Act 83-1271 is intended to change 22the lien priorities of any encumbrance created prior to August 2330, 1984.24(Source: P.A. 100-292, eff. 1-1-18.)
