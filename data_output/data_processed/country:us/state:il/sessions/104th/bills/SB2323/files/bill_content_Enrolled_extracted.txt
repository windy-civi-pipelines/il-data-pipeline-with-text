Full Text of SB2323 ILGA.GOV SB2323 - 104th General Assembly SB2323 EnrolledLRB104 02939 RLC 19420 b1    AN ACT concerning human trafficking. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. This Act may be referred to as the Illinois 5Statewide Trauma-Informed Response to Human Trafficking Act.  6    Section 2. Findings.7    (a) Human trafficking cuts across gender, race, age, 8immigration status, nationality, ability, income, and 9educational levels.10    (b) A multitude of factors can create susceptibility to 11the force, fraud, and coercion used by traffickers to exploit 12unmet physical, emotional, financial, or other needs of 13targeted persons. Vulnerability factors include, but are not 14limited to, poverty, prior sexual or domestic abuse, housing 15insecurity, immigration status, sexual orientation, gender 16identity, physical, mental and intellectual disability and 17limited education.18    (c) The complex trauma experienced by human trafficking 19survivors requires services from persons who have received 20training in effective responses to victims of human 21trafficking.22    (d) Trafficking for labor and sex exists in Illinois but 23it is going unrecognized because victims are not being   SB2323 Enrolled- 2 -LRB104 02939 RLC 19420 b1identified and the underlying crimes are not being reported. 2The National Human Trafficking Hotline in 2021 reported 929 3unique calls and texts and identified 355 victims from 4Illinois, including 177 sex and 27 labor trafficking cases. 5Fifty of those identified victims were minors. InfoNet, 6operated by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information 7Authority (ICJIA), indicates that 569 new client cases of sex 8and labor trafficking were identified and served via domestic 9violence and sexual assault service providers throughout 10Illinois in calendar years 2021, 2022, and 2023. There was a 11trend of increased victim identification during those years 12from 235 in 2021, 266 in 2022, to 303 in 2023. While the 13programs reporting to InfoNet primarily serve adults, 27 14minors and 96 youth survivors between the ages of 18 and 24 15were identified and served by these programs. The crime of 16human trafficking was identified only 73 times between 2021 17and 2023 according to the Illinois National Incident-Based 18Reporting System (NIBRS).19    (e) Child and youth victims of human trafficking are 20especially vulnerable as they are often trafficked by someone 21with whom they share a household or familial relationship, 22and, due to their developmental stage, have a need for a safe 23caregiving adult. Many have also previously experienced 24physical or sexual abuse. Between 2021 and 2023, 966 possible 25cases of child trafficking were identified by the Illinois 26Department of Children and Family Services via reports of   SB2323 Enrolled- 3 -LRB104 02939 RLC 19420 b1abuse or neglect. Of these, 292 (30.2%) were "indicated", 2meaning investigation found that these were cases of 3trafficking. There was a downward trend in the numbers of 4allegations and identification of child victims from 105 of 5416 (25.2%) indicated in 2021, to 104 of 312 (33.3%) in 2022, 6to 83 of 238 (34.8%) in 2023.7    (f) Survivors of sex and labor trafficking often do not 8identify themselves as victims of human trafficking which, 9unless they are identified as victims by others, hinders their 10access to specialized services and considerations in the 11criminal justice system.12    (g) Victims have difficulty leaving their trafficking 13situation due to the use of force, fraud, and coercive tactics 14by traffickers, many of whom exploit existing systemic 15barriers or other experiences faced by victims. These barriers 16or experiences could include prior criminal history, mistrust 17or previous experience with government systems, fear for 18themselves or family members, debt and poverty, isolation, 19language barriers, undocumented immigration status, or lack of 20knowledge of the United States legal system and their rights 21under it.22    (h) Labor trafficking victims are especially difficult to 23identify and engage. The National Human Trafficking Hotline in 242021 identified 177 incidents of sex trafficking, 27 incidents 25of labor trafficking and 15 incidents involving both labor and 26sex trafficking in Illinois. Illinois sexual assault and   SB2323 Enrolled- 4 -LRB104 02939 RLC 19420 b1domestic violence agencies reported serving 266 survivors of 2either sex or labor trafficking or both in 2022.3    (i) Illinois' government response system is fragmented 4without clear processes and procedures and without dedicated 5funding for specialized services for human trafficking 6survivors. Currently, federal funding is the primary source of 7funding for dedicated human trafficking service providers in 8Illinois.9    (j) No State standards for victim-centered, 10trauma-informed responses exist for the professions that are 11in a position to identify, treat, or otherwise respond to 12victims of human trafficking in Illinois.13    (k) Current Illinois multi-disciplinary response systems 14which are comprised of dedicated service providers, law 15enforcement and prosecutors are fragmented with 2 16multi-disciplinary task forces funded by the U.S. Department 17of Justice's Office of Victims of Crime located in Northern 18Illinois and Lake County, Illinois and other unfunded regional 19and local task forces operating independently.20    (l) The Illinois General Assembly finds that to identify 21and respond to labor and sex trafficking in Illinois and 22restore the dignity and future of survivors that a statewide 23strategic framework to prevent, detect and respond to victims 24of human trafficking must be established.25    (m) The General Assembly further finds that there is a 26need to create standards for training of human trafficking   SB2323 Enrolled- 5 -LRB104 02939 RLC 19420 b1service providers, law enforcement, prosecutors, public 2defenders, and housing, mental health, substance use disorder, 3medical personnel and other professions in order to ensure 4that victims of human trafficking in Illinois are identified 5and receive a victim-centered, trauma-informed response when 6they are identified or present for service. 7    Section 5.

Vulnerability factors include, but are not 14limited to, poverty, prior sexual or domestic abuse, housing 15insecurity, immigration status, sexual orientation, gender 16identity, physical, mental and intellectual disability and 17limited education.18    (c) The complex trauma experienced by human trafficking 19survivors requires services from persons who have received 20training in effective responses to victims of human 21trafficking.22    (d) Trafficking for labor and sex exists in Illinois but 23it is going unrecognized because victims are not being   SB2323 Enrolled- 2 -LRB104 02939 RLC 19420 b1identified and the underlying crimes are not being reported. 2The National Human Trafficking Hotline in 2021 reported 929 3unique calls and texts and identified 355 victims from 4Illinois, including 177 sex and 27 labor trafficking cases. 5Fifty of those identified victims were minors. InfoNet, 6operated by the Illinois Criminal Justice Information 7Authority (ICJIA), indicates that 569 new client cases of sex 8and labor trafficking were identified and served via domestic 9violence and sexual assault service providers throughout 10Illinois in calendar years 2021, 2022, and 2023. There was a 11trend of increased victim identification during those years 12from 235 in 2021, 266 in 2022, to 303 in 2023. While the 13programs reporting to InfoNet primarily serve adults, 27 14minors and 96 youth survivors between the ages of 18 and 24 15were identified and served by these programs. The crime of 16human trafficking was identified only 73 times between 2021 17and 2023 according to the Illinois National Incident-Based 18Reporting System (NIBRS).19    (e) Child and youth victims of human trafficking are 20especially vulnerable as they are often trafficked by someone 21with whom they share a household or familial relationship, 22and, due to their developmental stage, have a need for a safe 23caregiving adult. Many have also previously experienced 24physical or sexual abuse. Between 2021 and 2023, 966 possible 25cases of child trafficking were identified by the Illinois 26Department of Children and Family Services via reports of   SB2323 Enrolled- 3 -LRB104 02939 RLC 19420 b1abuse or neglect. Of these, 292 (30.2%) were "indicated", 2meaning investigation found that these were cases of 3trafficking. There was a downward trend in the numbers of 4allegations and identification of child victims from 105 of 5416 (25.2%) indicated in 2021, to 104 of 312 (33.3%) in 2022, 6to 83 of 238 (34.8%) in 2023.7    (f) Survivors of sex and labor trafficking often do not 8identify themselves as victims of human trafficking which, 9unless they are identified as victims by others, hinders their 10access to specialized services and considerations in the 11criminal justice system.12    (g) Victims have difficulty leaving their trafficking 13situation due to the use of force, fraud, and coercive tactics 14by traffickers, many of whom exploit existing systemic 15barriers or other experiences faced by victims. These barriers 16or experiences could include prior criminal history, mistrust 17or previous experience with government systems, fear for 18themselves or family members, debt and poverty, isolation, 19language barriers, undocumented immigration status, or lack of 20knowledge of the United States legal system and their rights 21under it.22    (h) Labor trafficking victims are especially difficult to 23identify and engage. The National Human Trafficking Hotline in 242021 identified 177 incidents of sex trafficking, 27 incidents 25of labor trafficking and 15 incidents involving both labor and 26sex trafficking in Illinois. Illinois sexual assault and   SB2323 Enrolled- 4 -LRB104 02939 RLC 19420 b1domestic violence agencies reported serving 266 survivors of 2either sex or labor trafficking or both in 2022.3    (i) Illinois' government response system is fragmented 4without clear processes and procedures and without dedicated 5funding for specialized services for human trafficking 6survivors. Currently, federal funding is the primary source of 7funding for dedicated human trafficking service providers in 8Illinois.9    (j) No State standards for victim-centered, 10trauma-informed responses exist for the professions that are 11in a position to identify, treat, or otherwise respond to 12victims of human trafficking in Illinois.13    (k) Current Illinois multi-disciplinary response systems 14which are comprised of dedicated service providers, law 15enforcement and prosecutors are fragmented with 2 16multi-disciplinary task forces funded by the U.S. Department 17of Justice's Office of Victims of Crime located in Northern 18Illinois and Lake County, Illinois and other unfunded regional 19and local task forces operating independently.20    (l) The Illinois General Assembly finds that to identify 21and respond to labor and sex trafficking in Illinois and 22restore the dignity and future of survivors that a statewide 23strategic framework to prevent, detect and respond to victims 24of human trafficking must be established.25    (m) The General Assembly further finds that there is a 26need to create standards for training of human trafficking   SB2323 Enrolled- 5 -LRB104 02939 RLC 19420 b1service providers, law enforcement, prosecutors, public 2defenders, and housing, mental health, substance use disorder, 3medical personnel and other professions in order to ensure 4that victims of human trafficking in Illinois are identified 5and receive a victim-centered, trauma-informed response when 6they are identified or present for service. 7    Section 5.
