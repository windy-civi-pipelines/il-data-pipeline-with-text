Which the individual he or she had accepted after 23    separation from other work, and the work which the 24    individual he or she left voluntarily would be deemed 25    unsuitable under the provisions of Section 603; 26        6.(a) Because the individual left work due to verified   HB3200 Enrolled- 4 -LRB104 11263 SPS 21347 b1    domestic violence as defined in Section 103 of the 2    Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 where the domestic 3    violence caused the individual to reasonably believe that 4    the individual's his or her continued employment would 5    jeopardize the individual's his or her safety or the 6    safety of the individual's his or her spouse, minor child, 7    or parent8        if the individual provides the following: 9            (i) notice to the employing unit of the reason for 10        the individual's voluntarily leaving; and 11            (ii) to the Department provides: 12                (A) an order of protection or other 13            documentation of equitable relief issued by a 14            court of competent jurisdiction; or15                (B) a police report or criminal charges 16            documenting the domestic violence; or 17                (C) medical documentation of the domestic 18            violence; or 19                (D) evidence of domestic violence from a 20            member of the clergy, attorney, counselor, social 21            worker, health worker or domestic violence shelter 22            worker.23        (b) If the individual does not meet the provisions of 24    subparagraph (a), the individual shall be held to have 25    voluntarily terminated employment for the purpose of 26    determining the individual's eligibility for benefits   HB3200 Enrolled- 5 -LRB104 11263 SPS 21347 b1    pursuant to subsection A. 2        (c) Notwithstanding any other provision to the 3    contrary, evidence of domestic violence experienced by an 4    individual, or the individual's his or her spouse, minor 5    child, or parent, including the individual's statement and 6    corroborating evidence, shall not be disclosed by the 7    Department unless consent for disclosure is given by the 8    individual. 9        7. Because, due to a change in location of employment 10    of the individual's spouse, the individual left work to 11    accompany the individual's his or her spouse to a place 12    from which it is impractical to commute or because the 13    individual left employment to accompany a spouse who has 14    been reassigned from one military assignment to another. 15    The employer's account, however, shall not be charged for 16    any benefits paid out to the individual who leaves work 17    under a circumstance described in this paragraph. 18    C.
