Voluntary leaving. 9    A. An individual shall be ineligible for benefits for the 10week in which the individual he or she has left work 11voluntarily without good cause attributable to the employing 12unit and, thereafter, until the individual he or she has 13become reemployed and has had earnings equal to or in excess of 14the individual's his or her current weekly benefit amount in 15each of four calendar weeks which are either for services in 16employment, or have been or will be reported pursuant to the 17provisions of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act by each 18employing unit for which such services are performed and which 19submits a statement certifying to that fact. 20    B. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to an 21individual who has left work voluntarily: 22        1. Because the individual, prior to voluntarily 23    leaving: he or she   HB3200- 2 -LRB104 11263 SPS 21347 b1            (a) is deemed physically unable to perform the 2        individual's his or her work by a licensed and 3        practicing physician, licensed and practicing nurse 4        practitioner, or licensed and practicing physician 5        assistant and the employer is unable to accommodate 6        the individual; , or7            (b) is deemed to be unable to perform the 8        individual's work due to a mental health disability by 9        a licensed and practicing psychiatrist or 10        psychologist, licensed and practicing clinical social 11        worker, or licensed and practicing professional 12        counselor and the employer is unable to accommodate 13        the individual; or14            (c) is providing necessary because the 15        individual's assistance to care is necessary for the 16        purpose of caring for the individual's his or her 17        spouse, child, or parent who, according to a licensed 18        and practicing physician or as otherwise reasonably 19        verified, is in poor physical or mental health or is a 20        person with a mental or physical disability and the 21        employer is unable to accommodate the individual's 22        need to provide such assistance; 23        2. To accept other bona fide work and, after such 24    acceptance, the individual is either not unemployed in 25    each of 2 weeks, or earns remuneration for such work equal 26    to at least twice the individual's his or her current   HB3200- 3 -LRB104 11263 SPS 21347 b1    weekly benefit amount; 2        3.

Because, due to a change in location of employment 11    of the individual's spouse, the individual left work to 12    accompany the individual's his or her spouse to a place 13    from which it is impractical to commute or because the 14    individual left employment to accompany a spouse who has 15    been reassigned from one military assignment to another. 16    The employer's account, however, shall not be charged for 17    any benefits paid out to the individual who leaves work 18    under a circumstance described in this paragraph. 19    C.
