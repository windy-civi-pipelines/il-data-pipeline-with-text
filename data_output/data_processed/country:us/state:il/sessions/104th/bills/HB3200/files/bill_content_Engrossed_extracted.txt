Because, due to a change in location of employment 10    of the individual's spouse, the individual left work to 11    accompany the individual's his or her spouse to a place 12    from which it is impractical to commute or because the 13    individual left employment to accompany a spouse who has 14    been reassigned from one military assignment to another. 15    The employer's account, however, shall not be charged for 16    any benefits paid out to the individual who leaves work 17    under a circumstance described in this paragraph. 18    C.
