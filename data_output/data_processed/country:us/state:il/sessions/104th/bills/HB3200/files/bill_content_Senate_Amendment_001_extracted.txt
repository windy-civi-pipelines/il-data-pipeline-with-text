Voluntary leaving. 9    A. An individual shall be ineligible for benefits for the 10week in which the individual he or she has left work 11voluntarily without good cause attributable to the employing 12unit and, thereafter, until the individual he or she has 13become reemployed and has had earnings equal to or in excess of 14the individual's his or her current weekly benefit amount in 15each of four calendar weeks which are either for services in 16employment, or have been or will be reported pursuant to the   10400HB3200sam001- 2 -LRB104 11263 SPS 26287 a1provisions of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act by each 2employing unit for which such services are performed and which 3submits a statement certifying to that fact. 4    B. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to an 5individual who has left work voluntarily: 6        1. Because the individual, prior to voluntarily 7    leaving: he or she 8            (a) is deemed physically unable to perform the 9        individual's his or her work by a licensed and 10        practicing physician, licensed and practicing nurse 11        practitioner, or licensed and practicing physician 12        assistant and the employer is unable to accommodate 13        the individual; , or14            (b) for claims dated December 28, 2025 through 15        December 24, 2028, is deemed to be unable to perform 16        the individual's work due to a mental health 17        disability by a licensed and practicing psychiatrist 18        and the employer is unable to accommodate the 19        individual; or20            (c) is providing necessary because the 21        individual's assistance to care is necessary for the 22        purpose of caring for the individual's his or her 23        spouse, child, or parent who, according to a licensed 24        and practicing physician or as otherwise reasonably 25        verified, is in poor physical or mental health or is a 26        person with a mental or physical disability and the   10400HB3200sam001- 3 -LRB104 11263 SPS 26287 a1        employer is unable to accommodate the individual's 2        need to provide such assistance; 3        2. To accept other bona fide work and, after such 4    acceptance, the individual is either not unemployed in 5    each of 2 weeks, or earns remuneration for such work equal 6    to at least twice the individual's his or her current 7    weekly benefit amount; 8        3. In lieu of accepting a transfer to other work 9    offered to the individual by the employing unit under the 10    terms of a collective bargaining agreement or pursuant to 11    an established employer plan, program, or policy, if the 12    acceptance of such other work by the individual would 13    require the separation from that work of another 14    individual currently performing it; 15        4. Solely because of the sexual harassment of the 16    individual by another employee. Sexual harassment means 17    (1) unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, 18    sexually motivated physical contact or other conduct or 19    communication which is made a term or condition of the 20    employment or (2) the employee's submission to or 21    rejection of such conduct or communication which is the 22    basis for decisions affecting employment, or (3) when such 23    conduct or communication has the purpose or effect of 24    substantially interfering with an individual's work 25    performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or 26    offensive working environment and the employer knows or   10400HB3200sam001- 4 -LRB104 11263 SPS 26287 a1    should know of the existence of the harassment and fails 2    to take timely and appropriate action; 3        5. Which the individual he or she had accepted after 4    separation from other work, and the work which the 5    individual he or she left voluntarily would be deemed 6    unsuitable under the provisions of Section 603; 7        6.(a) Because the individual left work due to verified 8    domestic violence as defined in Section 103 of the 9    Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 where the domestic 10    violence caused the individual to reasonably believe that 11    the individual's his or her continued employment would 12    jeopardize the individual's his or her safety or the 13    safety of the individual's his or her spouse, minor child, 14    or parent15        if the individual provides the following: 16            (i) notice to the employing unit of the reason for 17        the individual's voluntarily leaving; and 18            (ii) to the Department provides: 19                (A) an order of protection or other 20            documentation of equitable relief issued by a 21            court of competent jurisdiction; or22                (B) a police report or criminal charges 23            documenting the domestic violence; or 24                (C) medical documentation of the domestic 25            violence; or 26                (D) evidence of domestic violence from a   10400HB3200sam001- 5 -LRB104 11263 SPS 26287 a1            member of the clergy, attorney, counselor, social 2            worker, health worker or domestic violence shelter 3            worker.4        (b) If the individual does not meet the provisions of 5    subparagraph (a), the individual shall be held to have 6    voluntarily terminated employment for the purpose of 7    determining the individual's eligibility for benefits 8    pursuant to subsection A. 9        (c) Notwithstanding any other provision to the 10    contrary, evidence of domestic violence experienced by an 11    individual, or the individual's his or her spouse, minor 12    child, or parent, including the individual's statement and 13    corroborating evidence, shall not be disclosed by the 14    Department unless consent for disclosure is given by the 15    individual. 16        7. Because, due to a change in location of employment 17    of the individual's spouse, the individual left work to 18    accompany the individual's his or her spouse to a place 19    from which it is impractical to commute or because the 20    individual left employment to accompany a spouse who has 21    been reassigned from one military assignment to another. 22    The employer's account, however, shall not be charged for 23    any benefits paid out to the individual who leaves work 24    under a circumstance described in this paragraph. 25    C. Within 90 days of the effective date of this amendatory 26Act of the 96th General Assembly, the Department shall   10400HB3200sam001- 6 -LRB104 11263 SPS 26287 a1promulgate rules, pursuant to the Illinois Administrative 2Procedure Act and consistent with Section 903(f)(3)(B) of the 3Social Security Act, to clarify and provide guidance regarding 4eligibility and the prevention of fraud. 5    D.
