Such request shall be made by registered or 15certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 16the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 17at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 18date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 19hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 20shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 21heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 22as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 23the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 24reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 25is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision   HB1583- 9 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 2the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 3transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 4in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 5denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 6which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 7of students or staff in the alternative program. 8    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 9superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 10principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 11students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 12suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 13the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 14subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 15shall lie against them for such suspension.

The school board must be given a summary of the   HB1583- 10 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 2suspension length.

To ensure that 25students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 26recommended that school officials consider forms of   HB1583- 11 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 2suspensions or expulsions. 3    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 4Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 5by which school administrators are required to suspend or 6expel students for particular behaviors.7    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 8used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 9pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 10students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 11subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 12other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 13a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 14School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 15such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 16length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.17    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 18out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 19and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 20only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 21disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 22student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 23a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 24the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 25interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 26this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other   HB1583- 12 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1students, staff, or members of the school community" and 2"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 3operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 4basis by school officials.

A 10student must not be denied transfer because of the expulsion, 11except in cases in which such transfer is deemed to cause a 12threat to the safety of students or staff in the alternative 13program. 14    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 15superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 16principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 17students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 18suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 19the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 20subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 21shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 22policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 23principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 24school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 25to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 26gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board   HB1583- 20 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 2reasons. 3    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 4parents or guardians of a student along with a full statement 5of the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right 6to a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 7notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 8suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardians, 9the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 10review such action of the superintendent or principal, 11assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 12parents or guardians of the student may appear and discuss the 13suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 14officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 15a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 16its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 17hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 18appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 19subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 20decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 21misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 22suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 23specific duration of the suspension.24    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 25and consequences available to school officials, school 26exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions,   HB1583- 21 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 2and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 3extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 4only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 5students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 6recommended that school officials consider forms of 7non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 8suspensions or expulsions. 9    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 10Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 11by which school administrators are required to suspend or 12expel students for particular behaviors.13    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 14used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 15pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 16students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 17subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 18other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 19a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 20School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 21such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 22length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.23    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 24out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 25and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 26only if other appropriate and available behavioral and   HB1583- 22 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 2student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 3a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 4the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 5interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 6this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 7students, staff, or members of the school community" and 8"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 9operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 10basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 11(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 12available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 13exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 14shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 15address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 16exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 17suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 18Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 19of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 20interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 21there were no other appropriate and available interventions.22    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 23than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 24support services during the period of their suspension. For 25purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 26support services" shall be determined by school authorities.   HB1583- 23 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 2this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 3to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 4such appropriate and available services. 5    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 6appropriate and available support services.7    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 8re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 9expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 10consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 11Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 12and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 13suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 14alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 15Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 16    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 17suspended students, including those students suspended from 18the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 19school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 20equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 21a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 22that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 23alternate transportation to school. 24    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 25subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 26subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be   HB1583- 24 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 2parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 3violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 4parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 5emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 6throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 7its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 8student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 9emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany 10the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 11representative or support person must comply with any rules of 12the school district's hearing process. If the representative 13or support person violates the rules or engages in behavior or 14advocacy that harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a 15witness, or anyone else in attendance at the hearing, the 16representative or support person may be prohibited from 17further participation in the hearing or proceeding. A 18suspension or expulsion proceeding under this subsection 19(b-35) must be conducted independently from any ongoing 20criminal investigation or proceeding, and an absence of 21pending or possible criminal charges, criminal investigations, 22or proceedings may not be a factor in school disciplinary 23decisions.24    (b-40) During a suspension review hearing conducted under 25subsection (b) or an expulsion hearing conducted under 26subsection (a) that involves allegations of sexual violence by   HB1583- 25 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1the student who is subject to discipline, neither the student 2nor his or her representative shall directly question nor have 3direct contact with the alleged victim. The student who is 4subject to discipline or his or her representative may, at the 5discretion and direction of the school board or its appointed 6hearing officer, suggest questions to be posed by the school 7board or its appointed hearing officer to the alleged victim. 8    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 9local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 10meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 11the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.12    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 13provide ongoing professional development to all school 14personnel, school board members, school safety officers, and 15school resource officers on the requirements of this Section 16and Section 10-20.14, the adverse consequences of school 17exclusion and justice-system involvement, effective classroom 18management strategies, culturally responsive discipline, 19trauma-responsive learning environments, as defined in 20subsection (b) of Section 3-11, the appropriate and available 21supportive services for the promotion of student attendance 22and engagement, and developmentally appropriate disciplinary 23methods that promote positive and healthy school climates. 24    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 25time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 26case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have   HB1583- 26 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1brought one of the following objects to school, any 2school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 3that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 4expelled for a period of not less than one year:5        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 6    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 7    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 8    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 9    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 10    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period 11    under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the 12    superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may 13    be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.14        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon 15    regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other 16    object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily 17    harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in 18    subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). The expulsion 19    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 20    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 21    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 22Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 23consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 24Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 25expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 26transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with   HB1583- 27 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1Article 13A of the School Code.2    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 3superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 4principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 5student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 6a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 7calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 8that student has been determined to have made an explicit 9threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 10student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 11website through which the threat was made is a site that was 12accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 13was available to third parties who worked or studied within 14the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 15the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 16the safety and security of the threatened individual because 17of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 18student inside the school. 19    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 20authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 21lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 22equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 23personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 24without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 25search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 26Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of   HB1583- 28 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 2left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 3the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 4conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 5lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 6controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 7illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 8searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 9If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 10evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 11the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 12such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 13disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also 14turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.15    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or 16expulsion from school and all school activities and a 17prohibition from being present on school grounds.18    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if 19a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any 20public or private school in this or any other state, the 21student must complete the entire term of the suspension or 22expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A 23of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program 24under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the 25school district if there is no threat to the safety of students 26or staff in the alternative program. A school district that   HB1583- 29 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1adopts a policy under this subsection (g) must include a 2provision allowing for consideration of any mitigating 3factors, including, but not limited to, a student's status as 4a parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 5violence, as defined in Article 26A. 6    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 7students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 8difficulties.9    (i) A student may not be issued a monetary fine or fee as a 10disciplinary consequence, though this shall not preclude 11requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, stolen, 12or damaged property.13    (j) Subsections (a) through (i) of this Section shall 14apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter schools, 15special charter districts, and school districts organized 16under Article 34 of this Code. 17    (k) Through June 30, 2026, the expulsion of students 18enrolled in programs funded under Section 1C-2 of this Code is 19subject to the requirements under paragraph (7) of subsection 20(a) of Section 2-3.71 of this Code.21    (k-5) On and after July 1, 2026, the expulsion of children 22enrolled in programs funded under Section 15-25 of the 23Department of Early Childhood Act is subject to the 24requirements of paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 2515-30 of the Department of Early Childhood Act. 26    (l) An in-school suspension program provided by a school   HB1583- 30 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may 2focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and 3positive interaction with other students and school personnel. 4A school district may employ a school social worker or a 5licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school 6suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12. 7(Source: P.A. 102-466, eff. 7-1-25; 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 8102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-594, eff. 6-25-24; 103-896, eff. 98-9-24; revised 9-25-24.) 10    (105 ILCS 5/17-2.11)  (from Ch. 122, par. 17-2.11)11    Sec. 17-2.11.

If the estimated cost to effectuate emergency repairs is 15greater than the amount specified in Section 10-20.21 of this 16Code, then the school district shall proceed in conformity 17with Section 10-20.21 of this Code and with rules established 18by the State Board of Education to address such situations. 19The rules adopted by the State Board of Education to deal with 20these situations shall stipulate that emergency situations 21must be expedited and given priority consideration. For 22purposes of this paragraph, an emergency is a situation that 23presents an imminent and continuing threat to the health and 24safety of students or other occupants of a facility, requires 25complete or partial evacuation of a building or part of a 26building, or consumes one or more of the 5 emergency days built   HB1583- 33 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1into the adopted calendar of the school or schools or would 2otherwise be expected to cause such school or schools to fall 3short of the minimum school calendar requirements. 4    (b) Whenever any such district determines that it is 5necessary for energy conservation purposes that any school 6building or permanent, fixed equipment should be altered or 7reconstructed and that such alterations or reconstruction will 8be made with funds not necessary for the completion of 9approved and recommended projects contained in any safety 10survey report or amendments thereto authorized by Section 112-3.12 of this Act; the district may levy a tax or issue bonds 12as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.13    (c) Whenever any such district determines that it is 14necessary for accessibility purposes and to comply with the 15school building code that any school building or equipment 16should be altered or reconstructed and that such alterations 17or reconstruction will be made with funds not necessary for 18the completion of approved and recommended projects contained 19in any safety survey report or amendments thereto authorized 20under Section 2-3.12 of this Act, the district may levy a tax 21or issue bonds as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.22    (d) Whenever any such district determines that it is 23necessary for school security purposes and the related 24protection and safety of pupils and school personnel that any 25school building or property should be altered or reconstructed 26or that security systems and equipment (including but not   HB1583- 34 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1limited to intercom, early detection and warning, access 2control and television monitoring systems) should be purchased 3and installed, and that such alterations, reconstruction or 4purchase and installation of equipment will be made with funds 5not necessary for the completion of approved and recommended 6projects contained in any safety survey report or amendment 7thereto authorized by Section 2-3.12 of this Act and will 8deter and prevent unauthorized entry or activities upon school 9property by unknown or dangerous persons, assure early 10detection and advance warning of any such actual or attempted 11unauthorized entry or activities and help assure the continued 12safety of pupils and school staff if any such unauthorized 13entry or activity is attempted or occurs; the district may 14levy a tax or issue bonds as provided in subsection (a) of this 15Section.16    If such a school district determines that it is necessary 17for school security purposes and the related protection and 18safety of pupils and school staff to hire a school resource 19officer or that personnel costs for school counselors, mental 20health experts, school safety officers, or school resource 21officers are necessary and the district determines that it 22does not need funds for any of the other purposes set forth in 23this Section, then the district may levy a tax or issue bonds 24as provided in subsection (a). 25    (e) If a school district does not need funds for other fire 26prevention and safety projects, including the completion of   HB1583- 35 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1approved and recommended projects contained in any safety 2survey report or amendments thereto authorized by Section 32-3.12 of this Act, and it is determined after a public hearing 4(which is preceded by at least one published notice (i) 5occurring at least 7 days prior to the hearing in a newspaper 6of general circulation within the school district and (ii) 7setting forth the time, date, place, and general subject 8matter of the hearing) that there is a substantial, immediate, 9and otherwise unavoidable threat to the health, safety, or 10welfare of pupils due to disrepair of school sidewalks, 11playgrounds, parking lots, or school bus turnarounds and 12repairs must be made; then the district may levy a tax or issue 13bonds as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.14    (f) For purposes of this Section a school district may 15replace a school building or build additions to replace 16portions of a building when it is determined that the 17effectuation of the recommendations for the existing building 18will cost more than the replacement costs. Such determination 19shall be based on a comparison of estimated costs made by an 20architect or engineer licensed in the State of Illinois. The 21new building or addition shall be equivalent in area (square 22feet) and comparable in purpose and grades served and may be on 23the same site or another site.

Sexual abuse at schools.3    (a) The General Assembly finds that: 4        (1) investigation of a child regarding an incident of 5    sexual abuse can induce significant trauma for the child;6        (2) it is desirable to prevent multiple interviews of 7    a child at a school; and8        (3) it is important to recognize the role of 9    Children's Advocacy Centers in conducting developmentally 10    appropriate investigations. 11    (b) In this Section:12    "Alleged incident of sexual abuse" is limited to an 13incident of sexual abuse of a child that is alleged to have 14been perpetrated by school personnel, including a school 15vendor or volunteer, that occurred (i) on school grounds or 16during a school activity or (ii) outside of school grounds or 17not during a school activity. 18    "Appropriate law enforcement agency" means a law 19enforcement agency whose employees have been involved, in some 20capacity, with an investigation of a particular alleged 21incident of sexual abuse. 22    (c) If a mandated reporter within a school has knowledge 23of an alleged incident of sexual abuse, the reporter must call 24the Department of Children and Family Services' hotline 25established under Section 7.6 of the Abused and Neglected   HB1583- 42 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1Child Reporting Act immediately after obtaining the minimal 2information necessary to make a report, including the names of 3the affected parties and the allegations. The State Board of 4Education must make available materials detailing the 5information that is necessary to enable notification to the 6Department of Children and Family Services of an alleged 7incident of sexual abuse. Each school must ensure that 8mandated reporters review the State Board of Education's 9materials and materials developed by the Department of 10Children and Family Services and distributed in the school 11building under Section 7 of the Abused and Neglected Child 12Reporting Act at least once annually.13    (d) For schools in a county with an accredited Children's 14Advocacy Center, every alleged incident of sexual abuse that 15is reported to the Department of Children and Family Services' 16hotline or a law enforcement agency and is subsequently 17accepted for investigation must be referred by the entity that 18received the report to the local Children's Advocacy Center 19pursuant to that county's multidisciplinary team's protocol 20under the Children's Advocacy Center Act for investigating 21child sexual abuse allegations.22    (e) A county's local Children's Advocacy Center must, at a 23minimum, do both of the following regarding a referred case of 24an alleged incident of sexual abuse: 25        (1) Coordinate the investigation of the alleged 26    incident, as governed by the local Children's Advocacy   HB1583- 43 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1    Center's existing multidisciplinary team protocol and 2    according to National Children's Alliance accreditation 3    standards.4        (2) Facilitate communication between the 5    multidisciplinary team investigating the alleged incident 6    of sexual abuse and, if applicable, the referring school's 7    (i) Title IX officer, or his or her designee, (ii) school 8    resource officer, or (iii) personnel, or (iv) school 9    safety officer leading the school's investigation into the 10    alleged incident of sexual abuse. If a school uses a 11    designated entity to investigate a sexual abuse 12    allegation, the multidisciplinary team may correspond only 13    with that entity and any reference in this Section to 14    "school" refers to that designated entity. This 15    facilitation of communication must, at a minimum, ensure 16    that all applicable parties have each other's contact 17    information and must share the county's local Children's 18    Advocacy Center's protocol regarding the process of 19    approving the viewing of a forensic interview, as defined 20    under Section 2.5 of the Children's Advocacy Center Act, 21    by school personnel and a contact person for questions 22    relating to the protocol. 23    (f) After an alleged incident of sexual abuse is accepted 24for investigation by the Department of Children and Family 25Services or a law enforcement agency and while the criminal 26and child abuse investigations related to that alleged   HB1583- 44 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1incident are being conducted by the local multidisciplinary 2team, the school relevant to the alleged incident of sexual 3abuse must comply with both of the following:4        (1) It may not interview the alleged victim regarding 5    details of the alleged incident of sexual abuse until 6    after the completion of the forensic interview of that 7    victim is conducted at a Children's Advocacy Center. This 8    paragraph does not prohibit a school from requesting 9    information from the alleged victim or his or her parent 10    or guardian to ensure the safety and well-being of the 11    alleged victim at school during an investigation.12        (2) If asked by a law enforcement agency or an 13    investigator of the Department of Children and Family 14    Services who is conducting the investigation, it must 15    inform those individuals of any evidence the school has 16    gathered pertaining to an alleged incident of sexual 17    abuse, as permissible by federal or State law. 18    (g) After completion of a forensic interview, the 19multidisciplinary team must notify the school relevant to the 20alleged incident of sexual abuse of its completion. If, for 21any reason, a multidisciplinary team determines it will not 22conduct a forensic interview in a specific investigation, the 23multidisciplinary team must notify the school as soon as the 24determination is made. If a forensic interview has not been 25conducted within 15 calendar days after opening an 26investigation, the school may notify the multidisciplinary   HB1583- 45 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1team that it intends to interview the alleged victim. No later 2than 10 calendar days after this notification, the 3multidisciplinary team may conduct the forensic interview and, 4if the multidisciplinary team does not conduct the interview, 5the school may proceed with its interview.6    (h) To the greatest extent possible considering student 7safety and Title IX compliance, school personnel may view the 8electronic recordings of a forensic interview of an alleged 9victim of an incident of sexual abuse. As a means to avoid 10additional interviews of an alleged victim, school personnel 11must be granted viewing access to the electronic recording of 12a forensic interview conducted at an accredited Children's 13Advocacy Center for an alleged incident of sexual abuse only 14if the school receives (i) approval from the multidisciplinary 15team investigating the case and (ii) informed consent by a 16child over the age of 13 or the child's parent or guardian. 17Each county's local Children's Advocacy Center and 18multidisciplinary team must establish an internal protocol 19regarding the process of approving the viewing of the forensic 20interview, and this process and the contact person must be 21shared with the school contact at the time of the initial 22facilitation. Whenever possible, the school's viewing of the 23electronic recording of a forensic interview should be 24conducted in lieu of the need for additional interviews.25    (i) For an alleged incident of sexual abuse that has been 26accepted for investigation by a multidisciplinary team, if,   HB1583- 46 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1during the course of its internal investigation and at any 2point during or after the multidisciplinary team's 3investigation, the school determines that it needs to 4interview the alleged victim to successfully complete its 5investigation and the victim is under 18 years of age, a child 6advocate must be made available to the student and may be 7present during the school's interview. A child advocate may be 8a school social worker, a school or equally qualified 9psychologist, or a person in a position the State Board of 10Education has identified as an appropriate advocate for the 11student during a school's investigation into an alleged 12incident of sexual abuse.13    (j) The Department of Children and Family Services must 14notify the relevant school when an agency investigation of an 15alleged incident of sexual abuse is complete. The notification 16must include information on the outcome of that investigation.17    (k) The appropriate law enforcement agency must notify the 18relevant school when an agency investigation of an alleged 19incident of sexual abuse is complete or has been suspended. 20The notification must include information on the outcome of 21that investigation.22    (l) This Section applies to all schools operating under 23this Code, including, but not limited to, public schools 24located in cities having a population of more than 500,000, a 25school operated pursuant to an agreement with a public school 26district, alternative schools operated by third parties, an   HB1583- 47 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1alternative learning opportunities program, a public school 2administered by a local public agency or the Department of 3Human Services, charter schools operating under the authority 4of Article 27A, and non-public schools recognized by the State 5Board of Education. 6(Source: P.A. 101-531, eff. 8-23-19; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21.) 7    (105 ILCS 5/22-88)8    Sec. 22-88. Parental notification of law enforcement 9detainment and questioning on school grounds.10    (a) In this Section, "school grounds" means the real 11property comprising an active and operational elementary or 12secondary school during the regular hours in which school is 13in session and when students are present. 14    (b) Before detaining and questioning a student on school 15grounds who is under 18 years of age and who is suspected of 16committing a criminal act, a law enforcement officer, a school 17resource officer, school safety officer, or other school 18security personnel must do all of the following:19        (1) Ensure that notification or attempted notification 20    of the student's parent or guardian is made.21        (2) Document the time and manner in which the 22    notification or attempted notification under paragraph (1) 23    occurred.24        (3) Make reasonable efforts to ensure that the 25    student's parent or guardian is present during the   HB1583- 48 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1    questioning or, if the parent or guardian is not present, 2    ensure that school personnel, including, but not limited 3    to, a school social worker, a school psychologist, a 4    school nurse, a school counselor, or any other mental 5    health professional, are present during the questioning.6        (4) If practicable, make reasonable efforts to ensure 7    that a law enforcement officer trained in promoting safe 8    interactions and communications with youth is present 9    during the questioning. An officer who received training 10    in youth investigations approved or certified by his or 11    her law enforcement agency or under Section 10.22 of the 12    Police Training Act or a juvenile police officer, as 13    defined under Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 14    1987, satisfies the requirement under this paragraph.15    (c) This Section does not limit the authority of a law 16enforcement officer to make an arrest on school grounds. This 17Section does not apply to circumstances that would cause a 18reasonable person to believe that urgent and immediate action 19is necessary to do any of the following:20        (1) Prevent bodily harm or injury to the student or 21    any other person.22        (2) Apprehend an armed or fleeing suspect.23        (3) Prevent the destruction of evidence.24        (4) Address an emergency or other dangerous situation. 25(Source: P.A. 101-478, eff. 8-23-19; 102-197, eff. 7-30-21; 26102-558, eff. 8-20-21.)   HB1583- 49 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1    (105 ILCS 5/26A-20)2    (This Section may contain text from a Public Act with a 3delayed effective date)4    Sec. 26A-20. Review and revision of policies and 5procedures.6    (a) No later than July 1, 2024 and every 2 years 7thereafter, each school district must review all existing 8policies and procedures and must revise any existing policies 9and procedures that may act as a barrier to the immediate 10enrollment and re-enrollment, attendance, graduation, and 11success in school of any student who is a student parent, 12expectant student parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 13violence or any policies or procedures that may compromise a 14criminal investigation relating to domestic or sexual violence 15or may re-victimize students. A school district must adopt new 16policies and procedures, as needed, to implement this Section 17and to ensure that immediate and effective steps are taken to 18respond to students who are student parents, expectant 19parents, or victims of domestic or sexual violence.20    (b) A school district's policy must be consistent with the 21model policy and procedures adopted by the State Board of 22Education and under Public Act 101-531.23    (c) A school district's policy on the procedures that a 24student or his or her parent or guardian may follow if he or 25she chooses to report an incident of alleged domestic or   HB1583- 50 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1sexual violence must, at a minimum, include all of the 2following: 3        (1) The name and contact information for domestic or 4    sexual violence and parenting resource personnel, the 5    Title IX coordinator, school and school district resource 6    officers, school safety officers, or security, and a 7    community-based domestic or sexual violence organization.8        (2) The name, title, and contact information for 9    confidential resources and a description of what 10    confidential reporting means.11        (3) An option for the student or the student's parent 12    or guardian to electronically, anonymously, and 13    confidentially report the incident.14        (4) An option for reports by third parties and 15    bystanders.16        (5) Information regarding the various individuals, 17    departments, or organizations to whom a student may report 18    an incident of domestic or sexual violence, specifying for 19    each individual or entity (i) the extent of the 20    individual's or entity's reporting obligation to the 21    school's or school district's administration, Title IX 22    coordinator, or other personnel or entity, (ii) the 23    individual's or entity's ability to protect the student's 24    privacy, and (iii) the extent of the individual's or 25    entity's ability to have confidential communications with 26    the student or his or her parent or guardian.  HB1583- 51 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1        (6) The adoption of a complaint resolution procedure 2    as provided in Section 26A-25. 3    (d) A school district must post its revised policies and 4procedures on its website, distribute them at the beginning of 5each school year to each student, and make copies available to 6each student and his or her parent or guardian for inspection 7and copying at no cost to the student or parent or guardian at 8each school within a school district. 9(Source: P.A. 102-466, eff. 7-1-25.) 10    (105 ILCS 5/27-23.7)11    Sec. 27-23.7. Bullying prevention.12    (a) The General Assembly finds that a safe and civil 13school environment is necessary for students to learn and 14achieve and that bullying causes physical, psychological, and 15emotional harm to students and interferes with students' 16ability to learn and participate in school activities. The 17General Assembly further finds that bullying has been linked 18to other forms of antisocial behavior, such as vandalism, 19shoplifting, skipping and dropping out of school, fighting, 20using drugs and alcohol, sexual harassment, and sexual 21violence. Because of the negative outcomes associated with 22bullying in schools, the General Assembly finds that school 23districts, charter schools, and non-public, non-sectarian 24elementary and secondary schools should educate students, 25parents, and school district, charter school, or non-public,   HB1583- 52 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1non-sectarian elementary or secondary school personnel about 2what behaviors constitute prohibited bullying.3    Bullying on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, 4religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, physical appearance, 5socioeconomic status, academic status, pregnancy, parenting 6status, homelessness, age, marital status, physical or mental 7disability, military status, sexual orientation, 8gender-related identity or expression, unfavorable discharge 9from military service, association with a person or group with 10one or more of the aforementioned actual or perceived 11characteristics, or any other distinguishing characteristic is 12prohibited in all school districts, charter schools, and 13non-public, non-sectarian elementary and secondary schools. No 14student shall be subjected to bullying:15        (1) during any school-sponsored education program or 16    activity;17        (2) while in school, on school property, on school 18    buses or other school vehicles, at designated school bus 19    stops waiting for the school bus, or at school-sponsored 20    or school-sanctioned events or activities;21        (3) through the transmission of information from a 22    school computer, a school computer network, or other 23    similar electronic school equipment; or 24        (4) through the transmission of information from a 25    computer that is accessed at a nonschool-related location, 26    activity, function, or program or from the use of   HB1583- 53 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1    technology or an electronic device that is not owned, 2    leased, or used by a school district or school if the 3    bullying causes a substantial disruption to the 4    educational process or orderly operation of a school. This 5    item (4) applies only in cases in which a school 6    administrator or teacher receives a report that bullying 7    through this means has occurred and does not require a 8    district or school to staff or monitor any 9    nonschool-related activity, function, or program. 10    (a-5) Nothing in this Section is intended to infringe upon 11any right to exercise free expression or the free exercise of 12religion or religiously based views protected under the First 13Amendment to the United States Constitution or under Section 3 14of Article I of the Illinois Constitution. 15    (b) In this Section: 16    "Bullying" includes "cyber-bullying" and means any severe 17or pervasive physical or verbal act or conduct, including 18communications made in writing or electronically, directed 19toward a student or students that has or can be reasonably 20predicted to have the effect of one or more of the following:21        (1) placing the student or students in reasonable fear 22    of harm to the student's or students' person or property;23        (2) causing a substantially detrimental effect on the 24    student's or students' physical or mental health;25        (3) substantially interfering with the student's or 26    students' academic performance; or  HB1583- 54 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1        (4) substantially interfering with the student's or 2    students' ability to participate in or benefit from the 3    services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.4    Bullying, as defined in this subsection (b), may take 5various forms, including without limitation one or more of the 6following: harassment, threats, intimidation, stalking, 7physical violence, sexual harassment, sexual violence, theft, 8public humiliation, destruction of property, or retaliation 9for asserting or alleging an act of bullying.

The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 17at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 18date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 19hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 20shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 21heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 22as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 23the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 24reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 25is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision   HB1583- 9 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 2the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 3transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 4in Article 13A or 13B of this Code.

If a student is suspended due to 26gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board   HB1583- 20 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 2reasons. 3    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 4parents or guardians of a student along with a full statement 5of the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right 6to a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 7notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 8suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardians, 9the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 10review such action of the superintendent or principal, 11assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 12parents or guardians of the student may appear and discuss the 13suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 14officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 15a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 16its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 17hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 18appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 19subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 20decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 21misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 22suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 23specific duration of the suspension.24    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 25and consequences available to school officials, school 26exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions,   HB1583- 21 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 2and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 3extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 4only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 5students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 6recommended that school officials consider forms of 7non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 8suspensions or expulsions. 9    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 10Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 11by which school administrators are required to suspend or 12expel students for particular behaviors.13    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 14used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 15pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 16students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 17subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 18other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 19a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 20School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 21such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 22length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.23    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 24out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 25and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 26only if other appropriate and available behavioral and   HB1583- 22 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 2student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 3a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 4the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 5interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 6this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 7students, staff, or members of the school community" and 8"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 9operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 10basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 11(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 12available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 13exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 14shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 15address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 16exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 17suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 18Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 19of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 20interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 21there were no other appropriate and available interventions.22    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 23than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 24support services during the period of their suspension. For 25purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 26support services" shall be determined by school authorities.   HB1583- 23 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 2this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 3to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 4such appropriate and available services. 5    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 6appropriate and available support services.7    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 8re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 9expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 10consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 11Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 12and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 13suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 14alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 15Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 16    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 17suspended students, including those students suspended from 18the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 19school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 20equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 21a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 22that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 23alternate transportation to school. 24    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 25subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 26subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be   HB1583- 24 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 2parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 3violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 4parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 5emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 6throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 7its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 8student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 9emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany 10the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 11representative or support person must comply with any rules of 12the school district's hearing process. If the representative 13or support person violates the rules or engages in behavior or 14advocacy that harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a 15witness, or anyone else in attendance at the hearing, the 16representative or support person may be prohibited from 17further participation in the hearing or proceeding. A 18suspension or expulsion proceeding under this subsection 19(b-35) must be conducted independently from any ongoing 20criminal investigation or proceeding, and an absence of 21pending or possible criminal charges, criminal investigations, 22or proceedings may not be a factor in school disciplinary 23decisions.24    (b-40) During a suspension review hearing conducted under 25subsection (b) or an expulsion hearing conducted under 26subsection (a) that involves allegations of sexual violence by   HB1583- 25 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1the student who is subject to discipline, neither the student 2nor his or her representative shall directly question nor have 3direct contact with the alleged victim. The student who is 4subject to discipline or his or her representative may, at the 5discretion and direction of the school board or its appointed 6hearing officer, suggest questions to be posed by the school 7board or its appointed hearing officer to the alleged victim. 8    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 9local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 10meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 11the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.12    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 13provide ongoing professional development to all school 14personnel, school board members, school safety officers, and 15school resource officers on the requirements of this Section 16and Section 10-20.14, the adverse consequences of school 17exclusion and justice-system involvement, effective classroom 18management strategies, culturally responsive discipline, 19trauma-responsive learning environments, as defined in 20subsection (b) of Section 3-11, the appropriate and available 21supportive services for the promotion of student attendance 22and engagement, and developmentally appropriate disciplinary 23methods that promote positive and healthy school climates. 24    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 25time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 26case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have   HB1583- 26 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1brought one of the following objects to school, any 2school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 3that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 4expelled for a period of not less than one year:5        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 6    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 7    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 8    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 9    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 10    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period 11    under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the 12    superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may 13    be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.14        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon 15    regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other 16    object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily 17    harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in 18    subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). The expulsion 19    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 20    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 21    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 22Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 23consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 24Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 25expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 26transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with   HB1583- 27 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1Article 13A of the School Code.2    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 3superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 4principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 5student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 6a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 7calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 8that student has been determined to have made an explicit 9threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 10student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 11website through which the threat was made is a site that was 12accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 13was available to third parties who worked or studied within 14the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 15the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 16the safety and security of the threatened individual because 17of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 18student inside the school. 19    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 20authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 21lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 22equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 23personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 24without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 25search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 26Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of   HB1583- 28 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 2left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 3the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 4conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 5lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 6controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 7illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 8searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 9If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 10evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 11the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 12such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 13disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also 14turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.15    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or 16expulsion from school and all school activities and a 17prohibition from being present on school grounds.18    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if 19a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any 20public or private school in this or any other state, the 21student must complete the entire term of the suspension or 22expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A 23of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program 24under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the 25school district if there is no threat to the safety of students 26or staff in the alternative program. A school district that   HB1583- 29 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1adopts a policy under this subsection (g) must include a 2provision allowing for consideration of any mitigating 3factors, including, but not limited to, a student's status as 4a parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 5violence, as defined in Article 26A. 6    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 7students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 8difficulties.9    (i) A student may not be issued a monetary fine or fee as a 10disciplinary consequence, though this shall not preclude 11requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, stolen, 12or damaged property.13    (j) Subsections (a) through (i) of this Section shall 14apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter schools, 15special charter districts, and school districts organized 16under Article 34 of this Code. 17    (k) Through June 30, 2026, the expulsion of students 18enrolled in programs funded under Section 1C-2 of this Code is 19subject to the requirements under paragraph (7) of subsection 20(a) of Section 2-3.71 of this Code.21    (k-5) On and after July 1, 2026, the expulsion of children 22enrolled in programs funded under Section 15-25 of the 23Department of Early Childhood Act is subject to the 24requirements of paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 2515-30 of the Department of Early Childhood Act. 26    (l) An in-school suspension program provided by a school   HB1583- 30 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may 2focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and 3positive interaction with other students and school personnel. 4A school district may employ a school social worker or a 5licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school 6suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12. 7(Source: P.A. 102-466, eff. 7-1-25; 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 8102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-594, eff. 6-25-24; 103-896, eff. 98-9-24; revised 9-25-24.) 10    (105 ILCS 5/17-2.11)  (from Ch. 122, par. 17-2.11)11    Sec. 17-2.11.

If the estimated cost to effectuate emergency repairs is 15greater than the amount specified in Section 10-20.21 of this 16Code, then the school district shall proceed in conformity 17with Section 10-20.21 of this Code and with rules established 18by the State Board of Education to address such situations. 19The rules adopted by the State Board of Education to deal with 20these situations shall stipulate that emergency situations 21must be expedited and given priority consideration. For 22purposes of this paragraph, an emergency is a situation that 23presents an imminent and continuing threat to the health and 24safety of students or other occupants of a facility, requires 25complete or partial evacuation of a building or part of a 26building, or consumes one or more of the 5 emergency days built   HB1583- 33 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1into the adopted calendar of the school or schools or would 2otherwise be expected to cause such school or schools to fall 3short of the minimum school calendar requirements. 4    (b) Whenever any such district determines that it is 5necessary for energy conservation purposes that any school 6building or permanent, fixed equipment should be altered or 7reconstructed and that such alterations or reconstruction will 8be made with funds not necessary for the completion of 9approved and recommended projects contained in any safety 10survey report or amendments thereto authorized by Section 112-3.12 of this Act; the district may levy a tax or issue bonds 12as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.13    (c) Whenever any such district determines that it is 14necessary for accessibility purposes and to comply with the 15school building code that any school building or equipment 16should be altered or reconstructed and that such alterations 17or reconstruction will be made with funds not necessary for 18the completion of approved and recommended projects contained 19in any safety survey report or amendments thereto authorized 20under Section 2-3.12 of this Act, the district may levy a tax 21or issue bonds as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.22    (d) Whenever any such district determines that it is 23necessary for school security purposes and the related 24protection and safety of pupils and school personnel that any 25school building or property should be altered or reconstructed 26or that security systems and equipment (including but not   HB1583- 34 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1limited to intercom, early detection and warning, access 2control and television monitoring systems) should be purchased 3and installed, and that such alterations, reconstruction or 4purchase and installation of equipment will be made with funds 5not necessary for the completion of approved and recommended 6projects contained in any safety survey report or amendment 7thereto authorized by Section 2-3.12 of this Act and will 8deter and prevent unauthorized entry or activities upon school 9property by unknown or dangerous persons, assure early 10detection and advance warning of any such actual or attempted 11unauthorized entry or activities and help assure the continued 12safety of pupils and school staff if any such unauthorized 13entry or activity is attempted or occurs; the district may 14levy a tax or issue bonds as provided in subsection (a) of this 15Section.16    If such a school district determines that it is necessary 17for school security purposes and the related protection and 18safety of pupils and school staff to hire a school resource 19officer or that personnel costs for school counselors, mental 20health experts, school safety officers, or school resource 21officers are necessary and the district determines that it 22does not need funds for any of the other purposes set forth in 23this Section, then the district may levy a tax or issue bonds 24as provided in subsection (a). 25    (e) If a school district does not need funds for other fire 26prevention and safety projects, including the completion of   HB1583- 35 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1approved and recommended projects contained in any safety 2survey report or amendments thereto authorized by Section 32-3.12 of this Act, and it is determined after a public hearing 4(which is preceded by at least one published notice (i) 5occurring at least 7 days prior to the hearing in a newspaper 6of general circulation within the school district and (ii) 7setting forth the time, date, place, and general subject 8matter of the hearing) that there is a substantial, immediate, 9and otherwise unavoidable threat to the health, safety, or 10welfare of pupils due to disrepair of school sidewalks, 11playgrounds, parking lots, or school bus turnarounds and 12repairs must be made; then the district may levy a tax or issue 13bonds as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.14    (f) For purposes of this Section a school district may 15replace a school building or build additions to replace 16portions of a building when it is determined that the 17effectuation of the recommendations for the existing building 18will cost more than the replacement costs. Such determination 19shall be based on a comparison of estimated costs made by an 20architect or engineer licensed in the State of Illinois. The 21new building or addition shall be equivalent in area (square 22feet) and comparable in purpose and grades served and may be on 23the same site or another site.

Sexual abuse at schools.3    (a) The General Assembly finds that: 4        (1) investigation of a child regarding an incident of 5    sexual abuse can induce significant trauma for the child;6        (2) it is desirable to prevent multiple interviews of 7    a child at a school; and8        (3) it is important to recognize the role of 9    Children's Advocacy Centers in conducting developmentally 10    appropriate investigations. 11    (b) In this Section:12    "Alleged incident of sexual abuse" is limited to an 13incident of sexual abuse of a child that is alleged to have 14been perpetrated by school personnel, including a school 15vendor or volunteer, that occurred (i) on school grounds or 16during a school activity or (ii) outside of school grounds or 17not during a school activity. 18    "Appropriate law enforcement agency" means a law 19enforcement agency whose employees have been involved, in some 20capacity, with an investigation of a particular alleged 21incident of sexual abuse. 22    (c) If a mandated reporter within a school has knowledge 23of an alleged incident of sexual abuse, the reporter must call 24the Department of Children and Family Services' hotline 25established under Section 7.6 of the Abused and Neglected   HB1583- 42 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1Child Reporting Act immediately after obtaining the minimal 2information necessary to make a report, including the names of 3the affected parties and the allegations. The State Board of 4Education must make available materials detailing the 5information that is necessary to enable notification to the 6Department of Children and Family Services of an alleged 7incident of sexual abuse. Each school must ensure that 8mandated reporters review the State Board of Education's 9materials and materials developed by the Department of 10Children and Family Services and distributed in the school 11building under Section 7 of the Abused and Neglected Child 12Reporting Act at least once annually.13    (d) For schools in a county with an accredited Children's 14Advocacy Center, every alleged incident of sexual abuse that 15is reported to the Department of Children and Family Services' 16hotline or a law enforcement agency and is subsequently 17accepted for investigation must be referred by the entity that 18received the report to the local Children's Advocacy Center 19pursuant to that county's multidisciplinary team's protocol 20under the Children's Advocacy Center Act for investigating 21child sexual abuse allegations.22    (e) A county's local Children's Advocacy Center must, at a 23minimum, do both of the following regarding a referred case of 24an alleged incident of sexual abuse: 25        (1) Coordinate the investigation of the alleged 26    incident, as governed by the local Children's Advocacy   HB1583- 43 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1    Center's existing multidisciplinary team protocol and 2    according to National Children's Alliance accreditation 3    standards.4        (2) Facilitate communication between the 5    multidisciplinary team investigating the alleged incident 6    of sexual abuse and, if applicable, the referring school's 7    (i) Title IX officer, or his or her designee, (ii) school 8    resource officer, or (iii) personnel, or (iv) school 9    safety officer leading the school's investigation into the 10    alleged incident of sexual abuse. If a school uses a 11    designated entity to investigate a sexual abuse 12    allegation, the multidisciplinary team may correspond only 13    with that entity and any reference in this Section to 14    "school" refers to that designated entity. This 15    facilitation of communication must, at a minimum, ensure 16    that all applicable parties have each other's contact 17    information and must share the county's local Children's 18    Advocacy Center's protocol regarding the process of 19    approving the viewing of a forensic interview, as defined 20    under Section 2.5 of the Children's Advocacy Center Act, 21    by school personnel and a contact person for questions 22    relating to the protocol. 23    (f) After an alleged incident of sexual abuse is accepted 24for investigation by the Department of Children and Family 25Services or a law enforcement agency and while the criminal 26and child abuse investigations related to that alleged   HB1583- 44 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1incident are being conducted by the local multidisciplinary 2team, the school relevant to the alleged incident of sexual 3abuse must comply with both of the following:4        (1) It may not interview the alleged victim regarding 5    details of the alleged incident of sexual abuse until 6    after the completion of the forensic interview of that 7    victim is conducted at a Children's Advocacy Center. This 8    paragraph does not prohibit a school from requesting 9    information from the alleged victim or his or her parent 10    or guardian to ensure the safety and well-being of the 11    alleged victim at school during an investigation.12        (2) If asked by a law enforcement agency or an 13    investigator of the Department of Children and Family 14    Services who is conducting the investigation, it must 15    inform those individuals of any evidence the school has 16    gathered pertaining to an alleged incident of sexual 17    abuse, as permissible by federal or State law. 18    (g) After completion of a forensic interview, the 19multidisciplinary team must notify the school relevant to the 20alleged incident of sexual abuse of its completion. If, for 21any reason, a multidisciplinary team determines it will not 22conduct a forensic interview in a specific investigation, the 23multidisciplinary team must notify the school as soon as the 24determination is made. If a forensic interview has not been 25conducted within 15 calendar days after opening an 26investigation, the school may notify the multidisciplinary   HB1583- 45 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1team that it intends to interview the alleged victim. No later 2than 10 calendar days after this notification, the 3multidisciplinary team may conduct the forensic interview and, 4if the multidisciplinary team does not conduct the interview, 5the school may proceed with its interview.6    (h) To the greatest extent possible considering student 7safety and Title IX compliance, school personnel may view the 8electronic recordings of a forensic interview of an alleged 9victim of an incident of sexual abuse. As a means to avoid 10additional interviews of an alleged victim, school personnel 11must be granted viewing access to the electronic recording of 12a forensic interview conducted at an accredited Children's 13Advocacy Center for an alleged incident of sexual abuse only 14if the school receives (i) approval from the multidisciplinary 15team investigating the case and (ii) informed consent by a 16child over the age of 13 or the child's parent or guardian. 17Each county's local Children's Advocacy Center and 18multidisciplinary team must establish an internal protocol 19regarding the process of approving the viewing of the forensic 20interview, and this process and the contact person must be 21shared with the school contact at the time of the initial 22facilitation. Whenever possible, the school's viewing of the 23electronic recording of a forensic interview should be 24conducted in lieu of the need for additional interviews.25    (i) For an alleged incident of sexual abuse that has been 26accepted for investigation by a multidisciplinary team, if,   HB1583- 46 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1during the course of its internal investigation and at any 2point during or after the multidisciplinary team's 3investigation, the school determines that it needs to 4interview the alleged victim to successfully complete its 5investigation and the victim is under 18 years of age, a child 6advocate must be made available to the student and may be 7present during the school's interview. A child advocate may be 8a school social worker, a school or equally qualified 9psychologist, or a person in a position the State Board of 10Education has identified as an appropriate advocate for the 11student during a school's investigation into an alleged 12incident of sexual abuse.13    (j) The Department of Children and Family Services must 14notify the relevant school when an agency investigation of an 15alleged incident of sexual abuse is complete. The notification 16must include information on the outcome of that investigation.17    (k) The appropriate law enforcement agency must notify the 18relevant school when an agency investigation of an alleged 19incident of sexual abuse is complete or has been suspended. 20The notification must include information on the outcome of 21that investigation.22    (l) This Section applies to all schools operating under 23this Code, including, but not limited to, public schools 24located in cities having a population of more than 500,000, a 25school operated pursuant to an agreement with a public school 26district, alternative schools operated by third parties, an   HB1583- 47 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1alternative learning opportunities program, a public school 2administered by a local public agency or the Department of 3Human Services, charter schools operating under the authority 4of Article 27A, and non-public schools recognized by the State 5Board of Education. 6(Source: P.A. 101-531, eff. 8-23-19; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21.) 7    (105 ILCS 5/22-88)8    Sec. 22-88. Parental notification of law enforcement 9detainment and questioning on school grounds.10    (a) In this Section, "school grounds" means the real 11property comprising an active and operational elementary or 12secondary school during the regular hours in which school is 13in session and when students are present. 14    (b) Before detaining and questioning a student on school 15grounds who is under 18 years of age and who is suspected of 16committing a criminal act, a law enforcement officer, a school 17resource officer, school safety officer, or other school 18security personnel must do all of the following:19        (1) Ensure that notification or attempted notification 20    of the student's parent or guardian is made.21        (2) Document the time and manner in which the 22    notification or attempted notification under paragraph (1) 23    occurred.24        (3) Make reasonable efforts to ensure that the 25    student's parent or guardian is present during the   HB1583- 48 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1    questioning or, if the parent or guardian is not present, 2    ensure that school personnel, including, but not limited 3    to, a school social worker, a school psychologist, a 4    school nurse, a school counselor, or any other mental 5    health professional, are present during the questioning.6        (4) If practicable, make reasonable efforts to ensure 7    that a law enforcement officer trained in promoting safe 8    interactions and communications with youth is present 9    during the questioning. An officer who received training 10    in youth investigations approved or certified by his or 11    her law enforcement agency or under Section 10.22 of the 12    Police Training Act or a juvenile police officer, as 13    defined under Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 14    1987, satisfies the requirement under this paragraph.15    (c) This Section does not limit the authority of a law 16enforcement officer to make an arrest on school grounds. This 17Section does not apply to circumstances that would cause a 18reasonable person to believe that urgent and immediate action 19is necessary to do any of the following:20        (1) Prevent bodily harm or injury to the student or 21    any other person.22        (2) Apprehend an armed or fleeing suspect.23        (3) Prevent the destruction of evidence.24        (4) Address an emergency or other dangerous situation. 25(Source: P.A. 101-478, eff. 8-23-19; 102-197, eff. 7-30-21; 26102-558, eff. 8-20-21.)   HB1583- 49 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1    (105 ILCS 5/26A-20)2    (This Section may contain text from a Public Act with a 3delayed effective date)4    Sec. 26A-20. Review and revision of policies and 5procedures.6    (a) No later than July 1, 2024 and every 2 years 7thereafter, each school district must review all existing 8policies and procedures and must revise any existing policies 9and procedures that may act as a barrier to the immediate 10enrollment and re-enrollment, attendance, graduation, and 11success in school of any student who is a student parent, 12expectant student parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 13violence or any policies or procedures that may compromise a 14criminal investigation relating to domestic or sexual violence 15or may re-victimize students. A school district must adopt new 16policies and procedures, as needed, to implement this Section 17and to ensure that immediate and effective steps are taken to 18respond to students who are student parents, expectant 19parents, or victims of domestic or sexual violence.20    (b) A school district's policy must be consistent with the 21model policy and procedures adopted by the State Board of 22Education and under Public Act 101-531.23    (c) A school district's policy on the procedures that a 24student or his or her parent or guardian may follow if he or 25she chooses to report an incident of alleged domestic or   HB1583- 50 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1sexual violence must, at a minimum, include all of the 2following: 3        (1) The name and contact information for domestic or 4    sexual violence and parenting resource personnel, the 5    Title IX coordinator, school and school district resource 6    officers, school safety officers, or security, and a 7    community-based domestic or sexual violence organization.8        (2) The name, title, and contact information for 9    confidential resources and a description of what 10    confidential reporting means.11        (3) An option for the student or the student's parent 12    or guardian to electronically, anonymously, and 13    confidentially report the incident.14        (4) An option for reports by third parties and 15    bystanders.16        (5) Information regarding the various individuals, 17    departments, or organizations to whom a student may report 18    an incident of domestic or sexual violence, specifying for 19    each individual or entity (i) the extent of the 20    individual's or entity's reporting obligation to the 21    school's or school district's administration, Title IX 22    coordinator, or other personnel or entity, (ii) the 23    individual's or entity's ability to protect the student's 24    privacy, and (iii) the extent of the individual's or 25    entity's ability to have confidential communications with 26    the student or his or her parent or guardian.  HB1583- 51 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1        (6) The adoption of a complaint resolution procedure 2    as provided in Section 26A-25. 3    (d) A school district must post its revised policies and 4procedures on its website, distribute them at the beginning of 5each school year to each student, and make copies available to 6each student and his or her parent or guardian for inspection 7and copying at no cost to the student or parent or guardian at 8each school within a school district. 9(Source: P.A. 102-466, eff. 7-1-25.) 10    (105 ILCS 5/27-23.7)11    Sec. 27-23.7. Bullying prevention.12    (a) The General Assembly finds that a safe and civil 13school environment is necessary for students to learn and 14achieve and that bullying causes physical, psychological, and 15emotional harm to students and interferes with students' 16ability to learn and participate in school activities. The 17General Assembly further finds that bullying has been linked 18to other forms of antisocial behavior, such as vandalism, 19shoplifting, skipping and dropping out of school, fighting, 20using drugs and alcohol, sexual harassment, and sexual 21violence. Because of the negative outcomes associated with 22bullying in schools, the General Assembly finds that school 23districts, charter schools, and non-public, non-sectarian 24elementary and secondary schools should educate students, 25parents, and school district, charter school, or non-public,   HB1583- 52 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1non-sectarian elementary or secondary school personnel about 2what behaviors constitute prohibited bullying.3    Bullying on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, 4religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, physical appearance, 5socioeconomic status, academic status, pregnancy, parenting 6status, homelessness, age, marital status, physical or mental 7disability, military status, sexual orientation, 8gender-related identity or expression, unfavorable discharge 9from military service, association with a person or group with 10one or more of the aforementioned actual or perceived 11characteristics, or any other distinguishing characteristic is 12prohibited in all school districts, charter schools, and 13non-public, non-sectarian elementary and secondary schools. No 14student shall be subjected to bullying:15        (1) during any school-sponsored education program or 16    activity;17        (2) while in school, on school property, on school 18    buses or other school vehicles, at designated school bus 19    stops waiting for the school bus, or at school-sponsored 20    or school-sanctioned events or activities;21        (3) through the transmission of information from a 22    school computer, a school computer network, or other 23    similar electronic school equipment; or 24        (4) through the transmission of information from a 25    computer that is accessed at a nonschool-related location, 26    activity, function, or program or from the use of   HB1583- 53 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1    technology or an electronic device that is not owned, 2    leased, or used by a school district or school if the 3    bullying causes a substantial disruption to the 4    educational process or orderly operation of a school. This 5    item (4) applies only in cases in which a school 6    administrator or teacher receives a report that bullying 7    through this means has occurred and does not require a 8    district or school to staff or monitor any 9    nonschool-related activity, function, or program. 10    (a-5) Nothing in this Section is intended to infringe upon 11any right to exercise free expression or the free exercise of 12religion or religiously based views protected under the First 13Amendment to the United States Constitution or under Section 3 14of Article I of the Illinois Constitution. 15    (b) In this Section: 16    "Bullying" includes "cyber-bullying" and means any severe 17or pervasive physical or verbal act or conduct, including 18communications made in writing or electronically, directed 19toward a student or students that has or can be reasonably 20predicted to have the effect of one or more of the following:21        (1) placing the student or students in reasonable fear 22    of harm to the student's or students' person or property;23        (2) causing a substantially detrimental effect on the 24    student's or students' physical or mental health;25        (3) substantially interfering with the student's or 26    students' academic performance; or  HB1583- 54 -LRB104 08760 RTM 18814 b1        (4) substantially interfering with the student's or 2    students' ability to participate in or benefit from the 3    services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.4    Bullying, as defined in this subsection (b), may take 5various forms, including without limitation one or more of the 6following: harassment, threats, intimidation, stalking, 7physical violence, sexual harassment, sexual violence, theft, 8public humiliation, destruction of property, or retaliation 9for asserting or alleging an act of bullying.
