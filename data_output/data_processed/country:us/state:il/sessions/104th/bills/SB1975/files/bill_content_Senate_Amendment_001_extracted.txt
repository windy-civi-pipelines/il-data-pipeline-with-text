However, evidence of the 21        pendency of an appeal is admissible.22            (l) An acquittal or dismissal in a criminal 23        proceeding for violations of the Act giving rise to 24        the forfeiture of property herein shall not preclude 25        civil proceedings under this provision; however, for 26        good cause shown, on a motion by the Secretary of   10400SB1975sam001- 78 -LRB104 10391 SPS 23286 a1        State, the court may stay civil forfeiture proceedings 2        during the criminal trial for a related criminal 3        indictment or information alleging violation of the 4        provisions of Section 12 of the Illinois Securities 5        Law of 1953.

Upon the conversion of such 26securities to cash, the Secretary of State may then proceed to   10400SB1975sam001- 40 -LRB104 10391 SPS 23286 a1dispose of the sum received for such securities among the 2respective holders of such contracts as their interests may 3appear.

The obligation contained in 8this subsection J shall continue until such time as offers and 9sales of the face amount certificate contracts registered 10under this Section 6 are no longer being made in this State by 11the applicant or registrant.12    K.

The notice to investors shall 15        identify the name, address, and other identifying 16        information about any defendant prosecuted for 17        violations of this Act that resulted in forfeiture and 18        sale of property, the offense for which the defendant 19        was convicted, and that the court has ordered 20        forfeiture and sale of property for claims of 21        investors who incurred losses or damages as a result 22        of the violations.
