The respondent's failure to request 26a hearing within 30 days after receipt of the order shall   SB1975- 69 -LRB104 10391 SPS 20466 b1constitute an admission of any facts alleged therein and shall 2make the order final.

The order shall 5take effect immediately upon its entry. Immediately after 6taking the action the Secretary of State shall deliver a copy 7of the order to the named Respondent by personal service or 8registered mail or certified mail, return receipt requested.

The 14Secretary of State is hereby authorized to deal with such 15securities on deposit in this State for the benefit of the 16holders of such face amount certificate contracts, in his or 17her name or, if the Court shall so order, in the name of the 18issuer. The Secretary of State may, subject to the approval of 19the Court, sell or otherwise dispose of the securities so 20deposited or any part thereof. The Secretary of State shall as 21soon as may be conveniently possible, give notice by 22publication as provided by law, and as the Court may direct, to 23all contract holders residing in this State who may have 24claims against the issuer under such face amount certificate 25contracts and for whose benefit such deposit is held, to file 26and prove their claims in the manner and within the time the   SB1975- 39 -LRB104 10391 SPS 20466 b1Court shall direct. In order to preserve so far as possible the 2rights and interests of the holders of outstanding contracts 3of such issuer who reside in this State, the Secretary of State 4may liquidate such securities on deposit in this State by 5entering into contracts with any issuer or person able to buy 6such securities in whole, or in part. Upon receiving an offer 7or offers for the purchase of such securities in whole, or in 8part, the Secretary of State shall submit such offer or offers 9to the Court, and if, after a full hearing upon the petition 10filed by the Secretary of State, the court shall find that the 11Secretary of State endeavored to obtain the best contract 12price for the benefit of the contract holders, and if the court 13shall find that the best contract price in the interests of the 14contract holders has been obtained, and that it is for the best 15interests of the holders of such contracts that such 16securities be sold, the court shall, by written order approve 17the acts of the Secretary of State and authorize him or her to 18dispose of such securities. Upon the conversion of such 19securities to cash, the Secretary of State may then proceed to 20dispose of the sum received for such securities among the 21respective holders of such contracts as their interests may 22appear. Upon the liquidation and distribution of such funds, 23the Secretary of State may make proper liquidation of such 24securities and the distribution or disposition thereof or of 25the proceeds therefrom as herein provided.26    For the purpose of liquidation of such securities, the   SB1975- 40 -LRB104 10391 SPS 20466 b1Secretary of State shall have the power to appoint one or more 2special deputies as his or her agent or agents and to employ 3such clerks, assistants or attorneys as may by him or her be 4deemed necessary and to give each of such persons such power to 5assist him or her as he or she may consider wise.

The obligation contained in   SB1975- 41 -LRB104 10391 SPS 20466 b1this subsection J shall continue until such time as offers and 2sales of the face amount certificate contracts registered 3under this Section 6 are no longer being made in this State by 4the applicant or registrant.5    K.

The respondent's failure to request 26a hearing within 30 days after receipt of the order shall   SB1975- 69 -LRB104 10391 SPS 20466 b1constitute an admission of any facts alleged therein and shall 2make the order final.
