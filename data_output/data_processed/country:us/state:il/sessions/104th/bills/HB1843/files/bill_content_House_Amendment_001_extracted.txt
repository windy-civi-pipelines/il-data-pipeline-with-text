Zoning powers. 8    (a) To the end that adequate light, pure air, and safety 9from fire and other dangers may be secured, that the taxable 10value of land and buildings throughout the municipality may be 11conserved, that congestion in the public streets may be 12lessened or avoided, that the hazards to persons and damage to 13property resulting from the accumulation or runoff of storm or 14flood waters may be lessened or avoided, and that the public 15health, safety, comfort, morals, and welfare may otherwise be 16promoted, and to insure and facilitate the preservation of   10400HB1843ham001- 2 -LRB104 11318 RTM 25063 a1sites, areas, and structures of historical, architectural and 2aesthetic importance; the corporate authorities in each 3municipality have the following powers:4        (1) to regulate and limit the height and bulk of 5    buildings hereafter to be erected;6        (2) to establish, regulate and limit, subject to the 7    provisions of Division 14 of this Article 11, the building 8    or set-back lines on or along any street, traffic-way, 9    drive, parkway or storm or floodwater runoff channel or 10    basin;11        (3) to regulate and limit the intensity of the use of 12    lot areas, and to regulate and determine the area of open 13    spaces, within and surrounding such buildings;14        (4) to classify, regulate, and restrict the location 15    of trades and industries and the location of buildings 16    designed for specified industrial, business, residential, 17    and other uses;18        (5) to divide the entire municipality into districts 19    of such number, shape, area, and of such different classes 20    (according to use of land and buildings, height and bulk 21    of buildings, intensity of the use of lot area, area of 22    open spaces, or other classification) as may be deemed 23    best suited to carry out the purposes of this Division 13;24        (6) to fix standards to which buildings or structures 25    therein shall conform;26        (7) to prohibit uses, buildings, or structures   10400HB1843ham001- 3 -LRB104 11318 RTM 25063 a1    incompatible with the character of such districts;2        (8) to prevent additions to and alteration or 3    remodeling of existing buildings or structures in such a 4    way as to avoid the restrictions and limitations lawfully 5    imposed under this Division 13;6        (9) except as provided in paragraph (2) of subsection 7    (c), to classify, to regulate, and restrict the use of 8    property on the basis of family relationship, which family 9    relationship may be defined as one or more persons each 10    related to the other by blood, marriage or adoption and 11    maintaining a common household;12        (10) to regulate or forbid any structure or activity 13    which may hinder access to solar energy necessary for the 14    proper functioning of a solar energy system, as defined in 15    Section 1.2 of the Comprehensive Solar Energy Act of 1977;16        (11) to require the creation and preservation of 17    affordable housing, including the power to provide 18    increased density or other zoning incentives to developers 19    who are creating, establishing, or preserving affordable 20    housing;

except that, other than 26    reasonable restrictions as to size, no home rule or   10400HB1843ham001- 4 -LRB104 11318 RTM 25063 a1    non-home rule municipality may prohibit the display of 2    outdoor political campaign signs on residential property 3    during any period of time, the regulation of these signs 4    being a power and function of the State and, therefor, 5    this item (12) is a denial and limitation of concurrent 6    home rule powers and functions under subsection (i) of 7    Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution.8    (b) The powers enumerated in this Section may not be used 9in any way that violates or otherwise contradicts any other 10applicable State or federal law, including the federal Fair 11Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act.12    (c) A municipality may not adopt zoning regulations that 13prohibit:14        (1) the creation of a community-integrated living 15    arrangement or housing for a community-integrated living 16    arrangement; or17        (2) notwithstanding paragraph (9) of subsection (a), 2 18    or more individuals, who are not related by blood, from 19    living together in a community-integrated living 20    arrangement or housing for a community-integrated living 21    arrangement. 22    (d) The powers enumerated may be exercised within the 23corporate limits or within contiguous territory not more than 24one and one-half miles beyond the corporate limits and not 25included within any municipality. However, if any municipality 26adopts a plan pursuant to Division 12 of Article 11 which plan   10400HB1843ham001- 5 -LRB104 11318 RTM 25063 a1includes in its provisions a provision that the plan applies 2to such contiguous territory not more than one and one-half 3miles beyond the corporate limits and not included in any 4municipality, then no other municipality shall adopt a plan 5that shall apply to any territory included within the 6territory provided in the plan first so adopted by another 7municipality. No municipality shall exercise any power set 8forth in this Division 13 outside the corporate limits 9thereof, if the county in which such municipality is situated 10has adopted "An Act in relation to county zoning", approved 11June 12, 1935, as amended. Nothing in this Section prevents a 12municipality of more than 112,000 population located in a 13county of less than 185,000 population that has adopted a 14zoning ordinance and the county that adopted the zoning 15ordinance from entering into an intergovernmental agreement 16that allows the municipality to exercise its zoning powers 17beyond its territorial limits; provided, however, that the 18intergovernmental agreement must be limited to the territory 19within the municipality's planning jurisdiction as defined by 20law or any existing boundary agreement. The county and the 21municipality must amend their individual zoning maps in the 22same manner as other zoning changes are incorporated into 23revised zoning maps. No such intergovernmental agreement may 24authorize a municipality to exercise its zoning powers, other 25than powers that a county may exercise under Section 5-12001 26of the Counties Code, with respect to land used for   10400HB1843ham001- 6 -LRB104 11318 RTM 25063 a1agricultural purposes. This amendatory Act of the 92nd General 2Assembly is declarative of existing law. No municipality may 3exercise any power set forth in this Division 13 outside the 4corporate limits of the municipality with respect to a 5facility of a telecommunications carrier defined in Section 65-12001.1 of the Counties Code. 7    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the 8contrary, 30 days prior to the issuance of any permits for a 9new telecommunications facility within 1.5 miles of a 10municipality, the telecommunications carrier constructing the 11facility shall provide written notice of its intent to 12construct the facility. The notice shall include, but not be 13limited to, the following information: (i) the name, address, 14and telephone number of the company responsible for the 15construction of the facility, (ii) the address and telephone 16number of the governmental entity that is to issue the 17building permit for the telecommunications facility, (iii) a 18site plan and site map of sufficient specificity to indicate 19both the location of the parcel where the telecommunications 20facility is to be constructed and the location of all the 21telecommunications facilities within that parcel, and (iv) the 22property index number and common address of the parcel where 23the telecommunications facility is to be located. The notice 24shall not contain any material that appears to be an 25advertisement for the telecommunications carrier or any 26services provided by the telecommunications carrier. The   10400HB1843ham001- 7 -LRB104 11318 RTM 25063 a1notice shall be provided in person, by overnight private 2courier, or by certified mail to all owners of property within 3250 feet of the parcel in which the telecommunications carrier 4has a leasehold or ownership interest. For the purposes of 5this notice requirement, "owners" means those persons or 6entities identified from the authentic tax records of the 7county in which the telecommunications facility is to be 8located. If, after a bona fide effort by the 9telecommunications carrier to determine the owner and his or 10her address, the owner of the property on whom the notice must 11be served cannot be found at the owner's last known address, or 12if the mailed notice is returned because the owner cannot be 13found at the last known address, the notice requirement of 14this paragraph is deemed satisfied. For the purposes of this 15paragraph, "facility" means that term as it is defined in 16Section 5-12001.1 of the Counties Code.17    (f) If a municipality adopts a zoning plan covering an 18area outside its corporate limits, the plan adopted shall be 19reasonable with respect to the area outside the corporate 20limits so that future development will not be hindered or 21impaired; it is reasonable for a municipality to regulate or 22prohibit the extraction of sand, gravel, or limestone even 23when those activities are related to an agricultural purpose. 24If all or any part of the area outside the corporate limits of 25a municipality which has been zoned in accordance with the 26provisions of this Division 13 is annexed to another   10400HB1843ham001- 8 -LRB104 11318 RTM 25063 a1municipality or municipalities, the annexing unit shall 2thereafter exercise all zoning powers and regulations over the 3annexed area.4    (g) In all ordinances passed under the authority of this 5Division 13, due allowance shall be made for existing 6conditions, the conservation of property values, the direction 7of building development to the best advantage of the entire 8municipality and the uses to which the property is devoted at 9the time of the enactment of such an ordinance. The powers 10conferred by this Division 13 shall not be exercised so as to 11deprive the owner of any existing property of its use or 12maintenance for the purpose to which it is then lawfully 13devoted, but provisions may be made for the gradual 14elimination of uses, buildings and structures which are 15incompatible with the character of the districts in which they 16are made or located, including, without being limited thereto, 17provisions (a) for the elimination of such uses of unimproved 18lands or lot areas when the existing rights of the persons in 19possession thereof are terminated or when the uses to which 20they are devoted are discontinued; (b) for the elimination of 21uses to which such buildings and structures are devoted, if 22they are adaptable for permitted uses; and (c) for the 23elimination of such buildings and structures when they are 24destroyed or damaged in major part, or when they have reached 25the age fixed by the corporate authorities of the municipality 26as the normal useful life of such buildings or structures.  10400HB1843ham001- 9 -LRB104 11318 RTM 25063 a1    (h) This Section amendatory Act of 1971 does not apply to 2any municipality which is a home rule unit, except that 3subsections (b) and (c) and paragraph (12) of subsection (a) 4apply to home rule municipalities as provided in item (12). A 5home rule unit may not exercise the zoning and other powers 6described in subsections (b) and (c) and paragraph (12) of 7subsection (a) in a manner that is inconsistent with the 8regulation by the State of those powers under those 9provisions. This subsection (h) is a limitation under 10subsection (i) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois 11Constitution on the concurrent exercise by home rule units of 12powers and functions exercised by the State. 13(Source: P.A. 96-904, eff. 1-1-11; 97-496, eff. 8-22-11.)".
