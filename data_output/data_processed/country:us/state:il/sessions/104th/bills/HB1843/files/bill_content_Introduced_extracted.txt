No municipality shall exercise any power set 23forth in this Division 13 outside the corporate limits 24thereof, if the county in which such municipality is situated 25has adopted "An Act in relation to county zoning", approved 26June 12, 1935, as amended. Nothing in this Section prevents a   HB1843- 5 -LRB104 11318 RTM 21404 b1municipality of more than 112,000 population located in a 2county of less than 185,000 population that has adopted a 3zoning ordinance and the county that adopted the zoning 4ordinance from entering into an intergovernmental agreement 5that allows the municipality to exercise its zoning powers 6beyond its territorial limits; provided, however, that the 7intergovernmental agreement must be limited to the territory 8within the municipality's planning jurisdiction as defined by 9law or any existing boundary agreement. The county and the 10municipality must amend their individual zoning maps in the 11same manner as other zoning changes are incorporated into 12revised zoning maps. No such intergovernmental agreement may 13authorize a municipality to exercise its zoning powers, other 14than powers that a county may exercise under Section 5-12001 15of the Counties Code, with respect to land used for 16agricultural purposes. This amendatory Act of the 92nd General 17Assembly is declarative of existing law.

The notice 13shall not contain any material that appears to be an 14advertisement for the telecommunications carrier or any 15services provided by the telecommunications carrier. The 16notice shall be provided in person, by overnight private 17courier, or by certified mail to all owners of property within 18250 feet of the parcel in which the telecommunications carrier 19has a leasehold or ownership interest. For the purposes of 20this notice requirement, "owners" means those persons or 21entities identified from the authentic tax records of the 22county in which the telecommunications facility is to be 23located. If, after a bona fide effort by the 24telecommunications carrier to determine the owner and his or 25her address, the owner of the property on whom the notice must 26be served cannot be found at the owner's last known address, or   HB1843- 7 -LRB104 11318 RTM 21404 b1if the mailed notice is returned because the owner cannot be 2found at the last known address, the notice requirement of 3this paragraph is deemed satisfied. For the purposes of this 4paragraph, "facility" means that term as it is defined in 5Section 5-12001.1 of the Counties Code.6    (g) If a municipality adopts a zoning plan covering an 7area outside its corporate limits, the plan adopted shall be 8reasonable with respect to the area outside the corporate 9limits so that future development will not be hindered or 10impaired; it is reasonable for a municipality to regulate or 11prohibit the extraction of sand, gravel, or limestone even 12when those activities are related to an agricultural purpose. 13If all or any part of the area outside the corporate limits of 14a municipality which has been zoned in accordance with the 15provisions of this Division 13 is annexed to another 16municipality or municipalities, the annexing unit shall 17thereafter exercise all zoning powers and regulations over the 18annexed area.19    (h) In all ordinances passed under the authority of this 20Division 13, due allowance shall be made for existing 21conditions, the conservation of property values, the direction 22of building development to the best advantage of the entire 23municipality and the uses to which the property is devoted at 24the time of the enactment of such an ordinance. The powers 25conferred by this Division 13 shall not be exercised so as to 26deprive the owner of any existing property of its use or   HB1843- 8 -LRB104 11318 RTM 21404 b1maintenance for the purpose to which it is then lawfully 2devoted, but provisions may be made for the gradual 3elimination of uses, buildings and structures which are 4incompatible with the character of the districts in which they 5are made or located, including, without being limited thereto, 6provisions (a) for the elimination of such uses of unimproved 7lands or lot areas when the existing rights of the persons in 8possession thereof are terminated or when the uses to which 9they are devoted are discontinued; (b) for the elimination of 10uses to which such buildings and structures are devoted, if 11they are adaptable for permitted uses; and (c) for the 12elimination of such buildings and structures when they are 13destroyed or damaged in major part, or when they have reached 14the age fixed by the corporate authorities of the municipality 15as the normal useful life of such buildings or structures.16    (i) This Section amendatory Act of 1971 does not apply to 17any municipality which is a home rule unit, except that 18subsections (b), (c), and (d) and paragraph (12) of subsection 19(a) apply to home rule municipalities as provided in item 20(12). A home rule unit may not exercise the zoning and other 21powers described in subsections (b), (c), and (d) and 22paragraph (12) of subsection (a) in a manner that is 23inconsistent with the regulation by the State of those powers 24under those provisions. This subsection (i) is a limitation 25under subsection (i) of Section 6 of Article VII of the 26Illinois Constitution on the concurrent exercise by home rule   HB1843- 9 -LRB104 11318 RTM 21404 b1units of powers and functions exercised by the State. 2(Source: P.A. 96-904, eff. 1-1-11; 97-496, eff. 8-22-11.)
