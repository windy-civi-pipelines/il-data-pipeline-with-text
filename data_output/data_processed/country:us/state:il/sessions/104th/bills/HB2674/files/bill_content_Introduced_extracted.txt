Removes a provision that requires the Department of the Lottery to publish each January in the Illinois Register a list of all game-specific rules, play instructions, directives, operations manuals, brochures, or other game-specific publications issued by the Department during the previous year and instructions concerning how the public may obtain copies of these materials from the Department. Provides that written play instructions shall be made available on the Department's public website or by the Department by request (rather than made available through sales agents licensed to sell game tickets or shares). Makes a change in a provision that makes any organization in which specified individuals are to participate in the management or sales of lottery tickets or shares ineligible for any license under the Act. Provides that the State Lottery Fund shall receive from the sale of lottery tickets or shares consisting of the net of commissions and fees representing those expenses that are directly proportionate to the sale of tickets or shares at the agent location and prizes of $600 or less (rather than less than $600) which have been validly paid at the agent level. Provides that the Department may pay any prize (rather than prizes up to $25,000) from funds held by the Department in an account separate and apart from all public moneys of the State. Removes provisions allowing moneys in the account to be deposited by the Department into the Public Treasurers' Investment Pool or used to pay amounts to deferred prize winners. Allows the Department (rather than the State Treasurer with the consent of the Director of the Lottery) to contract with any person or corporation to perform such financial functions, activities, or services in connection with operation of the lottery. Allows, with the consent of the Director, the State Treasurer to act as an agent of the Department to perform the financial functions as the Director may prescribe. Removes language requiring the Director to prepare and send to the State Comptroller vouchers requesting payment from the Deferred Lottery Prize Winners Trust Fund to deferred prize winners. Removes certain deadlines related to private managers. In provisions concerning preaudits by the State Comptroller, removes a limitation that the provisions apply to payments for prizes of $25,000 or less.
