Notwithstanding anything to the 19contrary in this paragraph, the Department may approve a 20sexual assault transfer plan for the provision of medical 21forensic services if: 22        (1) a treatment hospital with approved pediatric 23    transfer has agreed, as part of an areawide treatment 24    plan, to accept acute sexual assault survivors 13 years of 25    age or older from the proposed transfer hospital, if the 26    treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer is   HB2374- 10 -LRB104 11915 BDA 22006 b1    geographically closer to the transfer hospital than a 2    treatment hospital or another treatment hospital with 3    approved pediatric transfer and such transfer is not 4    unduly burdensome on the sexual assault survivor; and5        (2) a treatment hospital has agreed, as a part of an 6    areawide treatment plan, to accept acute sexual assault 7    survivors under 13 years of age from the proposed transfer 8    hospital and transfer to the treatment hospital would not 9    unduly burden the sexual assault survivor.10    The Department may not approve a sexual assault transfer 11plan unless a treatment hospital has agreed, as a part of an 12areawide treatment plan, to accept acute sexual assault 13survivors from the proposed transfer hospital and a transfer 14to the treatment hospital would not unduly burden the sexual 15assault survivor.16    In counties with a population of less than 1,000,000, the 17Department may not approve a sexual assault transfer plan for 18a hospital located within a 20-mile radius of a 4-year public 19university, not including community colleges, unless there is 20a treatment hospital with a sexual assault treatment plan 21approved by the Department within a 20-mile radius of the 224-year public university. 23    A transfer must be in accordance with federal and State 24laws and local ordinances.25    Hospitals located in counties with a population of less 26than 1,000,000 and within a 20-mile radius of a 4-year public   HB2374- 11 -LRB104 11915 BDA 22006 b1university shall submit an areawide sexual assault treatment 2plan that is approved by the Department.

In 15    addition to immediate health issues, such as sexually 16    transmitted infections, physical injuries, and 17    psychological trauma, child sexual abuse victims are at 18    greater risk for a plethora of adverse psychological and 19    somatic problems into adulthood in contrast to those who 20    were not sexually abused.21        (2) Sexual abuse against the pediatric population is 22    distinct, particularly due to their dependence on their 23    caregivers and the ability of perpetrators to manipulate 24    and silence them (especially when the perpetrators are 25    family members or other adults trusted by, or with power   HB2374- 34 -LRB104 11915 BDA 22006 b1    over, children).
