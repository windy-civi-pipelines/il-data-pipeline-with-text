In 17    addition to immediate health issues, such as sexually 18    transmitted infections, physical injuries, and 19    psychological trauma, child sexual abuse victims are at 20    greater risk for a plethora of adverse psychological and 21    somatic problems into adulthood in contrast to those who 22    were not sexually abused.23        (2) Sexual abuse against the pediatric population is 24    distinct, particularly due to their dependence on their 25    caregivers and the ability of perpetrators to manipulate   10400HB2374ham001- 38 -LRB104 11915 BDA 23854 a1    and silence them (especially when the perpetrators are 2    family members or other adults trusted by, or with power 3    over, children). Sexual abuse is often hidden by 4    perpetrators, unwitnessed by others, and may leave no 5    obvious physical signs on child victims.6        (3) Pediatric sexual assault survivors throughout the 7    State should have access to qualified medical providers 8    who have received specialized training regarding the care 9    of pediatric sexual assault survivors within a reasonable 10    distance from their home.11        (4) There is a need in Illinois to increase the number 12    of qualified medical providers available to provide 13    medical forensic services to pediatric sexual assault 14    survivors. 15    (b) If a medically stable pediatric acute sexual assault 16survivor presents at a transfer hospital or treatment hospital 17with approved pediatric transfer that has a plan approved by 18the Department requesting medical forensic services, then the 19hospital emergency department staff shall contact an approved 20pediatric health care facility, if one is designated in the 21hospital's plan, then the patient and non-offending parent or 22legal guardian shall be given the option to transfer to the 23approved pediatric health care facility during posted hours of 24operation or a treatment hospital. 25    If the transferring hospital confirms that medical 26forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes of the   10400HB2374ham001- 39 -LRB104 11915 BDA 23854 a1patient's arrival at the approved pediatric health care 2facility following an immediate transfer, then the hospital 3emergency department staff shall notify the patient and 4non-offending parent or legal guardian that the patient will 5be transferred for medical forensic services and shall provide 6the patient and non-offending parent or legal guardian the 7option of being transferred to the approved pediatric health 8care facility or the treatment hospital designated in the 9hospital's plan. The pediatric sexual assault survivor may be 10transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 11vehicle.12    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90 13minutes of the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 14health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 15care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 16patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses to 17be transferred to a treatment hospital, the hospital emergency 18department staff shall contact a treatment hospital designated 19in the hospital's plan to arrange for the transfer of the 20patient to the treatment hospital for medical forensic 21services, which are to be initiated within 90 minutes of the 22patient's arrival at the treatment hospital. The treatment 23hospital shall provide medical forensic services and may not 24transfer the patient to another facility.

Prior to granting approval, the Department 7shall (i) confirm the treatment hospital with approved 8pediatric transfer is working towards becoming a treatment 9hospital and (ii) consult with the treatment hospital that 10receives acute pediatric sexual assault survivors from the 11treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer pursuant 12to the plan approved by the Department. Department approval 13under this Section is valid for one year and may be renewed. If 14a medically stable pediatric sexual assault survivor presents 15at a treatment hospital that has a plan approved by the 16Department requesting medical forensic services, then the 17hospital emergency department staff shall contact an approved 18pediatric health care facility, if one is designated in the 19treatment hospital's areawide treatment plan. 20    If medical forensic services can be initiated within 90 21minutes after the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 22health care facility following an immediate transfer, the 23hospital emergency department staff shall provide the patient 24and non-offending parent or legal guardian the option of 25having medical forensic services performed at the treatment 26hospital or at the approved pediatric health care facility.

Pediatric sexual assault care.14    (a) The General Assembly finds: 15        (1) Pediatric sexual assault survivors can suffer from 16    a wide range of health problems across their life span. In 17    addition to immediate health issues, such as sexually 18    transmitted infections, physical injuries, and 19    psychological trauma, child sexual abuse victims are at 20    greater risk for a plethora of adverse psychological and 21    somatic problems into adulthood in contrast to those who 22    were not sexually abused.23        (2) Sexual abuse against the pediatric population is 24    distinct, particularly due to their dependence on their 25    caregivers and the ability of perpetrators to manipulate   10400HB2374ham001- 38 -LRB104 11915 BDA 23854 a1    and silence them (especially when the perpetrators are 2    family members or other adults trusted by, or with power 3    over, children). Sexual abuse is often hidden by 4    perpetrators, unwitnessed by others, and may leave no 5    obvious physical signs on child victims.6        (3) Pediatric sexual assault survivors throughout the 7    State should have access to qualified medical providers 8    who have received specialized training regarding the care 9    of pediatric sexual assault survivors within a reasonable 10    distance from their home.11        (4) There is a need in Illinois to increase the number 12    of qualified medical providers available to provide 13    medical forensic services to pediatric sexual assault 14    survivors. 15    (b) If a medically stable pediatric acute sexual assault 16survivor presents at a transfer hospital or treatment hospital 17with approved pediatric transfer that has a plan approved by 18the Department requesting medical forensic services, then the 19hospital emergency department staff shall contact an approved 20pediatric health care facility, if one is designated in the 21hospital's plan, then the patient and non-offending parent or 22legal guardian shall be given the option to transfer to the 23approved pediatric health care facility during posted hours of 24operation or a treatment hospital. 25    If the transferring hospital confirms that medical 26forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes of the   10400HB2374ham001- 39 -LRB104 11915 BDA 23854 a1patient's arrival at the approved pediatric health care 2facility following an immediate transfer, then the hospital 3emergency department staff shall notify the patient and 4non-offending parent or legal guardian that the patient will 5be transferred for medical forensic services and shall provide 6the patient and non-offending parent or legal guardian the 7option of being transferred to the approved pediatric health 8care facility or the treatment hospital designated in the 9hospital's plan. The pediatric sexual assault survivor may be 10transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 11vehicle.12    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90 13minutes of the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 14health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 15care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 16patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses to 17be transferred to a treatment hospital, the hospital emergency 18department staff shall contact a treatment hospital designated 19in the hospital's plan to arrange for the transfer of the 20patient to the treatment hospital for medical forensic 21services, which are to be initiated within 90 minutes of the 22patient's arrival at the treatment hospital. The treatment 23hospital shall provide medical forensic services and may not 24transfer the patient to another facility. The pediatric sexual 25assault survivor may be transported by ambulance, law 26enforcement, or personal vehicle.   10400HB2374ham001- 40 -LRB104 11915 BDA 23854 a1    (c) A treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer 2may offer medical forensic services to pediatric acute sexual 3assault survivors in lieu of transfer when a qualified medical 4provider who is qualified to treat pediatric survivors of 5sexual assault is available, subject to prior approval from 6the Department. Prior to granting approval, the Department 7shall (i) confirm the treatment hospital with approved 8pediatric transfer is working towards becoming a treatment 9hospital and (ii) consult with the treatment hospital that 10receives acute pediatric sexual assault survivors from the 11treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer pursuant 12to the plan approved by the Department. Department approval 13under this Section is valid for one year and may be renewed. If 14a medically stable pediatric sexual assault survivor presents 15at a treatment hospital that has a plan approved by the 16Department requesting medical forensic services, then the 17hospital emergency department staff shall contact an approved 18pediatric health care facility, if one is designated in the 19treatment hospital's areawide treatment plan. 20    If medical forensic services can be initiated within 90 21minutes after the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 22health care facility following an immediate transfer, the 23hospital emergency department staff shall provide the patient 24and non-offending parent or legal guardian the option of 25having medical forensic services performed at the treatment 26hospital or at the approved pediatric health care facility.

The pediatric sexual assault survivor and 18non-offending parent or legal guardian may be transported by 19ambulance, law enforcement, or personal vehicle. Medical 20forensic services shall be initiated within 90 minutes of the 21acute sexual assault survivor's arrival at the approved 22pediatric health care facility following an immediate transfer 23during posted hours of operation.24    (e) (d) If a pediatric acute sexual assault survivor 25presents at an approved pediatric health care facility 26requesting medical forensic services or the facility is   10400HB2374ham001- 42 -LRB104 11915 BDA 23854 a1contacted by law enforcement or the Department of Children and 2Family Services requesting medical forensic services for a 3pediatric acute sexual assault survivor during posted hours of 4operation, then the medical forensic services shall be 5provided at the facility if the medical forensic services can 6be initiated within 90 minutes after the patient's arrival at 7the facility. If medical forensic services cannot be initiated 8within 90 minutes after the patient's arrival at the facility, 9then the patient shall be transferred to a treatment hospital 10designated in the approved pediatric health care facility's 11plan for medical forensic services.
