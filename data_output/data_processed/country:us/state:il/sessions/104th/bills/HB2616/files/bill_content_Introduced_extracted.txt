For proper preservation of 6the specimens, collected blood and buccal specimens shall be 7dried and tissue specimens shall be frozen if available 8equipment exists. As soon as possible, but no later than 30 9days after the collection of the specimens, the coroner or 10medical examiner shall release those specimens to the police 11agency responsible for investigating the death. As soon as 12possible, but no later than 30 days after the receipt from the 13coroner or medical examiner, the police agency shall submit 14the specimens using the agency case number to a National DNA 15Index System (NDIS) participating laboratory within this 16State, such as the Illinois State Police, Division of Forensic 17Services, for analysis and categorizing into genetic marker 18groupings. The results of the analysis and categorizing into 19genetic marker groupings shall be provided to the Illinois 20State Police and shall be maintained by the Illinois State 21Police in the State central repository in the same manner, and 22subject to the same conditions, as provided in Section 5-4-3 23of the Unified Code of Corrections.

The jury commission shall 3provide at least 8 jurors to the coroner, from whom the coroner 4shall select any 6 to serve as the jury for the inquest. 5Inquests may be continued from time to time as the coroner may 6deem necessary.

At the coroner's discretion, additional 11jurors to fill such vacancies shall be supplied by the jury 12commission. A juror serving pursuant to this paragraph in such 13county shall receive compensation from the county at the same 14rate as the rate of compensation that is paid to petit or grand 15jurors in the county.16    In every case in which a fire is determined to be a 17contributing factor in a death, the coroner shall report the 18death to the Office of the State Fire Marshal. The coroner 19shall provide a copy of the death certificate (i) within 30 20days after filing the permanent death certificate and (ii) in 21a manner that is agreed upon by the coroner and the State Fire 22Marshal. 23    In every case in which a drug overdose is officially 24determined to be the cause or a contributing factor in the 25death, the coroner or medical examiner shall report the death 26to the Department of Public Health. The Department of Public   HB2616- 7 -LRB104 10405 RTM 20480 b1Health shall adopt rules regarding specific information that 2must be reported in the event of such a death, including, at a 3minimum, the following information, if possible: (i) the cause 4of the overdose; (ii) whether or not fentanyl was part or all 5of the consumed substance; (iii) if fentanyl is part of the 6consumed substance, what other substances were consumed; and 7(iv) if fentanyl is part of the consumed substance, in what 8proportion was fentanyl consumed to other substance or 9substances. The coroner must also communicate whether there 10was a suspicious level of fentanyl in combination with other 11controlled substances present to all law enforcement agencies 12in whose jurisdiction the deceased's body was found in a 13prompt manner.

The Department shall also 18provide on its website a monthly report of overdose death 19figures organized by location, age, and any other factors the 20Department deems appropriate. 21    In addition, in every case in which domestic violence is 22determined to be a contributing factor in a death, the coroner 23shall report the death to the Illinois State Police.24    All deaths in State institutions and all deaths of wards 25of the State or youth in care as defined in Section 4d of the 26Children and Family Services Act in private care facilities or   HB2616- 8 -LRB104 10405 RTM 20480 b1in programs funded by the Department of Human Services under 2its powers relating to mental health and developmental 3disabilities or alcoholism and substance abuse or funded by 4the Department of Children and Family Services shall be 5reported to the coroner of the county in which the facility is 6located.
