Sentencing hearing. 13    (a) After a determination of guilt, a hearing shall be 14held to impose the sentence. However, prior to the imposition 15of sentence on an individual being sentenced for an offense 16based upon a charge for a violation of Section 11-501 of the 17Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local 18ordinance, the individual must undergo a professional 19evaluation to determine if an alcohol or other drug abuse 20problem exists and the extent of such a problem. Programs   10400SB0008sam001- 6 -LRB104 07753 RLC 24847 a1conducting these evaluations shall be licensed by the 2Department of Human Services. However, if the individual is 3not a resident of Illinois, the court may, in its discretion, 4accept an evaluation from a program in the state of such 5individual's residence. The court shall make a specific 6finding about whether the defendant is eligible for 7participation in a Department impact incarceration program as 8provided in Section 5-8-1.1 or 5-8-1.3, and if not, provide an 9explanation as to why a sentence to impact incarceration is 10not an appropriate sentence.

This 9statement is intended solely to inform the public, has no 10legal effect on the defendant's actual release, and may not be 11relied on by the defendant on appeal.12    The judge's statement, to be given after pronouncing the 13sentence, other than when the sentence is imposed for one of 14the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) of Section 3-6-3, 15shall include the following:16    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 17the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in 18prison as a result of this sentence.

In this 22case, assuming the defendant receives all of his or her 23sentence credit, the period of estimated actual custody is ... 24years and ... months, less up to 180 days additional earned 25sentence credit. If the defendant, because of his or her own 26misconduct or failure to comply with the institutional   10400SB0008sam001- 13 -LRB104 07753 RLC 24847 a1regulations, does not receive those credits, the actual time 2served in prison will be longer.

In this 8case, the defendant is entitled to no more than 4 1/2 days of 9sentence credit for each month of his or her sentence of 10imprisonment. Therefore, this defendant will serve at least 1185% of his or her sentence. Assuming the defendant receives 4 121/2 days credit for each month of his or her sentence, the 13period of estimated actual custody is ... years and ... 14months. If the defendant, because of his or her own misconduct 15or failure to comply with the institutional regulations 16receives lesser credit, the actual time served in prison will 17be longer."18    When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed for first 19degree murder and the offense was committed on or after June 2019, 1998, the judge's statement, to be given after pronouncing 21the sentence, shall include the following:22    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 23the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in 24prison as a result of this sentence.

Sentencing hearing. 13    (a) After a determination of guilt, a hearing shall be 14held to impose the sentence. However, prior to the imposition 15of sentence on an individual being sentenced for an offense 16based upon a charge for a violation of Section 11-501 of the 17Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local 18ordinance, the individual must undergo a professional 19evaluation to determine if an alcohol or other drug abuse 20problem exists and the extent of such a problem. Programs   10400SB0008sam001- 6 -LRB104 07753 RLC 24847 a1conducting these evaluations shall be licensed by the 2Department of Human Services. However, if the individual is 3not a resident of Illinois, the court may, in its discretion, 4accept an evaluation from a program in the state of such 5individual's residence. The court shall make a specific 6finding about whether the defendant is eligible for 7participation in a Department impact incarceration program as 8provided in Section 5-8-1.1 or 5-8-1.3, and if not, provide an 9explanation as to why a sentence to impact incarceration is 10not an appropriate sentence.

This 9statement is intended solely to inform the public, has no 10legal effect on the defendant's actual release, and may not be 11relied on by the defendant on appeal.12    The judge's statement, to be given after pronouncing the 13sentence, other than when the sentence is imposed for one of 14the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) of Section 3-6-3, 15shall include the following:16    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 17the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in 18prison as a result of this sentence. The actual period of 19prison time served is determined by the statutes of Illinois 20as applied to this sentence by the Illinois Department of 21Corrections and the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. In this 22case, assuming the defendant receives all of his or her 23sentence credit, the period of estimated actual custody is ... 24years and ... months, less up to 180 days additional earned 25sentence credit. If the defendant, because of his or her own 26misconduct or failure to comply with the institutional   10400SB0008sam001- 13 -LRB104 07753 RLC 24847 a1regulations, does not receive those credits, the actual time 2served in prison will be longer.

In this 8case, the defendant is entitled to no more than 4 1/2 days of 9sentence credit for each month of his or her sentence of 10imprisonment. Therefore, this defendant will serve at least 1185% of his or her sentence. Assuming the defendant receives 4 121/2 days credit for each month of his or her sentence, the 13period of estimated actual custody is ... years and ... 14months. If the defendant, because of his or her own misconduct 15or failure to comply with the institutional regulations 16receives lesser credit, the actual time served in prison will 17be longer."18    When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed for first 19degree murder and the offense was committed on or after June 2019, 1998, the judge's statement, to be given after pronouncing 21the sentence, shall include the following:22    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 23the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in 24prison as a result of this sentence.
