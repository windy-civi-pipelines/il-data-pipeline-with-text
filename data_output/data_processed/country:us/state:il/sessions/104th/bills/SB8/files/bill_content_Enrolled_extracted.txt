This 20statement is intended solely to inform the public, has no 21legal effect on the defendant's actual release, and may not be 22relied on by the defendant on appeal.23    The judge's statement, to be given after pronouncing the 24sentence, other than when the sentence is imposed for one of 25the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) of Section 3-6-3, 26shall include the following:  SB0008 Enrolled- 42 -LRB104 07753 RLC 17798 b1    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 2the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in 3prison as a result of this sentence. The actual period of 4prison time served is determined by the statutes of Illinois 5as applied to this sentence by the Illinois Department of 6Corrections and the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. In this 7case, assuming the defendant receives all of his or her 8sentence credit, the period of estimated actual custody is ... 9years and ... months, less up to 180 days additional earned 10sentence credit. If the defendant, because of his or her own 11misconduct or failure to comply with the institutional 12regulations, does not receive those credits, the actual time 13served in prison will be longer. The defendant may also 14receive an additional one-half day sentence credit for each 15day of participation in vocational, industry, substance abuse, 16and educational programs as provided for by Illinois statute."17    When the sentence is imposed for one of the offenses 18enumerated in paragraph (a)(2) of Section 3-6-3, other than 19first degree murder, and the offense was committed on or after 20June 19, 1998, and when the sentence is imposed for reckless 21homicide as defined in subsection (e) of Section 9-3 of the 22Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 if the 23offense was committed on or after January 1, 1999, and when the 24sentence is imposed for aggravated driving under the influence 25of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or 26compounds, or any combination thereof as defined in   SB0008 Enrolled- 43 -LRB104 07753 RLC 17798 b1subparagraph (F) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Section 211-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, and when the sentence is 3imposed for aggravated arson if the offense was committed on 4or after July 27, 2001 (the effective date of Public Act 592-176), and when the sentence is imposed for aggravated 6driving under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, 7or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination 8thereof as defined in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of 9subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code 10committed on or after January 1, 2011 (the effective date of 11Public Act 96-1230), the judge's statement, to be given after 12pronouncing the sentence, shall include the following:13    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 14the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in 15prison as a result of this sentence.

In this 19case, the defendant is entitled to no more than 4 1/2 days of 20sentence credit for each month of his or her sentence of 21imprisonment. Therefore, this defendant will serve at least 2285% of his or her sentence.

The actual period of 10prison time served is determined by the statutes of Illinois 11as applied to this sentence by the Illinois Department of 12Corrections and the Illinois Prisoner Review Board.

The judge 11who presided at the trial or the judge who accepted the plea of 12guilty shall impose the sentence unless he is no longer 13sitting as a judge in that court. Where the judge does not 14impose sentence at the same time on all defendants who are 15convicted as a result of being involved in the same offense, 16the defendant or the State's Attorney may advise the 17sentencing court of the disposition of any other defendants 18who have been sentenced.19    (b-1) In imposing a sentence of imprisonment or periodic 20imprisonment for a Class 3 or Class 4 felony for which a 21sentence of probation or conditional discharge is an available 22sentence, if the defendant has no prior sentence of probation 23or conditional discharge and no prior conviction for a violent 24crime, the defendant shall not be sentenced to imprisonment 25before review and consideration of a presentence report and 26determination and explanation of why the particular evidence,   SB0008 Enrolled- 40 -LRB104 07753 RLC 17798 b1information, factor in aggravation, factual finding, or other 2reasons support a sentencing determination that one or more of 3the factors under subsection (a) of Section 5-6-1 of this Code 4apply and that probation or conditional discharge is not an 5appropriate sentence. 6    (c) In imposing a sentence for a violent crime or for an 7offense of operating or being in physical control of a vehicle 8while under the influence of alcohol, any other drug or any 9combination thereof, or a similar provision of a local 10ordinance, when such offense resulted in the personal injury 11to someone other than the defendant, the trial judge shall 12specify on the record the particular evidence, information, 13factors in mitigation and aggravation or other reasons that 14led to his sentencing determination. The full verbatim record 15of the sentencing hearing shall be filed with the clerk of the 16court and shall be a public record.17    (c-1) In imposing a sentence for the offense of aggravated 18kidnapping for ransom, home invasion, armed robbery, 19aggravated vehicular hijacking, aggravated discharge of a 20firearm, or armed violence with a category I weapon or 21category II weapon, the trial judge shall make a finding as to 22whether the conduct leading to conviction for the offense 23resulted in great bodily harm to a victim, and shall enter that 24finding and the basis for that finding in the record.25    (c-1.5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the 26contrary, in imposing a sentence for an offense that requires   SB0008 Enrolled- 41 -LRB104 07753 RLC 17798 b1a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment, the court may 2instead sentence the offender to probation, conditional 3discharge, or a lesser term of imprisonment it deems 4appropriate if: (1) the offense involves the use or possession 5of drugs, retail theft, or driving on a revoked license due to 6unpaid financial obligations; (2) the court finds that the 7defendant does not pose a risk to public safety; and (3) the 8interest of justice requires imposing a term of probation, 9conditional discharge, or a lesser term of imprisonment. The 10court must state on the record its reasons for imposing 11probation, conditional discharge, or a lesser term of 12imprisonment.13    (c-2) If the defendant is sentenced to prison, other than 14when a sentence of natural life imprisonment is imposed, at 15the time the sentence is imposed the judge shall state on the 16record in open court the approximate period of time the 17defendant will serve in custody according to the then current 18statutory rules and regulations for sentence credit found in 19Section 3-6-3 and other related provisions of this Code. This 20statement is intended solely to inform the public, has no 21legal effect on the defendant's actual release, and may not be 22relied on by the defendant on appeal.23    The judge's statement, to be given after pronouncing the 24sentence, other than when the sentence is imposed for one of 25the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) of Section 3-6-3, 26shall include the following:  SB0008 Enrolled- 42 -LRB104 07753 RLC 17798 b1    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 2the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in 3prison as a result of this sentence. The actual period of 4prison time served is determined by the statutes of Illinois 5as applied to this sentence by the Illinois Department of 6Corrections and the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. In this 7case, assuming the defendant receives all of his or her 8sentence credit, the period of estimated actual custody is ... 9years and ... months, less up to 180 days additional earned 10sentence credit. If the defendant, because of his or her own 11misconduct or failure to comply with the institutional 12regulations, does not receive those credits, the actual time 13served in prison will be longer.
