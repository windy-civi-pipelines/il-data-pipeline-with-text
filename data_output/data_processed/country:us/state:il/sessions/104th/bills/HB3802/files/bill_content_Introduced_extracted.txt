Provides gas collection and control system requirements for municipal solid waste landfills, including requirements for gas to be collected from each area in which solid waste has been in place for at least one year, for gas to be drawn toward the gas control devices, for a gas collection and control system to be installed within 12 months of reaching certain thresholds, for gas collection and control design plans to provide for alternative preliminary measures, and for the methane destruction efficiency of flared systems to reach 99%.LRB104 08062 BDA 18108 b  A BILL FOR HB3802LRB104 08062 BDA 18108 b1    AN ACT concerning safety. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5.
