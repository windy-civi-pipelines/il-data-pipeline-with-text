Presumption for unlicensed distributors, 16remote retail sellers, or persons. Whenever any person obtains 17tobacco products from an unlicensed in-state or out-of-state 18distributor, remote retail seller, or person, a prima facie 19presumption shall arise that the tax imposed by this Act on 20such tobacco products has not been paid in violation of this 21Act. Invoices or other documents kept in the normal course of 22business in the possession of a person reflecting purchases of 23tobacco products from an unlicensed in-state or out-of-state 24distributor, remote retail seller, or person or invoices or 25other documents kept in the normal course of business obtained   SB1314- 33 -LRB104 07123 HLH 17160 b1by the Department from in-state or out-of-state distributors, 2remote retail sellers, or persons, are sufficient to raise the 3presumption that the tax imposed by this Act has not been paid. 4If a presumption is raised, the Department may assess tax, 5penalty, and interest on the tobacco products. In addition, 6any person who violates this Section is liable to pay to the 7Department, for deposit in the Tax Compliance and 8Administration Fund, a penalty of $1,000 for the first 9violation and $3,000 for any subsequent violation. The 10Department may adopt rules to administer the penalties under 11this Section.12(Source: P.A. 100-940, eff. 8-17-18.) 13    (35 ILCS 143/10-45)14    Sec. 10-45. Incorporation by reference.
