Tarver, IIFiled: 4/8/2025   10400HB3349ham001LRB104 10938 AAS 25172 a1AMENDMENT TO HOUSE BILL 3349 2    AMENDMENT NO. ______. Amend House Bill 3349 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Powering Up Illinois Act. 6    Section 5. Definitions. As used in this Act:7    "Commission" means the Illinois Commerce Commission.8    "Electric utility" means an electric utility serving more 9than 500,000 customers in this State.10    "Electrification" means any new use of electricity, 11expanded use of electricity, or change in use of electricity, 12including, but not limited to, any change in the use of 13electricity in the industrial, commercial, agricultural, 14housing, or transportation sectors that is associated with 15changes in consumption or demand related to conversion of 16equipment from a fossil fuel source to an electric fuel   10400HB3349ham001- 2 -LRB104 10938 AAS 25172 a1source.2    "Energization" and "energize" means the connection of new 3customers to the electrical grid, the establishment of 4adequate electrical capacity to provide service for a new 5customer, or upgrading electrical capacity to provide adequate 6service to an existing customer for the purpose of 7electrification. "Energization" and "energize" do not include 8activities related to connecting electricity supply resources.9    "Energization time period" means the period of time that 10begins when the electric utility receives a substantially 11complete energization project application and ends when the 12electric service associated with the project is installed and 13energized, consistent with the service obligations set forth 14in the Public Utilities Act. 15    Section 10. Findings. The General Assembly finds the 16following:17        (1) It is the policy of the State to increase the 18    amount of electric vehicles used in the State to 1,000,000 19    by 2030. That expanded infrastructure investment will help 20    Illinois more rapidly decarbonize the transportation 21    sector. Widespread use of electric vehicles and charging 22    equipment has the potential to provide customers with fuel 23    cost savings and provide electric utility customers with 24    cost-saving benefits. Widespread use of electric vehicles 25    stimulates innovation, competition, and increased choices   10400HB3349ham001- 3 -LRB104 10938 AAS 25172 a1    in charging equipment and networks, attracts private 2    capital investments to the State, and creates high-quality 3    jobs in the State. Accelerating the adoption of electric 4    vehicles will drive the decarbonization of the States' 5    transportation sector. To meet these goals and federal, 6    State, regional, and local air quality and decarbonization 7    standards, plans, and regulations, a large increase in 8    both the quantity of electricity used and the functions 9    for which electricity will be used is needed.10        (2) To meet these decarbonization goals as well as 11    federal, State, regional, and local air quality and 12    decarbonization standards, plans, and regulations, the 13    following must occur:14            (A) the State's electrical distribution systems 15        must be substantially upgraded;16            (B) new customers must promptly connect to the 17        electrical distribution system; and 18            (C) existing customers must have the customer's 19        service level promptly upgraded.20        (3) There are many reports throughout the country of 21    individual customers who are unable to have their 22    electrical service promptly upgraded or energized and 23    charging stations for light-duty, medium-duty, and 24    heavy-duty vehicles and off-road vehicles, vessels, 25    trains, and equipment that are unable to be energized 26    promptly. These delays may inhibit the State's ability to   10400HB3349ham001- 4 -LRB104 10938 AAS 25172 a1    meet its decarbonization goals and federal, State, 2    regional, and local air quality and decarbonization 3    standards, plans, and regulations.4        (4) To improve the speed at which energization and 5    service upgrades are performed, electric utilities that 6    distribute electricity need to do both of the following:7            (A) accelerate the utility's advance planning, 8        engineering, and construction of increased 9        distribution and transmission system capacity; and10            (B) advance order transformers, switchgear, and 11        other needed equipment to support acceleration of 12        activities in subparagraph (A).13        (5) Electrifying transportation and buildings can put 14    downward pressure on rates by spreading fixed costs over 15    more kilowatt-hours of usage.16        (6) Delays in energization, including service 17    upgrades, are costly both to the customers awaiting 18    service and to other customers who are deprived of the 19    downward pressure on rates.20        (7) To carry out the planning, engineering, and 21    construction of electrical distribution systems needed to 22    promptly serve customers, electric utilities that 23    distribute electricity need to recruit, train, and retain 24    an adequately sized, qualified workforce. 25        (8) The Illinois Commerce Commission needs to 26    establish target deadlines for utilities that distribute   10400HB3349ham001- 5 -LRB104 10938 AAS 25172 a1    electricity to energize new customers and upgrade the 2    service of existing customers.3        (9) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall establish 4    target energization time periods for electric distribution 5    utilities and shall establish associated reporting 6    requirements. 7    Section 15. Electrical distribution system upgrades. To 8fulfill the service obligations specified in the Public 9Utilities Act, an electric distribution utility shall:10        (1) prepare, maintain, and upgrade its electrical 11    distribution system as needed and in time to allow for the 12    achievement of federal, State, regional, and local air 13    quality and decarbonization standards, plans, and 14    regulations;15        (2) conduct sufficient advance planning, engineering, 16    and construction of increased distribution of system 17    capacity by advance ordering transformers and other needed 18    equipment so that customers can be energized without 19    substantial delay;20        (3) promptly energize new customers in a manner 21    consistent with the Public Utilities Act, including by 22    ensuring that new housing, new businesses, and new 23    charging for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty 24    vehicles and off-road vehicles, vessels, trains, and 25    equipment can be used without delay;  10400HB3349ham001- 6 -LRB104 10938 AAS 25172 a1        (4) promptly upgrade service when needed by customers;2        (5) if not already an option, allow customers seeking 3    energization to choose an optional flexible 4    interconnection or dynamic hosting capacity option, which 5    shall provide a voluntary utility offering by which 6    customers agree to specified service levels as a 7    requirement of energization through the use of demand 8    response technology that limits the net import and export 9    of electricity at the point of common coupling to remain 10    within the rated capacity limits of a customer's existing 11    service connection or distribution circuit, either on a 12    permanent basis or to allow for immediate project 13    operations before service or distribution system upgrades 14    are completed;15        (6) plan for and propose timely investments in secure, 16    resilient, high-bandwidth, and low-latency communications 17    systems as needed to support the achievement of the 18    federal, State, regional, and local air quality and 19    decarbonization standards, plans, and regulations 20    referenced in paragraph (1) of this Section and the 21    flexible interconnection or dynamic hosting capacity 22    options referenced in paragraph (5) of this Section; and23        (7) recruit, train, and retain an adequately sized and 24    qualified workforce to carry out the planning, 25    engineering, and construction of electrical distribution 26    systems needed to promptly serve customers seeking   10400HB3349ham001- 7 -LRB104 10938 AAS 25172 a1    energization and service upgrades without sacrificing 2    other necessary activities of the workforce. 3    Section 20. Commission requirements.4    (a) Within 180 days after the effective date of this Act, 5the Commission shall adopt rules as follows:6        (1) Rules that establish reasonable average and 7    maximum target energization time periods for categories of 8    energization requests. The targets shall ensure that work 9    results in safe, adequate, and reliable service while 10    minimizing delays in meeting the date requested by the 11    customer for completion of the project to the greatest 12    extent possible and prioritizes work in a manner 13    consistent with Sections 25 and 30. The targets may vary 14    depending on the complexity and magnitude of the work 15    required and uncertainties regarding the readiness of the 16    customer project needing energization. The targets may 17    also recognize any factors beyond the electric utility's 18    control and provide for adjustment upon a showing of such 19    factors.20        (2) Rules that require an electric distribution 21    utility to report to the Commission, at least annually, 22    its performance in meeting energization targets 23    established pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection 24    (a) in order to track and improve electric utility 25    performance. The report shall include the average, median,   10400HB3349ham001- 8 -LRB104 10938 AAS 25172 a1    and standard deviation time between receiving an 2    application for energization, explanations for 3    energization time periods that exceed the target maximum 4    for energization requests, and constraints and obstacles 5    to each category of energization request, including, but 6    not limited to, funding limitations, qualified staffing 7    availability, equipment availability, and any other 8    information requested by the Commission. The report may be 9    filed in conjunction with or as part of other applicable 10    reports already required by the Commission.11    (b) If energization time periods exceed the Commission's 12target averages or if the electric utility has a substantial 13number of energization projects that exceed the Commission's 14target maximums, the electric utility shall include in its 15report pursuant to rules adopted under paragraph (2) of 16subsection (a) a strategy for meeting the targets in the 17future.
