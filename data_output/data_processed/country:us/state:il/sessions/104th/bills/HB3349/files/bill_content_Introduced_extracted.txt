Effective immediately.LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b  A BILL FOR HB3349LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Powering Up Illinois Act. 6    Section 5. Definitions. As used in this Act:7    "Commission" means the Illinois Commerce Commission.8    "Electric utility" means an electric utility serving more 9than 200,000 customers in this State.10    "Electrification" means any new use of electricity, 11expanded use of electricity, or change in use of electricity, 12including, but not limited to, any change in the use of 13electricity in the industrial, commercial, agricultural, 14housing, or transportation sectors.15    "Energization" and "energize" means the connection of new 16customers to the electrical grid, the establishment of 17adequate electrical capacity to provide service for a new 18customer, or upgrading electrical capacity to provide adequate 19service to an existing customer. "Energization" and "energize" 20do not include activities related to connecting electricity 21supply resources.22    "Energization time period" means the period of time that 23begins when the electric utility receives a substantially   HB3349- 2 -LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1complete energization project application and ends when the 2electric service associated with the project is installed and 3energized, consistent with the service obligations set forth 4in the Section 8-101 of the Public Utilities Act. 5    Section 10. Findings. The General Assembly finds the 6following:7        (1) It is the policy of the State to increase the 8    amount of electric vehicles used in the State to 1,000,000 9    by 2030. That expanded infrastructure investment will help 10    Illinois more rapidly decarbonize the transportation 11    sector. Widespread use of electric vehicles and charging 12    equipment has the potential to provide customers with fuel 13    cost savings and provide electric utility customers with 14    cost-saving benefits. Widespread use of electric vehicles 15    stimulates innovation, competition, and increased choices 16    in charging equipment and networks, attracts private 17    capital investments to the State, and creates high-quality 18    jobs in the State. Accelerating the adoption of electric 19    vehicles will drive the decarbonization of the States' 20    transportation sector. To meet these goals and federal, 21    State, regional, and local air quality and decarbonization 22    standards, plans, and regulations, a large increase in 23    both the quantity of electricity used and the functions 24    for which electricity will be used is needed.25        (2) To meet these decarbonization goals as well as   HB3349- 3 -LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1    federal, State, regional, and local air quality and 2    decarbonization standards, plans, and regulations, the 3    following must occur:4            (A) the State's electrical distribution systems 5        must be substantially upgraded;6            (B) new customers must promptly connect to the 7        electrical distribution system; and 8            (C) existing customers must have the customer's 9        service level promptly upgraded.10        (3) There are many reports of large housing 11    developments that are unable to be energized promptly. The 12    State has an urgent need to increase its supply of 13    housing, requiring both new electrical distribution 14    capacity and the prompt energization of new housing.15        (4) There are many reports of individual customers who 16    are unable to have their electrical service promptly 17    upgraded or energized and charging stations for 18    light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and 19    off-road vehicles, vessels, trains, and equipment that are 20    unable to be energized promptly. These delays may inhibit 21    the State's ability to meet its decarbonization goals and 22    federal, State, regional, and local air quality and 23    decarbonization standards, plans, and regulations.24        (5) To improve the speed at which energization and 25    service upgrades are performed, electric utilities that 26    distribute electricity need to do both of the following:  HB3349- 4 -LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1            (A) accelerate the utility's advance planning, 2        engineering, and construction of increased 3        distribution and transmission system capacity; and4            (B) advance order transformers, switchgear, and 5        other needed equipment to support acceleration of 6        activities in subparagraph (A).7        (6) Electrifying transportation and buildings can put 8    downward pressure on rates by spreading fixed costs over 9    more kilowatt-hours of usage.10        (7) Delays in energization, including service 11    upgrades, are costly both to the customers awaiting 12    service and to other customers who are deprived of the 13    downward pressure on rates.14        (8) To carry out the planning, engineering, and 15    construction of electrical distribution systems needed to 16    promptly serve customers, electric utilities that 17    distribute electricity need to recruit, train, and retain 18    an adequately sized, qualified workforce. 19        (9) The Illinois Commerce Commission needs to 20    establish target deadlines for utilities that distribute 21    electricity to energize new customers and upgrade the 22    service of existing customers.23        (10) The Illinois Commerce Commission needs to 24    establish reporting requirements for electric utilities 25    that distribute electricity to report the extent to which 26    they comply with the target deadlines and the reasons for   HB3349- 5 -LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1    any noncompliance. 2    Section 15. Electrical distribution system upgrades. To 3fulfill the service obligations specified in Section 8-101 of 4the Public Utilities Act, an electric utility that operates 5within the State shall:6        (1) upgrade the State's electrical distribution 7    systems as needed and in time to achieve the State's 8    decarbonization goals, and implement federal, State, 9    regional, and local air quality and decarbonization 10    standards, plans, and regulations;11        (2) conduct sufficient advance planning, engineering, 12    and construction of increased distribution of system 13    capacity by advance ordering transformers and other needed 14    equipment so that customers can be energized without 15    substantial delay;16        (3) promptly energize new customers, including by 17    ensuring that new housing, new businesses, and new 18    charging for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty 19    vehicles and off-road vehicles, vessels, trains, and 20    equipment can be used without delay caused by a failure of 21    the utility to implement energization projects;22        (4) promptly upgrade service when needed by customers;23        (5) allow customers seeking energization to choose an 24    optional flexible connection agreement, which shall 25    provide a tariffed, voluntary utility offering that   HB3349- 6 -LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1    requires customers to agree to specified service levels as 2    a requirement of energization or interconnection through 3    the use of demand response technology that limits the net 4    import and export of electricity at the point of common 5    coupling to remain within the rated capacity limits of a 6    customer's existing service connection or distribution 7    circuit, either on a permanent basis or to allow for 8    immediate project operations before service or 9    distribution system upgrades are completed; and10        (6) recruit, train, and retain an adequately sized and 11    qualified workforce to carry out the planning, 12    engineering, and construction of electrical distribution 13    systems needed to promptly serve customers seeking 14    energization and service upgrades without sacrificing 15    other necessary activities of the workforce. 16    Section 20.

Sets forth provisions concerning: the staffing of an electrification team; electric utility requirements; recovery of costs; and safety standards. Effective immediately.LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b  A BILL FOR HB3349LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Powering Up Illinois Act. 6    Section 5. Definitions. As used in this Act:7    "Commission" means the Illinois Commerce Commission.8    "Electric utility" means an electric utility serving more 9than 200,000 customers in this State.10    "Electrification" means any new use of electricity, 11expanded use of electricity, or change in use of electricity, 12including, but not limited to, any change in the use of 13electricity in the industrial, commercial, agricultural, 14housing, or transportation sectors.15    "Energization" and "energize" means the connection of new 16customers to the electrical grid, the establishment of 17adequate electrical capacity to provide service for a new 18customer, or upgrading electrical capacity to provide adequate 19service to an existing customer. "Energization" and "energize" 20do not include activities related to connecting electricity 21supply resources.22    "Energization time period" means the period of time that 23begins when the electric utility receives a substantially   HB3349- 2 -LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1complete energization project application and ends when the 2electric service associated with the project is installed and 3energized, consistent with the service obligations set forth 4in the Section 8-101 of the Public Utilities Act. 5    Section 10. Findings. The General Assembly finds the 6following:7        (1) It is the policy of the State to increase the 8    amount of electric vehicles used in the State to 1,000,000 9    by 2030. That expanded infrastructure investment will help 10    Illinois more rapidly decarbonize the transportation 11    sector. Widespread use of electric vehicles and charging 12    equipment has the potential to provide customers with fuel 13    cost savings and provide electric utility customers with 14    cost-saving benefits. Widespread use of electric vehicles 15    stimulates innovation, competition, and increased choices 16    in charging equipment and networks, attracts private 17    capital investments to the State, and creates high-quality 18    jobs in the State. Accelerating the adoption of electric 19    vehicles will drive the decarbonization of the States' 20    transportation sector. To meet these goals and federal, 21    State, regional, and local air quality and decarbonization 22    standards, plans, and regulations, a large increase in 23    both the quantity of electricity used and the functions 24    for which electricity will be used is needed.25        (2) To meet these decarbonization goals as well as   HB3349- 3 -LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1    federal, State, regional, and local air quality and 2    decarbonization standards, plans, and regulations, the 3    following must occur:4            (A) the State's electrical distribution systems 5        must be substantially upgraded;6            (B) new customers must promptly connect to the 7        electrical distribution system; and 8            (C) existing customers must have the customer's 9        service level promptly upgraded.10        (3) There are many reports of large housing 11    developments that are unable to be energized promptly. The 12    State has an urgent need to increase its supply of 13    housing, requiring both new electrical distribution 14    capacity and the prompt energization of new housing.15        (4) There are many reports of individual customers who 16    are unable to have their electrical service promptly 17    upgraded or energized and charging stations for 18    light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and 19    off-road vehicles, vessels, trains, and equipment that are 20    unable to be energized promptly. These delays may inhibit 21    the State's ability to meet its decarbonization goals and 22    federal, State, regional, and local air quality and 23    decarbonization standards, plans, and regulations.24        (5) To improve the speed at which energization and 25    service upgrades are performed, electric utilities that 26    distribute electricity need to do both of the following:  HB3349- 4 -LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1            (A) accelerate the utility's advance planning, 2        engineering, and construction of increased 3        distribution and transmission system capacity; and4            (B) advance order transformers, switchgear, and 5        other needed equipment to support acceleration of 6        activities in subparagraph (A).7        (6) Electrifying transportation and buildings can put 8    downward pressure on rates by spreading fixed costs over 9    more kilowatt-hours of usage.10        (7) Delays in energization, including service 11    upgrades, are costly both to the customers awaiting 12    service and to other customers who are deprived of the 13    downward pressure on rates.14        (8) To carry out the planning, engineering, and 15    construction of electrical distribution systems needed to 16    promptly serve customers, electric utilities that 17    distribute electricity need to recruit, train, and retain 18    an adequately sized, qualified workforce. 19        (9) The Illinois Commerce Commission needs to 20    establish target deadlines for utilities that distribute 21    electricity to energize new customers and upgrade the 22    service of existing customers.23        (10) The Illinois Commerce Commission needs to 24    establish reporting requirements for electric utilities 25    that distribute electricity to report the extent to which 26    they comply with the target deadlines and the reasons for   HB3349- 5 -LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1    any noncompliance. 2    Section 15. Electrical distribution system upgrades. To 3fulfill the service obligations specified in Section 8-101 of 4the Public Utilities Act, an electric utility that operates 5within the State shall:6        (1) upgrade the State's electrical distribution 7    systems as needed and in time to achieve the State's 8    decarbonization goals, and implement federal, State, 9    regional, and local air quality and decarbonization 10    standards, plans, and regulations;11        (2) conduct sufficient advance planning, engineering, 12    and construction of increased distribution of system 13    capacity by advance ordering transformers and other needed 14    equipment so that customers can be energized without 15    substantial delay;16        (3) promptly energize new customers, including by 17    ensuring that new housing, new businesses, and new 18    charging for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty 19    vehicles and off-road vehicles, vessels, trains, and 20    equipment can be used without delay caused by a failure of 21    the utility to implement energization projects;22        (4) promptly upgrade service when needed by customers;23        (5) allow customers seeking energization to choose an 24    optional flexible connection agreement, which shall 25    provide a tariffed, voluntary utility offering that   HB3349- 6 -LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1    requires customers to agree to specified service levels as 2    a requirement of energization or interconnection through 3    the use of demand response technology that limits the net 4    import and export of electricity at the point of common 5    coupling to remain within the rated capacity limits of a 6    customer's existing service connection or distribution 7    circuit, either on a permanent basis or to allow for 8    immediate project operations before service or 9    distribution system upgrades are completed; and10        (6) recruit, train, and retain an adequately sized and 11    qualified workforce to carry out the planning, 12    engineering, and construction of electrical distribution 13    systems needed to promptly serve customers seeking 14    energization and service upgrades without sacrificing 15    other necessary activities of the workforce. 16    Section 20. Commission requirements.17    (a) Within 180 days after the effective date of this Act, 18the Commission shall adopt rules that meet all of the 19following requirements:20        (1) Rules that establish reasonable average and 21    maximum target energization time periods. The targets 22    shall ensure that work is completed in a safe and reliable 23    manner that minimizes delay in meeting the date requested 24    by the customer for completion of the project to the 25    greatest extent possible and prioritizes work in a manner   HB3349- 7 -LRB104 10938 AAS 21020 b1    consistent with Sections 25 and 30.
