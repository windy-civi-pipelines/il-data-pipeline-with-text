However, for taxable years ending on or after 12    December 31, 1986, net operating loss carryforwards from 13    taxable years ending prior to December 31, 1986, may not 14    exceed the sum of federal taxable income for the taxable 15    year before net operating loss deduction, plus the excess 16    of addition modifications over subtraction modifications 17    for the taxable year.

For purposes of paragraph (1) of 11    this subsection, the taxable income properly reportable 12    for federal income tax purposes shall mean:13            (A) Certain life insurance companies.

In the case of a 7        corporation which is a member of an affiliated group 8        of corporations filing a consolidated income tax 9        return for the taxable year for federal income tax 10        purposes, taxable income determined as if such 11        corporation had filed a separate return for federal 12        income tax purposes for the taxable year and each 13        preceding taxable year for which it was a member of an 14        affiliated group. For purposes of this subparagraph, 15        the taxpayer's separate taxable income shall be 16        determined as if the election provided by Section 17        243(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code had been in 18        effect for all such years;19            (F) Cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative 20        corporation or association, the taxable income of such 21        organization determined in accordance with the 22        provisions of Section 1381 through 1388 of the 23        Internal Revenue Code, but without regard to the 24        prohibition against offsetting losses from patronage 25        activities against income from nonpatronage 26        activities; except that a cooperative corporation or   HB3737- 103 -LRB104 10848 HLH 20929 b1        association may make an election to follow its federal 2        income tax treatment of patronage losses and 3        nonpatronage losses. In the event such election is 4        made, such losses shall be computed and carried over 5        in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of Section 6        207 of this Act and apportioned by the apportionment 7        factor reported by the cooperative on its Illinois 8        income tax return filed for the taxable year in which 9        the losses are incurred. The election shall be 10        effective for all taxable years with original returns 11        due on or after the date of the election. In addition, 12        the cooperative may file an amended return or returns, 13        as allowed under this Act, to provide that the 14        election shall be effective for losses incurred or 15        carried forward for taxable years occurring prior to 16        the date of the election. Once made, the election may 17        only be revoked upon approval of the Director. The 18        Department shall adopt rules setting forth 19        requirements for documenting the elections and any 20        resulting Illinois net loss and the standards to be 21        used by the Director in evaluating requests to revoke 22        elections. Public Act 96-932 is declaratory of 23        existing law; 24            (G) Subchapter S corporations. In the case of: (i) 25        a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 26        effect an election for the taxable year under Section   HB3737- 104 -LRB104 10848 HLH 20929 b1        1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxable income 2        of such corporation determined in accordance with 3        Section 1363(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, except 4        that taxable income shall take into account those 5        items which are required by Section 1363(b)(1) of the 6        Internal Revenue Code to be separately stated; and 7        (ii) a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 8        effect a federal election to opt out of the provisions 9        of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 and have 10        applied instead the prior federal Subchapter S rules 11        as in effect on July 1, 1982, the taxable income of 12        such corporation determined in accordance with the 13        federal Subchapter S rules as in effect on July 1, 14        1982; and15            (H) Partnerships. In the case of a partnership, 16        taxable income determined in accordance with Section 17        703 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that taxable 18        income shall take into account those items which are 19        required by Section 703(a)(1) to be separately stated 20        but which would be taken into account by an individual 21        in calculating his taxable income.22        (3) Recapture of business expenses on disposition of 23    asset or business. Notwithstanding any other law to the 24    contrary, if in prior years income from an asset or 25    business has been classified as business income and in a 26    later year is demonstrated to be non-business income, then   HB3737- 105 -LRB104 10848 HLH 20929 b1    all expenses, without limitation, deducted in such later 2    year and in the 2 immediately preceding taxable years 3    related to that asset or business that generated the 4    non-business income shall be added back and recaptured as 5    business income in the year of the disposition of the 6    asset or business. Such amount shall be apportioned to 7    Illinois using the greater of the apportionment fraction 8    computed for the business under Section 304 of this Act 9    for the taxable year or the average of the apportionment 10    fractions computed for the business under Section 304 of 11    this Act for the taxable year and for the 2 immediately 12    preceding taxable years.  13    (f) Valuation limitation amount.14        (1) In general. The valuation limitation amount 15    referred to in subsections (a)(2)(G), (c)(2)(I) and 16    (d)(2)(E) is an amount equal to:17            (A) The sum of the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 18        amounts (to the extent consisting of gain reportable 19        under the provisions of Section 1245 or 1250 of the 20        Internal Revenue Code) for all property in respect of 21        which such gain was reported for the taxable year; 22        plus23            (B) The lesser of (i) the sum of the pre-August 1, 24        1969 appreciation amounts (to the extent consisting of 25        capital gain) for all property in respect of which   HB3737- 106 -LRB104 10848 HLH 20929 b1        such gain was reported for federal income tax purposes 2        for the taxable year, or (ii) the net capital gain for 3        the taxable year, reduced in either case by any amount 4        of such gain included in the amount determined under 5        subsection (a)(2)(F) or (c)(2)(H).6        (2) Pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation amount.7            (A) If the fair market value of property referred 8        to in paragraph (1) was readily ascertainable on 9        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 10        amount for such property is the lesser of (i) the 11        excess of such fair market value over the taxpayer's 12        basis (for determining gain) for such property on that 13        date (determined under the Internal Revenue Code as in 14        effect on that date), or (ii) the total gain realized 15        and reportable for federal income tax purposes in 16        respect of the sale, exchange or other disposition of 17        such property.18            (B) If the fair market value of property referred 19        to in paragraph (1) was not readily ascertainable on 20        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 21        amount for such property is that amount which bears 22        the same ratio to the total gain reported in respect of 23        the property for federal income tax purposes for the 24        taxable year, as the number of full calendar months in 25        that part of the taxpayer's holding period for the 26        property ending July 31, 1969 bears to the number of   HB3737- 107 -LRB104 10848 HLH 20929 b1        full calendar months in the taxpayer's entire holding 2        period for the property.3            (C) The Department shall prescribe such 4        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the 5        purposes of this paragraph. 6    (g) Double deductions. Unless specifically provided 7otherwise, nothing in this Section shall permit the same item 8to be deducted more than once. 9    (h) Legislative intention. Except as expressly provided by 10this Section there shall be no modifications or limitations on 11the amounts of income, gain, loss or deduction taken into 12account in determining gross income, adjusted gross income or 13taxable income for federal income tax purposes for the taxable 14year, or in the amount of such items entering into the 15computation of base income and net income under this Act for 16such taxable year, whether in respect of property values as of 17August 1, 1969 or otherwise.18(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 19102-658, eff. 8-27-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-1112, eff. 2012-21-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23; 103-478, eff. 1-1-24; 103-592, 21Article 10, Section 10-900, eff. 6-7-24; 103-592, Article 170, 22Section 170-90, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24; 103-647, 23eff. 7-1-24; revised 8-20-24.)

The addition modification 20        required by this subparagraph shall be reduced to the 21        extent that dividends were included in base income of 22        the unitary group for the same taxable year and 23        received by the taxpayer or by a member of the 24        taxpayer's unitary business group (including amounts 25        included in gross income under Sections 951 through 26        964 of the Internal Revenue Code and amounts included   HB3737- 5 -LRB104 10848 HLH 20929 b1        in gross income under Section 78 of the Internal 2        Revenue Code) with respect to the stock of the same 3        person to whom the interest was paid, accrued, or 4        incurred.5            This paragraph shall not apply to the following: 6                (i) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 7            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person who 8            is subject in a foreign country or state, other 9            than a state which requires mandatory unitary 10            reporting, to a tax on or measured by net income 11            with respect to such interest; or12                (ii) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 13            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 14            the taxpayer can establish, based on a 15            preponderance of the evidence, both of the 16            following:17                    (a) the person, during the same taxable 18                year, paid, accrued, or incurred, the interest 19                to a person that is not a related member, and20                    (b) the transaction giving rise to the 21                interest expense between the taxpayer and the 22                person did not have as a principal purpose the 23                avoidance of Illinois income tax, and is paid 24                pursuant to a contract or agreement that 25                reflects an arm's-length interest rate and 26                terms; or   HB3737- 6 -LRB104 10848 HLH 20929 b1                (iii) the taxpayer can establish, based on 2            clear and convincing evidence, that the interest 3            paid, accrued, or incurred relates to a contract 4            or agreement entered into at arm's-length rates 5            and terms and the principal purpose for the 6            payment is not federal or Illinois tax avoidance; 7            or 8                (iv) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 9            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 10            the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing 11            evidence that the adjustments are unreasonable; or 12            if the taxpayer and the Director agree in writing 13            to the application or use of an alternative method 14            of apportionment under Section 304(f). 15                Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the 16            Director from making any other adjustment 17            otherwise allowed under Section 404 of this Act 18            for any tax year beginning after the effective 19            date of this amendment provided such adjustment is 20            made pursuant to regulation adopted by the 21            Department and such regulations provide methods 22            and standards by which the Department will utilize 23            its authority under Section 404 of this Act; 24            (D-18) An amount equal to the amount of intangible 25        expenses and costs otherwise allowed as a deduction in 26        computing base income, and that were paid, accrued, or   HB3737- 7 -LRB104 10848 HLH 20929 b1        incurred, directly or indirectly, (i) for taxable 2        years ending on or after December 31, 2004, to a 3        foreign person who would be a member of the same 4        unitary business group but for the fact that the 5        foreign person's business activity outside the United 6        States is 80% or more of that person's total business 7        activity and (ii) for taxable years ending on or after 8        December 31, 2008, to a person who would be a member of 9        the same unitary business group but for the fact that 10        the person is prohibited under Section 1501(a)(27) 11        from being included in the unitary business group 12        because he or she is ordinarily required to apportion 13        business income under different subsections of Section 14        304. The addition modification required by this 15        subparagraph shall be reduced to the extent that 16        dividends were included in base income of the unitary 17        group for the same taxable year and received by the 18        taxpayer or by a member of the taxpayer's unitary 19        business group (including amounts included in gross 20        income under Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal 21        Revenue Code and amounts included in gross income 22        under Section 78 of the Internal Revenue Code) with 23        respect to the stock of the same person to whom the 24        intangible expenses and costs were directly or 25        indirectly paid, incurred, or accrued. The preceding 26        sentence does not apply to the extent that the same   HB3737- 8 -LRB104 10848 HLH 20929 b1        dividends caused a reduction to the addition 2        modification required under Section 203(a)(2)(D-17) of 3        this Act.
