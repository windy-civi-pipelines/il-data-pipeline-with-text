Thus, it is the intent of the General 18Assembly that the Illinois Department implement a 19reimbursement system for ambulance services that, to the 20extent practicable and subject to the availability of funds 21appropriated by the General Assembly for this purpose, is 22consistent with the payment principles of Medicare. To ensure 23uniformity between the payment principles of Medicare and   HB3599- 2 -LRB104 10695 KTG 20774 b1Medicaid, the Illinois Department shall follow, to the extent 2necessary and practicable and subject to the availability of 3funds appropriated by the General Assembly for this purpose, 4the statutes, laws, regulations, policies, procedures, 5principles, definitions, guidelines, and manuals used to 6determine the amounts paid to ambulance service providers 7under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare).8    (b) For ambulance services provided to a recipient of aid 9under this Article on or after January 1, 1996, the Illinois 10Department shall reimburse ambulance service providers based 11upon the actual distance traveled if a natural disaster, 12weather conditions, road repairs, or traffic congestion 13necessitates the use of a route other than the most direct 14route.15    (c) For purposes of this Section, "ambulance services" 16includes medical transportation services provided by means of 17an ambulance, air ambulance, medi-car, service car, or taxi.18    (c-1) For purposes of this Section, "ground ambulance 19service" means medical transportation services that are 20described as ground ambulance services by the Centers for 21Medicare and Medicaid Services and provided in a vehicle that 22is licensed as an ambulance by the Illinois Department of 23Public Health pursuant to the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 24Systems Act.25    (c-2) For purposes of this Section, "ground ambulance 26service provider" means a vehicle service provider as   HB3599- 3 -LRB104 10695 KTG 20774 b1described in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems Act 2that operates licensed ambulances for the purpose of providing 3emergency ambulance services, or non-emergency ambulance 4services, or both. For purposes of this Section, this includes 5both ambulance providers and ambulance suppliers as described 6by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.7    (c-3) For purposes of this Section, "medi-car" means 8transportation services provided to a patient who is confined 9to a wheelchair and requires the use of a hydraulic or electric 10lift or ramp and wheelchair lockdown when the patient's 11condition does not require medical observation, medical 12supervision, medical equipment, the administration of 13medications, or the administration of oxygen. 14    (c-4) For purposes of this Section, "service car" means 15transportation services provided to a patient by a passenger 16vehicle where that patient does not require the specialized 17modes described in subsection (c-1) or (c-3). 18    (c-5) For purposes of this Section, "air ambulance 19service" means medical transport by helicopter or airplane for 20patients, as defined in 29 U.S.C. 1185f(c)(1), and any service 21that is described as an air ambulance service by the federal 22Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 23    (d) This Section does not prohibit separate billing by 24ambulance service providers for oxygen furnished while 25providing advanced life support services.26    (e) Beginning with services rendered on or after July 1,   HB3599- 4 -LRB104 10695 KTG 20774 b12008, all providers of non-emergency medi-car and service car 2transportation must certify that the driver and employee 3attendant, as applicable, have completed a safety program 4approved by the Department to protect both the patient and the 5driver, prior to transporting a patient.

Failure to produce documentation of such 9training shall result in recovery of any payments made by the 10Department for services rendered by a non-certified driver or 11employee attendant. Medi-car and service car providers must 12maintain legible documentation in their records of the driver 13and, as applicable, employee attendant that actually 14transported the patient.

The rule shall be filed by 20December 15, 2012 and shall provide that, for any decision 21rendered by the Department or its agent on or after the date 22the rule takes effect, the ground ambulance service provider 23shall have 60 days from the date the decision is received to 24file an appeal.

Thus, it is the intent of the General 18Assembly that the Illinois Department implement a 19reimbursement system for ambulance services that, to the 20extent practicable and subject to the availability of funds 21appropriated by the General Assembly for this purpose, is 22consistent with the payment principles of Medicare. To ensure 23uniformity between the payment principles of Medicare and   HB3599- 2 -LRB104 10695 KTG 20774 b1Medicaid, the Illinois Department shall follow, to the extent 2necessary and practicable and subject to the availability of 3funds appropriated by the General Assembly for this purpose, 4the statutes, laws, regulations, policies, procedures, 5principles, definitions, guidelines, and manuals used to 6determine the amounts paid to ambulance service providers 7under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Medicare).8    (b) For ambulance services provided to a recipient of aid 9under this Article on or after January 1, 1996, the Illinois 10Department shall reimburse ambulance service providers based 11upon the actual distance traveled if a natural disaster, 12weather conditions, road repairs, or traffic congestion 13necessitates the use of a route other than the most direct 14route.15    (c) For purposes of this Section, "ambulance services" 16includes medical transportation services provided by means of 17an ambulance, air ambulance, medi-car, service car, or taxi.18    (c-1) For purposes of this Section, "ground ambulance 19service" means medical transportation services that are 20described as ground ambulance services by the Centers for 21Medicare and Medicaid Services and provided in a vehicle that 22is licensed as an ambulance by the Illinois Department of 23Public Health pursuant to the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 24Systems Act.25    (c-2) For purposes of this Section, "ground ambulance 26service provider" means a vehicle service provider as   HB3599- 3 -LRB104 10695 KTG 20774 b1described in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems Act 2that operates licensed ambulances for the purpose of providing 3emergency ambulance services, or non-emergency ambulance 4services, or both. For purposes of this Section, this includes 5both ambulance providers and ambulance suppliers as described 6by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.7    (c-3) For purposes of this Section, "medi-car" means 8transportation services provided to a patient who is confined 9to a wheelchair and requires the use of a hydraulic or electric 10lift or ramp and wheelchair lockdown when the patient's 11condition does not require medical observation, medical 12supervision, medical equipment, the administration of 13medications, or the administration of oxygen. 14    (c-4) For purposes of this Section, "service car" means 15transportation services provided to a patient by a passenger 16vehicle where that patient does not require the specialized 17modes described in subsection (c-1) or (c-3). 18    (c-5) For purposes of this Section, "air ambulance 19service" means medical transport by helicopter or airplane for 20patients, as defined in 29 U.S.C. 1185f(c)(1), and any service 21that is described as an air ambulance service by the federal 22Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 23    (d) This Section does not prohibit separate billing by 24ambulance service providers for oxygen furnished while 25providing advanced life support services.26    (e) Beginning with services rendered on or after July 1,   HB3599- 4 -LRB104 10695 KTG 20774 b12008, all providers of non-emergency medi-car and service car 2transportation must certify that the driver and employee 3attendant, as applicable, have completed a safety program 4approved by the Department to protect both the patient and the 5driver, prior to transporting a patient.
