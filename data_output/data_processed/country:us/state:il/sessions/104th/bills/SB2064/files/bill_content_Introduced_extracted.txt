Short title. This Act may be cited as the Youth 5Social Media Engagement Act. 6    Section 5. Findings and intent. The General Assembly finds 7and declares: 8    (a) On May 23, 2023, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy 9released a Social Media and Youth Mental Health advisory to 10recognize the growing impact of social media on youth mental 11health and well-being as a significant public health challenge 12that requires immediate awareness and action. 13    (b) The advisory includes recommendations for policymakers 14to address this issue, including to "strengthen protections to 15ensure greater safety for children interacting with all social 16media platforms". 17    (c) In the United States, up to 95% of youth ages 13 to 17 18report using social media platforms, and a third of youth 19report using social media "almost constantly". 20    (d) A study of youth in the United States ages 12 to 15 21found that youth who spend 3 or more hours a day on social 22media had double the risk of experiencing poor mental health 23outcomes, including experiencing symptoms of depression and   SB2064- 2 -LRB104 09138 SPS 19194 b1anxiety. As of 2021, the average time spent on social media for 2this age group is 3.5 hours a day, with one in 4 youth spending 35 or more hours a day on the platforms, and one in 5 youth 4spending 7 or more hours a day on social media. 5    (e) A systematic review of 42 studies on the effects of 6excessive social media use found a consistent relationship 7between social media use and poor sleep quality, reduced sleep 8duration, sleep difficulties, and depression among youth. 9    (f) Social media sites are designed to maximize user 10engagement, which can encourage excessive social media use and 11behavioral dysregulation. Youth undergo critical periods of 12brain development, and social media exposure and frequent use 13may be associated with distinct changes in the developing 14brain, including overstimulation of the amygdala, triggering 15pathways similar to those in individuals with substance use or 16gambling addictions. 17    (g) The Illinois Children's Mental Health Partnership 18developed goals in 2022. One of the goals was to "increase 19public awareness on all issues connected to child mental 20health and wellness to decrease stigma and promote acceptance, 21and strengthen children, families, and communities to identify 22needs and access support with resources and funding". 23    (h) Understanding more about how technology and health 24intersect can help solve certain societal problems and improve 25the mental and physical health of Illinois youth. 26    (i) It is a matter of statewide concern to provide   SB2064- 3 -LRB104 09138 SPS 19194 b1research-based education and interventions, including 2resources on the effects of social media use on brain 3development, how to mitigate the risks associated with social 4media use, and how to maintain well-being while interacting in 5online environments, to help youth make informed decisions on 6responsible social media use. 7    Section 10.
