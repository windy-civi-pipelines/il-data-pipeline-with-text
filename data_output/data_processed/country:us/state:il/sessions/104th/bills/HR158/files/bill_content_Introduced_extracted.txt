Full Text of HR0158 ILGA.GOV HR0158 - 104th General Assembly HR0158LRB104 12436 ECR 22753 r1HOUSE RESOLUTION 2    WHEREAS, The original intent of the 340B Drug Pricing 3Program was to provide discounted medicines to eligible 4healthcare organizations for the purpose of improving access 5to affordable medications for low-income, underinsured, and 6uninsured patients being treated at eligible hospitals, 7including disproportionate share hospitals, clinics, federally 8qualified health centers (FQHC), and safety-net hospitals; and 9    WHEREAS, The 340B Program, established in 1992, was 10designed to restore manufacturers' ability to offer discounts 11to safety net entities, fixing an unintended problem created 12by the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) enacted in 1990; 13and 14    WHEREAS, Congress intended the 340B Program to provide 15discounts only to federally-funded clinics and public 16hospitals that provide direct clinical care to large numbers 17of uninsured Americans; and 18    WHEREAS, The lack of transparency and accountability of 19the 340B Program has resulted in the expansion of services to 20commercially insured patient populations who are charged full 21price for drugs purchased at steeply discounted 340B prices, 22resulting in the intended benefit to not reach the vulnerable   HR0158- 2 -LRB104 12436 ECR 22753 r1patient populations that the program was designed to help; and 2    WHEREAS, As the 340B Program is not serving vulnerable 3patients in the way that was intended, there is a need for 4increased understanding regarding how covered entities utilize 5the 340B Program and the eventual benefits that reach 6low-income patients; and 7    WHEREAS, Nationally, the 340B Program reached $66.3 8billion in 2023, representing a 24% increase over the 9preceding year; and 10    WHEREAS, While 340B profits have increased, Illinois 11hospitals only provide 2.14% of charity care compared to the 12national average of 2.28%; and 13    WHEREAS, The appropriate and effective use of the 340B 14Program is essential for improving health outcomes, 15particularly for underserved communities in rural, suburban, 16and urban areas throughout Illinois; and 17    WHEREAS, Pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) play a 18significant role in the healthcare ecosystem, and their 19practices regarding 340B revenue must be transparent and 20accountable; and   HR0158- 3 -LRB104 12436 ECR 22753 r1    WHEREAS, Half of the 340B contract pharmacies intended to 2serve underserved patients in Illinois are located in affluent 3neighborhoods; and 4    WHEREAS, Of the top five Illinois hospitals with the most 5contract pharmacies, 24% of their 340B contract pharmacies are 6based outside of Illinois; and 7    WHEREAS, The integrity and efficacy of state health 8programs, such as Medicaid and the State Employees Group 9Insurance Program, could be impacted by the lack of 10transparency of the 340B Program and current practices; and 11    WHEREAS, The North Carolina Treasurer's report on the 340B 12Program found that individual 340B hospitals collected as much 13as $6,026 in average profits per claim by charging up to 12.7 14times their 340B acquisition costs for oncology drugs when 15treating North Carolina state employees with outpatient 16oncology infusion drugs; and 17    WHEREAS, That same report stated, based on its findings, 18at the very least, policymakers should consider strengthening 19public oversight of the 340B Program by introducing 20transparency requirements and bolstering accountability for 21the charitable mission of hospitals; and   HR0158- 4 -LRB104 12436 ECR 22753 r1    WHEREAS, The report also stated, based on its findings, 2ultimately, the 340B Program's systemic lack of accountability 3has hurt those 340B hospitals and other safety-net providers 4that operate in good faith to provide lifesaving care to 5disadvantaged patients; and 6    WHEREAS, Ensuring the transparency and accountability of 7the 340B Program is important to understanding the potential 8long-term costs to taxpayers, including self-insured 9employers, because of its impact on incentivizing increasing 10provider consolidation, distorting incentives for efficient 11care, and impacting overall utilization; and 12    WHEREAS, Increasing the transparency and accountability 13within the 340B Program can foster better health outcomes for 14our most vulnerable patients and ensure taxpayer funding is 15utilized responsibly and effectively; and 16    WHEREAS, Improving the transparency and accountability 17within the 340B Program will ensure those 340B hospitals 18providing needed support to our most vulnerable patients will 19continue to access discounted medicines, and that any benefit 20stays with vulnerable patient populations and not with large, 21wealthy hospital systems and PBM contracted pharmacies; 22therefore, be it   HR0158- 5 -LRB104 12436 ECR 22753 r1    RESOLVED, BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE 2HUNDRED FOURTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, that 3we direct the Auditor General to conduct a comprehensive 4investigation of the utilization of the 340B Drug Pricing 5Program by covered entities within Illinois;

and be it further 20    RESOLVED, That this investigation shall also examine the 21impact of these practices on state health programs, such as 22Medicaid and the State Employees Group Insurance Program, and 23to make recommendations for improvement;
