Such pari-mutuel method of wagering 2shall not, under any circumstances if conducted under the 3provisions of this Act, be held or construed to be unlawful, 4other statutes of this State to the contrary notwithstanding. 5Subject to rules for advance wagering promulgated by the 6Board, any licensee may accept wagers in advance of the day the 7race wagered upon occurs.8    (b) Except for those gaming activities for which a license 9is obtained and authorized under the Illinois Lottery Law, the 10Charitable Games Act, the Raffles and Poker Runs Act, or the 11Illinois Gambling Act, no other method of betting, pool 12making, wagering or gambling shall be used or permitted by the 13licensee.

The Board may adopt rules under 13which it may permit simulcast commission fees in excess of 6%. 14The Board shall adopt rules limiting the interstate commission 15fees charged to an advance deposit wagering licensee. The 16Board shall adopt rules regarding advance deposit wagering on 17interstate simulcast races that shall reflect, among other 18things, the General Assembly's desire to maximize revenues to 19the State, horsemen purses, and organization licensees. 20However, organization licensees providing live signals 21pursuant to the requirements of this subsection (g) may 22petition the Board to withhold their live signals from an 23advance deposit wagering licensee if the organization licensee 24discovers and the Board finds reputable or credible 25information that the advance deposit wagering licensee is 26under investigation by another state or federal governmental   HB2681- 19 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1agency, the advance deposit wagering licensee's license has 2been suspended in another state, or the advance deposit 3wagering licensee's license is in revocation proceedings in 4another state. The organization licensee's provision of their 5live signal to an advance deposit wagering licensee under this 6subsection (g) pertains to wagers placed from within Illinois. 7Advance deposit wagering licensees may place advance deposit 8wagering terminals at wagering facilities as a convenience to 9customers. The advance deposit wagering licensee shall not 10charge or collect any fee from purses for the placement of the 11advance deposit wagering terminals. The costs and expenses of 12the host track and non-host licensees associated with 13interstate simulcast wagering, other than the interstate 14commission fee, shall be borne by the host track and all 15non-host licensees incurring these costs. The interstate 16commission fee shall not exceed 5% of Illinois handle on the 17interstate simulcast race or races without prior approval of 18the Board. The Board shall promulgate rules under which it may 19permit interstate commission fees in excess of 5%. The 20interstate commission fee and other fees charged by the 21sending racetrack, including, but not limited to, satellite 22decoder fees, shall be uniformly applied to the host track and 23all non-host licensees.24    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an 25organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 26association representing the largest number of owners,   HB2681- 20 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 2that organization licensee's racing meeting, may maintain a 3system whereby advance deposit wagering may take place or an 4organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 5association representing the largest number of owners, 6trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 7that organization licensee's racing meeting, may contract with 8another person to carry out a system of advance deposit 9wagering. Such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Only 10with respect to an appeal to the Board that consent for an 11organization licensee that maintains its own advance deposit 12wagering system is being unreasonably withheld, the Board 13shall issue a final order within 30 days after initiation of 14the appeal, and the organization licensee's advance deposit 15wagering system may remain operational during that 30-day 16period. The actions of any organization licensee who conducts 17advance deposit wagering or any person who has a contract with 18an organization licensee to conduct advance deposit wagering 19who conducts advance deposit wagering on or after January 1, 202013 and prior to June 7, 2013 (the effective date of Public 21Act 98-18) taken in reliance on the changes made to this 22subsection (g) by Public Act 98-18 are hereby validated, 23provided payment of all applicable pari-mutuel taxes are 24remitted to the Board. All advance deposit wagers placed from 25within Illinois must be placed through a Board-approved 26advance deposit wagering licensee; no other entity may accept   HB2681- 21 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1an advance deposit wager from a person within Illinois. All 2advance deposit wagering is subject to any rules adopted by 3the Board. The Board may adopt rules necessary to regulate 4advance deposit wagering through the use of emergency 5rulemaking in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Illinois 6Administrative Procedure Act. The General Assembly finds that 7the adoption of rules to regulate advance deposit wagering is 8deemed an emergency and necessary for the public interest, 9safety, and welfare. An advance deposit wagering licensee may 10retain all moneys as agreed to by contract with an 11organization licensee. Any moneys retained by the organization 12licensee from advance deposit wagering, not including moneys 13retained by the advance deposit wagering licensee, shall be 14paid 50% to the organization licensee's purse account and 50% 15to the organization licensee. With the exception of any 16organization licensee that is owned by a publicly traded 17company that is incorporated in a state other than Illinois 18and advance deposit wagering licensees under contract with 19such organization licensees, organization licensees that 20maintain advance deposit wagering systems and advance deposit 21wagering licensees that contract with organization licensees 22shall provide sufficiently detailed monthly accountings to the 23horsemen association representing the largest number of 24owners, trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race 25horses at that organization licensee's racing meeting so that 26the horsemen association, as an interested party, can confirm   HB2681- 22 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1the accuracy of the amounts paid to the purse account at the 2horsemen association's affiliated organization licensee from 3advance deposit wagering. If more than one breed races at the 4same race track facility, then the 50% of the moneys to be paid 5to an organization licensee's purse account shall be allocated 6among all organization licensees' purse accounts operating at 7that race track facility proportionately based on the actual 8number of host days that the Board grants to that breed at that 9race track facility in the current calendar year. To the 10extent any fees from advance deposit wagering conducted in 11Illinois for wagers in Illinois or other states have been 12placed in escrow or otherwise withheld from wagers pending a 13determination of the legality of advance deposit wagering, no 14action shall be brought to declare such wagers or the 15disbursement of any fees previously escrowed illegal.16        (1) Between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. an 17    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 18    may supplement the host track simulcast program with 19    additional simulcast races or race programs, provided that 20    between January 1 and the third Friday in February of any 21    year, inclusive, if no live thoroughbred racing is 22    occurring in Illinois during this period, only 23    thoroughbred races may be used for supplemental interstate 24    simulcast purposes. The Board shall withhold approval for 25    a supplemental interstate simulcast only if it finds that 26    the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of   HB2681- 23 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    racing. A supplemental interstate simulcast may be 2    transmitted from an inter-track wagering licensee to its 3    affiliated non-host licensees. The interstate commission 4    fee for a supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid 5    by the non-host licensee and its affiliated non-host 6    licensees receiving the simulcast.7        (2) Between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. an 8    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 9    may receive supplemental interstate simulcasts only with 10    the consent of the host track, except when the Board finds 11    that the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 12    racing. Consent granted under this paragraph (2) to any 13    inter-track wagering licensee shall be deemed consent to 14    all non-host licensees. The interstate commission fee for 15    the supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid by all 16    participating non-host licensees.17        (3) Each licensee conducting interstate simulcast 18    wagering may retain, subject to the payment of all 19    applicable taxes and the purses, an amount not to exceed 20    17% of all money wagered. If any licensee conducts the 21    pari-mutuel system wagering on races conducted at 22    racetracks in another state or country, each such race or 23    race program shall be considered a separate racing day for 24    the purpose of determining the daily handle and computing 25    the privilege tax of that daily handle as provided in 26    subsection (a) of Section 27. Until January 1, 2000, from   HB2681- 24 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    the sums permitted to be retained pursuant to this 2    subsection, each inter-track wagering location licensee 3    shall pay 1% of the pari-mutuel handle wagered on 4    simulcast wagering to the Horse Racing Tax Allocation 5    Fund, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of 6    paragraph (11) of subsection (h) of Section 26 of this 7    Act.8        (4) A licensee who receives an interstate simulcast 9    may combine its gross or net pools with pools at the 10    sending racetracks pursuant to rules established by the 11    Board. All licensees combining their gross pools at a 12    sending racetrack shall adopt the takeout percentages of 13    the sending racetrack. A licensee may also establish a 14    separate pool and takeout structure for wagering purposes 15    on races conducted at race tracks outside of the State of 16    Illinois. The licensee may permit pari-mutuel wagers 17    placed in other states or countries to be combined with 18    its gross or net wagering pools or other wagering pools.19        (5) After the payment of the interstate commission fee 20    (except for the interstate commission fee on a 21    supplemental interstate simulcast, which shall be paid by 22    the host track and by each non-host licensee through the 23    host track) and all applicable State and local taxes, 24    except as provided in subsection (g) of Section 27 of this 25    Act, the remainder of moneys retained from simulcast 26    wagering pursuant to this subsection (g), and Section 26.2   HB2681- 25 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    shall be divided as follows:2            (A) For interstate simulcast wagers made at a host 3        track, 50% to the host track and 50% to purses at the 4        host track.5            (B) For wagers placed on interstate simulcast 6        races, supplemental simulcasts as defined in 7        subparagraphs (1) and (2), and separately pooled races 8        conducted outside of the State of Illinois made at a 9        non-host licensee, 25% to the host track, 25% to the 10        non-host licensee, and 50% to the purses at the host 11        track.12        (6) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the 13    contrary, non-host licensees who derive their licenses 14    from a track located in a county with a population in 15    excess of 230,000 and that borders the Mississippi River 16    may receive supplemental interstate simulcast races at all 17    times subject to Board approval, which shall be withheld 18    only upon a finding that a supplemental interstate 19    simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of racing.20        (7) Effective January 1, 2017, notwithstanding any 21    provision of this Act to the contrary, after payment of 22    all applicable State and local taxes and interstate 23    commission fees, non-host licensees who derive their 24    licenses from a track located in a county with a 25    population in excess of 230,000 and that borders the 26    Mississippi River shall retain 50% of the retention from   HB2681- 26 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    interstate simulcast wagers and shall pay 50% to purses at 2    the track from which the non-host licensee derives its 3    license.4        (7.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 5    to the contrary, if no standardbred racing is conducted at 6    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar 7    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, all moneys 8    derived by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and 9    inter-track wagering that (1) are to be used for purses 10    and (2) are generated between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 11    6:30 a.m. during that calendar year shall be paid as 12    follows:13            (A) If the licensee that conducts horse racing at 14        that racetrack requests from the Board at least as 15        many racing dates as were conducted in calendar year 16        2000, 80% shall be paid to its thoroughbred purse 17        account; and18            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 19        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund and shall 20        be paid to purses for standardbred races for Illinois 21        conceived and foaled horses conducted at any county 22        fairgrounds. The moneys deposited into the Fund 23        pursuant to this subparagraph (B) shall be deposited 24        within 2 weeks after the day they were generated, 25        shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other 26        moneys paid to standardbred purses under this Act, and   HB2681- 27 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1        shall not be commingled with other moneys paid into 2        that Fund. The moneys deposited pursuant to this 3        subparagraph (B) shall be allocated as provided by the 4        Department of Agriculture, with the advice and 5        assistance of the Illinois Standardbred Breeders Fund 6        Advisory Board.7        (7.2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 8    to the contrary, if no thoroughbred racing is conducted at 9    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar 10    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, all moneys 11    derived by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and 12    inter-track wagering that (1) are to be used for purses 13    and (2) are generated between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 14    6:30 p.m. during that calendar year shall be deposited as 15    follows:16            (A) If the licensee that conducts horse racing at 17        that racetrack requests from the Board at least as 18        many racing dates as were conducted in calendar year 19        2000, 80% shall be deposited into its standardbred 20        purse account; and21            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 22        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund. Moneys 23        deposited into the Illinois Colt Stakes Purse 24        Distribution Fund pursuant to this subparagraph (B) 25        shall be paid to Illinois conceived and foaled 26        thoroughbred breeders' programs and to thoroughbred   HB2681- 28 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1        purses for races conducted at any county fairgrounds 2        for Illinois conceived and foaled horses at the 3        discretion of the Department of Agriculture, with the 4        advice and assistance of the Illinois Thoroughbred 5        Breeders Fund Advisory Board. The moneys deposited 6        into the Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund 7        pursuant to this subparagraph (B) shall be deposited 8        within 2 weeks after the day they were generated, 9        shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other 10        moneys paid to thoroughbred purses under this Act, and 11        shall not be commingled with other moneys deposited 12        into that Fund.13        (8) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the 14    contrary, an organization licensee from a track located in 15    a county with a population in excess of 230,000 and that 16    borders the Mississippi River and its affiliated non-host 17    licensees shall not be entitled to share in any retention 18    generated on racing, inter-track wagering, or simulcast 19    wagering at any other Illinois wagering facility.20        (8.1) Notwithstanding any provisions in this Act to 21    the contrary, if 2 organization licensees are conducting 22    standardbred race meetings concurrently between the hours 23    of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., after payment of all 24    applicable State and local taxes and interstate commission 25    fees, the remainder of the amount retained from simulcast 26    wagering otherwise attributable to the host track and to   HB2681- 29 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    host track purses shall be split daily between the 2 2    organization licensees and the purses at the tracks of the 3    2 organization licensees, respectively, based on each 4    organization licensee's share of the total live handle for 5    that day, provided that this provision shall not apply to 6    any non-host licensee that derives its license from a 7    track located in a county with a population in excess of 8    230,000 and that borders the Mississippi River.9        (9) (Blank).10        (10) (Blank).11        (11) (Blank).12        (12) The Board shall have authority to compel all host 13    tracks to receive the simulcast of any or all races 14    conducted at the Springfield or DuQuoin State fairgrounds 15    and include all such races as part of their simulcast 16    programs.17        (13) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, 18    in the event that the total Illinois pari-mutuel handle on 19    Illinois horse races at all wagering facilities in any 20    calendar year is less than 75% of the total Illinois 21    pari-mutuel handle on Illinois horse races at all such 22    wagering facilities for calendar year 1994, then each 23    wagering facility that has an annual total Illinois 24    pari-mutuel handle on Illinois horse races that is less 25    than 75% of the total Illinois pari-mutuel handle on 26    Illinois horse races at such wagering facility for   HB2681- 30 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    calendar year 1994, shall be permitted to receive, from 2    any amount otherwise payable to the purse account at the 3    race track with which the wagering facility is affiliated 4    in the succeeding calendar year, an amount equal to 2% of 5    the differential in total Illinois pari-mutuel handle on 6    Illinois horse races at the wagering facility between that 7    calendar year in question and 1994 provided, however, that 8    a wagering facility shall not be entitled to any such 9    payment until the Board certifies in writing to the 10    wagering facility the amount to which the wagering 11    facility is entitled and a schedule for payment of the 12    amount to the wagering facility, based on: (i) the racing 13    dates awarded to the race track affiliated with the 14    wagering facility during the succeeding year; (ii) the 15    sums available or anticipated to be available in the purse 16    account of the race track affiliated with the wagering 17    facility for purses during the succeeding year; and (iii) 18    the need to ensure reasonable purse levels during the 19    payment period. The Board's certification shall be 20    provided no later than January 31 of the succeeding year. 21    In the event a wagering facility entitled to a payment 22    under this paragraph (13) is affiliated with a race track 23    that maintains purse accounts for both standardbred and 24    thoroughbred racing, the amount to be paid to the wagering 25    facility shall be divided between each purse account pro 26    rata, based on the amount of Illinois handle on Illinois   HB2681- 31 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    standardbred and thoroughbred racing respectively at the 2    wagering facility during the previous calendar year. 3    Annually, the General Assembly shall appropriate 4    sufficient funds from the General Revenue Fund to the 5    Department of Agriculture for payment into the 6    thoroughbred and standardbred horse racing purse accounts 7    at Illinois pari-mutuel tracks. The amount paid to each 8    purse account shall be the amount certified by the 9    Illinois Racing Board in January to be transferred from 10    each account to each eligible racing facility in 11    accordance with the provisions of this Section. Beginning 12    in the calendar year in which an organization licensee 13    that is eligible to receive payment under this paragraph 14    (13) begins to receive funds from gaming pursuant to an 15    organization gaming license issued under the Illinois 16    Gambling Act, the amount of the payment due to all 17    wagering facilities licensed under that organization 18    licensee under this paragraph (13) shall be the amount 19    certified by the Board in January of that year. An 20    organization licensee and its related wagering facilities 21    shall no longer be able to receive payments under this 22    paragraph (13) beginning in the year subsequent to the 23    first year in which the organization licensee begins to 24    receive funds from gaming pursuant to an organization 25    gaming license issued under the Illinois Gambling Act.26    (h) The Board may approve and license the conduct of   HB2681- 32 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering by inter-track 2wagering licensees and inter-track wagering location licensees 3subject to the following terms and conditions:4        (1) Any person licensed to conduct a race meeting (i) 5    at a track where 60 or more days of racing were conducted 6    during the immediately preceding calendar year or where 7    over the 5 immediately preceding calendar years an average 8    of 30 or more days of racing were conducted annually may be 9    issued an inter-track wagering license; (ii) at a track 10    located in a county that is bounded by the Mississippi 11    River, which has a population of less than 150,000 12    according to the 1990 decennial census, and an average of 13    at least 60 days of racing per year between 1985 and 1993 14    may be issued an inter-track wagering license; (iii) at a 15    track awarded standardbred racing dates; or (iv) at a 16    track located in Madison County that conducted at least 17    100 days of live racing during the immediately preceding 18    calendar year may be issued an inter-track wagering 19    license, unless a lesser schedule of live racing is the 20    result of (A) weather, unsafe track conditions, or other 21    acts of God; (B) an agreement between the organization 22    licensee and the associations representing the largest 23    number of owners, trainers, jockeys, or standardbred 24    drivers who race horses at that organization licensee's 25    racing meeting; or (C) a finding by the Board of 26    extraordinary circumstances and that it was in the best   HB2681- 33 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    interest of the public and the sport to conduct fewer than 2    100 days of live racing. Any such person having operating 3    control of the racing facility may receive inter-track 4    wagering location licenses.

An eligible racetrack conducting standardbred 13    racing may have up to 16 inter-track wagering locations. 14    An application for said license shall be filed with the 15    Board prior to such dates as may be fixed by the Board. 16    With an application for an inter-track wagering location 17    license there shall be delivered to the Board a certified 18    check or bank draft payable to the order of the Board for 19    an amount equal to $500. The application shall be on forms 20    prescribed and furnished by the Board.

If found to be in 26    compliance with the Act and rules and regulations of the   HB2681- 34 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    Board, the Board may then issue a license to conduct 2    inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering to such 3    applicant.

However, inter-track 17    wagering and simulcast wagering shall not be conducted by 18    those licensees at any location within 5 miles of any race 19    track at which a horse race meeting has been licensed in 20    the current year, unless the person having operating 21    control of such race track has given its written consent 22    to such inter-track wagering location licensees, which 23    consent must be filed with the Board at or prior to the 24    time application is made. In the case of any inter-track 25    wagering location licensee initially licensed after 26    December 31, 2013, inter-track wagering and simulcast   HB2681- 36 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    wagering shall not be conducted by those inter-track 2    wagering location licensees that are located outside the 3    City of Chicago at any location within 8 miles of any race 4    track at which a horse race meeting has been licensed in 5    the current year, unless the person having operating 6    control of such race track has given its written consent 7    to such inter-track wagering location licensees, which 8    consent must be filed with the Board at or prior to the 9    time application is made. 10        (8.2) Inter-track wagering or simulcast wagering shall 11    not be conducted by an inter-track wagering location 12    licensee at any location within 100 feet of an existing 13    church, an existing elementary or secondary public school, 14    or an existing elementary or secondary private school 15    registered with or recognized by the State Board of 16    Education.

However, inter-track wagering 21    or simulcast wagering may be conducted at a site within 22    100 feet of a church or school if such church or school has 23    been erected or established after the Board issues the 24    original inter-track wagering location license at the site 25    in question. Inter-track wagering location licensees may 26    conduct inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering only   HB2681- 37 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    in areas that are zoned for commercial or manufacturing 2    purposes or in areas for which a special use has been 3    approved by the local zoning authority. However, no 4    license to conduct inter-track wagering and simulcast 5    wagering shall be granted by the Board with respect to any 6    inter-track wagering location within the jurisdiction of 7    any local zoning authority which has, by ordinance or by 8    resolution, prohibited the establishment of an inter-track 9    wagering location within its jurisdiction. However, 10    inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering may be 11    conducted at a site if such ordinance or resolution is 12    enacted after the Board licenses the original inter-track 13    wagering location licensee for the site in question.14        (9) (Blank).15        (10) An inter-track wagering licensee or an 16    inter-track wagering location licensee may retain, subject 17    to the payment of the privilege taxes and the purses, an 18    amount not to exceed 17% of all money wagered.

The Illinois Horse Racing Act of 1975 is 15amended by changing Section 26 as follows: 16    (230 ILCS 5/26)  (from Ch. 8, par. 37-26)17    Sec. 26. Wagering. 18    (a) Any licensee may conduct and supervise the pari-mutuel 19system of wagering, as defined in Section 3.12 of this Act, on 20horse races conducted by an Illinois organization licensee or 21conducted at a racetrack located in another state or country 22in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 26 of this Act. 23Subject to the prior consent of the Board, licensees may 24supplement any pari-mutuel pool in order to guarantee a   HB2681- 14 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1minimum distribution. Such pari-mutuel method of wagering 2shall not, under any circumstances if conducted under the 3provisions of this Act, be held or construed to be unlawful, 4other statutes of this State to the contrary notwithstanding. 5Subject to rules for advance wagering promulgated by the 6Board, any licensee may accept wagers in advance of the day the 7race wagered upon occurs.8    (b) Except for those gaming activities for which a license 9is obtained and authorized under the Illinois Lottery Law, the 10Charitable Games Act, the Raffles and Poker Runs Act, or the 11Illinois Gambling Act, no other method of betting, pool 12making, wagering or gambling shall be used or permitted by the 13licensee. Each licensee may retain, subject to the payment of 14all applicable taxes and purses, an amount not to exceed 17% of 15all money wagered under subsection (a) of this Section, except 16as may otherwise be permitted under this Act.17    (b-5) An individual may place a wager under the 18pari-mutuel system from any licensed location authorized under 19this Act provided that wager is electronically recorded in the 20manner described in Section 3.12 of this Act. Any wager made 21electronically by an individual while physically on the 22premises of a licensee shall be deemed to have been made at the 23premises of that licensee.24    (c) (Blank).25    (c-5) The sum held by any licensee for payment of 26outstanding pari-mutuel tickets, if unclaimed prior to   HB2681- 15 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1December 31 of the next year, shall be retained by the licensee 2for payment of such tickets until that date. Within 10 days 3thereafter, the balance of such sum remaining unclaimed, less 4any uncashed supplements contributed by such licensee for the 5purpose of guaranteeing minimum distributions of any 6pari-mutuel pool, shall be evenly distributed to the purse 7account of the organization licensee and the organization 8licensee, except that the balance of the sum of all 9outstanding pari-mutuel tickets generated from simulcast 10wagering and inter-track wagering by an organization licensee 11located in a county with a population in excess of 230,000 and 12borders the Mississippi River or any licensee that derives its 13license from that organization licensee shall be evenly 14distributed to the purse account of the organization licensee 15and the organization licensee.16    (d) A pari-mutuel ticket shall be honored until December 1731 of the next calendar year, and the licensee shall pay the 18same and may charge the amount thereof against unpaid money 19similarly accumulated on account of pari-mutuel tickets not 20presented for payment.21    (e) No licensee shall knowingly permit any minor, other 22than an employee of such licensee or an owner, trainer, 23jockey, driver, or employee thereof, to be admitted during a 24racing program unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, or 25any minor to be a patron of the pari-mutuel system of wagering 26conducted or supervised by it.

Beginning January 1, 2000, these 10wagers shall not be subject to State taxation. Until January 111, 2000, when the out-of-State entity conducts a pari-mutuel 12pool separate from the organization licensee, a privilege tax 13equal to 7 1/2% of all monies received by the organization 14licensee from entities in other states or countries pursuant 15to such contracts is imposed on the organization licensee, and 16such privilege tax shall be remitted to the Department of 17Revenue within 48 hours of receipt of the moneys from the 18simulcast. When the out-of-State entity conducts a combined 19pari-mutuel pool with the organization licensee, the tax shall 20be 10% of all monies received by the organization licensee 21with 25% of the receipts from this 10% tax to be distributed to 22the county in which the race was conducted.23    An organization licensee may permit one or more of its 24races to be utilized for pari-mutuel wagering at one or more 25locations in other states and may transmit audio and visual 26signals of races the organization licensee conducts to one or   HB2681- 17 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1more locations outside the State or country and may also 2permit pari-mutuel pools in other states or countries to be 3combined with its gross or net wagering pools or with wagering 4pools established by other states.5    (g) A host track may accept interstate simulcast wagers on 6horse races conducted in other states or countries and shall 7control the number of signals and types of breeds of racing in 8its simulcast program, subject to the disapproval of the 9Board. The Board may prohibit a simulcast program only if it 10finds that the simulcast program is clearly adverse to the 11integrity of racing. The host track simulcast program shall 12include the signal of live racing of all organization 13licensees. All non-host licensees and advance deposit wagering 14licensees shall carry the signal of and accept wagers on live 15racing of all organization licensees. Advance deposit wagering 16licensees shall not be permitted to accept out-of-state wagers 17on any Illinois signal provided pursuant to this Section 18without the approval and consent of the organization licensee 19providing the signal. For one year after August 15, 2014 (the 20effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host licensees may 21carry the host track simulcast program and shall accept wagers 22on all races included as part of the simulcast program of horse 23races conducted at race tracks located within North America 24upon which wagering is permitted. For a period of one year 25after August 15, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 2698-968), on horse races conducted at race tracks located   HB2681- 18 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1outside of North America, non-host licensees may accept wagers 2on all races included as part of the simulcast program upon 3which wagering is permitted. Beginning August 15, 2015 (one 4year after the effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host 5licensees may carry the host track simulcast program and shall 6accept wagers on all races included as part of the simulcast 7program upon which wagering is permitted. All organization 8licensees shall provide their live signal to all advance 9deposit wagering licensees for a simulcast commission fee not 10to exceed 6% of the advance deposit wagering licensee's 11Illinois handle on the organization licensee's signal without 12prior approval by the Board. The Board may adopt rules under 13which it may permit simulcast commission fees in excess of 6%. 14The Board shall adopt rules limiting the interstate commission 15fees charged to an advance deposit wagering licensee. The 16Board shall adopt rules regarding advance deposit wagering on 17interstate simulcast races that shall reflect, among other 18things, the General Assembly's desire to maximize revenues to 19the State, horsemen purses, and organization licensees. 20However, organization licensees providing live signals 21pursuant to the requirements of this subsection (g) may 22petition the Board to withhold their live signals from an 23advance deposit wagering licensee if the organization licensee 24discovers and the Board finds reputable or credible 25information that the advance deposit wagering licensee is 26under investigation by another state or federal governmental   HB2681- 19 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1agency, the advance deposit wagering licensee's license has 2been suspended in another state, or the advance deposit 3wagering licensee's license is in revocation proceedings in 4another state. The organization licensee's provision of their 5live signal to an advance deposit wagering licensee under this 6subsection (g) pertains to wagers placed from within Illinois. 7Advance deposit wagering licensees may place advance deposit 8wagering terminals at wagering facilities as a convenience to 9customers. The advance deposit wagering licensee shall not 10charge or collect any fee from purses for the placement of the 11advance deposit wagering terminals. The costs and expenses of 12the host track and non-host licensees associated with 13interstate simulcast wagering, other than the interstate 14commission fee, shall be borne by the host track and all 15non-host licensees incurring these costs. The interstate 16commission fee shall not exceed 5% of Illinois handle on the 17interstate simulcast race or races without prior approval of 18the Board. The Board shall promulgate rules under which it may 19permit interstate commission fees in excess of 5%. The 20interstate commission fee and other fees charged by the 21sending racetrack, including, but not limited to, satellite 22decoder fees, shall be uniformly applied to the host track and 23all non-host licensees.24    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an 25organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 26association representing the largest number of owners,   HB2681- 20 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 2that organization licensee's racing meeting, may maintain a 3system whereby advance deposit wagering may take place or an 4organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 5association representing the largest number of owners, 6trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 7that organization licensee's racing meeting, may contract with 8another person to carry out a system of advance deposit 9wagering. Such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Only 10with respect to an appeal to the Board that consent for an 11organization licensee that maintains its own advance deposit 12wagering system is being unreasonably withheld, the Board 13shall issue a final order within 30 days after initiation of 14the appeal, and the organization licensee's advance deposit 15wagering system may remain operational during that 30-day 16period. The actions of any organization licensee who conducts 17advance deposit wagering or any person who has a contract with 18an organization licensee to conduct advance deposit wagering 19who conducts advance deposit wagering on or after January 1, 202013 and prior to June 7, 2013 (the effective date of Public 21Act 98-18) taken in reliance on the changes made to this 22subsection (g) by Public Act 98-18 are hereby validated, 23provided payment of all applicable pari-mutuel taxes are 24remitted to the Board. All advance deposit wagers placed from 25within Illinois must be placed through a Board-approved 26advance deposit wagering licensee; no other entity may accept   HB2681- 21 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1an advance deposit wager from a person within Illinois. All 2advance deposit wagering is subject to any rules adopted by 3the Board. The Board may adopt rules necessary to regulate 4advance deposit wagering through the use of emergency 5rulemaking in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Illinois 6Administrative Procedure Act. The General Assembly finds that 7the adoption of rules to regulate advance deposit wagering is 8deemed an emergency and necessary for the public interest, 9safety, and welfare.

Consent granted under this paragraph (2) to any 13    inter-track wagering licensee shall be deemed consent to 14    all non-host licensees. The interstate commission fee for 15    the supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid by all 16    participating non-host licensees.17        (3) Each licensee conducting interstate simulcast 18    wagering may retain, subject to the payment of all 19    applicable taxes and the purses, an amount not to exceed 20    17% of all money wagered. If any licensee conducts the 21    pari-mutuel system wagering on races conducted at 22    racetracks in another state or country, each such race or 23    race program shall be considered a separate racing day for 24    the purpose of determining the daily handle and computing 25    the privilege tax of that daily handle as provided in 26    subsection (a) of Section 27. Until January 1, 2000, from   HB2681- 24 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    the sums permitted to be retained pursuant to this 2    subsection, each inter-track wagering location licensee 3    shall pay 1% of the pari-mutuel handle wagered on 4    simulcast wagering to the Horse Racing Tax Allocation 5    Fund, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of 6    paragraph (11) of subsection (h) of Section 26 of this 7    Act.8        (4) A licensee who receives an interstate simulcast 9    may combine its gross or net pools with pools at the 10    sending racetracks pursuant to rules established by the 11    Board. All licensees combining their gross pools at a 12    sending racetrack shall adopt the takeout percentages of 13    the sending racetrack. A licensee may also establish a 14    separate pool and takeout structure for wagering purposes 15    on races conducted at race tracks outside of the State of 16    Illinois. The licensee may permit pari-mutuel wagers 17    placed in other states or countries to be combined with 18    its gross or net wagering pools or other wagering pools.19        (5) After the payment of the interstate commission fee 20    (except for the interstate commission fee on a 21    supplemental interstate simulcast, which shall be paid by 22    the host track and by each non-host licensee through the 23    host track) and all applicable State and local taxes, 24    except as provided in subsection (g) of Section 27 of this 25    Act, the remainder of moneys retained from simulcast 26    wagering pursuant to this subsection (g), and Section 26.2   HB2681- 25 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    shall be divided as follows:2            (A) For interstate simulcast wagers made at a host 3        track, 50% to the host track and 50% to purses at the 4        host track.5            (B) For wagers placed on interstate simulcast 6        races, supplemental simulcasts as defined in 7        subparagraphs (1) and (2), and separately pooled races 8        conducted outside of the State of Illinois made at a 9        non-host licensee, 25% to the host track, 25% to the 10        non-host licensee, and 50% to the purses at the host 11        track.12        (6) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the 13    contrary, non-host licensees who derive their licenses 14    from a track located in a county with a population in 15    excess of 230,000 and that borders the Mississippi River 16    may receive supplemental interstate simulcast races at all 17    times subject to Board approval, which shall be withheld 18    only upon a finding that a supplemental interstate 19    simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of racing.20        (7) Effective January 1, 2017, notwithstanding any 21    provision of this Act to the contrary, after payment of 22    all applicable State and local taxes and interstate 23    commission fees, non-host licensees who derive their 24    licenses from a track located in a county with a 25    population in excess of 230,000 and that borders the 26    Mississippi River shall retain 50% of the retention from   HB2681- 26 -LRB104 06230 RTM 16265 b1    interstate simulcast wagers and shall pay 50% to purses at 2    the track from which the non-host licensee derives its 3    license.4        (7.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 5    to the contrary, if no standardbred racing is conducted at 6    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar 7    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, all moneys 8    derived by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and 9    inter-track wagering that (1) are to be used for purses 10    and (2) are generated between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 11    6:30 a.m. during that calendar year shall be paid as 12    follows:13            (A) If the licensee that conducts horse racing at 14        that racetrack requests from the Board at least as 15        many racing dates as were conducted in calendar year 16        2000, 80% shall be paid to its thoroughbred purse 17        account; and18            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 19        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund and shall 20        be paid to purses for standardbred races for Illinois 21        conceived and foaled horses conducted at any county 22        fairgrounds.
