For purposes of this subparagraph, 9        the taxpayer's separate taxable income shall be 10        determined as if the election provided by Section 11        243(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code had been in 12        effect for all such years;13            (F) Cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative 14        corporation or association, the taxable income of such 15        organization determined in accordance with the 16        provisions of Section 1381 through 1388 of the 17        Internal Revenue Code, but without regard to the 18        prohibition against offsetting losses from patronage 19        activities against income from nonpatronage 20        activities; except that a cooperative corporation or 21        association may make an election to follow its federal 22        income tax treatment of patronage losses and 23        nonpatronage losses. In the event such election is 24        made, such losses shall be computed and carried over 25        in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of Section 26        207 of this Act and apportioned by the apportionment   SB1833- 103 -LRB104 03837 HLH 13861 b1        factor reported by the cooperative on its Illinois 2        income tax return filed for the taxable year in which 3        the losses are incurred. The election shall be 4        effective for all taxable years with original returns 5        due on or after the date of the election. In addition, 6        the cooperative may file an amended return or returns, 7        as allowed under this Act, to provide that the 8        election shall be effective for losses incurred or 9        carried forward for taxable years occurring prior to 10        the date of the election. Once made, the election may 11        only be revoked upon approval of the Director. The 12        Department shall adopt rules setting forth 13        requirements for documenting the elections and any 14        resulting Illinois net loss and the standards to be 15        used by the Director in evaluating requests to revoke 16        elections. Public Act 96-932 is declaratory of 17        existing law; 18            (G) Subchapter S corporations. In the case of: (i) 19        a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 20        effect an election for the taxable year under Section 21        1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxable income 22        of such corporation determined in accordance with 23        Section 1363(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, except 24        that taxable income shall take into account those 25        items which are required by Section 1363(b)(1) of the 26        Internal Revenue Code to be separately stated; and   SB1833- 104 -LRB104 03837 HLH 13861 b1        (ii) a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 2        effect a federal election to opt out of the provisions 3        of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 and have 4        applied instead the prior federal Subchapter S rules 5        as in effect on July 1, 1982, the taxable income of 6        such corporation determined in accordance with the 7        federal Subchapter S rules as in effect on July 1, 8        1982; and9            (H) Partnerships. In the case of a partnership, 10        taxable income determined in accordance with Section 11        703 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that taxable 12        income shall take into account those items which are 13        required by Section 703(a)(1) to be separately stated 14        but which would be taken into account by an individual 15        in calculating his taxable income.16        (3) Recapture of business expenses on disposition of 17    asset or business. Notwithstanding any other law to the 18    contrary, if in prior years income from an asset or 19    business has been classified as business income and in a 20    later year is demonstrated to be non-business income, then 21    all expenses, without limitation, deducted in such later 22    year and in the 2 immediately preceding taxable years 23    related to that asset or business that generated the 24    non-business income shall be added back and recaptured as 25    business income in the year of the disposition of the 26    asset or business. Such amount shall be apportioned to   SB1833- 105 -LRB104 03837 HLH 13861 b1    Illinois using the greater of the apportionment fraction 2    computed for the business under Section 304 of this Act 3    for the taxable year or the average of the apportionment 4    fractions computed for the business under Section 304 of 5    this Act for the taxable year and for the 2 immediately 6    preceding taxable years.  7    (f) Valuation limitation amount.8        (1) In general. The valuation limitation amount 9    referred to in subsections (a)(2)(G), (c)(2)(I) and 10    (d)(2)(E) is an amount equal to:11            (A) The sum of the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 12        amounts (to the extent consisting of gain reportable 13        under the provisions of Section 1245 or 1250 of the 14        Internal Revenue Code) for all property in respect of 15        which such gain was reported for the taxable year; 16        plus17            (B) The lesser of (i) the sum of the pre-August 1, 18        1969 appreciation amounts (to the extent consisting of 19        capital gain) for all property in respect of which 20        such gain was reported for federal income tax purposes 21        for the taxable year, or (ii) the net capital gain for 22        the taxable year, reduced in either case by any amount 23        of such gain included in the amount determined under 24        subsection (a)(2)(F) or (c)(2)(H).25        (2) Pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation amount.  SB1833- 106 -LRB104 03837 HLH 13861 b1            (A) If the fair market value of property referred 2        to in paragraph (1) was readily ascertainable on 3        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 4        amount for such property is the lesser of (i) the 5        excess of such fair market value over the taxpayer's 6        basis (for determining gain) for such property on that 7        date (determined under the Internal Revenue Code as in 8        effect on that date), or (ii) the total gain realized 9        and reportable for federal income tax purposes in 10        respect of the sale, exchange or other disposition of 11        such property.12            (B) If the fair market value of property referred 13        to in paragraph (1) was not readily ascertainable on 14        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 15        amount for such property is that amount which bears 16        the same ratio to the total gain reported in respect of 17        the property for federal income tax purposes for the 18        taxable year, as the number of full calendar months in 19        that part of the taxpayer's holding period for the 20        property ending July 31, 1969 bears to the number of 21        full calendar months in the taxpayer's entire holding 22        period for the property.23            (C) The Department shall prescribe such 24        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the 25        purposes of this paragraph.   SB1833- 107 -LRB104 03837 HLH 13861 b1    (g) Double deductions. Unless specifically provided 2otherwise, nothing in this Section shall permit the same item 3to be deducted more than once. 4    (g-5) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 52026, in calculating the taxpayer's base income, the 6taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income shall also be 7modified to exclude (i) the portion of income or loss that is 8received from a trade or business conducted within and without 9Illinois and that is not derived from or connected with 10Illinois sources as determined in the provisions in Article 3 11of this Act and (ii) the portion of income or loss that is 12received from a pass-through entity conducting business within 13and without Illinois and that is not derived from or connected 14with Illinois sources as determined in the provisions in 15Article 3 of this Act.

The addition modification required by this 15        subparagraph shall be reduced to the extent that 16        dividends were included in base income of the unitary 17        group for the same taxable year and received by the 18        taxpayer or by a member of the taxpayer's unitary 19        business group (including amounts included in gross 20        income under Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal 21        Revenue Code and amounts included in gross income 22        under Section 78 of the Internal Revenue Code) with 23        respect to the stock of the same person to whom the 24        intangible expenses and costs were directly or 25        indirectly paid, incurred, or accrued.
