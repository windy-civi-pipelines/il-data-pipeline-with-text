The School Code is amended by adding Section 522-101 as follows: 6    (105 ILCS 5/22-101 new)7    Sec. 22-101. Denial of free education prohibited. 8    (a) The General Assembly finds that:9        (1) In June 1982, the United States Supreme Court 10    issued Plyler v. Doe (457 U.S. 202), a landmark decision 11    that held that it is unconstitutional for states to deny 12    children a free public education based on immigration 13    status. The Supreme Court found that any resources that 14    might be saved from excluding undocumented children from 15    public schools were far outweighed by the harms imposed on 16    society at large from denying these children an education.17        (2) For more than 40 years, Plyler v. Doe has ensured 18    equal access to education for children regardless of 19    immigration status, but anti-immigrant sentiment continues 20    to threaten that right.21        (3) A positive and healthy school climate is one in 22    which children, educators, and staff feel safe, welcomed, 23    supported, and connected. In an effort to create a   SB2065- 2 -LRB104 10774 LNS 20854 b1    positive school climate, State schools must take steps to 2    protect the integrity of school learning environments for 3    all children.4        (4) Anti-immigrant rhetoric and threats directed at 5    immigrants, in the public forum and directed at 6    individuals, chills and discourages parents from enrolling 7    their children in schools to access the education that 8    they are entitled to.9        (5) With risks of changes to approaches to immigration 10    policies and enforcement at the federal level, it is more 11    important than ever for the State to work to protect 12    children and ensure that, regardless of their immigration 13    status, they may continue to take advantage of the 14    education to which they are entitled, free from 15    intimidation or risk of a loss of access to resources and 16    programs that other students enjoy, consistent with Plyler 17    v. Doe as in effect on January 1, 2025.18    (b) As used in this Section:19    "Citizenship or immigration status" means all matters 20regarding citizenship of the United States or any other 21country or the authority, or lack thereof, to reside in or 22otherwise to be present in the United States, including an 23individual's nationality and country of citizenship.24    "Civil immigration warrant" has the same meaning given in 25Section 10 of the Illinois TRUST Act.26    "Immigration agent" has the same meaning given in Section   SB2065- 3 -LRB104 10774 LNS 20854 b110 of the Illinois TRUST Act.2    "Immigration detainer" has the same meaning given in 3Section 10 of the Illinois TRUST Act.4    "Prevailing party" includes any party:5        (1) who obtains some of his or her requested relief 6    through a judicial judgment in his or her favor;7        (2) who obtains some of his or her requested relief 8    through any settlement agreement approved by the court; or9        (3) whose pursuit of a non-frivolous claim was a 10    catalyst for a unilateral change in position by the 11    opposing party relative to the relief sought.12    "School" means every public school, school district, and 13governing body, including special charter district and charter 14schools, organized under this Code, and their agents, 15including contracted parties.16    (c) No child may be denied a free public education through 17secondary school while in this State based on the child's or 18associated person's perceived or actual citizenship or 19immigration status.20        (1) A school must not exclude a child, or associated 21    person, from participation in or deny a child, or 22    associated person, the benefits of any program or activity 23    on the grounds of that child's, or associated person's, 24    actual or perceived citizenship or immigration status.25        (2) A school must not use criteria, measures, or 26    methods of administration that have the effect of   SB2065- 4 -LRB104 10774 LNS 20854 b1    excluding from participation or denying the benefits of 2    any program or activity because of a child's, or 3    associated person's, actual or perceived immigration 4    status.
