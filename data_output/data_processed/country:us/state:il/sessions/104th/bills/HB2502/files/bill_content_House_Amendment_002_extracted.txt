If the board acts to expel a student, 21the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 22reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 23is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 24shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 25the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately   10400HB2502ham002- 10 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 2in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 3denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 4which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 5of students or staff in the alternative program. 6    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 7superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 8principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 9students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 10suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 11the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 12subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 13shall lie against them for such suspension.

The 14suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 15specific duration of the suspension.16    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 17and consequences available to school officials, school 18exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 19are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 20and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 21extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 22only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 23students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 24recommended that school officials consider forms of 25non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 26suspensions or expulsions.   10400HB2502ham002- 12 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 2Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 3by which school administrators are required to suspend or 4expel students for particular behaviors.5    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 6used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 7pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 8students' learning opportunities.

A 23student must not be denied transfer because of the expulsion, 24except in cases in which such transfer is deemed to cause a 25threat to the safety of students or staff in the alternative 26program.   10400HB2502ham002- 21 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 2superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 3principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 4students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 5suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 6the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 7subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 8shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 9policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 10principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 11school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 12to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 13gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 14may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 15reasons. 16    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 17parents or guardians of a student along with a full statement 18of the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right 19to a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 20notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 21suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardians, 22the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 23review such action of the superintendent or principal, 24assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 25parents or guardians of the student may appear and discuss the 26suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing   10400HB2502ham002- 22 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 2a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 3its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 4hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 5appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 6subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 7decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 8misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 9suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 10specific duration of the suspension.11    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 12and consequences available to school officials, school 13exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 14are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 15and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 16extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 17only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 18students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 19recommended that school officials consider forms of 20non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 21suspensions or expulsions. 22    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 23Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 24by which school administrators are required to suspend or 25expel students for particular behaviors.26    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be   10400HB2502ham002- 23 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 2pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 3students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 4subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 5other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 6a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 7School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 8such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 9length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.10    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 11out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 12and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 13only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 14disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 15student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 16a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 17the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 18interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 19this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 20students, staff, or members of the school community" and 21"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 22operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 23basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 24(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 25available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 26exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials   10400HB2502ham002- 24 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 2address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 3exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 4suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 5Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 6of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 7interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 8there were no other appropriate and available interventions.9    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 10than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 11support services during the period of their suspension. For 12purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 13support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 14Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 15this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 16to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 17such appropriate and available services. 18    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 19appropriate and available support services.20    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 21re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 22expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 23consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 24Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 25and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 26suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an   10400HB2502ham002- 25 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 2Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 3    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 4suspended students, including those students suspended from 5the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 6school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 7equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 8a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 9that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 10alternate transportation to school. 11    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 12subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 13subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be 14considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 15parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 16violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 17parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 18emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 19throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 20its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 21student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 22emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany 23the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 24representative or support person must comply with any rules of 25the school district's hearing process. If the representative 26or support person violates the rules or engages in behavior or   10400HB2502ham002- 26 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1advocacy that harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a 2witness, or anyone else in attendance at the hearing, the 3representative or support person may be prohibited from 4further participation in the hearing or proceeding. A 5suspension or expulsion proceeding under this subsection 6(b-35) must be conducted independently from any ongoing 7criminal investigation or proceeding, and an absence of 8pending or possible criminal charges, criminal investigations, 9or proceedings may not be a factor in school disciplinary 10decisions.11    (b-40) During a suspension review hearing conducted under 12subsection (b) or an expulsion hearing conducted under 13subsection (a) that involves allegations of sexual violence by 14the student who is subject to discipline, neither the student 15nor his or her representative shall directly question nor have 16direct contact with the alleged victim. The student who is 17subject to discipline or his or her representative may, at the 18discretion and direction of the school board or its appointed 19hearing officer, suggest questions to be posed by the school 20board or its appointed hearing officer to the alleged victim. 21    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 22local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 23meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 24the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.25    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 26provide ongoing professional development to all school   10400HB2502ham002- 27 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1personnel, school board members, and school resource officers 2on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 3adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 4involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 5culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 6environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 7the appropriate and available supportive services for the 8promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 9developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 10positive and healthy school climates. 11    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 12time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 13case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 14brought one of the following objects to school, any 15school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 16that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 17expelled for a period of not less than one year:18        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 19    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 20    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 21    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 22    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 23    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period 24    under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the 25    superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may 26    be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.  10400HB2502ham002- 28 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon 2    regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other 3    object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily 4    harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in 5    subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). The expulsion 6    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 7    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 8    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 9Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 10consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 11Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 12expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 13transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 14Article 13A of the School Code.15    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 16superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 17principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 18student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 19a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 20calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 21that student has been determined to have made an explicit 22threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 23student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 24website through which the threat was made is a site that was 25accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 26was available to third parties who worked or studied within   10400HB2502ham002- 29 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 2the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 3the safety and security of the threatened individual because 4of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 5student inside the school. 6    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 7authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 8lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 9equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 10personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 11without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 12search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 13Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 14privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 15left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 16the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 17conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 18lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 19controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 20illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 21searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 22If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 23evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 24the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 25such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 26disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also   10400HB2502ham002- 30 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.2    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or 3expulsion from school and all school activities and a 4prohibition from being present on school grounds.5    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if 6a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any 7public or private school in this or any other state, the 8student must complete the entire term of the suspension or 9expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A 10of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program 11under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the 12school district if there is no threat to the safety of students 13or staff in the alternative program. A school district that 14adopts a policy under this subsection (g) must include a 15provision allowing for consideration of any mitigating 16factors, including, but not limited to, a student's status as 17a parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 18violence, as defined in Article 26A. 19    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 20students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 21difficulties.22    (i) In this subsection (i), "municipal code violation" 23means the violation of a rule or regulation established by a 24local government authority, authorized by Section 1-2-1 of the 25Illinois Municipal Code.26    A student must may not be issued a monetary fine, or fee,   10400HB2502ham002- 31 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a1ticket, or citation as a school-based disciplinary consequence 2or for a municipal code violation on school grounds during 3school hours or while taking school transportation by any 4person as a disciplinary consequence, though this shall not 5preclude requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, 6stolen, or damaged property.7    This subsection (i) does not modify school disciplinary 8responses under this Section or Section 10-20.14 of this Code 9that existed before the effective date of this amendatory Act 10of the 104th General Assembly or responses to alleged 11delinquent or criminal conduct set forth in this Code, Article 12V of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, or the Criminal Code of 132012. This subsection (i) does not apply to violations of 14traffic, boating, or fish and game laws. 15    (j) Subsections (a) through (i) of this Section shall 16apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter schools, 17special charter districts, and school districts organized 18under Article 34 of this Code. 19    (k) Through June 30, 2026, the expulsion of students 20enrolled in programs funded under Section 1C-2 of this Code is 21subject to the requirements under paragraph (7) of subsection 22(a) of Section 2-3.71 of this Code.23    (k-5) On and after July 1, 2026, the expulsion of children 24enrolled in programs funded under Section 15-25 of the 25Department of Early Childhood Act is subject to the 26requirements of paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section   10400HB2502ham002- 32 -LRB104 06246 LNS 24525 a115-30 of the Department of Early Childhood Act. 2    (l) An in-school suspension program provided by a school 3district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may 4focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and 5positive interaction with other students and school personnel. 6A school district may employ a school social worker or a 7licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school 8suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12.9(Source: P.A. 102-466, eff. 7-1-25; 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 10102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-594, eff. 6-25-24; 103-896, eff. 118-9-24; revised 9-25-24.) 12    (105 ILCS 5/26-12)  (from Ch. 122, par. 26-12)13    Sec. 26-12.
