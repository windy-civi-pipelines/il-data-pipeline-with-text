Findings and intent.5    (a) The General Assembly finds the following:6        (1) Public Act 99-456 prohibited schools from issuing 7    monetary fines or fees as a disciplinary consequence.8        (2) Public Act 100-810 prohibited schools from 9    referring truant minors to local public entities for the 10    purpose of issuing fines or fees as punishment for truancy 11    and required schools to document the provision of all 12    appropriate and available supportive services before 13    referring an individual having custody of a truant minor 14    to a local public entity.15        (3) Thousands of students have been referred to 16    municipalities for behaviors occurring on school grounds, 17    during school-related events, or while taking school   10400HB2502ham001- 2 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1    transportation.2        (4) Municipal tickets, citations, and ordinance 3    violations disproportionately impact students of color and 4    students with disabilities.5        (5) Municipal fines and fees associated with municipal 6    tickets, citations, and ordinance violations create 7    financial hardship for minors and their families.8        (6) Municipal proceedings do not provide minors with 9    sufficient due process, confidentiality, or record 10    expungement protections.11        (7) In accordance with federal law and regulations, 12    Illinois schools provide data to the Civil Rights Data 13    Collection required by the Office for Civil Rights of the 14    U.S. Department of Education, including data on referrals 15    to law enforcement, and which disaggregates referrals 16    resulting in arrests, but does not disaggregate referrals 17    resulting in a municipal ticket, citation, or ordinance 18    violation.19    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to learn more 20about the prevalence of student referrals to law enforcement, 21particularly those resulting in municipal tickets, citations, 22and ordinance violations for behaviors occurring on school 23grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school 24transportation. It is not the intent of the General Assembly 25to modify current school disciplinary responses provided in 26the School Code or responses to alleged delinquent or criminal   10400HB2502ham001- 3 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1conduct as set forth in the School Code, the Juvenile Court Act 2of 1987, or the Criminal Code of 2012. 3    Section 5.

Such request shall be made by registered or 18certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 19the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 20at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 21date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 22hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 23shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 24heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 25as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student,   10400HB2502ham001- 10 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 2reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 3is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 4shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 5the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 6transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 7in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 8denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 9which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 10of students or staff in the alternative program. 11    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 12superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 13principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 14students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 15suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 16the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 17subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 18shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 19policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 20principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 21school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 22to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 23gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 24may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 25reasons. 26    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the   10400HB2502ham001- 11 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1parents or guardian of a student along with a full statement of 2the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right to 3a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 4notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 5suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardian, 6the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 7review such action of the superintendent or principal, 8assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 9parents or guardian of the student may appear and discuss the 10suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 11officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 12a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 13its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 14hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 15appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 16subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 17decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 18misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 19suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 20specific duration of the suspension.21    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 22and consequences available to school officials, school 23exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 24are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 25and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 26extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them   10400HB2502ham001- 12 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 2students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 3recommended that school officials consider forms of 4non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 5suspensions or expulsions. 6    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 7Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 8by which school administrators are required to suspend or 9expel students for particular behaviors.10    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 11used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 12pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 13students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 14subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 15other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 16a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 17School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 18such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 19length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.20    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 21out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 22and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 23only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 24disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 25student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 26a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of   10400HB2502ham001- 13 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 2interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 3this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 4students, staff, or members of the school community" and 5"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 6operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 7basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 8(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 9available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 10exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 11shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 12address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 13exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 14suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 15Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 16of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 17interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 18there were no other appropriate and available interventions.19    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 20than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 21support services during the period of their suspension.

In 7consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 8Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 9and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 10suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 11alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 12Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 13    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 14suspended students, including those students suspended from 15the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 16school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 17equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 18a student's parent or guardian to notify school officials that 19a student suspended from the school bus does not have 20alternate transportation to school. 21    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 22local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 23meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 24the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.25    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 26provide ongoing professional development to all school   10400HB2502ham001- 15 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1personnel, school board members, and school resource officers, 2on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 3adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 4involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 5culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 6environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 7the appropriate and available supportive services for the 8promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 9developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 10positive and healthy school climates. 11    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 12time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 13case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 14brought one of the following objects to school, any 15school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 16that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 17expelled for a period of not less than one year:18        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 19    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 20    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 21    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 22    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 23    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012.

The expulsion 6    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 7    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 8    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 9Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 10consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 11Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 12expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 13transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 14Article 13A of the School Code.15    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 16superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 17principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 18student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 19a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 20calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 21that student has been determined to have made an explicit 22threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 23student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 24website through which the threat was made is a site that was 25accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 26was available to third parties who worked or studied within   10400HB2502ham001- 17 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 2the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 3the safety and security of the threatened individual because 4of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 5student inside the school. 6    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 7authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 8lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 9equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 10personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 11without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 12search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 13Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 14privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 15left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 16the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 17conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 18lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 19controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 20illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 21searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 22If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 23evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 24the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 25such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 26disciplinary action may be taken.

If the board acts to 21expel a student, the written expulsion decision shall detail 22the specific reasons why removing the student from the 23learning environment is in the best interest of the school. 24The expulsion decision shall also include a rationale as to 25the specific duration of the expulsion. An expelled student   10400HB2502ham001- 21 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1may be immediately transferred to an alternative program in 2the manner provided in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A 3student must not be denied transfer because of the expulsion, 4except in cases in which such transfer is deemed to cause a 5threat to the safety of students or staff in the alternative 6program. 7    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 8superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 9principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 10students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 11suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 12the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 13subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 14shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 15policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 16principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 17school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 18to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 19gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 20may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 21reasons. 22    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 23parents or guardians of a student along with a full statement 24of the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right 25to a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 26notice, including the reason for the suspension and the   10400HB2502ham001- 22 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardians, 2the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 3review such action of the superintendent or principal, 4assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 5parents or guardians of the student may appear and discuss the 6suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 7officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 8a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 9its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 10hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 11appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 12subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 13decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 14misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 15suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 16specific duration of the suspension.17    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 18and consequences available to school officials, school 19exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 20are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 21and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 22extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 23only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 24students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 25recommended that school officials consider forms of 26non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school   10400HB2502ham001- 23 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1suspensions or expulsions. 2    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 3Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 4by which school administrators are required to suspend or 5expel students for particular behaviors.6    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 7used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 8pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 9students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 10subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 11other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 12a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 13School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 14such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 15length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.16    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 17out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 18and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 19only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 20disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 21student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 22a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 23the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 24interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 25this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 26students, staff, or members of the school community" and   10400HB2502ham001- 24 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 2operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 3basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 4(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 5available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 6exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 7shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 8address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 9exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 10suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 11Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 12of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 13interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 14there were no other appropriate and available interventions.15    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 16than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 17support services during the period of their suspension. For 18purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 19support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 20Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 21this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 22to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 23such appropriate and available services. 24    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 25appropriate and available support services.26    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the   10400HB2502ham001- 25 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 2expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 3consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 4Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 5and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 6suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 7alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 8Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 9    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 10suspended students, including those students suspended from 11the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 12school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 13equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 14a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 15that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 16alternate transportation to school. 17    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 18subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 19subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be 20considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 21parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 22violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 23parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 24emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 25throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 26its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the   10400HB2502ham001- 26 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 2emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany 3the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 4representative or support person must comply with any rules of 5the school district's hearing process. If the representative 6or support person violates the rules or engages in behavior or 7advocacy that harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a 8witness, or anyone else in attendance at the hearing, the 9representative or support person may be prohibited from 10further participation in the hearing or proceeding. A 11suspension or expulsion proceeding under this subsection 12(b-35) must be conducted independently from any ongoing 13criminal investigation or proceeding, and an absence of 14pending or possible criminal charges, criminal investigations, 15or proceedings may not be a factor in school disciplinary 16decisions.17    (b-40) During a suspension review hearing conducted under 18subsection (b) or an expulsion hearing conducted under 19subsection (a) that involves allegations of sexual violence by 20the student who is subject to discipline, neither the student 21nor his or her representative shall directly question nor have 22direct contact with the alleged victim. The student who is 23subject to discipline or his or her representative may, at the 24discretion and direction of the school board or its appointed 25hearing officer, suggest questions to be posed by the school 26board or its appointed hearing officer to the alleged victim.   10400HB2502ham001- 27 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 2local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 3meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 4the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.5    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 6provide ongoing professional development to all school 7personnel, school board members, and school resource officers 8on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 9adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 10involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 11culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 12environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 13the appropriate and available supportive services for the 14promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 15developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 16positive and healthy school climates. 17    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 18time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 19case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 20brought one of the following objects to school, any 21school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 22that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 23expelled for a period of not less than one year:24        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 25    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 26    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code,   10400HB2502ham001- 28 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 2    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 3    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period 4    under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the 5    superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may 6    be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.7        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon 8    regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other 9    object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily 10    harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in 11    subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). The expulsion 12    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 13    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 14    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 15Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 16consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 17Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 18expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 19transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 20Article 13A of the School Code.21    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 22superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 23principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 24student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 25a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 26calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i)   10400HB2502ham001- 29 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1that student has been determined to have made an explicit 2threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 3student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 4website through which the threat was made is a site that was 5accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 6was available to third parties who worked or studied within 7the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 8the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 9the safety and security of the threatened individual because 10of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 11student inside the school. 12    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 13authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 14lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 15equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 16personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 17without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 18search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 19Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 20privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 21left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 22the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 23conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 24lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 25controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 26illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including   10400HB2502ham001- 30 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 2If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 3evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 4the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 5such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 6disciplinary action may be taken.

A school district that 20adopts a policy under this subsection (g) must include a 21provision allowing for consideration of any mitigating 22factors, including, but not limited to, a student's status as 23a parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 24violence, as defined in Article 26A. 25    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 26students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic   10400HB2502ham001- 31 -LRB104 06246 LNS 23713 a1difficulties.2    (i) In this subsection (i), "municipal code violation" 3means the violation of a rule or regulation established by a 4local government authority, authorized by Section 1-2-1 of the 5Illinois Municipal Code.6    A student must may not be issued a monetary fine, or fee, 7ticket, or citation as a school-based disciplinary consequence 8or for a municipal code violation on school grounds during 9school-related events or activities, whether in-person or 10virtual, or while taking school transportation by any person 11as a disciplinary consequence, though this shall not preclude 12requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, stolen, 13or damaged property.14    This subsection (i) does not modify school disciplinary 15responses under this Section or Section 10-20.14 of this Code 16that existed before the effective date of this amendatory Act 17of the 104th General Assembly or responses to alleged 18delinquent or criminal conduct set forth in this Code, Article 19V of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, or the Criminal Code of 202012.
