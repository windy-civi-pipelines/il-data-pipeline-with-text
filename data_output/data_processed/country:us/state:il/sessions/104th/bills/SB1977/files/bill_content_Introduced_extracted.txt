In all other 20counties, the amount of the exemption is as follows: (i) 21through taxable year 2005 and for taxable year 2007 and 22thereafter, the amount of this exemption shall be the 23equalized assessed value of the residence in the taxable year 24for which application is made minus the base amount; and (ii) 25for taxable year 2006, the amount of the exemption is as 26follows:  SB1977- 9 -LRB104 10823 HLH 20904 b1        (1) For an applicant who has a household income of 2    $45,000 or less, the amount of the exemption is the 3    equalized assessed value of the residence in the taxable 4    year for which application is made minus the base amount.5        (2) For an applicant who has a household income 6    exceeding $45,000 but not exceeding $46,250, the amount of 7    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 8    residence in the taxable year for which application is 9    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.8.10        (3) For an applicant who has a household income 11    exceeding $46,250 but not exceeding $47,500, the amount of 12    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 13    residence in the taxable year for which application is 14    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.6.15        (4) For an applicant who has a household income 16    exceeding $47,500 but not exceeding $48,750, the amount of 17    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 18    residence in the taxable year for which application is 19    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.4.20        (5) For an applicant who has a household income 21    exceeding $48,750 but not exceeding $50,000, the amount of 22    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 23    residence in the taxable year for which application is 24    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.2. 25    When the applicant is a surviving spouse of an applicant 26for a prior year for the same residence for which an exemption   SB1977- 10 -LRB104 10823 HLH 20904 b1under this Section has been granted, the base year and base 2amount for that residence are the same as for the applicant for 3the prior year.4    Each year at the time the assessment books are certified 5to the County Clerk, the Board of Review or Board of Appeals 6shall give to the County Clerk a list of the assessed values of 7improvements on each parcel qualifying for this exemption that 8were added after the base year for this parcel and that 9increased the assessed value of the property.10    In the case of land improved with an apartment building 11owned and operated as a cooperative or a building that is a 12life care facility that qualifies as a cooperative, the 13maximum reduction from the equalized assessed value of the 14property is limited to the sum of the reductions calculated 15for each unit occupied as a residence by a person or persons 16(i) 65 years of age or older, (ii) with a household income that 17does not exceed the maximum income limitation, (iii) who is 18liable, by contract with the owner or owners of record, for 19paying real property taxes on the property, and (iv) who is an 20owner of record of a legal or equitable interest in the 21cooperative apartment building, other than a leasehold 22interest. In the instance of a cooperative where a homestead 23exemption has been granted under this Section, the cooperative 24association or its management firm shall credit the savings 25resulting from that exemption only to the apportioned tax 26liability of the owner who qualified for the exemption.

Each 3application shall contain or be verified by a written 4declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury. A 5taxpayer's signing a fraudulent application under this Act is 6perjury, as defined in Section 32-2 of the Criminal Code of 72012. The applications shall be clearly marked as applications 8for the Low-Income Senior Citizens Assessment Freeze Homestead 9Exemption and must contain a notice that any taxpayer who 10receives the exemption is subject to an audit by the Chief 11County Assessment Officer.12    Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, in 13counties having fewer than 3,000,000 inhabitants, if an 14applicant fails to file the application required by this 15Section in a timely manner and this failure to file is due to a 16mental or physical condition sufficiently severe so as to 17render the applicant incapable of filing the application in a 18timely manner, the Chief County Assessment Officer may extend 19the filing deadline for a period of 30 days after the applicant 20regains the capability to file the application, but in no case 21may the filing deadline be extended beyond 3 months of the 22original filing deadline.

In addition, in taxable year 1997, the applicant's 5exemption shall also include an amount equal to (i) the amount 6of any exemption denied to the applicant in taxable year 1995 7as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, as the base year, 8(ii) the amount of any exemption denied to the applicant in 9taxable year 1996 as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, 10as the base year, and (iii) the amount of the exemption 11erroneously denied for taxable year 1994.12    For purposes of this Section, a person who will be 65 years 13of age during the current taxable year shall be eligible to 14apply for the homestead exemption during that taxable year. 15Application shall be made during the application period in 16effect for the county of his or her residence. 17    The Chief County Assessment Officer may determine the 18eligibility of a life care facility that qualifies as a 19cooperative to receive the benefits provided by this Section 20by use of an affidavit, application, visual inspection, 21questionnaire, or other reasonable method in order to insure 22that the tax savings resulting from the exemption are credited 23by the management firm to the apportioned tax liability of 24each qualifying resident.
