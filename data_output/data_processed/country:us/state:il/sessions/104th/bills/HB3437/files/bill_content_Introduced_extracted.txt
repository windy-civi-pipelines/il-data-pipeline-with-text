The attorney shall provide independent 20    legal counsel for the child and shall owe the same duties 21    of undivided loyalty, confidentiality, and competent 22    representation as are due an adult client.  HB3437- 2 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1        (2) Guardian ad litem. The guardian ad litem shall 2    investigate the facts of the case and interview the child 3    and the parties. Unless the court directs otherwise, the 4    guardian ad litem shall submit to the court and the 5    parties a written report, written recommendations, or a 6    proposed parenting plan, in accordance with the child's 7    best interests, not less than 30 days before a final 8    hearing or trial. The guardian ad litem's written report 9    or written recommendations shall be admitted into evidence 10    without the need for foundation. The guardian ad litem 11    shall be available for deposition before a final hearing 12    or trial notwithstanding any other discovery cutoff. The 13    guardian ad litem may be called as a witness for purposes 14    of cross-examination regarding the guardian ad litem's 15    report or recommendations.

The child 9    representative shall meet with the child and the parties, 10    investigate the facts of the case, and encourage 11    settlement and the use of alternative forms of dispute 12    resolution. The child representative shall have the same 13    authority and obligation to participate in the litigation 14    as does an attorney for a party and shall possess all the 15    powers of investigation as does a guardian ad litem. The 16    child representative shall consider, but not be bound by, 17    the expressed wishes of the child. A child representative 18    shall have received training in child advocacy or shall 19    possess such experience as determined to be equivalent to 20    such training by the chief judge of the circuit where the 21    child representative has been appointed. The child 22    representative shall not disclose confidential 23    communications made by the child, except as required by 24    law or by the Rules of Professional Conduct.

During the proceedings the 11court may appoint an additional attorney to serve in the 12capacity described in subdivision (a)(1) or an additional 13attorney to serve in another of the capacities described in 14subdivision (a)(2) or (a)(3) on the court's own motion or that 15of a party only for good cause shown and when the reasons for 16the additional appointment are set forth in specific findings.17    (a-5) Appointment considerations. In deciding whether to 18make an appointment of an attorney for the minor child, a 19guardian ad litem, or a child representative, the court shall 20consider the nature and adequacy of the evidence to be 21presented by the parties and the availability of other methods 22of obtaining information, including social service 23organizations and evaluations by mental health professions, as 24well as resources for payment. 25    In no event is this Section intended to or designed to 26abrogate the decision making power of the trier of fact. Any   HB3437- 5 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1appointment made under this Section is not intended to nor 2should it serve to place any appointed individual in the role 3of a surrogate judge. 4    (b) Fees and costs. The court shall enter an order as 5appropriate for costs, fees, and disbursements, including a 6retainer, when the attorney, guardian ad litem, or child's 7representative is appointed.

The court may not order 17payment by the Department of Healthcare and Family Services in 18cases in which the Department is providing child support 19enforcement services under Article X of the Illinois Public 20Aid Code. Unless otherwise ordered by the court at the time 21fees and costs are approved, all fees and costs payable to an 22attorney, guardian ad litem, or child representative under 23this Section are by implication deemed to be in the nature of 24support of the child and are within the exceptions to 25discharge in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C.A. 523. The provisions 26of Sections 501 and 508 of this Act shall apply to fees and   HB3437- 6 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1costs for attorneys appointed under this Section.2(Source: P.A. 103-126, eff. 1-1-24.) 3    (750 ILCS 5/602.5)4    Sec. 602.5. Allocation of parental responsibilities: 5decision-making.6    (a) Generally. The court shall allocate decision-making 7responsibilities according to the child's best interests. 8Nothing in this Act requires that each parent be allocated 9decision-making responsibilities. If the court finds that 10there has been abuse by one parent against the child or a 11repeated pattern of coercive abuse by one parent against the 12other parent, the parent who has engaged in the abuse may not 13be allocated any decision-making unless the court makes a 14finding that the parent has provided adequate evidence that 15the parent will not use the allocation of decision making as a 16basis to further abuse the child or the other parent and will 17use the decision-making solely in the best interests of the 18child. 19    (b) Allocation of significant decision-making 20responsibilities. Unless the parents otherwise agree in 21writing on an allocation of significant decision-making 22responsibilities, or the issue of the allocation of parental 23responsibilities has been reserved under Section 401, the 24court shall make the determination. The court shall allocate 25to one or both of the parents the significant decision-making   HB3437- 7 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1responsibility for each significant issue affecting the child. 2Those significant issues shall include, without limitation, 3the following:4        (1) Education, including the choice of schools and 5    tutors.6        (2) Health, including all decisions relating to the 7    medical, dental, and psychological needs of the child and 8    to the treatments arising or resulting from those needs.9        (3) Religion, subject to the following provisions:10            (A) The court shall allocate decision-making 11        responsibility for the child's religious upbringing in 12        accordance with any express or implied agreement 13        between the parents.14            (B) The court shall consider evidence of the 15        parents' past conduct as to the child's religious 16        upbringing in allocating decision-making 17        responsibilities consistent with demonstrated past 18        conduct in the absence of an express or implied 19        agreement between the parents.20            (C) The court shall not allocate any aspect of the 21        child's religious upbringing if it determines that the 22        parents do not or did not have an express or implied 23        agreement for such religious upbringing or that there 24        is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a course of 25        conduct regarding the child's religious upbringing 26        that could serve as a basis for any such order.  HB3437- 8 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1        (4) Extracurricular activities.2    (c) Determination of child's best interests. In 3determining the child's best interests for purposes of 4allocating significant decision-making responsibilities, the 5court shall consider all relevant factors, including, without 6limitation, the following:7        (1) the wishes of the child, taking into account the 8    child's maturity and ability to express reasoned and 9    independent preferences as to decision-making and if the 10    court finds that a child who expresses fear of a parent is 11    based on the parent's actual and specific conduct that is 12    contrary to the child's best interests, the finding shall 13    be considered;14        (2) the child's adjustment to his or her home, school, 15    and community;16        (3) the mental and physical health of all individuals 17    involved;18        (4) the ability of the parents to cooperate to make 19    decisions, or the level of conflict between the parties 20    that may affect their ability to share decision-making 21    especially when one parent has engaged in abuse of the 22    child or a repeated pattern of coercive abuse of the other 23    parent;24        (5) the level of each parent's participation in past 25    significant decision-making with respect to the child;26        (6) any prior agreement or course of conduct between   HB3437- 9 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    the parents relating to decision-making with respect to 2    the child; 3        (7) the wishes of the parents;4        (8) the child's needs;5        (8.1) which parent is more likely to ensure the health 6    and safety of the child as defined in Section 603.12;7        (9) the distance between the parents' residences, the 8    cost and difficulty of transporting the child, each 9    parent's and the child's daily schedules, and the ability 10    of the parents to cooperate in the arrangement;11        (10) whether a restriction on decision-making is 12    appropriate under Section 603.10 or other protective 13    measures as specified in Section 603.12; 14        (11) the willingness and ability of each parent to 15    facilitate and encourage a close and continuing 16    relationship between the other parent and the child except 17    if one parent has engaged in abuse of the child or the 18    other parent, if reasonable safety measures are necessary 19    to protect the health and safety of the child as defined in 20    Section 603.12 from harm and a parent's reasonable 21    concerns for the health and safety of the child, the 22    parent's reasonable efforts to protect the child may not 23    be considered negatively under this subsection;24        (12) the physical violence or threat of physical 25    violence by the child's parent directed against the child;26        (13) the occurrence of abuse against the child or   HB3437- 10 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    other member of the child's household;2        (14) whether one of the parents is a sex offender, and 3    if so, the exact nature of the offense and what, if any, 4    treatment in which the parent has successfully 5    participated; and 6        (15) any other factor that the court expressly finds 7    to be relevant. 8    (d) A parent shall have sole responsibility for making 9routine decisions with respect to the child and for emergency 10decisions affecting the child's health and safety during that 11parent's parenting time.12    (e) In allocating significant decision-making 13responsibilities, the court shall not consider conduct of a 14parent that does not affect that parent's relationship to the 15child.16(Source: P.A. 99-90, eff. 1-1-16.) 17    (750 ILCS 5/602.7)18    Sec. 602.7. Allocation of parental responsibilities: 19parenting time.20    (a) Best interests. The court shall allocate parenting 21time according to the child's best interests. 22    (b) Allocation of parenting time. Unless the parents 23present a mutually agreed written parenting plan and that plan 24is approved by the court, the court shall allocate parenting 25time. It is presumed both parents are fit and the court shall   HB3437- 11 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1not place any restrictions on parenting time as defined in 2Section 600 and described in Section 603.10, unless it finds 3by a preponderance of the evidence that a parent's exercise of 4parenting time would seriously endanger the child's physical, 5mental, moral, or emotional health.6    In determining the child's best interests for purposes of 7allocating parenting time, the court shall consider all 8relevant factors, including, without limitation, the 9following:10        (1) the wishes of each parent seeking parenting time;11        (2) the wishes of the child, taking into account the 12    child's maturity and ability to express reasoned and 13    independent preferences as to parenting time. If the court 14    finds that a child who expresses fear of a parent is based 15    on the parent's actual and specific conduct that is 16    contrary to the child's best interests, the finding shall 17    be considered;18        (3) the amount of time each parent spent performing 19    caretaking functions with respect to the child in the 24 20    months preceding the filing of any petition for allocation 21    of parental responsibilities or, if the child is under 2 22    years of age, since the child's birth;23        (4) any prior agreement or course of conduct between 24    the parents relating to caretaking functions with respect 25    to the child;26        (5) the interaction and interrelationship of the child   HB3437- 12 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    with his or her parents and siblings and with any other 2    person who may significantly affect the child's best 3    interests;4        (6) the child's adjustment to his or her home, school, 5    and community;6        (7) the mental and physical health of all individuals 7    involved;8        (8) the child's needs;9        (8.1) which parent is more likely to ensure the health 10    and safety of the child, as defined in Section 603.12; 11        (9) the distance between the parents' residences, the 12    cost and difficulty of transporting the child, each 13    parent's and the child's daily schedules, and the ability 14    of the parents to cooperate in the arrangement;15        (10) whether a restriction on parenting time is 16    appropriate;17        (11) the physical violence or threat of physical 18    violence by the child's parent directed against the child 19    or other member of the child's household;20        (12) the willingness and ability of each parent to 21    place the needs of the child ahead of his or her own needs;22        (13) the willingness and ability of each parent to 23    facilitate and encourage a close and continuing 24    relationship between the other parent and the child except 25    if one parent has engaged in abuse of the child or the 26    other parent, if reasonable safety measures are necessary   HB3437- 13 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    to protect the health and safety of the child as defined in 2    Section 603.12 from harm and a parent's reasonable 3    concerns for the health and safety of the child, the 4    parent's reasonable efforts to protect the child may not 5    be considered negatively under this subsection;6        (14) the occurrence of abuse against the child or 7    other member of the child's household;8        (15) whether one of the parents is a convicted sex 9    offender or lives with a convicted sex offender and, if 10    so, the exact nature of the offense and what if any 11    treatment the offender has successfully participated in; 12    the parties are entitled to a hearing on the issues raised 13    in this paragraph (15);14        (16) the terms of a parent's military family-care plan 15    that a parent must complete before deployment if a parent 16    is a member of the United States Armed Forces who is being 17    deployed; and 18        (17) any other factor that the court expressly finds 19    to be relevant.20    (b-1) A factor under subsection (b) may not be adversely 21weighed against a party if the circumstances related to the 22factor were in response to abuse or necessary to protect the 23child or the abused party from harm and the party alleging 24abuse does not pose a risk to the health and safety of the 25child, as defined in Section 603.12. A temporary housing 26instability as a result of abuse may not be considered against   HB3437- 14 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1the party alleging the abuse.2    As used in this subsection, "temporary housing 3instability" means a period not to exceed 6 months from the 4date of the last incident of abuse as determined by the court.5    (c) In allocating parenting time, the court shall not 6consider conduct of a parent that does not affect that 7parent's relationship to the child. 8    (d) Upon motion, the court may allow a parent who is 9deployed or who has orders to be deployed as a member of the 10United States Armed Forces to designate a person known to the 11child to exercise reasonable substitute visitation on behalf 12of the deployed parent, if the court determines that 13substitute visitation is in the best interests of the child. 14In determining whether substitute visitation is in the best 15interests of the child, the court shall consider all of the 16relevant factors listed in subsection (b) of this Section and 17apply those factors to the person designated as a substitute 18for the deployed parent for visitation purposes. Visitation 19orders entered under this subsection are subject to 20subsections (e) and (f) of Section 602.9 and subsections (c) 21and (d) of Section 603.10.22    (e) If the street address of a parent is not identified 23pursuant to Section 708 of this Act, the court shall require 24the parties to identify reasonable alternative arrangements 25for parenting time by the other parent including, but not 26limited to, parenting time of the minor child at the residence   HB3437- 15 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1of another person or at a local public or private facility.2(Source: P.A. 99-90, eff. 1-1-16.) 3    (750 ILCS 5/603.10)4    Sec. 603.10. Restriction of parental responsibilities.5    (a) After a hearing, if the court finds by a preponderance 6of the evidence that a parent engaged in any conduct that 7seriously endangered the child's mental, moral, or physical 8health or that significantly impaired the child's emotional 9development, the court shall enter orders as necessary to 10protect the child. If a parent does any of the following that 11seriously endangers a child's health or significantly impairs 12the child's emotional development: 13        (1) inflicts physical injury upon the parent's child 14    or another child, by other than accidental means, which 15    causes death, disfigurement, impairment of physical or 16    emotional health, or loss of impairment of any bodily 17    function;18        (2) creates a substantial risk of physical injury 19    against the parent's child or another child, by other than 20    accidental means, which would be likely to cause death, 21    disfigurement, impairment of physical or emotional health, 22    or loss of impairment of any bodily function;23        (3) inflicts excessive corporal punishment upon the 24    parent's child or another child;25        (4) commits any sex offense against the parent's child   HB3437- 16 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    or another child; or2        (5) commits an act of torture against the parent's 3    child or another child.4    If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that 5any of this conduct has likely occurred, the court shall order 6one or more of the restrictions on parenting time set forth in 7Section 603.10, including temporarily denying parenting time, 8restricting parenting time to supervised parenting time, and 9any other protective measures that are necessary to protect 10the child's physical, mental, moral, or emotional well-being.11    Such orders may include, but are not limited to, orders 12for one or more of the following:13        (1) a reduction, elimination, or other adjustment of 14    the parent's decision-making responsibilities or parenting 15    time, or both decision-making responsibilities and 16    parenting time;17        (2) supervision, including ordering the Department of 18    Children and Family Services to exercise continuing 19    supervision under Section 5 of the Children and Family 20    Services Act;21        (2.1) supervision under Section 603.12; 22        (3) requiring the exchange of the child between the 23    parents through an intermediary or in a protected setting;24        (4) restraining a parent's communication with or 25    proximity to the other parent or the child;26        (5) requiring a parent to abstain from possessing or   HB3437- 17 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    consuming alcohol or non-prescribed drugs while exercising 2    parenting time with the child and within a specified 3    period immediately preceding the exercise of parenting 4    time;5        (6) restricting the presence of specific persons while 6    a parent is exercising parenting time with the child;7        (7) requiring a parent to post a bond to secure the 8    return of the child following the parent's exercise of 9    parenting time or to secure other performance required by 10    the court;11        (8) requiring a parent to complete a treatment program 12    for perpetrators of abuse, for drug or alcohol abuse, or 13    for other behavior that is the basis for restricting 14    parental responsibilities under this Section; and15        (9) any other constraints or conditions that the court 16    deems necessary to provide for the child's safety or 17    welfare.18    (b) The court may modify an order restricting parental 19responsibilities if, after a hearing, the court finds by a 20preponderance of the evidence that a modification is in the 21child's best interests based on (i) a change of circumstances 22that occurred after the entry of an order restricting parental 23responsibilities; or (ii) conduct of which the court was 24previously unaware that seriously endangers the child. In 25determining whether to modify an order under this subsection, 26the court must consider factors that include, but need not be   HB3437- 18 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1limited to, the following:2        (1) abuse, neglect, or abandonment of the child;3        (2) abusing or allowing abuse of another person that 4    had an impact upon the child;5        (3) use of drugs, alcohol, or any other substance in a 6    way that interferes with the parent's ability to perform 7    caretaking functions with respect to the child; and8        (4) persistent continuing interference with the other 9    parent's access to the child, except for actions taken 10    with a reasonable, good-faith belief that they are 11    necessary to protect the child's safety pending 12    adjudication of the facts underlying that belief, provided 13    that the interfering parent initiates a proceeding to 14    determine those facts as soon as practicable.15    (c) An order granting parenting time to a parent or 16visitation to another person may be revoked by the court if 17that parent or other person is found to have knowingly used his 18or her parenting time or visitation to facilitate contact 19between the child and a parent who has been barred from contact 20with the child or to have knowingly used his or her parenting 21time or visitation to facilitate contact with the child that 22violates any restrictions imposed on a parent's parenting time 23by a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this 24subsection limits a court's authority to enforce its orders in 25any other manner authorized by law.26    (d) If parenting time of a parent is restricted, an order   HB3437- 19 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1granting visitation to a non-parent with a child or an order 2granting parenting time to the other parent shall contain the 3following language:4        "If a person granted parenting time or visitation 5    under this order uses that time to facilitate contact 6    between the child and a parent whose parenting time is 7    restricted, or if such a person violates any restrictions 8    placed on parenting time or visitation by the court, the 9    parenting time or visitation granted under this order 10    shall be revoked until further order of court."11    (e) A parent who, after a hearing, is determined by the 12court to have been convicted of any offense involving an 13illegal sex act perpetrated upon a victim less than 18 years of 14age, including but not limited to an offense under Article 11 15of the Criminal Code of 2012, is not entitled to parenting time 16while incarcerated or while on parole, probation, conditional 17discharge, periodic imprisonment, or mandatory supervised 18release for a felony offense, until the parent complies with 19such terms and conditions as the court determines are in the 20child's best interests, taking into account the exact nature 21of the offense and what, if any, treatment in which the parent 22successfully participated.23    (f) A parent may not, while the child is present, visit any 24person granted visitation or parenting time who has been 25convicted of first degree murder, unless the court finds, 26after considering all relevant factors, including those set   HB3437- 20 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1forth in subsection (b) of Section 602.7, that it would be in 2the child's best interests to allow the child to be present 3during such a visit.4(Source: P.A. 99-90, eff. 1-1-16.) 5    (750 ILCS 5/603.12 new)6    Sec. 603.12. Safety conditions.7    (a) The General Assembly adopts the findings of the United 8States Congress in enacting Kayden's Law in Public Law 117-103 9as follows:10        (1) Approximately 1 in 15 children is exposed to 11    domestic violence each year.12        (2) Most child abuse is perpetrated in the family and 13    by a parent. Intimate partner violence and child abuse 14    overlap in the same families at rates between 30% and 60%. 15    A child's risk of abuse increases after a perpetrator of 16    intimate partner violence separates from a domestic 17    partner, even when the perpetrator has not previously 18    directly abused the child. Children who have witnessed 19    intimate partner violence are approximately 4 times more 20    likely to experience direct child maltreatment than 21    children who have not witnessed intimate partner violence.22        (3) More than 75% of child sexual abuse is perpetrated 23    by a family member or a person known to the child. Data of 24    the Department of Justice shows that family members are 25    49%, or almost half, of the perpetrators of crimes against   HB3437- 21 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    child sex assault victims younger than 6 years of age.2        (4) Research suggests a child's exposure to a batterer 3    is among the strongest indicators of risk of incest 4    victimization. One study found that female children with 5    fathers who are batterers of their mothers were 6.5 times 6    more likely to experience father-daughter incest than 7    female children who do not have abusive fathers.8        (5) Child abuse is a major public health issue in the 9    United States. Total lifetime financial costs associated 10    with just one year of confirmed cases of child 11    maltreatment, including child physical abuse, sexual 12    abuse, psychological abuse, and neglect, result in 13    $124,000,000,000 in annual costs to the economy of the 14    United States, or approximately 1% of the gross domestic 15    product of the United States.16        (6) Empirical research indicates that courts regularly 17    discount allegations of child physical and sexual abuse 18    when those allegations are raised in child custody cases. 19    Courts believed less than 1/4 of claims that a father has 20    committed child physical or sexual abuse. With respect to 21    cases in which an allegedly abusive parent claimed the 22    mother "alienated" the child, courts believed only 1 out 23    of 51 claims of sexual molestation by a father. 24    Independent research indicates that child sexual abuse 25    allegations are credible between 50% and 70% of the time.26        (7) Empirical research shows that alleged or known   HB3437- 22 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    abusive parents are often granted custody or unprotected 2    parenting time by courts. Approximately 1/3 of parents 3    alleged to have committed child abuse took primary custody 4    from the protective parent reporting the abuse, placing 5    children at ongoing risk.6        (8) Researchers have documented nearly 800 child 7    murders in the United States since 2008 committed by a 8    divorcing or separating parent. More than 100 of these 9    child murders are known to have occurred after a court 10    ordered the child to have contact with the dangerous 11    parent over the objection of a safe parent or caregiver.12        (9) Scientifically unsound theories that treat abuse 13    allegations of mothers as likely false attempts to 14    undermine fathers are frequently applied in family court 15    to minimize or deny reports of abuse of parents and 16    children. Many experts who testify against abuse 17    allegations lack expertise in the relevant type of alleged 18    abuse, relying instead on unsound and unproven theories.19        (10) Judges presiding over custody cases involving 20    allegations of child abuse, child sexual abuse, and 21    domestic violence are rarely required to receive training 22    on these subjects, and most states have not established 23    standards for such training. 24    (b) After considering the factors under subsection (b) of 25Section 602.7, if the court finds that there is a history of 26abuse of the child or a household member by a party or a   HB3437- 23 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1present risk of harm to the child or an abused party and awards 2any form of parenting time to a party who committed the abuse 3or who has a household member who committed the abuse, the 4court shall include in the parenting plan safety conditions, 5restrictions, or safeguards as reasonably necessary to protect 6the child or the abused party.7    The court shall include in the parenting plan the reason 8for imposing the safety conditions, restrictions, or 9safeguards and an explanation as to why the safety conditions, 10restrictions, or safeguards are in the best interests of the 11child or the abused party. If supervised contact is ordered, 12there shall be a review of the risk of harm and need for 13continued supervision on at least an annual basis. The safety 14conditions, restrictions, or safeguards may include:15        (1) nonprofessional supervised parenting time;16        (2) professional supervised parenting time;17        (3) limitations on the time of day that parenting time 18    is permitted or the number of hours of parenting time and 19    the maximum number of hours of parenting time permitted 20    per day or per week;21        (4) the appointment of a qualified professional 22    specializing in programming relating to the history of 23    abuse or risk of harm to provider intervention or harm 24    prevention programming. The court may order an evaluation 25    by the appointed qualified professional to determine 26    whether additional programming is necessary;  HB3437- 24 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1        (5) limitations on parenting time; or2        (6) any other safety conditions, restrictions, or 3    safeguards to ensure the health and safety of the child or 4    to protect a household member.5    (c) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence 6that a party has abused the child or household member, there 7shall be a rebuttable presumption that the court shall only 8allow nonprofessional supervised parenting time or 9professional supervised parenting time between the child and 10the party who committed the abuse. A court may find that an 11indicated report for physical or sexual abuse is a basis for a 12finding of abuse under this subsection only after a de novo 13review of the circumstances leading to the indicated report. 14Notwithstanding this subsection, the court may award an 15alternative form of parenting time if the court finds by a 16preponderance of the evidence that:17        (1) the party no longer poses a risk of abuse to the 18    child or any other household member; and19        (2) another parenting time arrangement is in the best 20    interests of the child and will not jeopardize the health 21    and safety of the child.22    (d) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence 23that there is an ongoing risk of abuse of the child, there 24shall be a rebuttable presumption that the court shall only 25allow professional supervised parenting time between the child 26and the party who poses the risk of abuse. A court may find   HB3437- 25 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1that an indicated report for physical or sexual abuse is a 2basis for a finding of abuse under this subsection only after a 3de novo review of the circumstances leading to the indicated 4report. Notwithstanding this subsection, the court may award 5an alternative form of parenting time if the court finds by a 6preponderance of the evidence that:7        (1) the party no longer poses a risk of abuse to the 8    child or any other household member; and9        (2) another parenting time arrangement is in the best 10    interests of the child and will not jeopardize the health 11    and safety of the child.12    (e) As used in this Section:13    "Health and safety of the child" includes, but is not 14limited to, the physical, emotional, and psychological 15well-being of the child.16    "Household member" means a spouse or individual who has 17been a spouse, individual living as a spouse or lived as a 18spouse, parent or child, individual related by consanguinity 19or affinity, current or former sexual or intimate partner, or 20individual who shares biological parenthood currently sharing 21a household with the child or a party.22    "Intervention and harm prevention programming" includes, 23but is not limited to, programming designed to rehabilitate 24the offending individual, including prioritizing an 25intervention or harm prevent program, if available, or the 26impacts of physical, sexual, or domestic abuse on the victim.  HB3437- 26 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    "Nonprofessional supervised parenting time" means 2parenting time during which an adult, designated by the court 3or agreed upon by the parties, monitors the interaction 4between the child and the individual with parenting time 5rights.6    "Professional supervised parenting time" means parenting 7time during which a professional with education and training 8on the dynamics of domestic violence, sexual assault, child 9abuse, and the impact of domestic violence on children 10oversees the interaction between the child and the individual 11with parenting time rights and promotes the health and safety 12of the child during the interaction. 13    (750 ILCS 5/604.10)14    Sec. 604.10. Interviews; evaluations; investigation.15    (a) Court's interview of child. The court may interview 16the child in chambers to ascertain the child's wishes as to the 17allocation of parental responsibilities. Counsel shall be 18present at the interview unless otherwise agreed upon by the 19parties. The entire interview shall be recorded by a court 20reporter. The transcript of the interview shall be filed under 21seal and released only upon order of the court.22    (b) Court's professional. The court may seek the advice of 23any professional, whether or not regularly employed by the 24court, to assist the court in determining the child's best 25interests. The advice to the court shall be in writing and sent   HB3437- 27 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1by the professional to counsel for the parties and to the court 2not later than 60 days before the date on which the trial court 3reasonably anticipates the hearing on the allocation of 4parental responsibilities will commence. The court may review 5the writing upon receipt. The writing may be admitted into 6evidence without testimony from its author, unless a party 7objects. A professional consulted by the court shall testify 8as the court's witness and be subject to cross-examination. 9The court shall order all costs and fees of the professional to 10be paid by one or more of the parties, subject to reallocation 11in accordance with subsection (a) of Section 508.12    The professional's report must, at a minimum, set forth 13the following:14        (1) a description of the procedures employed during 15    the evaluation;16        (2) a report of the data collected;17        (3) all test results;18        (4) any conclusions of the professional relating to 19    the allocation of parental responsibilities under Sections 20    602.5 and 602.7;21        (5) any recommendations of the professional concerning 22    the allocation of parental responsibilities or the child's 23    relocation; and24        (6) an explanation of any limitations in the 25    evaluation or any reservations of the professional 26    regarding the resulting recommendations.  HB3437- 28 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    (c) Evaluation by a party's retained professional. In a 2proceeding to allocate parental responsibilities or to 3relocate a child, upon notice and motion made by a parent or 4any party to the litigation within a reasonable time before 5trial, the court shall order an evaluation to assist the court 6in determining the child's best interests unless the court 7finds that an evaluation under this Section is untimely or not 8in the best interests of the child. The evaluation may be in 9place of or in addition to any advice given to the court by a 10professional under subsection (b). A motion for an evaluation 11under this subsection must, at a minimum, identify the 12proposed evaluator and the evaluator's specialty or 13discipline.

The attorney shall provide independent 20    legal counsel for the child and shall owe the same duties 21    of undivided loyalty, confidentiality, and competent 22    representation as are due an adult client.  HB3437- 2 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1        (2) Guardian ad litem. The guardian ad litem shall 2    investigate the facts of the case and interview the child 3    and the parties. Unless the court directs otherwise, the 4    guardian ad litem shall submit to the court and the 5    parties a written report, written recommendations, or a 6    proposed parenting plan, in accordance with the child's 7    best interests, not less than 30 days before a final 8    hearing or trial.

The child representative 6    shall advocate what the child representative finds to be 7    in the best interests of the child after reviewing the 8    facts and circumstances of the case. The child 9    representative shall meet with the child and the parties, 10    investigate the facts of the case, and encourage 11    settlement and the use of alternative forms of dispute 12    resolution. The child representative shall have the same 13    authority and obligation to participate in the litigation 14    as does an attorney for a party and shall possess all the 15    powers of investigation as does a guardian ad litem. The 16    child representative shall consider, but not be bound by, 17    the expressed wishes of the child. A child representative 18    shall have received training in child advocacy or shall 19    possess such experience as determined to be equivalent to 20    such training by the chief judge of the circuit where the 21    child representative has been appointed. The child 22    representative shall not disclose confidential 23    communications made by the child, except as required by 24    law or by the Rules of Professional Conduct. The child 25    representative shall not render an opinion, 26    recommendation, or report to the court and shall not be   HB3437- 4 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    called as a witness, but shall offer evidence-based legal 2    arguments.

During the proceedings the 11court may appoint an additional attorney to serve in the 12capacity described in subdivision (a)(1) or an additional 13attorney to serve in another of the capacities described in 14subdivision (a)(2) or (a)(3) on the court's own motion or that 15of a party only for good cause shown and when the reasons for 16the additional appointment are set forth in specific findings.17    (a-5) Appointment considerations. In deciding whether to 18make an appointment of an attorney for the minor child, a 19guardian ad litem, or a child representative, the court shall 20consider the nature and adequacy of the evidence to be 21presented by the parties and the availability of other methods 22of obtaining information, including social service 23organizations and evaluations by mental health professions, as 24well as resources for payment. 25    In no event is this Section intended to or designed to 26abrogate the decision making power of the trier of fact. Any   HB3437- 5 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1appointment made under this Section is not intended to nor 2should it serve to place any appointed individual in the role 3of a surrogate judge. 4    (b) Fees and costs. The court shall enter an order as 5appropriate for costs, fees, and disbursements, including a 6retainer, when the attorney, guardian ad litem, or child's 7representative is appointed. Any person appointed under this 8Section shall file with the court within 90 days of his or her 9appointment, and every subsequent 90-day period thereafter 10during the course of his or her representation, a detailed 11invoice for services rendered with a copy being sent to each 12party.

Any 14order approving the fees shall require payment by either or 15both parents, by any other party or source, or from the marital 16estate or the child's separate estate. The court may not order 17payment by the Department of Healthcare and Family Services in 18cases in which the Department is providing child support 19enforcement services under Article X of the Illinois Public 20Aid Code. Unless otherwise ordered by the court at the time 21fees and costs are approved, all fees and costs payable to an 22attorney, guardian ad litem, or child representative under 23this Section are by implication deemed to be in the nature of 24support of the child and are within the exceptions to 25discharge in bankruptcy under 11 U.S.C.A. 523. The provisions 26of Sections 501 and 508 of this Act shall apply to fees and   HB3437- 6 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1costs for attorneys appointed under this Section.2(Source: P.A. 103-126, eff. 1-1-24.) 3    (750 ILCS 5/602.5)4    Sec. 602.5. Allocation of parental responsibilities: 5decision-making.6    (a) Generally. The court shall allocate decision-making 7responsibilities according to the child's best interests. 8Nothing in this Act requires that each parent be allocated 9decision-making responsibilities. If the court finds that 10there has been abuse by one parent against the child or a 11repeated pattern of coercive abuse by one parent against the 12other parent, the parent who has engaged in the abuse may not 13be allocated any decision-making unless the court makes a 14finding that the parent has provided adequate evidence that 15the parent will not use the allocation of decision making as a 16basis to further abuse the child or the other parent and will 17use the decision-making solely in the best interests of the 18child. 19    (b) Allocation of significant decision-making 20responsibilities. Unless the parents otherwise agree in 21writing on an allocation of significant decision-making 22responsibilities, or the issue of the allocation of parental 23responsibilities has been reserved under Section 401, the 24court shall make the determination. The court shall allocate 25to one or both of the parents the significant decision-making   HB3437- 7 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1responsibility for each significant issue affecting the child. 2Those significant issues shall include, without limitation, 3the following:4        (1) Education, including the choice of schools and 5    tutors.6        (2) Health, including all decisions relating to the 7    medical, dental, and psychological needs of the child and 8    to the treatments arising or resulting from those needs.9        (3) Religion, subject to the following provisions:10            (A) The court shall allocate decision-making 11        responsibility for the child's religious upbringing in 12        accordance with any express or implied agreement 13        between the parents.14            (B) The court shall consider evidence of the 15        parents' past conduct as to the child's religious 16        upbringing in allocating decision-making 17        responsibilities consistent with demonstrated past 18        conduct in the absence of an express or implied 19        agreement between the parents.20            (C) The court shall not allocate any aspect of the 21        child's religious upbringing if it determines that the 22        parents do not or did not have an express or implied 23        agreement for such religious upbringing or that there 24        is insufficient evidence to demonstrate a course of 25        conduct regarding the child's religious upbringing 26        that could serve as a basis for any such order.  HB3437- 8 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1        (4) Extracurricular activities.2    (c) Determination of child's best interests. In 3determining the child's best interests for purposes of 4allocating significant decision-making responsibilities, the 5court shall consider all relevant factors, including, without 6limitation, the following:7        (1) the wishes of the child, taking into account the 8    child's maturity and ability to express reasoned and 9    independent preferences as to decision-making and if the 10    court finds that a child who expresses fear of a parent is 11    based on the parent's actual and specific conduct that is 12    contrary to the child's best interests, the finding shall 13    be considered;14        (2) the child's adjustment to his or her home, school, 15    and community;16        (3) the mental and physical health of all individuals 17    involved;18        (4) the ability of the parents to cooperate to make 19    decisions, or the level of conflict between the parties 20    that may affect their ability to share decision-making 21    especially when one parent has engaged in abuse of the 22    child or a repeated pattern of coercive abuse of the other 23    parent;24        (5) the level of each parent's participation in past 25    significant decision-making with respect to the child;26        (6) any prior agreement or course of conduct between   HB3437- 9 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    the parents relating to decision-making with respect to 2    the child; 3        (7) the wishes of the parents;4        (8) the child's needs;5        (8.1) which parent is more likely to ensure the health 6    and safety of the child as defined in Section 603.12;7        (9) the distance between the parents' residences, the 8    cost and difficulty of transporting the child, each 9    parent's and the child's daily schedules, and the ability 10    of the parents to cooperate in the arrangement;11        (10) whether a restriction on decision-making is 12    appropriate under Section 603.10 or other protective 13    measures as specified in Section 603.12; 14        (11) the willingness and ability of each parent to 15    facilitate and encourage a close and continuing 16    relationship between the other parent and the child except 17    if one parent has engaged in abuse of the child or the 18    other parent, if reasonable safety measures are necessary 19    to protect the health and safety of the child as defined in 20    Section 603.12 from harm and a parent's reasonable 21    concerns for the health and safety of the child, the 22    parent's reasonable efforts to protect the child may not 23    be considered negatively under this subsection;24        (12) the physical violence or threat of physical 25    violence by the child's parent directed against the child;26        (13) the occurrence of abuse against the child or   HB3437- 10 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    other member of the child's household;2        (14) whether one of the parents is a sex offender, and 3    if so, the exact nature of the offense and what, if any, 4    treatment in which the parent has successfully 5    participated; and 6        (15) any other factor that the court expressly finds 7    to be relevant. 8    (d) A parent shall have sole responsibility for making 9routine decisions with respect to the child and for emergency 10decisions affecting the child's health and safety during that 11parent's parenting time.12    (e) In allocating significant decision-making 13responsibilities, the court shall not consider conduct of a 14parent that does not affect that parent's relationship to the 15child.16(Source: P.A. 99-90, eff. 1-1-16.) 17    (750 ILCS 5/602.7)18    Sec. 602.7. Allocation of parental responsibilities: 19parenting time.20    (a) Best interests. The court shall allocate parenting 21time according to the child's best interests. 22    (b) Allocation of parenting time. Unless the parents 23present a mutually agreed written parenting plan and that plan 24is approved by the court, the court shall allocate parenting 25time. It is presumed both parents are fit and the court shall   HB3437- 11 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1not place any restrictions on parenting time as defined in 2Section 600 and described in Section 603.10, unless it finds 3by a preponderance of the evidence that a parent's exercise of 4parenting time would seriously endanger the child's physical, 5mental, moral, or emotional health.6    In determining the child's best interests for purposes of 7allocating parenting time, the court shall consider all 8relevant factors, including, without limitation, the 9following:10        (1) the wishes of each parent seeking parenting time;11        (2) the wishes of the child, taking into account the 12    child's maturity and ability to express reasoned and 13    independent preferences as to parenting time. If the court 14    finds that a child who expresses fear of a parent is based 15    on the parent's actual and specific conduct that is 16    contrary to the child's best interests, the finding shall 17    be considered;18        (3) the amount of time each parent spent performing 19    caretaking functions with respect to the child in the 24 20    months preceding the filing of any petition for allocation 21    of parental responsibilities or, if the child is under 2 22    years of age, since the child's birth;23        (4) any prior agreement or course of conduct between 24    the parents relating to caretaking functions with respect 25    to the child;26        (5) the interaction and interrelationship of the child   HB3437- 12 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    with his or her parents and siblings and with any other 2    person who may significantly affect the child's best 3    interests;4        (6) the child's adjustment to his or her home, school, 5    and community;6        (7) the mental and physical health of all individuals 7    involved;8        (8) the child's needs;9        (8.1) which parent is more likely to ensure the health 10    and safety of the child, as defined in Section 603.12; 11        (9) the distance between the parents' residences, the 12    cost and difficulty of transporting the child, each 13    parent's and the child's daily schedules, and the ability 14    of the parents to cooperate in the arrangement;15        (10) whether a restriction on parenting time is 16    appropriate;17        (11) the physical violence or threat of physical 18    violence by the child's parent directed against the child 19    or other member of the child's household;20        (12) the willingness and ability of each parent to 21    place the needs of the child ahead of his or her own needs;22        (13) the willingness and ability of each parent to 23    facilitate and encourage a close and continuing 24    relationship between the other parent and the child except 25    if one parent has engaged in abuse of the child or the 26    other parent, if reasonable safety measures are necessary   HB3437- 13 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    to protect the health and safety of the child as defined in 2    Section 603.12 from harm and a parent's reasonable 3    concerns for the health and safety of the child, the 4    parent's reasonable efforts to protect the child may not 5    be considered negatively under this subsection;6        (14) the occurrence of abuse against the child or 7    other member of the child's household;8        (15) whether one of the parents is a convicted sex 9    offender or lives with a convicted sex offender and, if 10    so, the exact nature of the offense and what if any 11    treatment the offender has successfully participated in; 12    the parties are entitled to a hearing on the issues raised 13    in this paragraph (15);14        (16) the terms of a parent's military family-care plan 15    that a parent must complete before deployment if a parent 16    is a member of the United States Armed Forces who is being 17    deployed; and 18        (17) any other factor that the court expressly finds 19    to be relevant.20    (b-1) A factor under subsection (b) may not be adversely 21weighed against a party if the circumstances related to the 22factor were in response to abuse or necessary to protect the 23child or the abused party from harm and the party alleging 24abuse does not pose a risk to the health and safety of the 25child, as defined in Section 603.12. A temporary housing 26instability as a result of abuse may not be considered against   HB3437- 14 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1the party alleging the abuse.2    As used in this subsection, "temporary housing 3instability" means a period not to exceed 6 months from the 4date of the last incident of abuse as determined by the court.5    (c) In allocating parenting time, the court shall not 6consider conduct of a parent that does not affect that 7parent's relationship to the child. 8    (d) Upon motion, the court may allow a parent who is 9deployed or who has orders to be deployed as a member of the 10United States Armed Forces to designate a person known to the 11child to exercise reasonable substitute visitation on behalf 12of the deployed parent, if the court determines that 13substitute visitation is in the best interests of the child. 14In determining whether substitute visitation is in the best 15interests of the child, the court shall consider all of the 16relevant factors listed in subsection (b) of this Section and 17apply those factors to the person designated as a substitute 18for the deployed parent for visitation purposes. Visitation 19orders entered under this subsection are subject to 20subsections (e) and (f) of Section 602.9 and subsections (c) 21and (d) of Section 603.10.22    (e) If the street address of a parent is not identified 23pursuant to Section 708 of this Act, the court shall require 24the parties to identify reasonable alternative arrangements 25for parenting time by the other parent including, but not 26limited to, parenting time of the minor child at the residence   HB3437- 15 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1of another person or at a local public or private facility.2(Source: P.A. 99-90, eff. 1-1-16.) 3    (750 ILCS 5/603.10)4    Sec. 603.10. Restriction of parental responsibilities.5    (a) After a hearing, if the court finds by a preponderance 6of the evidence that a parent engaged in any conduct that 7seriously endangered the child's mental, moral, or physical 8health or that significantly impaired the child's emotional 9development, the court shall enter orders as necessary to 10protect the child. If a parent does any of the following that 11seriously endangers a child's health or significantly impairs 12the child's emotional development: 13        (1) inflicts physical injury upon the parent's child 14    or another child, by other than accidental means, which 15    causes death, disfigurement, impairment of physical or 16    emotional health, or loss of impairment of any bodily 17    function;18        (2) creates a substantial risk of physical injury 19    against the parent's child or another child, by other than 20    accidental means, which would be likely to cause death, 21    disfigurement, impairment of physical or emotional health, 22    or loss of impairment of any bodily function;23        (3) inflicts excessive corporal punishment upon the 24    parent's child or another child;25        (4) commits any sex offense against the parent's child   HB3437- 16 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    or another child; or2        (5) commits an act of torture against the parent's 3    child or another child.4    If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that 5any of this conduct has likely occurred, the court shall order 6one or more of the restrictions on parenting time set forth in 7Section 603.10, including temporarily denying parenting time, 8restricting parenting time to supervised parenting time, and 9any other protective measures that are necessary to protect 10the child's physical, mental, moral, or emotional well-being.11    Such orders may include, but are not limited to, orders 12for one or more of the following:13        (1) a reduction, elimination, or other adjustment of 14    the parent's decision-making responsibilities or parenting 15    time, or both decision-making responsibilities and 16    parenting time;17        (2) supervision, including ordering the Department of 18    Children and Family Services to exercise continuing 19    supervision under Section 5 of the Children and Family 20    Services Act;21        (2.1) supervision under Section 603.12; 22        (3) requiring the exchange of the child between the 23    parents through an intermediary or in a protected setting;24        (4) restraining a parent's communication with or 25    proximity to the other parent or the child;26        (5) requiring a parent to abstain from possessing or   HB3437- 17 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    consuming alcohol or non-prescribed drugs while exercising 2    parenting time with the child and within a specified 3    period immediately preceding the exercise of parenting 4    time;5        (6) restricting the presence of specific persons while 6    a parent is exercising parenting time with the child;7        (7) requiring a parent to post a bond to secure the 8    return of the child following the parent's exercise of 9    parenting time or to secure other performance required by 10    the court;11        (8) requiring a parent to complete a treatment program 12    for perpetrators of abuse, for drug or alcohol abuse, or 13    for other behavior that is the basis for restricting 14    parental responsibilities under this Section; and15        (9) any other constraints or conditions that the court 16    deems necessary to provide for the child's safety or 17    welfare.18    (b) The court may modify an order restricting parental 19responsibilities if, after a hearing, the court finds by a 20preponderance of the evidence that a modification is in the 21child's best interests based on (i) a change of circumstances 22that occurred after the entry of an order restricting parental 23responsibilities; or (ii) conduct of which the court was 24previously unaware that seriously endangers the child. In 25determining whether to modify an order under this subsection, 26the court must consider factors that include, but need not be   HB3437- 18 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1limited to, the following:2        (1) abuse, neglect, or abandonment of the child;3        (2) abusing or allowing abuse of another person that 4    had an impact upon the child;5        (3) use of drugs, alcohol, or any other substance in a 6    way that interferes with the parent's ability to perform 7    caretaking functions with respect to the child; and8        (4) persistent continuing interference with the other 9    parent's access to the child, except for actions taken 10    with a reasonable, good-faith belief that they are 11    necessary to protect the child's safety pending 12    adjudication of the facts underlying that belief, provided 13    that the interfering parent initiates a proceeding to 14    determine those facts as soon as practicable.15    (c) An order granting parenting time to a parent or 16visitation to another person may be revoked by the court if 17that parent or other person is found to have knowingly used his 18or her parenting time or visitation to facilitate contact 19between the child and a parent who has been barred from contact 20with the child or to have knowingly used his or her parenting 21time or visitation to facilitate contact with the child that 22violates any restrictions imposed on a parent's parenting time 23by a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this 24subsection limits a court's authority to enforce its orders in 25any other manner authorized by law.26    (d) If parenting time of a parent is restricted, an order   HB3437- 19 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1granting visitation to a non-parent with a child or an order 2granting parenting time to the other parent shall contain the 3following language:4        "If a person granted parenting time or visitation 5    under this order uses that time to facilitate contact 6    between the child and a parent whose parenting time is 7    restricted, or if such a person violates any restrictions 8    placed on parenting time or visitation by the court, the 9    parenting time or visitation granted under this order 10    shall be revoked until further order of court."11    (e) A parent who, after a hearing, is determined by the 12court to have been convicted of any offense involving an 13illegal sex act perpetrated upon a victim less than 18 years of 14age, including but not limited to an offense under Article 11 15of the Criminal Code of 2012, is not entitled to parenting time 16while incarcerated or while on parole, probation, conditional 17discharge, periodic imprisonment, or mandatory supervised 18release for a felony offense, until the parent complies with 19such terms and conditions as the court determines are in the 20child's best interests, taking into account the exact nature 21of the offense and what, if any, treatment in which the parent 22successfully participated.23    (f) A parent may not, while the child is present, visit any 24person granted visitation or parenting time who has been 25convicted of first degree murder, unless the court finds, 26after considering all relevant factors, including those set   HB3437- 20 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1forth in subsection (b) of Section 602.7, that it would be in 2the child's best interests to allow the child to be present 3during such a visit.4(Source: P.A. 99-90, eff. 1-1-16.) 5    (750 ILCS 5/603.12 new)6    Sec. 603.12. Safety conditions.7    (a) The General Assembly adopts the findings of the United 8States Congress in enacting Kayden's Law in Public Law 117-103 9as follows:10        (1) Approximately 1 in 15 children is exposed to 11    domestic violence each year.12        (2) Most child abuse is perpetrated in the family and 13    by a parent. Intimate partner violence and child abuse 14    overlap in the same families at rates between 30% and 60%. 15    A child's risk of abuse increases after a perpetrator of 16    intimate partner violence separates from a domestic 17    partner, even when the perpetrator has not previously 18    directly abused the child. Children who have witnessed 19    intimate partner violence are approximately 4 times more 20    likely to experience direct child maltreatment than 21    children who have not witnessed intimate partner violence.22        (3) More than 75% of child sexual abuse is perpetrated 23    by a family member or a person known to the child. Data of 24    the Department of Justice shows that family members are 25    49%, or almost half, of the perpetrators of crimes against   HB3437- 21 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    child sex assault victims younger than 6 years of age.2        (4) Research suggests a child's exposure to a batterer 3    is among the strongest indicators of risk of incest 4    victimization. One study found that female children with 5    fathers who are batterers of their mothers were 6.5 times 6    more likely to experience father-daughter incest than 7    female children who do not have abusive fathers.8        (5) Child abuse is a major public health issue in the 9    United States. Total lifetime financial costs associated 10    with just one year of confirmed cases of child 11    maltreatment, including child physical abuse, sexual 12    abuse, psychological abuse, and neglect, result in 13    $124,000,000,000 in annual costs to the economy of the 14    United States, or approximately 1% of the gross domestic 15    product of the United States.16        (6) Empirical research indicates that courts regularly 17    discount allegations of child physical and sexual abuse 18    when those allegations are raised in child custody cases. 19    Courts believed less than 1/4 of claims that a father has 20    committed child physical or sexual abuse. With respect to 21    cases in which an allegedly abusive parent claimed the 22    mother "alienated" the child, courts believed only 1 out 23    of 51 claims of sexual molestation by a father. 24    Independent research indicates that child sexual abuse 25    allegations are credible between 50% and 70% of the time.26        (7) Empirical research shows that alleged or known   HB3437- 22 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    abusive parents are often granted custody or unprotected 2    parenting time by courts. Approximately 1/3 of parents 3    alleged to have committed child abuse took primary custody 4    from the protective parent reporting the abuse, placing 5    children at ongoing risk.6        (8) Researchers have documented nearly 800 child 7    murders in the United States since 2008 committed by a 8    divorcing or separating parent. More than 100 of these 9    child murders are known to have occurred after a court 10    ordered the child to have contact with the dangerous 11    parent over the objection of a safe parent or caregiver.12        (9) Scientifically unsound theories that treat abuse 13    allegations of mothers as likely false attempts to 14    undermine fathers are frequently applied in family court 15    to minimize or deny reports of abuse of parents and 16    children. Many experts who testify against abuse 17    allegations lack expertise in the relevant type of alleged 18    abuse, relying instead on unsound and unproven theories.19        (10) Judges presiding over custody cases involving 20    allegations of child abuse, child sexual abuse, and 21    domestic violence are rarely required to receive training 22    on these subjects, and most states have not established 23    standards for such training. 24    (b) After considering the factors under subsection (b) of 25Section 602.7, if the court finds that there is a history of 26abuse of the child or a household member by a party or a   HB3437- 23 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1present risk of harm to the child or an abused party and awards 2any form of parenting time to a party who committed the abuse 3or who has a household member who committed the abuse, the 4court shall include in the parenting plan safety conditions, 5restrictions, or safeguards as reasonably necessary to protect 6the child or the abused party.7    The court shall include in the parenting plan the reason 8for imposing the safety conditions, restrictions, or 9safeguards and an explanation as to why the safety conditions, 10restrictions, or safeguards are in the best interests of the 11child or the abused party. If supervised contact is ordered, 12there shall be a review of the risk of harm and need for 13continued supervision on at least an annual basis. The safety 14conditions, restrictions, or safeguards may include:15        (1) nonprofessional supervised parenting time;16        (2) professional supervised parenting time;17        (3) limitations on the time of day that parenting time 18    is permitted or the number of hours of parenting time and 19    the maximum number of hours of parenting time permitted 20    per day or per week;21        (4) the appointment of a qualified professional 22    specializing in programming relating to the history of 23    abuse or risk of harm to provider intervention or harm 24    prevention programming. The court may order an evaluation 25    by the appointed qualified professional to determine 26    whether additional programming is necessary;  HB3437- 24 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1        (5) limitations on parenting time; or2        (6) any other safety conditions, restrictions, or 3    safeguards to ensure the health and safety of the child or 4    to protect a household member.5    (c) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence 6that a party has abused the child or household member, there 7shall be a rebuttable presumption that the court shall only 8allow nonprofessional supervised parenting time or 9professional supervised parenting time between the child and 10the party who committed the abuse. A court may find that an 11indicated report for physical or sexual abuse is a basis for a 12finding of abuse under this subsection only after a de novo 13review of the circumstances leading to the indicated report. 14Notwithstanding this subsection, the court may award an 15alternative form of parenting time if the court finds by a 16preponderance of the evidence that:17        (1) the party no longer poses a risk of abuse to the 18    child or any other household member; and19        (2) another parenting time arrangement is in the best 20    interests of the child and will not jeopardize the health 21    and safety of the child.22    (d) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence 23that there is an ongoing risk of abuse of the child, there 24shall be a rebuttable presumption that the court shall only 25allow professional supervised parenting time between the child 26and the party who poses the risk of abuse. A court may find   HB3437- 25 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1that an indicated report for physical or sexual abuse is a 2basis for a finding of abuse under this subsection only after a 3de novo review of the circumstances leading to the indicated 4report. Notwithstanding this subsection, the court may award 5an alternative form of parenting time if the court finds by a 6preponderance of the evidence that:7        (1) the party no longer poses a risk of abuse to the 8    child or any other household member; and9        (2) another parenting time arrangement is in the best 10    interests of the child and will not jeopardize the health 11    and safety of the child.12    (e) As used in this Section:13    "Health and safety of the child" includes, but is not 14limited to, the physical, emotional, and psychological 15well-being of the child.16    "Household member" means a spouse or individual who has 17been a spouse, individual living as a spouse or lived as a 18spouse, parent or child, individual related by consanguinity 19or affinity, current or former sexual or intimate partner, or 20individual who shares biological parenthood currently sharing 21a household with the child or a party.22    "Intervention and harm prevention programming" includes, 23but is not limited to, programming designed to rehabilitate 24the offending individual, including prioritizing an 25intervention or harm prevent program, if available, or the 26impacts of physical, sexual, or domestic abuse on the victim.  HB3437- 26 -LRB104 08898 JRC 18953 b1    "Nonprofessional supervised parenting time" means 2parenting time during which an adult, designated by the court 3or agreed upon by the parties, monitors the interaction 4between the child and the individual with parenting time 5rights.6    "Professional supervised parenting time" means parenting 7time during which a professional with education and training 8on the dynamics of domestic violence, sexual assault, child 9abuse, and the impact of domestic violence on children 10oversees the interaction between the child and the individual 11with parenting time rights and promotes the health and safety 12of the child during the interaction. 13    (750 ILCS 5/604.10)14    Sec. 604.10. Interviews; evaluations; investigation.15    (a) Court's interview of child. The court may interview 16the child in chambers to ascertain the child's wishes as to the 17allocation of parental responsibilities. Counsel shall be 18present at the interview unless otherwise agreed upon by the 19parties. The entire interview shall be recorded by a court 20reporter. The transcript of the interview shall be filed under 21seal and released only upon order of the court.22    (b) Court's professional.
