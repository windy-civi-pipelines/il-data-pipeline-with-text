The Department shall make the 4        documents required under this paragraph available for 5        retrieval from the Department's website. 6            (2) Upon notification of a violation of paragraph 7        (1) of this subdivision (K), the Department may launch 8        a preliminary investigation. If the Department finds a 9        violation, the Department may issue a notice to show 10        cause giving the employer 30 days to correct the 11        violation. If the violation is not corrected, the 12        Department may initiate a charge of a civil rights 13        violation. 14        (L) Use of artificial intelligence.15            (1) With respect to recruitment, hiring, 16        promotion, renewal of employment, selection for 17        training or apprenticeship, discharge, discipline, 18        tenure, or the terms, privileges, or conditions of 19        employment, for an employer to use artificial 20        intelligence that has the effect of subjecting 21        employees to discrimination on the basis of protected 22        classes under this Article or to use zip codes as a 23        proxy for protected classes under this Article.24            (2) For an employer to fail to provide notice to an 25        employee that the employer is using artificial 26        intelligence for the purposes described in paragraph   HB1594- 28 -LRB104 06954 JRC 16991 b1        (1).2        The Department shall adopt any rules necessary for the 3    implementation and enforcement of this subdivision, 4    including, but not limited to, rules on the circumstances 5    and conditions that require notice, the time period for 6    providing notice, and the means for providing notice.7(Source: P.A. 102-233, eff. 8-2-21; 103-797, eff. 1-1-25; 8103-804, eff. 1-1-26; revised 11-26-24.) 9    (775 ILCS 5/5-102.3 new)10    Sec. 5-102.3.
