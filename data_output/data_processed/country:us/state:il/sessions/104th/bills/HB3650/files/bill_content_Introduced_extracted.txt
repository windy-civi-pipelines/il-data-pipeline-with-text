Lilly SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: See Index    Amends the Energy Transition Act. Adds electrification industries to clean energy jobs. Amends the Public Utilities Act. Provides that a gas utility may cease providing service if the Illinois Commerce Commission determines that adequate substitute service is available at a reasonable cost to support the existing end uses of the affected utility customers. Provides for cost-effective energy efficiency measures for natural gas utilities that supersede existing provisions concerning natural gas energy efficiency programs and take effect beginning January 1, 2025. Provides that gas main and gas service extension policies shall be based on the principle that the full incremental cost associated with new development and growth shall be borne by the customers that cause those incremental costs. Provides that, no later than 60 days after the effective date of the amendatory Act, the Commission shall initiate a docketed rulemaking reviewing each gas public utility tariff that provides for gas main and gas service extensions without additional charge to new customers in excess of the default extensions as specified in administrative rule. Adds the Clean Building Heating Law Article to the Act, with provisions concerning emissions standards for heating in buildings, as well as related and other provisions. Adds the 2050 Heat Decarbonization Standard Article to the Act, with provisions concerning options for compliance, measures for customer emission reduction, customer emission reductions, tradable clean heat credits, banking of emission reductions, equity in emission reductions, enforcement, the 2050 Heat Decarbonization Pathways Study, gas infrastructure planning, a study on gas utility financial incentive reform, and reporting requirements.

The Public Utilities Act is amended by 21changing Sections 1-102, 8-101, 9-229, 9-241, and 16-111.10 22and by adding Sections 1-103, 3-128, 8-104B, 9-228.5, 9-235, 239-254, and 9-255, and Articles XXIII, XXIV, and XXV as 24follows:   HB3650- 4 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    (220 ILCS 5/1-102)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 1-102)2    Sec. 1-102. Findings and Intent. The General Assembly 3finds that the health, welfare, and prosperity of all Illinois 4citizens require the provision of adequate, efficient, 5reliable, affordable, environmentally safe, and least-cost 6public utility services at prices which accurately reflect the 7long-term cost of such services and which are equitable to all 8citizens. It is therefore declared to be the policy of the 9State that public utilities shall continue to be regulated 10effectively and comprehensively. It is further declared that 11the goals and objectives of such regulation shall be to 12ensure: 13        (a) Efficiency: the provision of reliable and 14    affordable energy services that meet the State's climate 15    and emissions reduction targets at the lowest societal 16    least possible cost to the citizens of the State; in such 17    manner that: 18            (i) physical, human, and financial resources are 19        allocated efficiently and equitably; 20            (ii) all supply and demand options are considered 21        and evaluated using comparable terms and methods in 22        order to determine how utilities shall meet State 23        emissions reduction targets and their customers' 24        demands for public utility services at the lowest 25        societal least cost; 26            (iii) utilities are allowed a sufficient return on   HB3650- 5 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        investment so as to enable them to attract capital in 2        financial markets at competitive rates; 3            (iv) tariff rates for the sale of various public 4        utility services are authorized such that they 5        accurately reflect the cost of delivering those 6        services and allow utilities to recover the total 7        costs prudently and reasonably incurred; 8            (v) variation in costs by customer class and time 9        of use is taken into consideration in authorizing 10        rates for each class. 11        (b) Environmental Quality: the protection of the 12    environment, people, and communities from the adverse 13    external costs of public utility services, including 14    environmental costs, so that: 15            (i) environmental costs of proposed actions having 16        a significant impact on the environment and the 17        environmental impact of the alternatives are 18        identified, documented, monetized, included in 19        assessments of cost, and considered in all aspects of 20        the regulatory process; 21            (ii) the prudently and reasonably incurred costs 22        of environmental controls are recovered. 23        (c) Reliability: the ability of utilities to provide 24    consumers with public utility services under varying 25    demand conditions in such manner that suppliers of public 26    utility services are able to provide service at varying   HB3650- 6 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    levels of economic reliability giving appropriate 2    consideration to the costs likely to be incurred as a 3    result of service interruptions, and to the costs of 4    increasing or maintaining current levels of reliability 5    consistent with commitments to consumers. 6        (d) Equity: the fair treatment of consumers, including 7    equity investment eligible persons and equity investment 8    eligible communities, as defined in the Energy Transition 9    Act, and investors in order that 10            (i) the public health, safety, and welfare shall 11        be protected; 12            (ii) the application of rates is based on public 13        understandability and acceptance of the reasonableness 14        of the rate structure and level; 15            (iii) the cost of supplying public utility 16        services is allocated to those who cause the costs to 17        be incurred; 18            (iv) if factors other than cost of service are 19        considered in regulatory decisions, the rationale for 20        these actions is set forth; 21            (v) regulation allows for orderly transition 22        periods to accommodate changes in public utility 23        service markets; 24            (vi) regulation does not result in undue or 25        sustained adverse impact on utility earnings; 26            (vii) the impacts of regulatory actions on all   HB3650- 7 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        sectors of the State are carefully weighed; 2            (viii) the rates for utility services are 3        affordable and, therefore, ensure and preserve the 4        availability and accessibility of such services to all 5        customers, and customers are not energy burdened or 6        severely energy burdened citizens.7        As used in this subsection (d): 8            (I) "Energy burdened" means, with respect to a 9        customer's household, that the household pays 6% or 10        more of its income toward electricity and gas bills.11            (II) "Severely energy burdened" means, with 12        respect to a customer's household, that the household 13        pays 10% or more of its income toward electricity and 14        gas bills. 15        (e) Affordability: the ability of utilities to ensure 16    uninterrupted access to essential utility service; to 17    minimize and reduce over time the number of households who 18    are energy burdened and severely energy burdened, as 19    defined in this Act, ideally to zero; and to minimize 20    disconnections to residential customers in a manner which 21    ensures that:22            (i) all low-income customers, defined as those 23        whose income is less than or equal to 80% of the area 24        median income, as defined by the United States 25        Department of Housing and Urban Development, have 26        access to a discounted utility rate;  HB3650- 8 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1            (ii) low-income customers 65 years of age or older 2        are not disconnected from essential utility service 3        due to inability to afford the monthly bill;4            (iii) low-income customers with children under the 5        age of 6 are not disconnected from essential utility 6        service due to inability to afford the monthly bill;7            (iv) persons with medical conditions are not 8        disconnected from essential utility service if a 9        medical or qualified professional as described in 10        subsection (b) of Section 8-202.7 certifies that the 11        condition will be exacerbated by disconnection from 12        essential utility service;13            (v) disconnection of essential utility service is 14        not accelerated based on a utility's payment risk 15        assessment of a customer; and16            (vi) a utility assesses whether a customer may be 17        eligible for energy assistance programs under the 18        Energy Assistance Act, provides the customer with 19        specific information on where and how to obtain energy 20        assistance, and ceases disconnection activity for 60 21        days to allow the customer to apply for and establish 22        eligibility for the energy assistance. 23    It is further declared to be the policy of the State that 24this Act shall not apply in relation to motor carriers and rail 25carriers as defined in the Illinois Commercial Transportation 26Law, or to the Commission in the regulation of such carriers.  HB3650- 9 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit, restrict, 2or mitigate in any way the power and authority of the State's 3Attorneys or the Attorney General under the Consumer Fraud and 4Deceptive Business Practices Act.5(Source: P.A. 92-22, eff. 6-30-01.) 6    (220 ILCS 5/1-103 new)7    Sec. 1-103. Commission methodologies and metrics. The 8Commission shall oversee the objectives identified in Section 91-102 by establishing and implementing methodologies for 10tracking each of the following metrics:11        (1) Environmental costs: The Commission shall 12    establish a social cost of greenhouse gases, measured in 13    dollars per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, that shall 14    serve as a monetary estimate of the value of not emitting a 15    ton of greenhouse gas emissions. The Commission shall 16    consider prior or existing estimates of the social cost of 17    carbon issued or adopted by the federal government, 18    appropriate international bodies, or other appropriate and 19    reputable scientific organizations. The social cost of 20    greenhouse gases shall: 21            (A) estimate the emissions for all relevant 22        greenhouse gases, including carbon, methane, nitrous 23        oxide, hydrofluorocarbons and hydrofluoroolefins, 24        perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and nitrogen 25        trifluoride;   HB3650- 10 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1            (B) consider the fullest geographic and temporal 2        scope of damages; 3            (C) for the purposes of this Act, the cost of 4        greenhouse gas emissions is no less than the cost per 5        metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, 6        using the 2.5% discount rate, listed in Table ES-1 of 7        "Technical Support Document: Social Cost of Carbon, 8        Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under 9        Executive Order 13990", a report prepared in support 10        of federal Executive Order 13990 and dated February 11        2021.12        The Commission must annually adjust the costs 13    established in this Section to reflect the effect of 14    inflation and may, at its discretion, set the price at a 15    higher level than described above, but no lower. 16        (2) Impacts to public health: The Commission shall 17    develop a methodology for measuring and monetizing in cost 18    assessments the public health impacts of pollutants, 19    including impacts of both indoor and outdoor air quality, 20    including carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, nitrogen 21    oxides, including nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, 22    formaldehyde, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and lead. The 23    Commission shall integrate its methodology into 24    assessments of utility system planning and supply and 25    demand-side resource selection. 26    It is further declared to be the policy of the State that   HB3650- 11 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1this Section does not apply to motor carriers and rail 2carriers as defined in the Illinois Commercial Transportation 3Law or to the Commission in the regulation of such carriers. 4    Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit, 5restrict, or mitigate in any way the power and authority of the 6State's Attorneys or the Attorney General under the Consumer 7Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.  8    (220 ILCS 5/3-128 new)9    Sec. 3-128. Fixed charge. "Fixed charge" means a charge 10that is assessed by a public utility as part of its rates, is 11equal across all customers or customers of a certain class, 12and is not directly proportional to a customer's usage. 13    (220 ILCS 5/8-101)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 8-101)14    Sec. 8-101. Duties of public utilities; nondiscrimination. 15A public utility shall furnish, provide, and maintain such 16service instrumentalities, equipment, and facilities as shall 17promote the safety, health, comfort, and convenience of its 18patrons, employees, and public and as shall be in all respects 19adequate, efficient, just, and reasonable.20    All rules and regulations made by a public utility 21affecting or pertaining to its charges or service to the 22public shall be just and reasonable.23    An electric A public utility shall, and a gas utility may, 24upon reasonable notice, furnish to all persons who may apply   HB3650- 12 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1therefor and be reasonably entitled thereto, suitable 2facilities and service, without discrimination and without 3delay. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a gas 4utility may cease providing service if the Commission 5determines that adequate substitute service is available at a 6reasonable cost to support the existing end uses of the 7affected utility customers. Any applicant for gas service 8shall receive clear, timely information from the gas utility, 9written in plain language, and approved by the Commission 10after stakeholder input on incentives and opportunities for 11installing, as alternatives to gas, energy-efficient electric 12technologies and incentives and opportunities for other energy 13efficiency measures, weatherization, demand management, and 14distributed energy resource programs. The information provided 15must include, among other things, information detailing 16electrification incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act and 17describing how the applicant can elect to receive the upfront 18discounts or tax incentives applicable to the applicant's 19electric purchases. 20    Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent a 21public utility from accepting payment electronically or by the 22use of a customer-preferred financially accredited credit or 23debit methodology.24(Source: P.A. 92-22, eff. 6-30-01.) 25    (220 ILCS 5/8-104B new)  HB3650- 13 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Sec. 8-104B. Gas energy efficiency.2    (a) As used in this Section:3    "Benefit-cost ratio" means the ratio of the net present 4value of the total benefits of the measures to the net present 5value of the total costs as calculated over the lifetime of the 6measures. 7    "Cost-effective measure" means a measure that satisfies 8the total resource cost test.9    "Energy efficiency measure" means a measure that reduces 10(i) the total Btus of electricity and natural gas and other 11utility-delivered gaseous fuels needed to meet an end use or 12end uses and (ii) the amount of natural gas and other 13utility-delivered gaseous fuels consumed on site, at the home 14or business facility, to meet an end use or end uses.15    "Total resource cost test" means a standard that is met 16if, for an investment in an energy efficiency measure, the 17benefit-cost ratio is greater than one. The total resource 18cost test quantifies the net savings obtained through the 19substitution of demand-side measures for supply resources by 20comparing (i) the sum of avoided natural gas utility costs, 21representing the benefits that accrue to the natural gas 22system and the participant in the delivery of those energy 23efficiency measures and including avoided costs associated 24with the use of electricity or other fuels, avoided costs 25associated with reduced water consumption, and avoided 26operation and maintenance costs, as well as other quantifiable   HB3650- 14 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1societal benefits and (ii) the sum of all incremental costs of 2end-use measures, including both utility and participant 3contribution costs to administer, deliver, and evaluate each 4demand-side measure. In calculating avoided costs, reasonable 5estimates shall be included for financial costs likely to be 6imposed by future regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases. 7In discounting future societal costs and benefits for the 8purpose of calculating net present values, a societal discount 9rate based on actual, long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields 10shall be used. The income-qualified measures described in 11paragraphs (5) and (6) of subsection (d) shall not be required 12to meet the total resource cost test.13    (b) It is the policy of the State for gas utilities to be 14required to use cost-effective energy efficiency measures to 15reduce delivery load. Requiring investment in cost-effective 16energy efficiency measures will reduce direct and indirect 17costs to consumers by decreasing environmental impacts, 18reducing the amount of natural gas and other utility-delivered 19gaseous fuels that need to be purchased, and avoiding or 20delaying the need for new transmission, distribution, storage, 21and other related infrastructure. Moreover, the public 22interest is served by allowing gas utilities to recover costs 23for reasonably and prudently incurred expenditures for energy 24efficiency measures. 25    (c) This Section applies to all gas distribution utilities 26in the State and supersedes Section 8-104 beginning January 1,   HB3650- 15 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b12024. 2    (d) Natural gas utilities shall implement cost-effective 3energy efficiency measures to achieve all of the following 4requirements: 5        (1) Total incremental annual savings shall be equal to 6    at least 0.6% of annual sales to distribution customers in 7    2025, 0.8% of such sales in 2026, and at least 1% of such 8    sales in 2027 and each subsequent year. For the purpose of 9    calculating savings as a percent of sales to distribution 10    customers for a given program year, the denominator of 11    sales to distribution customers shall be annual average 12    sales over the second, third, and fourth full calendar 13    years prior to the beginning of the program year. 14        (2) The savings achieved must have an average life of 15    at least 12 years. 16        (3) Savings may not be applied toward achievement of 17    utility savings goals if the savings arise from the 18    installation of efficient new gas furnaces, gas boilers, 19    gas water heaters, or other gas-consuming equipment in a 20    residential building, such as a single-family, 21    individually metered multifamily building or a 22    master-metered multifamily building. 23        (4) At least 50% of the entire budget for efficiency 24    programs shall be spent on energy efficiency measures that 25    reduce space heating needs through improvements to the 26    efficiency of building envelopes, including, but not   HB3650- 16 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    limited to, insulation measures and efficient windows and 2    energy efficiency measures that reduce air leakage through 3    improvements to systems for distributing heat, including, 4    but not limited to, duct leakage reduction, duct 5    insulation, or pipe insulation in buildings or through 6    improved heating systems controls, including, but not 7    limited to, advanced thermostats and demand control 8    ventilation. Spending on efficient furnaces, efficient 9    boilers, or other efficient heating systems is permitted 10    within business efficiency programs but does not count 11    toward this minimum requirement for spending on building 12    envelope, heating distribution, and control efficiencies. 13    Spending on income-qualified building envelope measures, 14    heating distribution system measures, and heating controls 15    does count toward this requirement. The portion of 16    portfolio spending on program marketing, training of 17    installers, audits of buildings, inspections of work 18    performed, and other administrative and technical expenses 19    that are clearly tied to promotion or installation of 20    building envelope or heating distribution system measures 21    shall count toward this requirement. If this minimum 22    requirement is not met, any performance incentive earned 23    under subsection (h) should be reduced by the percentage 24    point level of shortfall in meeting this requirement.25        (5) The portion of the entire budget for efficiency 26    programs that is spent on efficiency measures for   HB3650- 17 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    income-qualified households shall be the greater of 20% or 2    5 percentage points more than the proportion of total 3    residential and business customer gas sales going to 4    income-qualified households. For purposes of this Section, 5    households at or below 80% of area median income are 6    income-qualified. At least 80% of spending on measures in 7    programs targeted at income-qualified households shall be 8    delivered through whole building weatherization programs 9    and spent on measures that reduce space heating needs 10    through improvements to the building envelope, heating 11    distribution systems, or heating controls. The utilities 12    shall invest in health and safety measures appropriate and 13    necessary for comprehensively weatherizing the homes and 14    multifamily buildings of income-qualified households, with 15    up to 15% of income-qualified program spending made 16    available for such purposes. The ratio of spending on 17    efficiency programs targeted at multifamily buildings of 18    income-qualified households to spending on energy 19    efficiency programs targeted at single-family buildings of 20    income-qualified households shall be designed to achieve 21    levels of savings from each building type that are 22    approximately proportional to the magnitude of 23    cost-effective lifetime savings potential in each building 24    type. The gas utilities shall participate in a Low-Income 25    Energy Efficiency Accountability Committee as established 26    in Section 8-103B.  HB3650- 18 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        Gas utilities must conduct customer outreach and 2    education efforts in equity investment eligible 3    communities in order to provide notice of and explanations 4    concerning the following types of programs:5            (A) energy efficiency programs, the Illinois Solar 6        for All Program, and whole home retrofit programs that 7        reduce natural gas usage;8            (B) income-qualified financial assistance 9        programs, including rebate programs from the federal 10        government; and11            (C) general education programs designed to explain 12        utility bills and the decisions customers can make to 13        lower energy usage.14        These outreach and education efforts must be brought 15    to communities in a diversity of ways, must be created 16    with input from members of the communities, and must be 17    provided through, among other things:18            (i) information on customers' bills in the main 19        languages spoken in the communities;20            (ii) a quarterly posting in local newspapers that 21        cover the service area;22            (iii) a dedicated section on the investor-owned 23        utility's website; and24            (iv) in-person and virtual educational sessions 25        that take place in the income-qualified and Justice40 26        community, provide food and child care for   HB3650- 19 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        participating customers, and are codesigned with 2        interested community-based organization 3        representatives. 4        (6) Implementation of energy efficiency measures and 5    programs targeted at income-qualified households shall be 6    contracted, when practicable, to independent third parties 7    that have demonstrated the capability of serving those 8    households, with a preference for not-for-profit entities 9    and government agencies that have existing relationships 10    with, experience serving, or working directly within and 11    alongside income-qualified communities in the State. Each 12    gas utility shall develop and implement reporting 13    procedures that address and assist in determining the 14    amount of energy savings that can be applied to the 15    income-qualified procurement and expenditure requirements 16    set forth in this paragraph. 17        (7) A minimum of 10% of the utility's entire portfolio 18    funding level for a given year shall be used to procure 19    cost-effective energy efficiency measures from units of 20    local government, municipal corporations, school 21    districts, public housing, community college districts, 22    and nonprofit-owned buildings as long as a minimum 23    percentage of available funds shall be used to procure 24    energy efficiency from public housing, which percentage 25    shall be, at a minimum, equal to public housing's share of 26    public building energy consumption. Spending on public   HB3650- 20 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    housing may count toward minimum spending requirements on 2    efficiency improvements for income-qualified households. 3    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a utility 4providing approved energy efficiency measures in the State may 5recover all reasonable and prudently incurred costs of those 6measures from its retail customers. However, nothing in this 7subsection permits the double recovery of such costs from 8customers. 9    (f) Beginning in 2024, each gas utility shall file an 10energy efficiency plan with the Commission to meet the energy 11efficiency standards in subsection (d) for the next applicable 12multiyear period beginning January 1 of the year following the 13filing, according to the schedule set forth in paragraphs (1) 14through (4). If a utility does not file such a plan on or 15before the applicable filing deadline for the plan, the 16utility shall be liable for a civil penalty of $100,000 per day 17until the plan is filed. 18        (1) No later than 120 days after the effective date of 19    this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, each 20    gas utility shall file an energy efficiency plan to 21    supersede its previously filed energy efficiency plan for 22    calendar year 2025 that is designed to achieve through 23    implementation of energy efficiency measures the 24    incremental annual savings goals, minimum average savings 25    life, and other requirements specified in paragraphs (1) 26    through (7) of subsection (d). An energy efficiency plan   HB3650- 21 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    submitted by a gas utility under this paragraph supersedes 2    any energy efficiency plan previously filed by the gas 3    utility for calendar year 2025. 4        (2) No later than March 1, 2025, each gas utility 5    shall file a 4-year energy efficiency plan that takes 6    effect on January 1, 2026 and is designed to achieve, 7    through implementation of emergency efficiency measures, 8    the incremental annual savings goals, minimum average 9    savings life, and other requirements specified in 10    paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (d). However, the 11    incremental annual savings goals may be reduced if the 12    plan's analysis and forecasts of the utility's ability to 13    acquire energy savings demonstrate by clear and convincing 14    evidence and through independent analysis that achievement 15    of such goals is not cost-effective. In no event may 16    incremental annual savings goals for any year be reduced 17    to levels below (i) those actually achieved in calendar 18    year 2024, (ii) those forecast to be achieved in calendar 19    year 2025, or (iii) 0.75% of sales. The Commission shall 20    review any proposed goal reduction as part of its review 21    and approval of the utility's proposed plan. 22        (3) Beginning in 2029 and every 4 years thereafter, 23    each gas utility shall file by no later than March 1 of the 24    applicable year, a 4-year energy efficiency plan that 25    takes effect on the following January 1 and is designed to 26    achieve, through implementation of energy efficiency   HB3650- 22 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    measures, the incremental annual savings goals, minimum 2    average savings life, and other requirements specified in 3    paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (d). However, the 4    incremental annual savings goals may be reduced if the 5    plan's analysis and forecasts of the utility's ability to 6    acquire energy savings demonstrate by clear and convincing 7    evidence and through independent analysis that achievement 8    of such goals is not cost-effective. In no event may 9    incremental annual savings goals for any year be reduced 10    to levels below (i) those actually achieved in the 11    calendar year before the plan filing, (ii) those forecast 12    to be achieved in the calendar year in which the plan 13    filing is made, or (iii) 0.75% of sales. The Commission 14    shall review any proposed goal reduction as part of its 15    review and approval of the utility's proposed plan. 16        (4) Each utility's plan shall set forth the utility's 17    proposals to meet the energy efficiency standards 18    identified in subsection (d). The Commission shall seek 19    public comment on each plan that takes effect on January 20    1, 2024 and before January 1, 2026 and shall issue an order 21    approving or disapproving the plan no later than November 22    30, 2023, or 225 days after the effective date of this 23    amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, whichever is 24    later. The Commission shall seek public comment on each 25    plan that takes effect on January 1, 2026 and shall issue 26    an order approving or disapproving the plan within 6   HB3650- 23 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    months after its submission. If the Commission disapproves 2    a plan, the Commission shall, within 30 days, describe in 3    detail the reasons for the disapproval and describe a path 4    by which the utility may file a revised draft of the plan 5    to address the Commission's concerns satisfactorily. If 6    the utility does not refile with the Commission within 60 7    days, the utility shall be subject to civil penalties at a 8    rate of $100,000 per day until the plan is refiled. This 9    process shall continue, and penalties shall accrue, until 10    the utility has successfully filed a portfolio of energy 11    efficiency measures. Penalties shall be deposited into the 12    Energy Efficiency Trust Fund. 13    (g) In submitting proposed plans and funding levels under 14subsection (f) to meet the savings goals identified in 15subsection (d), the utility shall: 16        (1) demonstrate that its proposed energy efficiency 17    measures will achieve the requirements that are identified 18    in subsection (d); 19        (2) demonstrate consideration of program options for 20    supporting efforts to improve compliance with new building 21    codes, appliance standards, and municipal regulations as 22    potentially cost-effective means of acquiring energy 23    savings to count toward energy savings goals; 24        (3) demonstrate that its overall portfolio of measures 25    and programs, not including income-qualified programs 26    described in subsection (d), is cost-effective using the   HB3650- 24 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    total resource cost test and represents a diverse cross 2    section of opportunities for customers of all rate classes 3    to participate in programs. Individual measures need not 4    be cost-effective; 5        (4) demonstrate that the utility's plan integrates the 6    delivery of energy efficiency programs with electric 7    efficiency programs, programs promoting demand response, 8    and other efforts to address bill payment issues, 9    including, but not limited to, the Low Income Home Energy 10    Assistance Program and the Percentage of Income Payment 11    Plans; 12        (5) include a proposed or revised cost-recovery 13    mechanism to fund the proposed energy efficiency measures 14    and ensure the recovery of the prudently and reasonably 15    incurred costs of Commission-approved programs; 16        (6) provide, using not more than 3% of portfolio 17    resources in any given year, an annual independent 18    evaluation of the performance and cost-effectiveness of 19    the utility's portfolio of measures and programs; 20        (7) demonstrate how it will ensure that program 21    implementation contractors and energy efficiency 22    installation vendors will promote workforce equity and 23    quality jobs. Utilities shall collect, and make publicly 24    available at least quarterly, data necessary to 25    demonstrate how efforts are advancing workforce equity. 26    Utilities shall work with relevant vendors providing   HB3650- 25 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    education, training, and other resources needed to ensure 2    compliance and, where necessary, adjusting or terminating 3    work with vendors that cannot assist with compliance; and 4        (8) include any plans for research, development, or 5    pilot deployment of new measures or program approaches. 6    For utilities with unmodified savings goals, no more than 7    4% of energy efficiency portfolio spending may be 8    allocated for such purposes. For utilities with modified 9    savings goals, no more than 2% of energy efficiency 10    portfolio spending may be allocated for such purposes. 11    Utilities shall work with interested stakeholders to 12    formulate a plan for how any proposed funds should be 13    spent, incorporate statewide approaches for these 14    allocations whenever such approaches would be more 15    effective or cost-efficient, and demonstrate such 16    collaboration in the utilities' plans. 17    (h) Each gas utility shall be eligible to earn a 18shareholder incentive for effective implementation of its 19efficiency programs. The incentive shall be tied to each 20utility's annual energy efficiency spending and its savings. 21There shall be no incentive if the independent evaluator 22determines the utility either (i) failed to achieve the 23minimum average savings life specified in paragraph (2) of 24subsection (d), (ii) did not fully meet all of the 25requirements specified in paragraphs (3) through (7) of 26subsection (d), or (iii) failed to achieve incremental annual   HB3650- 26 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1savings equal to at least 90% of the incremental savings goal 2specified in paragraph (1) of subsection (d). If a utility 3meets all of the requirements specified in paragraphs (2) 4through (7) of subsection (d), it can earn an incentive equal 50.5% of total annual efficiency spending in the year being 6evaluated for every one percentage point above 90% of its 7incremental annual savings goal that it achieves for that 8year, with a maximum incentive of 15% for achieving 120% of its 9incremental annual savings goal. 10    (i) The utility shall submit energy savings data to the 11independent evaluator no later than 30 days after the close of 12the plan year. The independent evaluator shall determine the 13incremental annual savings and average savings life, as well 14as an estimate of the job impacts and other macroeconomic 15impacts of the efficiency programs for that year, achieved no 16later than 120 days after the close of the plan year. The 17utility shall submit an informational filing to the Commission 18no later than 160 days after the close of the plan year that 19attaches the independent evaluator's final report identifying 20the incremental annual savings for the year, identifying 21average savings life for the year, documenting compliance with 22other requirements in subsection (d), and, as applicable, the 23magnitude of any shareholder incentive which the utility has 24earned. 25    (j) Gas utilities shall report annually to the Commission 26and General Assembly on how hiring, contracting, job training,   HB3650- 27 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1and other practices related to its energy efficiency programs 2enhance the diversity of vendors working on such programs. 3These reports must include data on vendor and employee 4diversity. 5    (k) The independent evaluator shall follow the guidelines 6and use the savings set forth in Commission-approved energy 7efficiency policy manuals and technical reference manuals, as 8each may be updated from time to time. Until measure life 9values for energy efficiency measures implemented for 10income-qualified households are separately incorporated into 11such Commission-approved manuals, the income-qualified 12measures shall have the same measure life values that are 13established for the same measures implemented in households 14that are not income-qualified households.  15    (220 ILCS 5/9-228.5 new)16    Sec. 9-228.5. Consideration of gas main and gas service 17extension costs. Gas main and gas service extension policies 18shall be based on the principle that the full incremental cost 19associated with new development and growth shall be borne by 20the customers that cause those incremental costs. Gas main and 21gas service extension policies, procedures, and conditions 22shall align with the greenhouse gas emission reduction goals 23established in Article XXIV. 24    (220 ILCS 5/9-229)  HB3650- 28 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Sec. 9-229.

This issue shall be 7expressly addressed in the Commission's final order.8    (b) The State of Illinois shall create a Consumer 9Intervenor Compensation Fund subject to the following:10        (1) Provision of compensation for Consumer Interest 11    Representatives that intervene in Illinois Commerce 12    Commission proceedings will increase public engagement, 13    encourage additional transparency, expand the information 14    available to the Commission, and improve decision-making.15        (2) As used in this Section, "consumer Consumer 16    interest representative" means:17            (A) a residential utility customer or group of 18        residential utility customers represented by a 19        not-for-profit group or organization registered with 20        the Illinois Attorney General under the Solicitation 21        for Charity Act;22            (B) representatives of not-for-profit groups or 23        organizations whose membership is limited to 24        residential utility customers; or25            (C) representatives of not-for-profit groups or 26        organizations whose membership includes Illinois   HB3650- 29 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        residents and that address the community, economic, 2        environmental, or social welfare of Illinois 3        residents, except government agencies or intervenors 4        specifically authorized by Illinois law to participate 5        in Commission proceedings on behalf of Illinois 6        consumers.7        (3) A consumer interest representative is eligible to 8    receive compensation from the consumer intervenor 9    compensation fund if its participation included lay or 10    expert testimony or legal briefing and argument concerning 11    the expenses, investments, rate design, rate impact, or 12    other matters affecting the pricing, rates, costs or other 13    charges associated with utility service, the Commission 14    adopts a material recommendation related to a significant 15    issue in the docket, and participation caused a 16    significant financial cost hardship to the participant; 17    however, no consumer interest representative shall be 18    eligible to receive an award pursuant to this Section if 19    the consumer interest representative receives any 20    compensation, funding, or donations, directly or 21    indirectly, from parties that have a financial interest in 22    the outcome of the proceeding.23        (4) Within 30 days after September 15, 2021 (the 24    effective date of Public Act 102-662), each utility that 25    files a request for an increase in rates under Article IX 26    or Article XVI shall deposit an amount equal to one half of   HB3650- 30 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    the rate case attorney and expert expense allowed by the 2    Commission, but not to exceed $500,000, into the fund 3    within 35 days of the date of the Commission's Final final 4    Order in the rate case or 20 days after the denial of 5    rehearing under Section 10-113 of this Act, whichever is 6    later. The Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund shall be 7    used to provide payment to consumer interest 8    representatives as described in this Section.9        (5) An electric public utility with 3,000,000 or more 10    retail customers shall contribute $450,000 to the Consumer 11    Intervenor Compensation Fund within 60 days after 12    September 15, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 13    102-662). A combined electric and gas public utility 14    serving fewer than 3,000,000 but more than 500,000 retail 15    customers shall contribute $225,000 to the Consumer 16    Intervenor Compensation Fund within 60 days after 17    September 15, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 18    102-662). A gas public utility with 1,500,000 or more 19    retail customers that is not a combined electric and gas 20    public utility shall contribute $225,000 to the Consumer 21    Intervenor Compensation Fund within 60 days after 22    September 15, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 23    102-662). A gas public utility with fewer than 1,500,000 24    retail customers but more than 300,000 retail customers 25    that is not a combined electric and gas public utility 26    shall contribute $80,000 to the Consumer Intervenor   HB3650- 31 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Compensation Fund within 60 days after September 15, 2021 2    (the effective date of Public Act 102-662). A gas public 3    utility with fewer than 300,000 retail customers that is 4    not a combined electric and gas public utility shall 5    contribute $20,000 to the Consumer Intervenor Compensation 6    Fund within 60 days after September 15, 2021 (the 7    effective date of Public Act 102-662). A combined electric 8    and gas public utility serving fewer than 500,000 retail 9    customers shall contribute $20,000 to the Consumer 10    Intervenor Compensation Fund within 60 days after 11    September 15, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 12    102-662).

All 25    disbursements from the Consumer Intervenor Compensation 26    Fund shall be made only upon warrants of the Comptroller   HB3650- 33 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    drawn upon the Treasurer as custodian of the Fund upon 2    vouchers signed by the Executive Director of the 3    Commission or by the person or persons designated by the 4    Director for that purpose. The Comptroller is authorized 5    to draw the warrant upon vouchers so signed. The Treasurer 6    shall accept all warrants so signed and shall be released 7    from liability for all payments made on those warrants. 8    The Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund shall be 9    administered by an Administrator that is a person or 10    entity that is independent of the Commission. The 11    administrator will be responsible for the prudent 12    management of the Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund 13    and for recommendations for the award of consumer 14    intervenor compensation from the Consumer Intervenor 15    Compensation Fund. The Commission shall issue a request 16    for qualifications for a third-party program administrator 17    to administer the Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund. 18    The third-party administrator shall be chosen through a 19    competitive bid process based on selection criteria and 20    requirements developed by the Commission. The Illinois 21    Procurement Code does not apply to the hiring or payment 22    of the Administrator. All Administrator costs may be paid 23    for using monies from the Consumer Intervenor Compensation 24    Fund, but the Program Administrator shall strive to 25    minimize costs in the implementation of the program.26        (B) The computation of compensation awarded from the   HB3650- 34 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    fund shall take into consideration the market rates paid 2    to persons of comparable training and experience who offer 3    similar services, but may not exceed the comparable market 4    rate for services paid by the public utility as part of its 5    rate case expense.6        (C)(1) Recommendations on the award of compensation by 7    the administrator shall include consideration of whether 8    the participation raised Commission adopted a material 9    recommendation related to a significant issue in the 10    docket and whether participation caused a significant 11    financial cost hardship to the participant and the payment 12    of compensation is fair, just, and reasonable.13        (2) Recommendations on the award of compensation by 14    the administrator shall be submitted to the Commission for 15    approval. Unless the Commission initiates an investigation 16    within 45 days after the notice to the Commission, the 17    award of compensation shall be allowed 45 days after 18    notice to the Commission. Such notice shall be given by 19    filing with the Commission on the Commission's e-docket 20    system, and keeping open for public inspection the award 21    for compensation proposed by the Administrator. The 22    Commission shall have power, and it is hereby given 23    authority, either upon complaint or upon its own 24    initiative without complaint, at once, and if it so 25    orders, without answer or other formal pleadings, but upon 26    reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the   HB3650- 35 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    propriety of the award.2    (c) The Commission may adopt rules to implement this 3Section.4(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24.) 5    (220 ILCS 5/9-235 new)6    Sec. 9-235. Tariffed gas main and gas service extension 7provisions. No later than 60 days after the effective date of 8this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, the 9Commission shall initiate a docketed rulemaking reviewing each 10gas public utility tariff that provides for gas main and gas 11service extensions without additional charge to new customers 12in excess of the default extensions without charge as 13specified in 83 Ill. Adm. Code 501. The focus of the rulemaking 14shall be to modify each gas utility's gas main and gas service 15extension tariff to align with the provisions set forth in 16Section 9-228.5. 17    (220 ILCS 5/9-241)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 9-241)18    Sec. 9-241. Nondiscrimination. 19    (a) No public utility shall, as to rates or other charges, 20services, facilities, or in other respect, make or grant any 21preference or advantage to any corporation or person or 22subject any corporation or person to any prejudice or 23disadvantage. No public utility shall establish or maintain 24any unreasonable difference as to rates or other charges,   HB3650- 36 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1services, facilities, or in any other respect, either as 2between localities or as between classes of service.3    (b) An electric utility in a county with a population of 43,000,000 or more shall not establish or maintain any 5unreasonable difference as to rates or other charges, 6services, contractual terms, or facilities for access to or 7the use of its utility infrastructure by another person or for 8any other purpose. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 9the Commission and its staff shall interpret this Section in 10accordance with Article XVI of this Act. 11     (c) Nothing in this Section shall be construed as 12limiting the authority of the Commission to permit the 13establishment of economic development rates as incentives to 14economic development either in enterprise zones as designated 15by the State of Illinois or in other areas of a utility's 16service area. Such rates should be available to existing 17businesses which demonstrate an increase to existing load as 18well as new businesses which create new load for a utility so 19as to create a more balanced utilization of generating 20capacity. The Commission shall ensure that such rates are 21established at a level which provides a net benefit to 22customers within a public utility's service area.23    (d) On or before January 1, 2025 2023, the Commission 24shall conduct a comprehensive study to assess whether 25low-income discount rates for electric and natural gas 26residential customers are appropriate and the potential design   HB3650- 37 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1and implementation of any such rates. The Commission shall 2include its findings, together with the appropriate 3recommendations, in a report to be provided to the General 4Assembly. Upon completion of the study, the Commission shall 5have the authority to permit or require electric and natural 6gas utilities to file a tariff establishing low-income 7discount rates.8    Such study shall assess, at a minimum, the following:9        (1) customer eligibility requirements, including 10    income-based eligibility and eligibility based on 11    participation in or eligibility for certain public 12    assistance programs;13        (2) appropriate rate structures, including 14    consideration of tiered discounts for different income 15    levels;16        (3) appropriate recovery mechanisms, including the 17    consideration of volumetric charges and customer charges;18        (4) appropriate verification mechanisms;19        (5) measures to ensure customer confidentiality and 20    data safeguards;21        (6) outreach and consumer education procedures; and22        (7) the impact that a low-income discount rate would 23    have on the affordability of delivery service to 24    low-income customers and customers overall.25    On or before January 1, 2026, the Commission shall begin a 26docketed rulemaking process to implement low-income discount   HB3650- 38 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1rates for electric and natural gas residential customers, 2incorporating the recommendations of the report required by 3this Section, released by the Commission in December 2022 and 4titled the "Illinois Commerce Commission Low-Income Discount 5Rate Study Report to the Illinois General Assembly". 6    (e) The Commission shall adopt rules requiring utility 7companies to produce information, in the form of a mailing, 8and other approved methods of distribution, to its consumers, 9to inform the consumers of available rebates, discounts, 10credits, and other cost-saving mechanisms that can help them 11lower their monthly utility bills, and send out such 12information semi-annually, unless otherwise provided by this 13Article. 14    (f) Prior to October 1, 1989, no public utility providing 15electrical or gas service shall consider the use of solar or 16other nonconventional renewable sources of energy by a 17customer as a basis for establishing higher rates or charges 18for any service or commodity sold to such customer; nor shall a 19public utility subject any customer utilizing such energy 20source or sources to any other prejudice or disadvantage on 21account of such use. No public utility shall without the 22consent of the Commission, charge or receive any greater 23compensation in the aggregate for a lesser commodity, product, 24or service than for a greater commodity, product or service of 25like character.26    The Commission, in order to expedite the determination of   HB3650- 39 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1rate questions, or to avoid unnecessary and unreasonable 2expense, or to avoid unjust or unreasonable discrimination 3between classes of customers, or, whenever in the judgment of 4the Commission public interest so requires, may, for rate 5making and accounting purposes, or either of them, consider 6one or more municipalities either with or without the adjacent 7or intervening rural territory as a regional unit where the 8same public utility serves such region under substantially 9similar conditions, and may within such region prescribe 10uniform rates for consumers or patrons of the same class.11    Any public utility, with the consent and approval of the 12Commission, may as a basis for the determination of the 13charges made by it classify its service according to the 14amount used, the time when used, the purpose for which used, 15and other relevant factors.16(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 103-679, eff. 7-19-24.) 17    (220 ILCS 5/9-254 new)18    Sec. 9-254. Independent gas system assessment.19    (a) The General Assembly finds that an independent audit 20of the current state of the gas distribution system, and of the 21expenditures made since 2012, will need to be made. 22Specifically, the General Assembly finds:23        (1) Pursuant to 2013 legislation establishing the 24    qualifying infrastructure plant charge, gas utilities in 25    this State that serve over 700,000 retail customers have   HB3650- 40 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    spent significant amounts of ratepayer dollars on system 2    investments purporting to refurbish, rebuild, modernize, 3    and expand gas system infrastructure.4        (2) The qualifying infrastructure plant charge is set 5    to conclude at its statutory deadline of December 31, 6    2023, and it is in the interest of this State and in the 7    interest of gas utilities' customers to understand the 8    benefits of these investments to the gas system and to 9    customers and to evaluate the current condition of the gas 10    system.11        (3) It is also necessary for gas utilities, the 12    Commission, and stakeholders to have an independently 13    verified set of data to draw upon for future gas rate cases 14    and any other proposed gas system spending.15        (4) Meeting the State's climate goals will require an 16    ordered transition away from gas, and toward electric 17    heating and appliances, for all or nearly all buildings, 18    and planning this transition will require a thorough 19    understanding of the current state of the gas system.20        (5) The Commission has authority to order and 21    implement the requirements of this Section under Section 22    8-102.23    (b) Terms used in this Section shall have the meanings 24given to them in Section 19-105.25    (c) Within 30 days after the effective date of this 26amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, the Commission   HB3650- 41 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1shall issue an order initiating an audit of each gas utility 2serving over 700,000 retail customers in the State, which 3shall examine the following:4        (1) An assessment of the gas distribution system, as 5    described in paragraph (2) of subsection (a). The 6    Commission shall have the authority to require additional 7    items that it deems necessary.8        (2) An analysis of the utility's capital projects 9    placed into service in the preceding 10 years, including, 10    but not limited to, an assessment of the value and safety 11    impact of pipe replacement, increased system pressure, and 12    pipe capacity expansion.13        (3) An assessment of the utility's emissions 14    reductions to date and what preparations the utility has 15    made to meet the terms of the Paris Climate Agreement, 16    with which it is the policy of the State to comply.17        (4) The creation of a visual, geographic map of the 18    gas system displaying the level of risk of various 19    pipelines and showing the areas where pipelines have 20    already been replaced.21        (5) The identifying areas of the gas system where the 22    cost to replace pipeline is likely to be high, including, 23    but not limited to, identifying places where 24    decommissioning a portion of the gas system and planning 25    to provide for electric heating and appliance needs in 26    that area may be preferable, considering the costs and   HB3650- 42 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    benefits for affordability, health, and climate.2    (d) It is contemplated that the auditor will use materials 3filed with the Commission by the utilities with respect to the 4auditor's expenditures in the preceding 10 years; however, the 5auditor may also, with Commission approval, assess other 6information deemed necessary to make its report. The results 7of the audit described in this Section shall be reflected in a 8report delivered to the Commission, describing the information 9specified in this Section. The report is to be delivered no 10later than 180 days after the Commission enters its order 11under subsection (c). It is understood that any public report 12may not contain items that are confidential or proprietary.13    (e) The costs of a gas utility's audit described in this 14Section shall not exceed $500,000 and shall be paid for by the 15electric utility that is the subject of the audit. Such costs 16shall be a recoverable expense.17    (f) The Commission shall have the authority to retain the 18services of an auditor to assist with the distribution 19planning process, as well as in docketed proceedings. Such 20expenses for these activities shall also be borne by the 21Commission. 22    (220 ILCS 5/9-255 new)23    Sec. 9-255. Phase-out of gas fixed changes. Beginning 24January 1, 2035, a public utility providing gas service may 25not assess fixed charges as part of its rates. Beginning   HB3650- 43 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1January 1, 2030, a public utility providing gas service must 2limit, for each customer class, any fixed charges in its rates 3to no greater than 50% of the average of monthly fixed charges 4for that customer class during the period January 1, 2019 to 5December 31, 2021. 6    (220 ILCS 5/16-111.10)7    Sec. 16-111.10. Equitable Energy Upgrade Program.8    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that Illinois 9homes and businesses can contribute to the creation of a clean 10energy economy, conservation of natural resources, and 11reliability of the electricity grid through the installation 12of cost-effective renewable energy generation, energy 13efficiency and demand response equipment, and energy storage 14systems. Further, a large portion of Illinois residents and 15businesses that would benefit from the installation of energy 16efficiency, storage, and renewable energy generation systems 17are unable to purchase systems due to capital or credit 18barriers. This State should pursue options to enable many more 19Illinoisans to access the health, environmental, and financial 20benefits of new clean energy technology.21    (b) As used in this Section:22    "Commission" means the Illinois Commerce Commission.23    "Energy project" means renewable energy generation 24systems, including solar projects, energy efficiency upgrades, 25decarbonization and electrification measures, energy storage   HB3650- 44 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1systems, demand response equipment, or any combination 2thereof.3    "Fund" means the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund 4established in the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund Act.5    "Program" means the Equitable Energy Upgrade Program 6established under subsection (c).7    "Utility" means electric public utilities providing 8services to 500,000 or more customers under this Act.9    (c) The Commission shall open an investigation into and 10direct all electric and gas public utilities in this State to 11adopt an Equitable Energy Upgrade Program that permits 12customers to finance the construction of energy projects 13through an optional tariff payable directly through their 14utility bill, modeled after the Pay As You Save system, 15developed by the Energy Efficiency Institute. The Program 16model shall enable utilities to offer to make investments in 17energy projects to customer properties with low-cost capital 18and use an opt-in tariff to recover the costs. The Program 19shall be designed to provide customers with immediate 20financial savings if they choose to participate. The Program 21shall allow residential electric and gas utility customers 22that own the property, or renters that have permission of the 23property owner, for which they subscribe to utility service to 24agree to the installation of an energy project. The Program 25shall ensure:26        (1) eligible projects do not require upfront payments;   HB3650- 45 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    however, customers may pay down the costs for projects 2    with a payment to the installing contractor in order to 3    qualify projects that would otherwise require upfront 4    payments;5        (2) eligible projects have sufficient estimated 6    savings and estimated life span to produce significant, 7    immediate net savings;8        (3) participants shall agree the utility can recover 9    its costs for the projects at their location by paying for 10    the project through an optional tariff directly through 11    the participant's utility electricity bill, allowing 12    participants to benefit from installation of energy 13    projects without traditional loans;14        (4) accessibility by lower-income residents and 15    environmental justice community residents; and16        (5) the utility must ensure that customers who are 17    interested in participating are notified that if they are 18    income qualified, they may also be eligible for the 19    Percentage of Income Payment Plan program and free energy 20    improvements through other programs and facilitate 21    interested customers' enrollment in those programs; and 22    provide contact information.23        (6) coordination with existing utility, state, and 24    federal energy efficiency, solar, electrification, and 25    other energy savings funding and implementation programs. 26    (d) The Commission shall establish Program guidelines with   HB3650- 46 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1the anticipated schedule of Program availability as follows:2        (1) Year 1: Beginning in the first year of operation, 3    each utility with greater than 100,000 retail customers is 4    required to obtain low-cost capital of at least 5    $20,000,000 annually for investments in energy projects.6        (2) Year 2: Beginning in the second year of operation, 7    each utility with greater than 100,000 retail customers is 8    required to obtain low-cost capital for investments in 9    energy projects of at least $40,000,000 annually.10        (3) Year 3: Beginning in the third year of operation, 11    each utility with greater than 100,000 retail customers is 12    required to obtain low-cost capital for investments in as 13    many systems as customers demand, subject to available 14    capital provided by the utility, State, or other lenders.15    (e) In the design of the Program, the Commission shall:16        (1) Within 90 days after the effective date of this 17    amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, begin a 18    process to update the Program guidelines for 19    implementation of the Program. Any such process shall 20    allow for participation from interested stakeholders. 21    Within 270 days after the effective date of this 22    amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, convene a 23    workshop during which interested participants may discuss 24    issues and submit comments related to the Program.25        (2) Establish Program guidelines for implementation of 26    the Program in accordance with the Pay As You Save   HB3650- 47 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Essential Elements and Minimum Program Requirements that 2    electric and gas utilities must abide by when implementing 3    the Program. Program guidelines established by the 4    Commission shall include the following elements:5            (A) The Commission shall establish conditions 6        under which utilities secure capital to fund the 7        energy projects. The Commission may allow utilities to 8        raise capital independently, work with third-party 9        lenders to secure the capital for participants, or a 10        combination thereof. Any process the Commission 11        approves must use a market mechanism to identify the 12        least costly sources of capital funds so as to pass on 13        maximum savings to participants. The State or the 14        Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund may also provide 15        capital for the Program.16            (B) Customer protection guidelines should be 17        designed consistent with Pay As You Save Essential 18        Elements and Minimum Program Requirements.19            (C) The Commission shall establish conditions by 20        which utilities may connect Program participants to 21        energy project vendors. In setting conditions for 22        connection, the Commission may prioritize vendors that 23        have a history of good relations with the State, 24        including vendors that have hired participants from 25        State-created job training programs.26            (D) Guarantee that conservative estimates of   HB3650- 48 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        financial savings will immediately and significantly 2        exceed estimated Program costs for Program 3        participants.4            (E) Require any customer data sharing between 5        electric and gas utilities and third-party vendors 6        needed to evaluate the energy and demand saving and 7        energy services revenue opportunities of all customers 8        and otherwise facilitate a positive customer 9        experience. Such data sharing may include but shall 10        not be limited to historical and ongoing customer 11        usage data and billing rates. The Commission may allow 12        utilities to recover the costs associated with data 13        sharing from all customers.14            (F) Notwithstanding the method used to estimate 15        site-specific energy savings or measure direct energy 16        savings for Program participants, the utility will 17        report aggregate savings to the Commission for 18        regulatory filings in the same or a similar manner as 19        other energy efficiency or clean energy programs. 20    (f) Within 90 120 days after the Commission releases the 21Program conditions established under this Section, each 22utility subject to the requirements of this Section shall 23submit an informational filing to the Commission that 24describes its plan for implementing the provisions of this 25Section. If the Commission finds that the submission does not 26properly comply with the statutory or regulatory requirements   HB3650- 49 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1of the Program, the Commission may require that the utility 2make modifications to its filing.3    (g) An independent process evaluation shall be conducted 4after one year of the Program's operation. An independent 5impact evaluation shall be conducted after 3 years of 6operation, excluding one-time startup costs and results from 7the first 12 months of the Program. The Commission shall 8convene an advisory council of stakeholders, including 9representation of low-income and environmental justice 10community members to make recommendations in response to the 11findings of the independent evaluation.12    (h) The Program shall be designed using the Pay As You Save 13system guidelines to be cost-effective for customers. Only 14projects that are deemed to be cost-effective and can be 15reasonably expected to ensure customer savings are eligible 16for funding through the Program, unless, as specified in 17paragraph (1) of subsection (c), customers able to make 18upfront copayments to installers buy down the cost of projects 19so it can be deemed cost-effective.20    (i) Eligible customers must be:21        (1) property renters with permission of the property 22    owner; or23        (2) property owners.24    (j) The calculation of project cost-effectiveness shall be 25based upon the Pay As You Save system requirements.26        (1) The calculation of cost-effectiveness must be   HB3650- 50 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    conducted by an objective process approved by the 2    Commission and based on rates in effect at the time of 3    installation.4        (2) A project shall be considered cost-effective only 5    if it is estimated to produce significant immediate net 6    savings, not counting copayments voluntarily made by 7    customers. The Commission may establish guidelines by 8    which this required savings is estimated.9        (3) Net savings shall include savings across all fuel 10    sources, not limited to electricity and natural gas.11        (4) The calculation of project cost-effectiveness 12    shall not exclude projects that:13            (A) would raise customer costs in a particular 14        month so long as customers see annual project savings; 15        or16            (B) increase electric load and accompanying costs 17        when a heating electrification project results in the 18        ability to cool part or all of a home that was not 19        previously cooled. In such cases, the increased 20        electricity consumption associated with that added 21        cooling shall not be included in calculations of net 22        savings. Extreme heat poses an increasing risk to 23        Illinois communities. As such, it is in the public 24        interest to mitigate that risk through the addition of 25        building cooling systems.26        However, any expected increase in electric load and   HB3650- 51 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    customer costs should be clearly communicated to impacted 2    customers, along with any options for mitigating that 3    increase. 4    (k) The Program should be modeled after the Pay As You Save 5system, by which Program participants finance energy projects 6using the savings that the energy project creates with a 7tariffed on-bill program. Eligible projects shall not create 8personal debt for the customer, result in a lien in the event 9of nonpayment, or require customers to pay monthly charges for 10any upgrade that fails and is not repaired within 21 days. The 11utility may restart charges once the upgrade is repaired and 12functioning and extend the term of payments to recover its 13costs for missed payments and deferred cost recovery, 14providing the upgrade continues to function. 15    (l) Any energy project that is defective or damaged due to 16no fault of the participant must be either replaced or 17repaired with parts that meet industry standards at the cost 18of the utility or vendor, as specified by the Commission, and 19charges shall be suspended until repairs or replacement is 20completed. The Commission may establish, increase, or replace 21the requirements imposed in this subsection. The Commission 22may determine that this responsibility is best handled by 23participating project vendors in the form of insurance, 24contractual guarantees, or other mechanisms, and issue rules 25detailing this requirement. Customers shall not be charged 26monthly payments for upgrades that are no longer functioning.   HB3650- 52 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    (m) In the event of nonpayment, the remaining balance due 2to pay off the system shall remain with the utility meter at an 3upgraded location. The Commission shall establish conditions 4subject to this constraint in the event of nonpayment that are 5in accordance with the Pay As You Save system.6    (n) The utility shall make every effort to ensure that 7customers who are income-qualified for free energy upgrade 8programs take full advantage of those programs first before 9using the Equitable Energy Upgrade Program. If the demand by 10utility customers exceeds the Program capital supply in a 11given year, utilities shall ensure that 50% of participants 12are:13        (1) customers in neighborhoods where a majority of 14    households make 150% or less of area median income; or15        (2) residents of environmental justice communities.16    (o) Utilities shall endeavor to inform customers about the 17availability of the Program, their potential eligibility for 18participation in the Program, and whether they are likely to 19save money on the basis of an estimate conducted using 20variables consistent with the Program that the utility has at 21its disposal. The Commission may establish guidelines by which 22utilities must abide by this directive and alternatives if the 23Commission deems utilities' efforts as inadequate.24    (p) Subject to Commission specifications under subsection 25(c), each utility shall work with certified project vendors 26selected using a request for proposals process to establish   HB3650- 53 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1the terms and processes under which a utility can install 2eligible renewable energy generation and energy storage 3systems using the capital to fit the Equitable Energy Upgrade 4model. The utility certified project vendor shall explain and 5offer the approved upgrades to customers and shall assist 6customers in applying for financing through the Program. As 7part of the process, utilities vendors shall also provide 8participants with information about any other relevant 9incentives that may be available and customer service 10regarding the effective use of the upgrades.11    Nothing shall preclude gas and electric utilities that 12have overlapping service territories from jointly implementing 13and delivering the Program. 14    (q) A participating An electric utility shall recover all 15of the prudently incurred costs of offering a program approved 16by the Commission under this Section. For investor-owned 17utilities, shareholder incentives will be proportional to 18meeting Commission approved thresholds for the number of 19customers served and the amount of its investments in those 20locations.21    (r) The Commission shall adopt all rules necessary for the 22administration of this Section. 23(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21.) 24    (220 ILCS 5/Art.

XXIV heading new)9ARTICLE XXIV. 2050 HEAT DECARBONIZATION STANDARD 10    (220 ILCS 5/24-101 new)11    Sec. 24-101. Legislative policy. To provide the highest 12quality of life for the residents of this State and to provide 13for a clean and healthy environment, it is the policy of this 14State that natural gas utilities, otherwise referred to as 15"obligated parties", shall transition to 100% zero emissions 16by 2050. Under the heat decarbonization standard, each gas 17utility has an annual obligation, beginning in 2030, to reduce 18the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion of 19the fuels it delivers to its customers. The emission reduction 20obligation for 2030 shall be 20% relative to each utility's 212020 greenhouse gas emissions levels on a weather-normalized 22basis. The emission reduction obligation shall grow by 4 23percentage points per year every year thereafter, such that 24the annual emission reduction requirement will reach 24% in   HB3650- 71 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b12031, 28% in 2032, 32% in 2033, 36% in 2034, 40% by 2035, 44% 2by 2036, 48% by 2037, 52% by 2038, 56% by 2039, 60% by 2040, 364% by 2041, 68% by 2042, 72% by 2043, 76% by 2044, 80% by 42045, 84% by 2046, 88% by 2047, 92% by 2048, 96% by 2049, and 5100% by 2050. This obligation shall be referred to as the "heat 6decarbonization standard". The heat decarbonization standard 7must be met by the lowest societal cost combination of supply 8and demand-side resources. References in this Article to "this 9Act" means this Article. 10    (220 ILCS 5/24-102 new)11    Sec. 24-102. Options for compliance.12    (a) Obligated parties must demonstrate compliance with the 13heat decarbonization standard using a combination of:14        (1) emission reductions achieved from the obligated 15    parties' own customers; and 16        (2) clean heat credits purchased from other gas 17    utilities that are also obligated parties in this State. 18    (b) Prior to 2035, at least 70% of each obligated party's 19emission reduction obligation must be met through emission 20reductions achieved from its own customers, with no more than 2130% of the emission reduction obligation in any year met 22through the purchase of clean heat credits. From 2035 through 232040, at least 80% of each obligated party's emission 24reduction requirement must be met through emission reductions 25from its own customers, with no more than 20% met through the   HB3650- 72 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1purchase of clean heat credits. After 2040, at least 90% of 2each obligated party's emission reduction requirement must be 3met through emission reductions achieved from its own 4customers, with no more than 10% met through the purchase of 5clean heat credits.  6    (220 ILCS 5/24-103 new)7    Sec. 24-103. Measures for customer emission reduction. 8Emissions must be achieved through improvements in customers' 9energy conservation practices, improvements in customers' 10end-use efficiency, full or partial electrification of any end 11use, or switching from fossil methane to lower-emitting liquid 12or gaseous fuels that are delivered by the obligated party and 13directly consumed by end-use customers at the customers' homes 14or businesses. Lower-emitting liquid or gaseous fuels may 15include biomethane, but lower-emitting liquid or gaseous fuels 16may not include hydrogen except for industrial applications. 17For emission reductions from lower-emitting liquid or gaseous 18fuels to be counted toward an obligated party's emission 19reduction obligation, the obligated party must both acquire 20the lower-emitting fuel, including its environmental 21attributes, and demonstrate a contractual pathway for the 22physical delivery of the fuel from the point of injection into 23a pipeline to the obligated party's delivery system. Gas 24utilities may not use reductions in emissions from sources 25unrelated to combustion of fossil gas at customers' homes and   HB3650- 73 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1businesses in this State as emissions offsets or alternatives 2to reductions in the customers' own emissions.3    Obligated parties must meet the heat decarbonization 4standard with the lowest societal cost combination of 5resources, where societal cost includes infrastructure costs, 6utility return on capital, the social cost of greenhouse gas 7emissions and leakage, and the cost of health impacts 8attributable to pollution from a given measure.  9    (220 ILCS 5/24-104 new)10    Sec. 24-104. Demonstrating customer emission reductions.11    (a) Each obligated party's emissions in each year shall be 12calculated as:13        (1) a weather-normalized estimate of emissions from 14    the actual amount of fossil methane consumed by its 15    customers in the year, plus; 16        (2) a weather-normalized estimate of emissions from 17    the leakage of methane, hydrogen, or other greenhouse 18    gases from front or behind-the-meter sources in a given 19    year, plus; 20        (3) a weather-normalized estimate of the magnitude of 21    remaining emissions resulting from switching from fossil 22    methane to lower-emitting liquid or gaseous fuels that are 23    delivered by the obligated party and directly consumed by 24    customers at the customers' homes or businesses in the 25    year. The magnitude of remaining emissions resulting from   HB3650- 74 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    switching from fossil methane to lower-emitting liquid or 2    gaseous fuels shall be calculated as (i) the magnitude of 3    emissions that would have occurred had fossil methane 4    continued to be consumed, multiplied by (ii) one minus the 5    percent reduction in life cycle emissions resulting from 6    the fuel substitution. Life cycle emission calculations 7    shall account for emissions associated with the entire 8    pathway of a fuel, including extraction, production, 9    transportation, distribution, and combustion of the fuel 10    by the consumer. 11    (b) Obligated parties shall calculate these figures 12annually, and electronically submit the figures in an easily 13accessible digital format, such as .PDF, .DOCX, or XLSX, to 14the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commission, the 15Governor, and the General Assembly. 16    (c) The Environmental Protection Agency shall post these 17figures for each utility on a website readily accessible to 18the public, within 30 days of obligated parties submitting the 19figures to the Agency, and shall maintain all previous years' 20records for similar public access. 21    (d) The Environmental Protection Agency shall also assess 22the emissions figures submitted by obligated parties to assess 23those parties' compliance or lack thereof with the heat 24decarbonization standard. If an obligated party does not 25comply, the obligated party shall be subject to enforcement 26mechanisms described in Section 24-108.    HB3650- 75 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    (220 ILCS 5/24-105 new)2    Sec. 24-105. Tradable clean heat credits. A tradable clean 3heat credit is a tradable, intangible commodity that 4represents an amount of greenhouse gas reduction, measured in 5tons of CO2, achieved by a gas utility from its customers in 6this State. An obligated party must achieve excess emission 7reductions, over and above its annual obligation, to sell 8tradable clean heat credits to another obligated party. The 9number of tradable clean heat credits sold by an obligated 10party in any year may not exceed the magnitude of the obligated 11party's excess emission reductions in that year. 12    (220 ILCS 5/24-106 new)13    Sec. 24-106. Banking of emission reductions. An obligated 14party that achieves emission reductions in a given year that 15are in excess of its emission reduction obligation in that 16year may, in lieu of selling them to another obligated party, 17bank them. Emission reductions that are banked in a given year 18may be used to comply with emission reduction obligations in 19any of the following 3 years. Excess emission reductions may 20not be banked for more than 3 years or used as part of an 21obligated party's annual compliance more than 3 years after 22they were generated. No obligated party may achieve more than 2320% of any annual emission reduction obligation using banked 24emission reductions.   HB3650- 76 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    (220 ILCS 5/24-107 new)2    Sec. 24-107. Equity in emission reductions. 3    (a) As used in this Section:4    "Equity investment eligible communities" has the meaning 5given to that term in the Energy Transition Act.6    "Income-qualified households" means those households whose 7annual incomes are at or below 80% of the area median income.8    (b) Each obligated party must achieve real emission 9reductions from income-qualified households and environmental 10justice communities that are at least 5 percentage points 11greater than a proportional percentage of the annual gas 12consumption of such customers multiplied by each obligated 13party's annual emissions reduction requirements. At least half 14of the emission reductions from equity investment eligible 15communities shall be from measures that require capital 16investments in homes, have expected lives of at least 10 17years, and are estimated to lower annual energy bills. 18Emission reductions in equity investment eligible communities 19shall include codelivery and coordinated implementation of all 20relevant programs, measures, and complementary services. This 21includes, but is not limited to, pairing high efficiency 22electrification measures and programs with energy efficiency, 23building envelope improvements, the Illinois Solar for All 24Program, energy assistance, health and safety improvements, 25and federal incentives targeted to disadvantaged communities.   HB3650- 77 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1Emission reductions from income-qualified and environmental 2justice communities, including efforts to codeliver and 3coordinate other programs and services, shall be reported on 4at least annually to the Commission. Tradable clean heat 5credits cannot be used to fulfill this requirement. 6    (220 ILCS 5/24-108 new)7    Sec. 24-108. Enforcement.8    (a) The Commission shall order an obligated party that 9fails to achieve its emission reduction obligation in a given 10year, including required amounts from income-qualified 11customers and front-line communities, to make a noncompliance 12payment. The noncompliance payment shall be equal to 3 times 13the estimated cost per unit of emission reduction incurred by 14all obligated parties in the State for the emission reductions 15the obligated parties achieved in the prior year.16    (b) The Commission may waive the noncompliance payment if: 17        (1) it finds that the obligated party made a good 18    faith effort to achieve the required amount of emission 19    reduction and its failure to achieve the required 20    reduction resulted from market factors beyond its control, 21    that could not have reasonably been anticipated, and for 22    which the obligated party could not have planned; and 23        (2) it directs the obligated party to add the 24    difference between its obligated level of emission 25    reduction and actual emission reduction achieved to its   HB3650- 78 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    required emission reduction amount in subsequent years, 2    with the shortfall being made up in no more than 3 years. 3    (c) Payments received pursuant to the noncompliance 4penalty shall be directed to the Commission. 5    (d) The Commission shall use any noncompliance payments to 6contract with an independent third party to achieve emission 7reductions in the service territory of the noncomplying 8utility. The Commission shall prioritize achieving such 9reductions from weatherization or electrification of 10income-qualified households, to the extent that such 11reductions would lower annual energy bills.  12    (220 ILCS 5/24-109 new)13    Sec. 24-109. 2050 Heat Decarbonization Pathways Study.14    (a) In order to ensure sufficient planning for achieving 15this goal, the Commission shall complete a 2050 Heat 16Decarbonization Pathways Study by June 1, 2025, to examine 17feasible and practical pathways for investor-owned natural gas 18utilities to achieve the State's decarbonization requirement 19to be net zero by 2050, and the impacts of decarbonization on 20customers and the electric and natural gas utilities that 21serve the customers.22    (b) The Commission shall host the study in collaboration 23with a technical working group whose members are appointed by 24the Governor and a consultant selected by the technical 25working group.

Gas infrastructure planning.20    (a) This Article creates the Office of Decarbonization 21Planning within the Commission to manage an iterative 22statewide heat decarbonization plan located within the 23Commission. On a timeline concurrent with the 2050 Heat 24Decarbonization Pathways Study, the Office of Decarbonization 25Planning shall adopt rules for implementing the heat   HB3650- 83 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1decarbonization plans.2    (b) As used in this Section:3    "Environmental justice communities" has the meaning given 4to that term in the Illinois Power Agency Act. 5    "Lowest reasonable cost" means the least-cost, least-risk 6mix of demand-side, supply-side, and electrification resources 7determined through a detailed and consistent analysis of a 8wide range of commercially available sources. At a minimum, 9this analysis must consider resource costs, resource 10availability, market-volatility risks, the risks imposed on 11ratepayers, resource effect on system operations, public 12policies regarding resource preferences, the cost of risks 13associated with environmental effects, including emissions of 14carbon dioxide, the ability to scale to meet 2050 goals, air 15pollution and resulting public health impacts, equity impacts, 16and the need for security of supply.17    "Planned project" means any programmatic expense or 18related group of programmatic expenses with a defined scope of 19work and associated cost estimate that exceeds $1,000,000 in 202020 dollars or $500,000 in 2020 dollars for gas utilities 21with less than 50,000 full service customers, as adjusted 22annually for inflation.23    "Resources" means both demand-side and supply-side 24resources, including, but not limited to, natural gas, 25biomethane, green hydrogen for industrial application, 26conservation, energy efficiency, demand response, and   HB3650- 84 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1electrification.2    (c) Each natural gas utility regulated by the Commission 3has the responsibility to meet system demand and public policy 4requirements, including the State's heat decarbonization 5standard, with the lowest reasonable cost and most feasible 6mix of resources. In furtherance of that responsibility, each 7natural gas utility must develop a gas infrastructure plan for 8meeting the utility's heat decarbonization standard, including 95-year interim milestones from 2025 until 2050. The gas 10infrastructure plan must take into account the findings of the 112050 Heat Decarbonization Pathways Study. 12    (d) Natural gas utilities shall file biennial gas 13infrastructure plans that create alignment between gas utility 14distribution system investments and the utility's heat 15decarbonization standard obligations at lowest reasonable cost 16and that consider nonpipeline infrastructure projects that 17minimize costs over the long term. 18    (e) Before the filing of each biennial gas infrastructure 19plan, the Office of Decarbonization Planning shall contract 20for gas demand forecasts for each regulated gas utility in the 21State from an independent party. Gas utilities must reasonably 22provide accurate and timely system data to the independent 23contractor selected to conduct the forecasts. For each 24regulated gas utility in the State, the third party must 25produce forecasts for each customer class that consider slow, 26medium, and rapid acceleration of residential, commercial, and   HB3650- 85 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1industrial electrification of the end uses that rely upon the 2direct combustion of natural gas in buildings. The forecasts 3must include, to the extent possible, the effects of updated 4State and local building codes, changes to the number of gas 5utility customers, consumer responses to building 6electrification programs or incentives offered within a gas 7utility's service territory, the price elasticity of gas 8demand if rates increase due to reduced gas throughput and the 9impacts of commodity prices, and any other criteria as 10stipulated by the Commission. The forecasts shall be due to 11the Commission and the gas utilities at least 8 months prior to 12the filing of a gas infrastructure plan. 13    (f) A gas infrastructure plan must: 14        (1) cover the 20 years immediately following the 15    approval of the plan with a 5-year action plan of 16    investments; 17        (2) provide the estimated total cost and annual 18    incremental revenue requirements of the proposed action 19    plan, assuming both conventional depreciation and 20    accelerated depreciation, as applicable; 21        (3) use the various gas demand forecasts provided to 22    it under this article and include a range of possible 23    future scenarios and input sensitivities for the purpose 24    of testing the robustness of the utility's portfolio of 25    planned projects under various parameters; 26        (4) take into account the findings of the 2050 Heat   HB3650- 86 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Decarbonization Pathways Study; 2        (5) demonstrate that the utility's infrastructure 3    investment plans align with obligations under the heat 4    decarbonization standard; 5        (6) include a list of all proposed system expenditures 6    and investments, including an analysis of infrastructure 7    needs and detailed information on all planned projects 8    within the action plan; 9        (7) include the results of nonpipeline alternative 10    analyses conducted for all planned projects not necessary 11    to mitigate a near-term safety or reliability risk subject 12    to rules by the Commission that include, but are not 13    limited to: 14            (A) a consideration of both supply and demand-side 15        alternatives to traditional capital investments, 16        including gas demand response and electrification; and 17            (B) a cost-benefit analysis of the various options 18        that consider non-energy benefits and the societal 19        value, including health benefits, of reduced carbon 20        emissions and surface-level pollutants, particularly 21        in equity investment eligible communities; 22        (8) minimize rate impacts on customers, particularly 23    low-income households and households within equity 24    investment eligible communities; 25        (9) describe the methodology, criteria, and 26    assumptions used to develop the plan;   HB3650- 87 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        (10) include one or more system maps indicating 2    locations of individual planned projects, pressure 3    districts served by the individual project, locations of 4    equity investment eligible communities, and any other 5    information as required by the Commission; 6        (11) provide a summary of stakeholder participation 7    and input from a public stakeholder process, and an 8    explanation of how input was incorporated into the plan, 9    including for all projects located within equity 10    investment eligible communities, a description of its 11    outreach to members of that community and findings from 12    those efforts; and 13        (12) requires the utility, to the extent that the 14    utility assumes the use of alternative fuels, such as 15    biomethane or green hydrogen, to meet its obligations 16    under the heat decarbonization standard, to demonstrate a 17    plan to procure firm supply and cost-effectiveness as 18    compared to nonfuel alternatives, inclusive of the costs 19    to retrofit all public and private infrastructure to 20    accommodate the fuels; green hydrogen may only be used for 21    industrial applications; hydrogen blending with methane 22    shall not be part of decarbonization plans. 23    (g) Not later than 12 months before the due date of a plan, 24the utility must provide a work plan for the Commission to 25review. The work plan must outline the content of the resource 26plan to be developed by the utility, the method for assessing   HB3650- 88 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1potential resources, and the timing and extent of public 2participation. In addition, the Commission will hear comments 3on the plan at a minimum of 3 public hearings, held at times 4and locations accessible and convenient to most people, 5including at least one in an equity investment eligible 6community, which are scheduled after the utility submits its 7plan for Commission review. 8    (h) No later than July 1, 2025, gas utilities in this State 9must file the first gas infrastructure plan application for 10approval. The Commission may approve, deny, or require 11modifications to the plan. Once approved, the plan must be 12incorporated into the utility's next general rate case using 13the approved ratemaking treatments. Deviations based on 14unforeseen circumstances must be justified and approved by the 15Commission. 16    (i) The Commission shall adopt new rules, amend existing 17rules, as necessary, and dedicate sufficient resources to 18implement this Section.  19    (220 ILCS 5/24-111 new)20    Sec. 24-111. Study on gas utility financial incentive 21reform.22    (a) The General Assembly finds that:23        (1) Improving the alignment of gas utility customer 24    interests, State policy, and company interests is critical 25    to ensuring the expected decline in the use of natural gas   HB3650- 89 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    is done efficiently, safely, cost-effectively, and 2    transparently.3        (2) There is urgency around addressing increasing 4    threats from climate change and assisting communities that 5    have borne disproportionate impacts from climate change, 6    including air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and 7    energy burdens. Addressing this problem requires changes 8    to the energy used to power homes and businesses, and 9    changes to the gas utility business model under which 10    utilities in the State have traditionally functioned.11        (3) Gas utility ratepayers may face upwardly spiraling 12    bills if steps are not taken to contain costs and 13    strategically prune parts of the gas distribution network.14        (4) There is a need to encourage gas utilities to 15    innovate and find new lines of business to maintain 16    financial health as their main business, the provision of 17    fossil natural gas, winds down.18        (5) The current regulatory framework has encouraged 19    infrastructure programs that have been plagued by 20    excessive cost overruns and delays.21        (6) Discussions of performance incentive mechanisms 22    must always take into account the affordability of 23    customer rates and bills via stakeholder input.24    The General Assembly, therefore, directs the Commission to 25reform the gas utility financial incentives structure to 26further specified goals and objectives related to the   HB3650- 90 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1provision of clean, affordable heat and the advancement of an 2equitable distribution of benefits and reduction in harms in 3equity investment eligible communities and economically 4disadvantaged communities.5    (b) The Commission shall open an investigation to consider 6performance-based ratemaking tools and other financial 7mechanisms to advance the goals of affordability, equity, 8pollution reduction, energy system flexibility and 9electrification, reliability, safety, customer experience, 10cost-effectiveness, and the financial health of gas utilities 11as the gas utilities scale down their core business of 12delivering fuel-based energy through the distribution network. 13The investigation shall consider the following mechanisms, in 14addition to any others that the Commission or stakeholders 15deem necessary:16        (1) accelerated and shortened depreciation schedules;17        (2) performance metrics and benchmarking;18        (3) revenue decoupling;19        (4) cost-recovery options for nonpipeline 20    alternatives;21        (5) electrification;22        (6) networked geothermal systems;23        (7) securitization;24        (8) fuel-cost sharing;25        (9) multiyear rate plans;26        (10) performance incentive mechanisms;  HB3650- 91 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        (11) the equalization of capital and operational 2    expenditures;3        (12) return on equity levels for different investment 4    types;5        (13) rate designs at the electric and gas nexus;6        (14) low-income rates;7        (15) luxury gas rates; and8        (16) intersectoral cost recovery.9    (c) The Commission must create a framework to evaluate 10each mechanism on its own and as part of a set of mechanisms to 11achieve the policy objectives determined by the General 12Assembly, stakeholders, and the general public after a minimum 13of 3 public hearings held at times and locations accessible 14and convenient to most people, including at least one in an 15equity investment eligible community.16    (d) The investigation shall consist of a series of 17workshops facilitated by an independent consultant that 18encourages representation from diverse stakeholders, ensures 19equitable opportunities for participation, and does not 20require formal intervention or representation by an attorney.21    (e) Any recommendations at the conclusion of the process 22must be shared with the General Assembly, and those 23recommendations already within the Commission's existing 24authorities must be adopted in the next applicable general 25rate case or relevant filing.   HB3650- 92 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    (220 ILCS 5/24-112 new)2    Sec. 24-112. Reporting requirements.3    (a) Each gas utility in the State must report data to the 4Commission in January and July of each year that satisfy 5metrics that are set by the Commission to assess, on a system, 6segment, and neighborhood basis, the level of system safety 7and risk. The metrics must include, but are not limited to, the 8following:9        (1) the overall average leak rate of replaced and 10    to-be-replaced mains and leak-prone pipes;11        (2) the overall average leak rate using only 12    leak-prone pipe and current leaks;13        (3) the neighborhood average leak rate using only 14    remaining leak-prone pipes and current leaks; and15        (4) the neighborhood historic average leak rate using 16    leaks on leak-prone pipes for the past 2 years, on a 17    rolling basis, normalized for weather, and incorporating 18    all class 2 leaks except third-party damage.19    (b) Gas utilities must include in the report an assessment 20of whether the actions taken in the prior 3 years produced the 21best value, in terms of risk reduction, for the amounts 22expended and a prediction of how planned projects will change 23risk levels on a neighborhood, segment, and system basis. The 24report filed by Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company must also 25include updates on steps taken to implement the 26recommendations of the Final Report on Phase One of an   HB3650- 93 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1Investigation of Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company's AMRP. 2The Commission may require any other gas utility to adopt new 3and revised practices and processes by Peoples Gas Light and 4Coke Company to ensure consistency across utilities.5    (c) In its review of the data and metrics provided, the 6Commission may order adjustments in infrastructure replacement 7plans as it deems necessary to meet an acceptable level of risk 8at appropriate cost. 9    (220 ILCS 5/Art.

The Public Utilities Act is amended by 21changing Sections 1-102, 8-101, 9-229, 9-241, and 16-111.10 22and by adding Sections 1-103, 3-128, 8-104B, 9-228.5, 9-235, 239-254, and 9-255, and Articles XXIII, XXIV, and XXV as 24follows:   HB3650- 4 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    (220 ILCS 5/1-102)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 1-102)2    Sec. 1-102. Findings and Intent. The General Assembly 3finds that the health, welfare, and prosperity of all Illinois 4citizens require the provision of adequate, efficient, 5reliable, affordable, environmentally safe, and least-cost 6public utility services at prices which accurately reflect the 7long-term cost of such services and which are equitable to all 8citizens. It is therefore declared to be the policy of the 9State that public utilities shall continue to be regulated 10effectively and comprehensively. It is further declared that 11the goals and objectives of such regulation shall be to 12ensure: 13        (a) Efficiency: the provision of reliable and 14    affordable energy services that meet the State's climate 15    and emissions reduction targets at the lowest societal 16    least possible cost to the citizens of the State; in such 17    manner that: 18            (i) physical, human, and financial resources are 19        allocated efficiently and equitably; 20            (ii) all supply and demand options are considered 21        and evaluated using comparable terms and methods in 22        order to determine how utilities shall meet State 23        emissions reduction targets and their customers' 24        demands for public utility services at the lowest 25        societal least cost; 26            (iii) utilities are allowed a sufficient return on   HB3650- 5 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        investment so as to enable them to attract capital in 2        financial markets at competitive rates; 3            (iv) tariff rates for the sale of various public 4        utility services are authorized such that they 5        accurately reflect the cost of delivering those 6        services and allow utilities to recover the total 7        costs prudently and reasonably incurred; 8            (v) variation in costs by customer class and time 9        of use is taken into consideration in authorizing 10        rates for each class. 11        (b) Environmental Quality: the protection of the 12    environment, people, and communities from the adverse 13    external costs of public utility services, including 14    environmental costs, so that: 15            (i) environmental costs of proposed actions having 16        a significant impact on the environment and the 17        environmental impact of the alternatives are 18        identified, documented, monetized, included in 19        assessments of cost, and considered in all aspects of 20        the regulatory process; 21            (ii) the prudently and reasonably incurred costs 22        of environmental controls are recovered. 23        (c) Reliability: the ability of utilities to provide 24    consumers with public utility services under varying 25    demand conditions in such manner that suppliers of public 26    utility services are able to provide service at varying   HB3650- 6 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    levels of economic reliability giving appropriate 2    consideration to the costs likely to be incurred as a 3    result of service interruptions, and to the costs of 4    increasing or maintaining current levels of reliability 5    consistent with commitments to consumers. 6        (d) Equity: the fair treatment of consumers, including 7    equity investment eligible persons and equity investment 8    eligible communities, as defined in the Energy Transition 9    Act, and investors in order that 10            (i) the public health, safety, and welfare shall 11        be protected; 12            (ii) the application of rates is based on public 13        understandability and acceptance of the reasonableness 14        of the rate structure and level; 15            (iii) the cost of supplying public utility 16        services is allocated to those who cause the costs to 17        be incurred; 18            (iv) if factors other than cost of service are 19        considered in regulatory decisions, the rationale for 20        these actions is set forth; 21            (v) regulation allows for orderly transition 22        periods to accommodate changes in public utility 23        service markets; 24            (vi) regulation does not result in undue or 25        sustained adverse impact on utility earnings; 26            (vii) the impacts of regulatory actions on all   HB3650- 7 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        sectors of the State are carefully weighed; 2            (viii) the rates for utility services are 3        affordable and, therefore, ensure and preserve the 4        availability and accessibility of such services to all 5        customers, and customers are not energy burdened or 6        severely energy burdened citizens.7        As used in this subsection (d): 8            (I) "Energy burdened" means, with respect to a 9        customer's household, that the household pays 6% or 10        more of its income toward electricity and gas bills.11            (II) "Severely energy burdened" means, with 12        respect to a customer's household, that the household 13        pays 10% or more of its income toward electricity and 14        gas bills. 15        (e) Affordability: the ability of utilities to ensure 16    uninterrupted access to essential utility service; to 17    minimize and reduce over time the number of households who 18    are energy burdened and severely energy burdened, as 19    defined in this Act, ideally to zero; and to minimize 20    disconnections to residential customers in a manner which 21    ensures that:22            (i) all low-income customers, defined as those 23        whose income is less than or equal to 80% of the area 24        median income, as defined by the United States 25        Department of Housing and Urban Development, have 26        access to a discounted utility rate;  HB3650- 8 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1            (ii) low-income customers 65 years of age or older 2        are not disconnected from essential utility service 3        due to inability to afford the monthly bill;4            (iii) low-income customers with children under the 5        age of 6 are not disconnected from essential utility 6        service due to inability to afford the monthly bill;7            (iv) persons with medical conditions are not 8        disconnected from essential utility service if a 9        medical or qualified professional as described in 10        subsection (b) of Section 8-202.7 certifies that the 11        condition will be exacerbated by disconnection from 12        essential utility service;13            (v) disconnection of essential utility service is 14        not accelerated based on a utility's payment risk 15        assessment of a customer; and16            (vi) a utility assesses whether a customer may be 17        eligible for energy assistance programs under the 18        Energy Assistance Act, provides the customer with 19        specific information on where and how to obtain energy 20        assistance, and ceases disconnection activity for 60 21        days to allow the customer to apply for and establish 22        eligibility for the energy assistance. 23    It is further declared to be the policy of the State that 24this Act shall not apply in relation to motor carriers and rail 25carriers as defined in the Illinois Commercial Transportation 26Law, or to the Commission in the regulation of such carriers.  HB3650- 9 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to limit, restrict, 2or mitigate in any way the power and authority of the State's 3Attorneys or the Attorney General under the Consumer Fraud and 4Deceptive Business Practices Act.5(Source: P.A. 92-22, eff. 6-30-01.) 6    (220 ILCS 5/1-103 new)7    Sec. 1-103. Commission methodologies and metrics. The 8Commission shall oversee the objectives identified in Section 91-102 by establishing and implementing methodologies for 10tracking each of the following metrics:11        (1) Environmental costs: The Commission shall 12    establish a social cost of greenhouse gases, measured in 13    dollars per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, that shall 14    serve as a monetary estimate of the value of not emitting a 15    ton of greenhouse gas emissions. The Commission shall 16    consider prior or existing estimates of the social cost of 17    carbon issued or adopted by the federal government, 18    appropriate international bodies, or other appropriate and 19    reputable scientific organizations. The social cost of 20    greenhouse gases shall: 21            (A) estimate the emissions for all relevant 22        greenhouse gases, including carbon, methane, nitrous 23        oxide, hydrofluorocarbons and hydrofluoroolefins, 24        perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and nitrogen 25        trifluoride;   HB3650- 10 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1            (B) consider the fullest geographic and temporal 2        scope of damages; 3            (C) for the purposes of this Act, the cost of 4        greenhouse gas emissions is no less than the cost per 5        metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, 6        using the 2.5% discount rate, listed in Table ES-1 of 7        "Technical Support Document: Social Cost of Carbon, 8        Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under 9        Executive Order 13990", a report prepared in support 10        of federal Executive Order 13990 and dated February 11        2021.12        The Commission must annually adjust the costs 13    established in this Section to reflect the effect of 14    inflation and may, at its discretion, set the price at a 15    higher level than described above, but no lower. 16        (2) Impacts to public health: The Commission shall 17    develop a methodology for measuring and monetizing in cost 18    assessments the public health impacts of pollutants, 19    including impacts of both indoor and outdoor air quality, 20    including carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, nitrogen 21    oxides, including nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, 22    formaldehyde, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and lead. The 23    Commission shall integrate its methodology into 24    assessments of utility system planning and supply and 25    demand-side resource selection. 26    It is further declared to be the policy of the State that   HB3650- 11 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1this Section does not apply to motor carriers and rail 2carriers as defined in the Illinois Commercial Transportation 3Law or to the Commission in the regulation of such carriers. 4    Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit, 5restrict, or mitigate in any way the power and authority of the 6State's Attorneys or the Attorney General under the Consumer 7Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.  8    (220 ILCS 5/3-128 new)9    Sec. 3-128. Fixed charge. "Fixed charge" means a charge 10that is assessed by a public utility as part of its rates, is 11equal across all customers or customers of a certain class, 12and is not directly proportional to a customer's usage. 13    (220 ILCS 5/8-101)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 8-101)14    Sec. 8-101. Duties of public utilities; nondiscrimination. 15A public utility shall furnish, provide, and maintain such 16service instrumentalities, equipment, and facilities as shall 17promote the safety, health, comfort, and convenience of its 18patrons, employees, and public and as shall be in all respects 19adequate, efficient, just, and reasonable.20    All rules and regulations made by a public utility 21affecting or pertaining to its charges or service to the 22public shall be just and reasonable.23    An electric A public utility shall, and a gas utility may, 24upon reasonable notice, furnish to all persons who may apply   HB3650- 12 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1therefor and be reasonably entitled thereto, suitable 2facilities and service, without discrimination and without 3delay. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a gas 4utility may cease providing service if the Commission 5determines that adequate substitute service is available at a 6reasonable cost to support the existing end uses of the 7affected utility customers. Any applicant for gas service 8shall receive clear, timely information from the gas utility, 9written in plain language, and approved by the Commission 10after stakeholder input on incentives and opportunities for 11installing, as alternatives to gas, energy-efficient electric 12technologies and incentives and opportunities for other energy 13efficiency measures, weatherization, demand management, and 14distributed energy resource programs. The information provided 15must include, among other things, information detailing 16electrification incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act and 17describing how the applicant can elect to receive the upfront 18discounts or tax incentives applicable to the applicant's 19electric purchases. 20    Nothing in this Section shall be construed to prevent a 21public utility from accepting payment electronically or by the 22use of a customer-preferred financially accredited credit or 23debit methodology.24(Source: P.A. 92-22, eff. 6-30-01.) 25    (220 ILCS 5/8-104B new)  HB3650- 13 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Sec. 8-104B. Gas energy efficiency.2    (a) As used in this Section:3    "Benefit-cost ratio" means the ratio of the net present 4value of the total benefits of the measures to the net present 5value of the total costs as calculated over the lifetime of the 6measures. 7    "Cost-effective measure" means a measure that satisfies 8the total resource cost test.9    "Energy efficiency measure" means a measure that reduces 10(i) the total Btus of electricity and natural gas and other 11utility-delivered gaseous fuels needed to meet an end use or 12end uses and (ii) the amount of natural gas and other 13utility-delivered gaseous fuels consumed on site, at the home 14or business facility, to meet an end use or end uses.15    "Total resource cost test" means a standard that is met 16if, for an investment in an energy efficiency measure, the 17benefit-cost ratio is greater than one. The total resource 18cost test quantifies the net savings obtained through the 19substitution of demand-side measures for supply resources by 20comparing (i) the sum of avoided natural gas utility costs, 21representing the benefits that accrue to the natural gas 22system and the participant in the delivery of those energy 23efficiency measures and including avoided costs associated 24with the use of electricity or other fuels, avoided costs 25associated with reduced water consumption, and avoided 26operation and maintenance costs, as well as other quantifiable   HB3650- 14 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1societal benefits and (ii) the sum of all incremental costs of 2end-use measures, including both utility and participant 3contribution costs to administer, deliver, and evaluate each 4demand-side measure. In calculating avoided costs, reasonable 5estimates shall be included for financial costs likely to be 6imposed by future regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases. 7In discounting future societal costs and benefits for the 8purpose of calculating net present values, a societal discount 9rate based on actual, long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields 10shall be used. The income-qualified measures described in 11paragraphs (5) and (6) of subsection (d) shall not be required 12to meet the total resource cost test.13    (b) It is the policy of the State for gas utilities to be 14required to use cost-effective energy efficiency measures to 15reduce delivery load. Requiring investment in cost-effective 16energy efficiency measures will reduce direct and indirect 17costs to consumers by decreasing environmental impacts, 18reducing the amount of natural gas and other utility-delivered 19gaseous fuels that need to be purchased, and avoiding or 20delaying the need for new transmission, distribution, storage, 21and other related infrastructure. Moreover, the public 22interest is served by allowing gas utilities to recover costs 23for reasonably and prudently incurred expenditures for energy 24efficiency measures. 25    (c) This Section applies to all gas distribution utilities 26in the State and supersedes Section 8-104 beginning January 1,   HB3650- 15 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b12024. 2    (d) Natural gas utilities shall implement cost-effective 3energy efficiency measures to achieve all of the following 4requirements: 5        (1) Total incremental annual savings shall be equal to 6    at least 0.6% of annual sales to distribution customers in 7    2025, 0.8% of such sales in 2026, and at least 1% of such 8    sales in 2027 and each subsequent year. For the purpose of 9    calculating savings as a percent of sales to distribution 10    customers for a given program year, the denominator of 11    sales to distribution customers shall be annual average 12    sales over the second, third, and fourth full calendar 13    years prior to the beginning of the program year. 14        (2) The savings achieved must have an average life of 15    at least 12 years. 16        (3) Savings may not be applied toward achievement of 17    utility savings goals if the savings arise from the 18    installation of efficient new gas furnaces, gas boilers, 19    gas water heaters, or other gas-consuming equipment in a 20    residential building, such as a single-family, 21    individually metered multifamily building or a 22    master-metered multifamily building. 23        (4) At least 50% of the entire budget for efficiency 24    programs shall be spent on energy efficiency measures that 25    reduce space heating needs through improvements to the 26    efficiency of building envelopes, including, but not   HB3650- 16 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    limited to, insulation measures and efficient windows and 2    energy efficiency measures that reduce air leakage through 3    improvements to systems for distributing heat, including, 4    but not limited to, duct leakage reduction, duct 5    insulation, or pipe insulation in buildings or through 6    improved heating systems controls, including, but not 7    limited to, advanced thermostats and demand control 8    ventilation. Spending on efficient furnaces, efficient 9    boilers, or other efficient heating systems is permitted 10    within business efficiency programs but does not count 11    toward this minimum requirement for spending on building 12    envelope, heating distribution, and control efficiencies. 13    Spending on income-qualified building envelope measures, 14    heating distribution system measures, and heating controls 15    does count toward this requirement. The portion of 16    portfolio spending on program marketing, training of 17    installers, audits of buildings, inspections of work 18    performed, and other administrative and technical expenses 19    that are clearly tied to promotion or installation of 20    building envelope or heating distribution system measures 21    shall count toward this requirement. If this minimum 22    requirement is not met, any performance incentive earned 23    under subsection (h) should be reduced by the percentage 24    point level of shortfall in meeting this requirement.25        (5) The portion of the entire budget for efficiency 26    programs that is spent on efficiency measures for   HB3650- 17 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    income-qualified households shall be the greater of 20% or 2    5 percentage points more than the proportion of total 3    residential and business customer gas sales going to 4    income-qualified households. For purposes of this Section, 5    households at or below 80% of area median income are 6    income-qualified. At least 80% of spending on measures in 7    programs targeted at income-qualified households shall be 8    delivered through whole building weatherization programs 9    and spent on measures that reduce space heating needs 10    through improvements to the building envelope, heating 11    distribution systems, or heating controls. The utilities 12    shall invest in health and safety measures appropriate and 13    necessary for comprehensively weatherizing the homes and 14    multifamily buildings of income-qualified households, with 15    up to 15% of income-qualified program spending made 16    available for such purposes. The ratio of spending on 17    efficiency programs targeted at multifamily buildings of 18    income-qualified households to spending on energy 19    efficiency programs targeted at single-family buildings of 20    income-qualified households shall be designed to achieve 21    levels of savings from each building type that are 22    approximately proportional to the magnitude of 23    cost-effective lifetime savings potential in each building 24    type. The gas utilities shall participate in a Low-Income 25    Energy Efficiency Accountability Committee as established 26    in Section 8-103B.  HB3650- 18 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        Gas utilities must conduct customer outreach and 2    education efforts in equity investment eligible 3    communities in order to provide notice of and explanations 4    concerning the following types of programs:5            (A) energy efficiency programs, the Illinois Solar 6        for All Program, and whole home retrofit programs that 7        reduce natural gas usage;8            (B) income-qualified financial assistance 9        programs, including rebate programs from the federal 10        government; and11            (C) general education programs designed to explain 12        utility bills and the decisions customers can make to 13        lower energy usage.14        These outreach and education efforts must be brought 15    to communities in a diversity of ways, must be created 16    with input from members of the communities, and must be 17    provided through, among other things:18            (i) information on customers' bills in the main 19        languages spoken in the communities;20            (ii) a quarterly posting in local newspapers that 21        cover the service area;22            (iii) a dedicated section on the investor-owned 23        utility's website; and24            (iv) in-person and virtual educational sessions 25        that take place in the income-qualified and Justice40 26        community, provide food and child care for   HB3650- 19 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        participating customers, and are codesigned with 2        interested community-based organization 3        representatives. 4        (6) Implementation of energy efficiency measures and 5    programs targeted at income-qualified households shall be 6    contracted, when practicable, to independent third parties 7    that have demonstrated the capability of serving those 8    households, with a preference for not-for-profit entities 9    and government agencies that have existing relationships 10    with, experience serving, or working directly within and 11    alongside income-qualified communities in the State. Each 12    gas utility shall develop and implement reporting 13    procedures that address and assist in determining the 14    amount of energy savings that can be applied to the 15    income-qualified procurement and expenditure requirements 16    set forth in this paragraph. 17        (7) A minimum of 10% of the utility's entire portfolio 18    funding level for a given year shall be used to procure 19    cost-effective energy efficiency measures from units of 20    local government, municipal corporations, school 21    districts, public housing, community college districts, 22    and nonprofit-owned buildings as long as a minimum 23    percentage of available funds shall be used to procure 24    energy efficiency from public housing, which percentage 25    shall be, at a minimum, equal to public housing's share of 26    public building energy consumption. Spending on public   HB3650- 20 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    housing may count toward minimum spending requirements on 2    efficiency improvements for income-qualified households. 3    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a utility 4providing approved energy efficiency measures in the State may 5recover all reasonable and prudently incurred costs of those 6measures from its retail customers. However, nothing in this 7subsection permits the double recovery of such costs from 8customers. 9    (f) Beginning in 2024, each gas utility shall file an 10energy efficiency plan with the Commission to meet the energy 11efficiency standards in subsection (d) for the next applicable 12multiyear period beginning January 1 of the year following the 13filing, according to the schedule set forth in paragraphs (1) 14through (4). If a utility does not file such a plan on or 15before the applicable filing deadline for the plan, the 16utility shall be liable for a civil penalty of $100,000 per day 17until the plan is filed. 18        (1) No later than 120 days after the effective date of 19    this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, each 20    gas utility shall file an energy efficiency plan to 21    supersede its previously filed energy efficiency plan for 22    calendar year 2025 that is designed to achieve through 23    implementation of energy efficiency measures the 24    incremental annual savings goals, minimum average savings 25    life, and other requirements specified in paragraphs (1) 26    through (7) of subsection (d). An energy efficiency plan   HB3650- 21 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    submitted by a gas utility under this paragraph supersedes 2    any energy efficiency plan previously filed by the gas 3    utility for calendar year 2025. 4        (2) No later than March 1, 2025, each gas utility 5    shall file a 4-year energy efficiency plan that takes 6    effect on January 1, 2026 and is designed to achieve, 7    through implementation of emergency efficiency measures, 8    the incremental annual savings goals, minimum average 9    savings life, and other requirements specified in 10    paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (d). However, the 11    incremental annual savings goals may be reduced if the 12    plan's analysis and forecasts of the utility's ability to 13    acquire energy savings demonstrate by clear and convincing 14    evidence and through independent analysis that achievement 15    of such goals is not cost-effective. In no event may 16    incremental annual savings goals for any year be reduced 17    to levels below (i) those actually achieved in calendar 18    year 2024, (ii) those forecast to be achieved in calendar 19    year 2025, or (iii) 0.75% of sales. The Commission shall 20    review any proposed goal reduction as part of its review 21    and approval of the utility's proposed plan. 22        (3) Beginning in 2029 and every 4 years thereafter, 23    each gas utility shall file by no later than March 1 of the 24    applicable year, a 4-year energy efficiency plan that 25    takes effect on the following January 1 and is designed to 26    achieve, through implementation of energy efficiency   HB3650- 22 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    measures, the incremental annual savings goals, minimum 2    average savings life, and other requirements specified in 3    paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (d). However, the 4    incremental annual savings goals may be reduced if the 5    plan's analysis and forecasts of the utility's ability to 6    acquire energy savings demonstrate by clear and convincing 7    evidence and through independent analysis that achievement 8    of such goals is not cost-effective. In no event may 9    incremental annual savings goals for any year be reduced 10    to levels below (i) those actually achieved in the 11    calendar year before the plan filing, (ii) those forecast 12    to be achieved in the calendar year in which the plan 13    filing is made, or (iii) 0.75% of sales. The Commission 14    shall review any proposed goal reduction as part of its 15    review and approval of the utility's proposed plan. 16        (4) Each utility's plan shall set forth the utility's 17    proposals to meet the energy efficiency standards 18    identified in subsection (d). The Commission shall seek 19    public comment on each plan that takes effect on January 20    1, 2024 and before January 1, 2026 and shall issue an order 21    approving or disapproving the plan no later than November 22    30, 2023, or 225 days after the effective date of this 23    amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, whichever is 24    later. The Commission shall seek public comment on each 25    plan that takes effect on January 1, 2026 and shall issue 26    an order approving or disapproving the plan within 6   HB3650- 23 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    months after its submission. If the Commission disapproves 2    a plan, the Commission shall, within 30 days, describe in 3    detail the reasons for the disapproval and describe a path 4    by which the utility may file a revised draft of the plan 5    to address the Commission's concerns satisfactorily. If 6    the utility does not refile with the Commission within 60 7    days, the utility shall be subject to civil penalties at a 8    rate of $100,000 per day until the plan is refiled. This 9    process shall continue, and penalties shall accrue, until 10    the utility has successfully filed a portfolio of energy 11    efficiency measures. Penalties shall be deposited into the 12    Energy Efficiency Trust Fund. 13    (g) In submitting proposed plans and funding levels under 14subsection (f) to meet the savings goals identified in 15subsection (d), the utility shall: 16        (1) demonstrate that its proposed energy efficiency 17    measures will achieve the requirements that are identified 18    in subsection (d); 19        (2) demonstrate consideration of program options for 20    supporting efforts to improve compliance with new building 21    codes, appliance standards, and municipal regulations as 22    potentially cost-effective means of acquiring energy 23    savings to count toward energy savings goals; 24        (3) demonstrate that its overall portfolio of measures 25    and programs, not including income-qualified programs 26    described in subsection (d), is cost-effective using the   HB3650- 24 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    total resource cost test and represents a diverse cross 2    section of opportunities for customers of all rate classes 3    to participate in programs. Individual measures need not 4    be cost-effective; 5        (4) demonstrate that the utility's plan integrates the 6    delivery of energy efficiency programs with electric 7    efficiency programs, programs promoting demand response, 8    and other efforts to address bill payment issues, 9    including, but not limited to, the Low Income Home Energy 10    Assistance Program and the Percentage of Income Payment 11    Plans; 12        (5) include a proposed or revised cost-recovery 13    mechanism to fund the proposed energy efficiency measures 14    and ensure the recovery of the prudently and reasonably 15    incurred costs of Commission-approved programs; 16        (6) provide, using not more than 3% of portfolio 17    resources in any given year, an annual independent 18    evaluation of the performance and cost-effectiveness of 19    the utility's portfolio of measures and programs; 20        (7) demonstrate how it will ensure that program 21    implementation contractors and energy efficiency 22    installation vendors will promote workforce equity and 23    quality jobs. Utilities shall collect, and make publicly 24    available at least quarterly, data necessary to 25    demonstrate how efforts are advancing workforce equity. 26    Utilities shall work with relevant vendors providing   HB3650- 25 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    education, training, and other resources needed to ensure 2    compliance and, where necessary, adjusting or terminating 3    work with vendors that cannot assist with compliance; and 4        (8) include any plans for research, development, or 5    pilot deployment of new measures or program approaches. 6    For utilities with unmodified savings goals, no more than 7    4% of energy efficiency portfolio spending may be 8    allocated for such purposes. For utilities with modified 9    savings goals, no more than 2% of energy efficiency 10    portfolio spending may be allocated for such purposes. 11    Utilities shall work with interested stakeholders to 12    formulate a plan for how any proposed funds should be 13    spent, incorporate statewide approaches for these 14    allocations whenever such approaches would be more 15    effective or cost-efficient, and demonstrate such 16    collaboration in the utilities' plans. 17    (h) Each gas utility shall be eligible to earn a 18shareholder incentive for effective implementation of its 19efficiency programs. The incentive shall be tied to each 20utility's annual energy efficiency spending and its savings. 21There shall be no incentive if the independent evaluator 22determines the utility either (i) failed to achieve the 23minimum average savings life specified in paragraph (2) of 24subsection (d), (ii) did not fully meet all of the 25requirements specified in paragraphs (3) through (7) of 26subsection (d), or (iii) failed to achieve incremental annual   HB3650- 26 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1savings equal to at least 90% of the incremental savings goal 2specified in paragraph (1) of subsection (d). If a utility 3meets all of the requirements specified in paragraphs (2) 4through (7) of subsection (d), it can earn an incentive equal 50.5% of total annual efficiency spending in the year being 6evaluated for every one percentage point above 90% of its 7incremental annual savings goal that it achieves for that 8year, with a maximum incentive of 15% for achieving 120% of its 9incremental annual savings goal. 10    (i) The utility shall submit energy savings data to the 11independent evaluator no later than 30 days after the close of 12the plan year. The independent evaluator shall determine the 13incremental annual savings and average savings life, as well 14as an estimate of the job impacts and other macroeconomic 15impacts of the efficiency programs for that year, achieved no 16later than 120 days after the close of the plan year. The 17utility shall submit an informational filing to the Commission 18no later than 160 days after the close of the plan year that 19attaches the independent evaluator's final report identifying 20the incremental annual savings for the year, identifying 21average savings life for the year, documenting compliance with 22other requirements in subsection (d), and, as applicable, the 23magnitude of any shareholder incentive which the utility has 24earned. 25    (j) Gas utilities shall report annually to the Commission 26and General Assembly on how hiring, contracting, job training,   HB3650- 27 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1and other practices related to its energy efficiency programs 2enhance the diversity of vendors working on such programs. 3These reports must include data on vendor and employee 4diversity. 5    (k) The independent evaluator shall follow the guidelines 6and use the savings set forth in Commission-approved energy 7efficiency policy manuals and technical reference manuals, as 8each may be updated from time to time. Until measure life 9values for energy efficiency measures implemented for 10income-qualified households are separately incorporated into 11such Commission-approved manuals, the income-qualified 12measures shall have the same measure life values that are 13established for the same measures implemented in households 14that are not income-qualified households.  15    (220 ILCS 5/9-228.5 new)16    Sec. 9-228.5. Consideration of gas main and gas service 17extension costs. Gas main and gas service extension policies 18shall be based on the principle that the full incremental cost 19associated with new development and growth shall be borne by 20the customers that cause those incremental costs. Gas main and 21gas service extension policies, procedures, and conditions 22shall align with the greenhouse gas emission reduction goals 23established in Article XXIV. 24    (220 ILCS 5/9-229)  HB3650- 28 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Sec. 9-229.

This issue shall be 7expressly addressed in the Commission's final order.8    (b) The State of Illinois shall create a Consumer 9Intervenor Compensation Fund subject to the following:10        (1) Provision of compensation for Consumer Interest 11    Representatives that intervene in Illinois Commerce 12    Commission proceedings will increase public engagement, 13    encourage additional transparency, expand the information 14    available to the Commission, and improve decision-making.15        (2) As used in this Section, "consumer Consumer 16    interest representative" means:17            (A) a residential utility customer or group of 18        residential utility customers represented by a 19        not-for-profit group or organization registered with 20        the Illinois Attorney General under the Solicitation 21        for Charity Act;22            (B) representatives of not-for-profit groups or 23        organizations whose membership is limited to 24        residential utility customers; or25            (C) representatives of not-for-profit groups or 26        organizations whose membership includes Illinois   HB3650- 29 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        residents and that address the community, economic, 2        environmental, or social welfare of Illinois 3        residents, except government agencies or intervenors 4        specifically authorized by Illinois law to participate 5        in Commission proceedings on behalf of Illinois 6        consumers.7        (3) A consumer interest representative is eligible to 8    receive compensation from the consumer intervenor 9    compensation fund if its participation included lay or 10    expert testimony or legal briefing and argument concerning 11    the expenses, investments, rate design, rate impact, or 12    other matters affecting the pricing, rates, costs or other 13    charges associated with utility service, the Commission 14    adopts a material recommendation related to a significant 15    issue in the docket, and participation caused a 16    significant financial cost hardship to the participant; 17    however, no consumer interest representative shall be 18    eligible to receive an award pursuant to this Section if 19    the consumer interest representative receives any 20    compensation, funding, or donations, directly or 21    indirectly, from parties that have a financial interest in 22    the outcome of the proceeding.23        (4) Within 30 days after September 15, 2021 (the 24    effective date of Public Act 102-662), each utility that 25    files a request for an increase in rates under Article IX 26    or Article XVI shall deposit an amount equal to one half of   HB3650- 30 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    the rate case attorney and expert expense allowed by the 2    Commission, but not to exceed $500,000, into the fund 3    within 35 days of the date of the Commission's Final final 4    Order in the rate case or 20 days after the denial of 5    rehearing under Section 10-113 of this Act, whichever is 6    later. The Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund shall be 7    used to provide payment to consumer interest 8    representatives as described in this Section.9        (5) An electric public utility with 3,000,000 or more 10    retail customers shall contribute $450,000 to the Consumer 11    Intervenor Compensation Fund within 60 days after 12    September 15, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 13    102-662). A combined electric and gas public utility 14    serving fewer than 3,000,000 but more than 500,000 retail 15    customers shall contribute $225,000 to the Consumer 16    Intervenor Compensation Fund within 60 days after 17    September 15, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 18    102-662). A gas public utility with 1,500,000 or more 19    retail customers that is not a combined electric and gas 20    public utility shall contribute $225,000 to the Consumer 21    Intervenor Compensation Fund within 60 days after 22    September 15, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 23    102-662). A gas public utility with fewer than 1,500,000 24    retail customers but more than 300,000 retail customers 25    that is not a combined electric and gas public utility 26    shall contribute $80,000 to the Consumer Intervenor   HB3650- 31 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Compensation Fund within 60 days after September 15, 2021 2    (the effective date of Public Act 102-662). A gas public 3    utility with fewer than 300,000 retail customers that is 4    not a combined electric and gas public utility shall 5    contribute $20,000 to the Consumer Intervenor Compensation 6    Fund within 60 days after September 15, 2021 (the 7    effective date of Public Act 102-662). A combined electric 8    and gas public utility serving fewer than 500,000 retail 9    customers shall contribute $20,000 to the Consumer 10    Intervenor Compensation Fund within 60 days after 11    September 15, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 12    102-662).

All 25    disbursements from the Consumer Intervenor Compensation 26    Fund shall be made only upon warrants of the Comptroller   HB3650- 33 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    drawn upon the Treasurer as custodian of the Fund upon 2    vouchers signed by the Executive Director of the 3    Commission or by the person or persons designated by the 4    Director for that purpose. The Comptroller is authorized 5    to draw the warrant upon vouchers so signed. The Treasurer 6    shall accept all warrants so signed and shall be released 7    from liability for all payments made on those warrants. 8    The Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund shall be 9    administered by an Administrator that is a person or 10    entity that is independent of the Commission. The 11    administrator will be responsible for the prudent 12    management of the Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund 13    and for recommendations for the award of consumer 14    intervenor compensation from the Consumer Intervenor 15    Compensation Fund. The Commission shall issue a request 16    for qualifications for a third-party program administrator 17    to administer the Consumer Intervenor Compensation Fund. 18    The third-party administrator shall be chosen through a 19    competitive bid process based on selection criteria and 20    requirements developed by the Commission. The Illinois 21    Procurement Code does not apply to the hiring or payment 22    of the Administrator. All Administrator costs may be paid 23    for using monies from the Consumer Intervenor Compensation 24    Fund, but the Program Administrator shall strive to 25    minimize costs in the implementation of the program.26        (B) The computation of compensation awarded from the   HB3650- 34 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    fund shall take into consideration the market rates paid 2    to persons of comparable training and experience who offer 3    similar services, but may not exceed the comparable market 4    rate for services paid by the public utility as part of its 5    rate case expense.6        (C)(1) Recommendations on the award of compensation by 7    the administrator shall include consideration of whether 8    the participation raised Commission adopted a material 9    recommendation related to a significant issue in the 10    docket and whether participation caused a significant 11    financial cost hardship to the participant and the payment 12    of compensation is fair, just, and reasonable.13        (2) Recommendations on the award of compensation by 14    the administrator shall be submitted to the Commission for 15    approval. Unless the Commission initiates an investigation 16    within 45 days after the notice to the Commission, the 17    award of compensation shall be allowed 45 days after 18    notice to the Commission. Such notice shall be given by 19    filing with the Commission on the Commission's e-docket 20    system, and keeping open for public inspection the award 21    for compensation proposed by the Administrator. The 22    Commission shall have power, and it is hereby given 23    authority, either upon complaint or upon its own 24    initiative without complaint, at once, and if it so 25    orders, without answer or other formal pleadings, but upon 26    reasonable notice, to enter upon a hearing concerning the   HB3650- 35 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    propriety of the award.2    (c) The Commission may adopt rules to implement this 3Section.4(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24.) 5    (220 ILCS 5/9-235 new)6    Sec. 9-235. Tariffed gas main and gas service extension 7provisions. No later than 60 days after the effective date of 8this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, the 9Commission shall initiate a docketed rulemaking reviewing each 10gas public utility tariff that provides for gas main and gas 11service extensions without additional charge to new customers 12in excess of the default extensions without charge as 13specified in 83 Ill. Adm. Code 501. The focus of the rulemaking 14shall be to modify each gas utility's gas main and gas service 15extension tariff to align with the provisions set forth in 16Section 9-228.5. 17    (220 ILCS 5/9-241)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 9-241)18    Sec. 9-241. Nondiscrimination. 19    (a) No public utility shall, as to rates or other charges, 20services, facilities, or in other respect, make or grant any 21preference or advantage to any corporation or person or 22subject any corporation or person to any prejudice or 23disadvantage. No public utility shall establish or maintain 24any unreasonable difference as to rates or other charges,   HB3650- 36 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1services, facilities, or in any other respect, either as 2between localities or as between classes of service.3    (b) An electric utility in a county with a population of 43,000,000 or more shall not establish or maintain any 5unreasonable difference as to rates or other charges, 6services, contractual terms, or facilities for access to or 7the use of its utility infrastructure by another person or for 8any other purpose. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, 9the Commission and its staff shall interpret this Section in 10accordance with Article XVI of this Act. 11     (c) Nothing in this Section shall be construed as 12limiting the authority of the Commission to permit the 13establishment of economic development rates as incentives to 14economic development either in enterprise zones as designated 15by the State of Illinois or in other areas of a utility's 16service area. Such rates should be available to existing 17businesses which demonstrate an increase to existing load as 18well as new businesses which create new load for a utility so 19as to create a more balanced utilization of generating 20capacity. The Commission shall ensure that such rates are 21established at a level which provides a net benefit to 22customers within a public utility's service area.23    (d) On or before January 1, 2025 2023, the Commission 24shall conduct a comprehensive study to assess whether 25low-income discount rates for electric and natural gas 26residential customers are appropriate and the potential design   HB3650- 37 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1and implementation of any such rates. The Commission shall 2include its findings, together with the appropriate 3recommendations, in a report to be provided to the General 4Assembly. Upon completion of the study, the Commission shall 5have the authority to permit or require electric and natural 6gas utilities to file a tariff establishing low-income 7discount rates.8    Such study shall assess, at a minimum, the following:9        (1) customer eligibility requirements, including 10    income-based eligibility and eligibility based on 11    participation in or eligibility for certain public 12    assistance programs;13        (2) appropriate rate structures, including 14    consideration of tiered discounts for different income 15    levels;16        (3) appropriate recovery mechanisms, including the 17    consideration of volumetric charges and customer charges;18        (4) appropriate verification mechanisms;19        (5) measures to ensure customer confidentiality and 20    data safeguards;21        (6) outreach and consumer education procedures; and22        (7) the impact that a low-income discount rate would 23    have on the affordability of delivery service to 24    low-income customers and customers overall.25    On or before January 1, 2026, the Commission shall begin a 26docketed rulemaking process to implement low-income discount   HB3650- 38 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1rates for electric and natural gas residential customers, 2incorporating the recommendations of the report required by 3this Section, released by the Commission in December 2022 and 4titled the "Illinois Commerce Commission Low-Income Discount 5Rate Study Report to the Illinois General Assembly". 6    (e) The Commission shall adopt rules requiring utility 7companies to produce information, in the form of a mailing, 8and other approved methods of distribution, to its consumers, 9to inform the consumers of available rebates, discounts, 10credits, and other cost-saving mechanisms that can help them 11lower their monthly utility bills, and send out such 12information semi-annually, unless otherwise provided by this 13Article. 14    (f) Prior to October 1, 1989, no public utility providing 15electrical or gas service shall consider the use of solar or 16other nonconventional renewable sources of energy by a 17customer as a basis for establishing higher rates or charges 18for any service or commodity sold to such customer; nor shall a 19public utility subject any customer utilizing such energy 20source or sources to any other prejudice or disadvantage on 21account of such use. No public utility shall without the 22consent of the Commission, charge or receive any greater 23compensation in the aggregate for a lesser commodity, product, 24or service than for a greater commodity, product or service of 25like character.26    The Commission, in order to expedite the determination of   HB3650- 39 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1rate questions, or to avoid unnecessary and unreasonable 2expense, or to avoid unjust or unreasonable discrimination 3between classes of customers, or, whenever in the judgment of 4the Commission public interest so requires, may, for rate 5making and accounting purposes, or either of them, consider 6one or more municipalities either with or without the adjacent 7or intervening rural territory as a regional unit where the 8same public utility serves such region under substantially 9similar conditions, and may within such region prescribe 10uniform rates for consumers or patrons of the same class.11    Any public utility, with the consent and approval of the 12Commission, may as a basis for the determination of the 13charges made by it classify its service according to the 14amount used, the time when used, the purpose for which used, 15and other relevant factors.16(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 103-679, eff. 7-19-24.) 17    (220 ILCS 5/9-254 new)18    Sec. 9-254. Independent gas system assessment.19    (a) The General Assembly finds that an independent audit 20of the current state of the gas distribution system, and of the 21expenditures made since 2012, will need to be made. 22Specifically, the General Assembly finds:23        (1) Pursuant to 2013 legislation establishing the 24    qualifying infrastructure plant charge, gas utilities in 25    this State that serve over 700,000 retail customers have   HB3650- 40 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    spent significant amounts of ratepayer dollars on system 2    investments purporting to refurbish, rebuild, modernize, 3    and expand gas system infrastructure.4        (2) The qualifying infrastructure plant charge is set 5    to conclude at its statutory deadline of December 31, 6    2023, and it is in the interest of this State and in the 7    interest of gas utilities' customers to understand the 8    benefits of these investments to the gas system and to 9    customers and to evaluate the current condition of the gas 10    system.11        (3) It is also necessary for gas utilities, the 12    Commission, and stakeholders to have an independently 13    verified set of data to draw upon for future gas rate cases 14    and any other proposed gas system spending.15        (4) Meeting the State's climate goals will require an 16    ordered transition away from gas, and toward electric 17    heating and appliances, for all or nearly all buildings, 18    and planning this transition will require a thorough 19    understanding of the current state of the gas system.20        (5) The Commission has authority to order and 21    implement the requirements of this Section under Section 22    8-102.23    (b) Terms used in this Section shall have the meanings 24given to them in Section 19-105.25    (c) Within 30 days after the effective date of this 26amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, the Commission   HB3650- 41 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1shall issue an order initiating an audit of each gas utility 2serving over 700,000 retail customers in the State, which 3shall examine the following:4        (1) An assessment of the gas distribution system, as 5    described in paragraph (2) of subsection (a). The 6    Commission shall have the authority to require additional 7    items that it deems necessary.8        (2) An analysis of the utility's capital projects 9    placed into service in the preceding 10 years, including, 10    but not limited to, an assessment of the value and safety 11    impact of pipe replacement, increased system pressure, and 12    pipe capacity expansion.13        (3) An assessment of the utility's emissions 14    reductions to date and what preparations the utility has 15    made to meet the terms of the Paris Climate Agreement, 16    with which it is the policy of the State to comply.17        (4) The creation of a visual, geographic map of the 18    gas system displaying the level of risk of various 19    pipelines and showing the areas where pipelines have 20    already been replaced.21        (5) The identifying areas of the gas system where the 22    cost to replace pipeline is likely to be high, including, 23    but not limited to, identifying places where 24    decommissioning a portion of the gas system and planning 25    to provide for electric heating and appliance needs in 26    that area may be preferable, considering the costs and   HB3650- 42 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    benefits for affordability, health, and climate.2    (d) It is contemplated that the auditor will use materials 3filed with the Commission by the utilities with respect to the 4auditor's expenditures in the preceding 10 years; however, the 5auditor may also, with Commission approval, assess other 6information deemed necessary to make its report. The results 7of the audit described in this Section shall be reflected in a 8report delivered to the Commission, describing the information 9specified in this Section. The report is to be delivered no 10later than 180 days after the Commission enters its order 11under subsection (c). It is understood that any public report 12may not contain items that are confidential or proprietary.13    (e) The costs of a gas utility's audit described in this 14Section shall not exceed $500,000 and shall be paid for by the 15electric utility that is the subject of the audit. Such costs 16shall be a recoverable expense.17    (f) The Commission shall have the authority to retain the 18services of an auditor to assist with the distribution 19planning process, as well as in docketed proceedings. Such 20expenses for these activities shall also be borne by the 21Commission. 22    (220 ILCS 5/9-255 new)23    Sec. 9-255. Phase-out of gas fixed changes. Beginning 24January 1, 2035, a public utility providing gas service may 25not assess fixed charges as part of its rates. Beginning   HB3650- 43 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1January 1, 2030, a public utility providing gas service must 2limit, for each customer class, any fixed charges in its rates 3to no greater than 50% of the average of monthly fixed charges 4for that customer class during the period January 1, 2019 to 5December 31, 2021. 6    (220 ILCS 5/16-111.10)7    Sec. 16-111.10. Equitable Energy Upgrade Program.8    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that Illinois 9homes and businesses can contribute to the creation of a clean 10energy economy, conservation of natural resources, and 11reliability of the electricity grid through the installation 12of cost-effective renewable energy generation, energy 13efficiency and demand response equipment, and energy storage 14systems. Further, a large portion of Illinois residents and 15businesses that would benefit from the installation of energy 16efficiency, storage, and renewable energy generation systems 17are unable to purchase systems due to capital or credit 18barriers. This State should pursue options to enable many more 19Illinoisans to access the health, environmental, and financial 20benefits of new clean energy technology.21    (b) As used in this Section:22    "Commission" means the Illinois Commerce Commission.23    "Energy project" means renewable energy generation 24systems, including solar projects, energy efficiency upgrades, 25decarbonization and electrification measures, energy storage   HB3650- 44 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1systems, demand response equipment, or any combination 2thereof.3    "Fund" means the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund 4established in the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund Act.5    "Program" means the Equitable Energy Upgrade Program 6established under subsection (c).7    "Utility" means electric public utilities providing 8services to 500,000 or more customers under this Act.9    (c) The Commission shall open an investigation into and 10direct all electric and gas public utilities in this State to 11adopt an Equitable Energy Upgrade Program that permits 12customers to finance the construction of energy projects 13through an optional tariff payable directly through their 14utility bill, modeled after the Pay As You Save system, 15developed by the Energy Efficiency Institute. The Program 16model shall enable utilities to offer to make investments in 17energy projects to customer properties with low-cost capital 18and use an opt-in tariff to recover the costs. The Program 19shall be designed to provide customers with immediate 20financial savings if they choose to participate. The Program 21shall allow residential electric and gas utility customers 22that own the property, or renters that have permission of the 23property owner, for which they subscribe to utility service to 24agree to the installation of an energy project. The Program 25shall ensure:26        (1) eligible projects do not require upfront payments;   HB3650- 45 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    however, customers may pay down the costs for projects 2    with a payment to the installing contractor in order to 3    qualify projects that would otherwise require upfront 4    payments;5        (2) eligible projects have sufficient estimated 6    savings and estimated life span to produce significant, 7    immediate net savings;8        (3) participants shall agree the utility can recover 9    its costs for the projects at their location by paying for 10    the project through an optional tariff directly through 11    the participant's utility electricity bill, allowing 12    participants to benefit from installation of energy 13    projects without traditional loans;14        (4) accessibility by lower-income residents and 15    environmental justice community residents; and16        (5) the utility must ensure that customers who are 17    interested in participating are notified that if they are 18    income qualified, they may also be eligible for the 19    Percentage of Income Payment Plan program and free energy 20    improvements through other programs and facilitate 21    interested customers' enrollment in those programs; and 22    provide contact information.23        (6) coordination with existing utility, state, and 24    federal energy efficiency, solar, electrification, and 25    other energy savings funding and implementation programs. 26    (d) The Commission shall establish Program guidelines with   HB3650- 46 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1the anticipated schedule of Program availability as follows:2        (1) Year 1: Beginning in the first year of operation, 3    each utility with greater than 100,000 retail customers is 4    required to obtain low-cost capital of at least 5    $20,000,000 annually for investments in energy projects.6        (2) Year 2: Beginning in the second year of operation, 7    each utility with greater than 100,000 retail customers is 8    required to obtain low-cost capital for investments in 9    energy projects of at least $40,000,000 annually.10        (3) Year 3: Beginning in the third year of operation, 11    each utility with greater than 100,000 retail customers is 12    required to obtain low-cost capital for investments in as 13    many systems as customers demand, subject to available 14    capital provided by the utility, State, or other lenders.15    (e) In the design of the Program, the Commission shall:16        (1) Within 90 days after the effective date of this 17    amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, begin a 18    process to update the Program guidelines for 19    implementation of the Program. Any such process shall 20    allow for participation from interested stakeholders. 21    Within 270 days after the effective date of this 22    amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, convene a 23    workshop during which interested participants may discuss 24    issues and submit comments related to the Program.25        (2) Establish Program guidelines for implementation of 26    the Program in accordance with the Pay As You Save   HB3650- 47 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Essential Elements and Minimum Program Requirements that 2    electric and gas utilities must abide by when implementing 3    the Program. Program guidelines established by the 4    Commission shall include the following elements:5            (A) The Commission shall establish conditions 6        under which utilities secure capital to fund the 7        energy projects. The Commission may allow utilities to 8        raise capital independently, work with third-party 9        lenders to secure the capital for participants, or a 10        combination thereof. Any process the Commission 11        approves must use a market mechanism to identify the 12        least costly sources of capital funds so as to pass on 13        maximum savings to participants. The State or the 14        Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund may also provide 15        capital for the Program.16            (B) Customer protection guidelines should be 17        designed consistent with Pay As You Save Essential 18        Elements and Minimum Program Requirements.19            (C) The Commission shall establish conditions by 20        which utilities may connect Program participants to 21        energy project vendors. In setting conditions for 22        connection, the Commission may prioritize vendors that 23        have a history of good relations with the State, 24        including vendors that have hired participants from 25        State-created job training programs.26            (D) Guarantee that conservative estimates of   HB3650- 48 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        financial savings will immediately and significantly 2        exceed estimated Program costs for Program 3        participants.4            (E) Require any customer data sharing between 5        electric and gas utilities and third-party vendors 6        needed to evaluate the energy and demand saving and 7        energy services revenue opportunities of all customers 8        and otherwise facilitate a positive customer 9        experience. Such data sharing may include but shall 10        not be limited to historical and ongoing customer 11        usage data and billing rates. The Commission may allow 12        utilities to recover the costs associated with data 13        sharing from all customers.14            (F) Notwithstanding the method used to estimate 15        site-specific energy savings or measure direct energy 16        savings for Program participants, the utility will 17        report aggregate savings to the Commission for 18        regulatory filings in the same or a similar manner as 19        other energy efficiency or clean energy programs. 20    (f) Within 90 120 days after the Commission releases the 21Program conditions established under this Section, each 22utility subject to the requirements of this Section shall 23submit an informational filing to the Commission that 24describes its plan for implementing the provisions of this 25Section. If the Commission finds that the submission does not 26properly comply with the statutory or regulatory requirements   HB3650- 49 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1of the Program, the Commission may require that the utility 2make modifications to its filing.3    (g) An independent process evaluation shall be conducted 4after one year of the Program's operation. An independent 5impact evaluation shall be conducted after 3 years of 6operation, excluding one-time startup costs and results from 7the first 12 months of the Program. The Commission shall 8convene an advisory council of stakeholders, including 9representation of low-income and environmental justice 10community members to make recommendations in response to the 11findings of the independent evaluation.12    (h) The Program shall be designed using the Pay As You Save 13system guidelines to be cost-effective for customers. Only 14projects that are deemed to be cost-effective and can be 15reasonably expected to ensure customer savings are eligible 16for funding through the Program, unless, as specified in 17paragraph (1) of subsection (c), customers able to make 18upfront copayments to installers buy down the cost of projects 19so it can be deemed cost-effective.20    (i) Eligible customers must be:21        (1) property renters with permission of the property 22    owner; or23        (2) property owners.24    (j) The calculation of project cost-effectiveness shall be 25based upon the Pay As You Save system requirements.26        (1) The calculation of cost-effectiveness must be   HB3650- 50 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    conducted by an objective process approved by the 2    Commission and based on rates in effect at the time of 3    installation.4        (2) A project shall be considered cost-effective only 5    if it is estimated to produce significant immediate net 6    savings, not counting copayments voluntarily made by 7    customers. The Commission may establish guidelines by 8    which this required savings is estimated.9        (3) Net savings shall include savings across all fuel 10    sources, not limited to electricity and natural gas.11        (4) The calculation of project cost-effectiveness 12    shall not exclude projects that:13            (A) would raise customer costs in a particular 14        month so long as customers see annual project savings; 15        or16            (B) increase electric load and accompanying costs 17        when a heating electrification project results in the 18        ability to cool part or all of a home that was not 19        previously cooled. In such cases, the increased 20        electricity consumption associated with that added 21        cooling shall not be included in calculations of net 22        savings. Extreme heat poses an increasing risk to 23        Illinois communities. As such, it is in the public 24        interest to mitigate that risk through the addition of 25        building cooling systems.26        However, any expected increase in electric load and   HB3650- 51 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    customer costs should be clearly communicated to impacted 2    customers, along with any options for mitigating that 3    increase. 4    (k) The Program should be modeled after the Pay As You Save 5system, by which Program participants finance energy projects 6using the savings that the energy project creates with a 7tariffed on-bill program. Eligible projects shall not create 8personal debt for the customer, result in a lien in the event 9of nonpayment, or require customers to pay monthly charges for 10any upgrade that fails and is not repaired within 21 days. The 11utility may restart charges once the upgrade is repaired and 12functioning and extend the term of payments to recover its 13costs for missed payments and deferred cost recovery, 14providing the upgrade continues to function. 15    (l) Any energy project that is defective or damaged due to 16no fault of the participant must be either replaced or 17repaired with parts that meet industry standards at the cost 18of the utility or vendor, as specified by the Commission, and 19charges shall be suspended until repairs or replacement is 20completed. The Commission may establish, increase, or replace 21the requirements imposed in this subsection. The Commission 22may determine that this responsibility is best handled by 23participating project vendors in the form of insurance, 24contractual guarantees, or other mechanisms, and issue rules 25detailing this requirement. Customers shall not be charged 26monthly payments for upgrades that are no longer functioning.   HB3650- 52 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    (m) In the event of nonpayment, the remaining balance due 2to pay off the system shall remain with the utility meter at an 3upgraded location. The Commission shall establish conditions 4subject to this constraint in the event of nonpayment that are 5in accordance with the Pay As You Save system.6    (n) The utility shall make every effort to ensure that 7customers who are income-qualified for free energy upgrade 8programs take full advantage of those programs first before 9using the Equitable Energy Upgrade Program. If the demand by 10utility customers exceeds the Program capital supply in a 11given year, utilities shall ensure that 50% of participants 12are:13        (1) customers in neighborhoods where a majority of 14    households make 150% or less of area median income; or15        (2) residents of environmental justice communities.16    (o) Utilities shall endeavor to inform customers about the 17availability of the Program, their potential eligibility for 18participation in the Program, and whether they are likely to 19save money on the basis of an estimate conducted using 20variables consistent with the Program that the utility has at 21its disposal. The Commission may establish guidelines by which 22utilities must abide by this directive and alternatives if the 23Commission deems utilities' efforts as inadequate.24    (p) Subject to Commission specifications under subsection 25(c), each utility shall work with certified project vendors 26selected using a request for proposals process to establish   HB3650- 53 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1the terms and processes under which a utility can install 2eligible renewable energy generation and energy storage 3systems using the capital to fit the Equitable Energy Upgrade 4model. The utility certified project vendor shall explain and 5offer the approved upgrades to customers and shall assist 6customers in applying for financing through the Program. As 7part of the process, utilities vendors shall also provide 8participants with information about any other relevant 9incentives that may be available and customer service 10regarding the effective use of the upgrades.11    Nothing shall preclude gas and electric utilities that 12have overlapping service territories from jointly implementing 13and delivering the Program. 14    (q) A participating An electric utility shall recover all 15of the prudently incurred costs of offering a program approved 16by the Commission under this Section. For investor-owned 17utilities, shareholder incentives will be proportional to 18meeting Commission approved thresholds for the number of 19customers served and the amount of its investments in those 20locations.21    (r) The Commission shall adopt all rules necessary for the 22administration of this Section. 23(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21.) 24    (220 ILCS 5/Art.

XXIV heading new)9ARTICLE XXIV. 2050 HEAT DECARBONIZATION STANDARD 10    (220 ILCS 5/24-101 new)11    Sec. 24-101. Legislative policy. To provide the highest 12quality of life for the residents of this State and to provide 13for a clean and healthy environment, it is the policy of this 14State that natural gas utilities, otherwise referred to as 15"obligated parties", shall transition to 100% zero emissions 16by 2050. Under the heat decarbonization standard, each gas 17utility has an annual obligation, beginning in 2030, to reduce 18the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion of 19the fuels it delivers to its customers. The emission reduction 20obligation for 2030 shall be 20% relative to each utility's 212020 greenhouse gas emissions levels on a weather-normalized 22basis. The emission reduction obligation shall grow by 4 23percentage points per year every year thereafter, such that 24the annual emission reduction requirement will reach 24% in   HB3650- 71 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b12031, 28% in 2032, 32% in 2033, 36% in 2034, 40% by 2035, 44% 2by 2036, 48% by 2037, 52% by 2038, 56% by 2039, 60% by 2040, 364% by 2041, 68% by 2042, 72% by 2043, 76% by 2044, 80% by 42045, 84% by 2046, 88% by 2047, 92% by 2048, 96% by 2049, and 5100% by 2050. This obligation shall be referred to as the "heat 6decarbonization standard". The heat decarbonization standard 7must be met by the lowest societal cost combination of supply 8and demand-side resources. References in this Article to "this 9Act" means this Article. 10    (220 ILCS 5/24-102 new)11    Sec. 24-102. Options for compliance.12    (a) Obligated parties must demonstrate compliance with the 13heat decarbonization standard using a combination of:14        (1) emission reductions achieved from the obligated 15    parties' own customers; and 16        (2) clean heat credits purchased from other gas 17    utilities that are also obligated parties in this State. 18    (b) Prior to 2035, at least 70% of each obligated party's 19emission reduction obligation must be met through emission 20reductions achieved from its own customers, with no more than 2130% of the emission reduction obligation in any year met 22through the purchase of clean heat credits. From 2035 through 232040, at least 80% of each obligated party's emission 24reduction requirement must be met through emission reductions 25from its own customers, with no more than 20% met through the   HB3650- 72 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1purchase of clean heat credits. After 2040, at least 90% of 2each obligated party's emission reduction requirement must be 3met through emission reductions achieved from its own 4customers, with no more than 10% met through the purchase of 5clean heat credits.  6    (220 ILCS 5/24-103 new)7    Sec. 24-103. Measures for customer emission reduction. 8Emissions must be achieved through improvements in customers' 9energy conservation practices, improvements in customers' 10end-use efficiency, full or partial electrification of any end 11use, or switching from fossil methane to lower-emitting liquid 12or gaseous fuels that are delivered by the obligated party and 13directly consumed by end-use customers at the customers' homes 14or businesses. Lower-emitting liquid or gaseous fuels may 15include biomethane, but lower-emitting liquid or gaseous fuels 16may not include hydrogen except for industrial applications. 17For emission reductions from lower-emitting liquid or gaseous 18fuels to be counted toward an obligated party's emission 19reduction obligation, the obligated party must both acquire 20the lower-emitting fuel, including its environmental 21attributes, and demonstrate a contractual pathway for the 22physical delivery of the fuel from the point of injection into 23a pipeline to the obligated party's delivery system. Gas 24utilities may not use reductions in emissions from sources 25unrelated to combustion of fossil gas at customers' homes and   HB3650- 73 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1businesses in this State as emissions offsets or alternatives 2to reductions in the customers' own emissions.3    Obligated parties must meet the heat decarbonization 4standard with the lowest societal cost combination of 5resources, where societal cost includes infrastructure costs, 6utility return on capital, the social cost of greenhouse gas 7emissions and leakage, and the cost of health impacts 8attributable to pollution from a given measure.  9    (220 ILCS 5/24-104 new)10    Sec. 24-104. Demonstrating customer emission reductions.11    (a) Each obligated party's emissions in each year shall be 12calculated as:13        (1) a weather-normalized estimate of emissions from 14    the actual amount of fossil methane consumed by its 15    customers in the year, plus; 16        (2) a weather-normalized estimate of emissions from 17    the leakage of methane, hydrogen, or other greenhouse 18    gases from front or behind-the-meter sources in a given 19    year, plus; 20        (3) a weather-normalized estimate of the magnitude of 21    remaining emissions resulting from switching from fossil 22    methane to lower-emitting liquid or gaseous fuels that are 23    delivered by the obligated party and directly consumed by 24    customers at the customers' homes or businesses in the 25    year. The magnitude of remaining emissions resulting from   HB3650- 74 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    switching from fossil methane to lower-emitting liquid or 2    gaseous fuels shall be calculated as (i) the magnitude of 3    emissions that would have occurred had fossil methane 4    continued to be consumed, multiplied by (ii) one minus the 5    percent reduction in life cycle emissions resulting from 6    the fuel substitution. Life cycle emission calculations 7    shall account for emissions associated with the entire 8    pathway of a fuel, including extraction, production, 9    transportation, distribution, and combustion of the fuel 10    by the consumer. 11    (b) Obligated parties shall calculate these figures 12annually, and electronically submit the figures in an easily 13accessible digital format, such as .PDF, .DOCX, or XLSX, to 14the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commission, the 15Governor, and the General Assembly. 16    (c) The Environmental Protection Agency shall post these 17figures for each utility on a website readily accessible to 18the public, within 30 days of obligated parties submitting the 19figures to the Agency, and shall maintain all previous years' 20records for similar public access. 21    (d) The Environmental Protection Agency shall also assess 22the emissions figures submitted by obligated parties to assess 23those parties' compliance or lack thereof with the heat 24decarbonization standard. If an obligated party does not 25comply, the obligated party shall be subject to enforcement 26mechanisms described in Section 24-108.    HB3650- 75 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    (220 ILCS 5/24-105 new)2    Sec. 24-105. Tradable clean heat credits. A tradable clean 3heat credit is a tradable, intangible commodity that 4represents an amount of greenhouse gas reduction, measured in 5tons of CO2, achieved by a gas utility from its customers in 6this State. An obligated party must achieve excess emission 7reductions, over and above its annual obligation, to sell 8tradable clean heat credits to another obligated party. The 9number of tradable clean heat credits sold by an obligated 10party in any year may not exceed the magnitude of the obligated 11party's excess emission reductions in that year. 12    (220 ILCS 5/24-106 new)13    Sec. 24-106. Banking of emission reductions. An obligated 14party that achieves emission reductions in a given year that 15are in excess of its emission reduction obligation in that 16year may, in lieu of selling them to another obligated party, 17bank them. Emission reductions that are banked in a given year 18may be used to comply with emission reduction obligations in 19any of the following 3 years. Excess emission reductions may 20not be banked for more than 3 years or used as part of an 21obligated party's annual compliance more than 3 years after 22they were generated. No obligated party may achieve more than 2320% of any annual emission reduction obligation using banked 24emission reductions.   HB3650- 76 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    (220 ILCS 5/24-107 new)2    Sec. 24-107. Equity in emission reductions. 3    (a) As used in this Section:4    "Equity investment eligible communities" has the meaning 5given to that term in the Energy Transition Act.6    "Income-qualified households" means those households whose 7annual incomes are at or below 80% of the area median income.8    (b) Each obligated party must achieve real emission 9reductions from income-qualified households and environmental 10justice communities that are at least 5 percentage points 11greater than a proportional percentage of the annual gas 12consumption of such customers multiplied by each obligated 13party's annual emissions reduction requirements. At least half 14of the emission reductions from equity investment eligible 15communities shall be from measures that require capital 16investments in homes, have expected lives of at least 10 17years, and are estimated to lower annual energy bills. 18Emission reductions in equity investment eligible communities 19shall include codelivery and coordinated implementation of all 20relevant programs, measures, and complementary services. This 21includes, but is not limited to, pairing high efficiency 22electrification measures and programs with energy efficiency, 23building envelope improvements, the Illinois Solar for All 24Program, energy assistance, health and safety improvements, 25and federal incentives targeted to disadvantaged communities.   HB3650- 77 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1Emission reductions from income-qualified and environmental 2justice communities, including efforts to codeliver and 3coordinate other programs and services, shall be reported on 4at least annually to the Commission. Tradable clean heat 5credits cannot be used to fulfill this requirement. 6    (220 ILCS 5/24-108 new)7    Sec. 24-108. Enforcement.8    (a) The Commission shall order an obligated party that 9fails to achieve its emission reduction obligation in a given 10year, including required amounts from income-qualified 11customers and front-line communities, to make a noncompliance 12payment. The noncompliance payment shall be equal to 3 times 13the estimated cost per unit of emission reduction incurred by 14all obligated parties in the State for the emission reductions 15the obligated parties achieved in the prior year.16    (b) The Commission may waive the noncompliance payment if: 17        (1) it finds that the obligated party made a good 18    faith effort to achieve the required amount of emission 19    reduction and its failure to achieve the required 20    reduction resulted from market factors beyond its control, 21    that could not have reasonably been anticipated, and for 22    which the obligated party could not have planned; and 23        (2) it directs the obligated party to add the 24    difference between its obligated level of emission 25    reduction and actual emission reduction achieved to its   HB3650- 78 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    required emission reduction amount in subsequent years, 2    with the shortfall being made up in no more than 3 years. 3    (c) Payments received pursuant to the noncompliance 4penalty shall be directed to the Commission. 5    (d) The Commission shall use any noncompliance payments to 6contract with an independent third party to achieve emission 7reductions in the service territory of the noncomplying 8utility. The Commission shall prioritize achieving such 9reductions from weatherization or electrification of 10income-qualified households, to the extent that such 11reductions would lower annual energy bills.  12    (220 ILCS 5/24-109 new)13    Sec. 24-109. 2050 Heat Decarbonization Pathways Study.14    (a) In order to ensure sufficient planning for achieving 15this goal, the Commission shall complete a 2050 Heat 16Decarbonization Pathways Study by June 1, 2025, to examine 17feasible and practical pathways for investor-owned natural gas 18utilities to achieve the State's decarbonization requirement 19to be net zero by 2050, and the impacts of decarbonization on 20customers and the electric and natural gas utilities that 21serve the customers.22    (b) The Commission shall host the study in collaboration 23with a technical working group whose members are appointed by 24the Governor and a consultant selected by the technical 25working group.

Gas infrastructure planning.20    (a) This Article creates the Office of Decarbonization 21Planning within the Commission to manage an iterative 22statewide heat decarbonization plan located within the 23Commission. On a timeline concurrent with the 2050 Heat 24Decarbonization Pathways Study, the Office of Decarbonization 25Planning shall adopt rules for implementing the heat   HB3650- 83 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1decarbonization plans.2    (b) As used in this Section:3    "Environmental justice communities" has the meaning given 4to that term in the Illinois Power Agency Act. 5    "Lowest reasonable cost" means the least-cost, least-risk 6mix of demand-side, supply-side, and electrification resources 7determined through a detailed and consistent analysis of a 8wide range of commercially available sources. At a minimum, 9this analysis must consider resource costs, resource 10availability, market-volatility risks, the risks imposed on 11ratepayers, resource effect on system operations, public 12policies regarding resource preferences, the cost of risks 13associated with environmental effects, including emissions of 14carbon dioxide, the ability to scale to meet 2050 goals, air 15pollution and resulting public health impacts, equity impacts, 16and the need for security of supply.17    "Planned project" means any programmatic expense or 18related group of programmatic expenses with a defined scope of 19work and associated cost estimate that exceeds $1,000,000 in 202020 dollars or $500,000 in 2020 dollars for gas utilities 21with less than 50,000 full service customers, as adjusted 22annually for inflation.23    "Resources" means both demand-side and supply-side 24resources, including, but not limited to, natural gas, 25biomethane, green hydrogen for industrial application, 26conservation, energy efficiency, demand response, and   HB3650- 84 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1electrification.2    (c) Each natural gas utility regulated by the Commission 3has the responsibility to meet system demand and public policy 4requirements, including the State's heat decarbonization 5standard, with the lowest reasonable cost and most feasible 6mix of resources. In furtherance of that responsibility, each 7natural gas utility must develop a gas infrastructure plan for 8meeting the utility's heat decarbonization standard, including 95-year interim milestones from 2025 until 2050. The gas 10infrastructure plan must take into account the findings of the 112050 Heat Decarbonization Pathways Study. 12    (d) Natural gas utilities shall file biennial gas 13infrastructure plans that create alignment between gas utility 14distribution system investments and the utility's heat 15decarbonization standard obligations at lowest reasonable cost 16and that consider nonpipeline infrastructure projects that 17minimize costs over the long term. 18    (e) Before the filing of each biennial gas infrastructure 19plan, the Office of Decarbonization Planning shall contract 20for gas demand forecasts for each regulated gas utility in the 21State from an independent party. Gas utilities must reasonably 22provide accurate and timely system data to the independent 23contractor selected to conduct the forecasts. For each 24regulated gas utility in the State, the third party must 25produce forecasts for each customer class that consider slow, 26medium, and rapid acceleration of residential, commercial, and   HB3650- 85 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1industrial electrification of the end uses that rely upon the 2direct combustion of natural gas in buildings. The forecasts 3must include, to the extent possible, the effects of updated 4State and local building codes, changes to the number of gas 5utility customers, consumer responses to building 6electrification programs or incentives offered within a gas 7utility's service territory, the price elasticity of gas 8demand if rates increase due to reduced gas throughput and the 9impacts of commodity prices, and any other criteria as 10stipulated by the Commission. The forecasts shall be due to 11the Commission and the gas utilities at least 8 months prior to 12the filing of a gas infrastructure plan. 13    (f) A gas infrastructure plan must: 14        (1) cover the 20 years immediately following the 15    approval of the plan with a 5-year action plan of 16    investments; 17        (2) provide the estimated total cost and annual 18    incremental revenue requirements of the proposed action 19    plan, assuming both conventional depreciation and 20    accelerated depreciation, as applicable; 21        (3) use the various gas demand forecasts provided to 22    it under this article and include a range of possible 23    future scenarios and input sensitivities for the purpose 24    of testing the robustness of the utility's portfolio of 25    planned projects under various parameters; 26        (4) take into account the findings of the 2050 Heat   HB3650- 86 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    Decarbonization Pathways Study; 2        (5) demonstrate that the utility's infrastructure 3    investment plans align with obligations under the heat 4    decarbonization standard; 5        (6) include a list of all proposed system expenditures 6    and investments, including an analysis of infrastructure 7    needs and detailed information on all planned projects 8    within the action plan; 9        (7) include the results of nonpipeline alternative 10    analyses conducted for all planned projects not necessary 11    to mitigate a near-term safety or reliability risk subject 12    to rules by the Commission that include, but are not 13    limited to: 14            (A) a consideration of both supply and demand-side 15        alternatives to traditional capital investments, 16        including gas demand response and electrification; and 17            (B) a cost-benefit analysis of the various options 18        that consider non-energy benefits and the societal 19        value, including health benefits, of reduced carbon 20        emissions and surface-level pollutants, particularly 21        in equity investment eligible communities; 22        (8) minimize rate impacts on customers, particularly 23    low-income households and households within equity 24    investment eligible communities; 25        (9) describe the methodology, criteria, and 26    assumptions used to develop the plan;   HB3650- 87 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        (10) include one or more system maps indicating 2    locations of individual planned projects, pressure 3    districts served by the individual project, locations of 4    equity investment eligible communities, and any other 5    information as required by the Commission; 6        (11) provide a summary of stakeholder participation 7    and input from a public stakeholder process, and an 8    explanation of how input was incorporated into the plan, 9    including for all projects located within equity 10    investment eligible communities, a description of its 11    outreach to members of that community and findings from 12    those efforts; and 13        (12) requires the utility, to the extent that the 14    utility assumes the use of alternative fuels, such as 15    biomethane or green hydrogen, to meet its obligations 16    under the heat decarbonization standard, to demonstrate a 17    plan to procure firm supply and cost-effectiveness as 18    compared to nonfuel alternatives, inclusive of the costs 19    to retrofit all public and private infrastructure to 20    accommodate the fuels; green hydrogen may only be used for 21    industrial applications; hydrogen blending with methane 22    shall not be part of decarbonization plans. 23    (g) Not later than 12 months before the due date of a plan, 24the utility must provide a work plan for the Commission to 25review. The work plan must outline the content of the resource 26plan to be developed by the utility, the method for assessing   HB3650- 88 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1potential resources, and the timing and extent of public 2participation. In addition, the Commission will hear comments 3on the plan at a minimum of 3 public hearings, held at times 4and locations accessible and convenient to most people, 5including at least one in an equity investment eligible 6community, which are scheduled after the utility submits its 7plan for Commission review. 8    (h) No later than July 1, 2025, gas utilities in this State 9must file the first gas infrastructure plan application for 10approval. The Commission may approve, deny, or require 11modifications to the plan. Once approved, the plan must be 12incorporated into the utility's next general rate case using 13the approved ratemaking treatments. Deviations based on 14unforeseen circumstances must be justified and approved by the 15Commission. 16    (i) The Commission shall adopt new rules, amend existing 17rules, as necessary, and dedicate sufficient resources to 18implement this Section.  19    (220 ILCS 5/24-111 new)20    Sec. 24-111. Study on gas utility financial incentive 21reform.22    (a) The General Assembly finds that:23        (1) Improving the alignment of gas utility customer 24    interests, State policy, and company interests is critical 25    to ensuring the expected decline in the use of natural gas   HB3650- 89 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    is done efficiently, safely, cost-effectively, and 2    transparently.3        (2) There is urgency around addressing increasing 4    threats from climate change and assisting communities that 5    have borne disproportionate impacts from climate change, 6    including air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and 7    energy burdens. Addressing this problem requires changes 8    to the energy used to power homes and businesses, and 9    changes to the gas utility business model under which 10    utilities in the State have traditionally functioned.11        (3) Gas utility ratepayers may face upwardly spiraling 12    bills if steps are not taken to contain costs and 13    strategically prune parts of the gas distribution network.14        (4) There is a need to encourage gas utilities to 15    innovate and find new lines of business to maintain 16    financial health as their main business, the provision of 17    fossil natural gas, winds down.18        (5) The current regulatory framework has encouraged 19    infrastructure programs that have been plagued by 20    excessive cost overruns and delays.21        (6) Discussions of performance incentive mechanisms 22    must always take into account the affordability of 23    customer rates and bills via stakeholder input.24    The General Assembly, therefore, directs the Commission to 25reform the gas utility financial incentives structure to 26further specified goals and objectives related to the   HB3650- 90 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1provision of clean, affordable heat and the advancement of an 2equitable distribution of benefits and reduction in harms in 3equity investment eligible communities and economically 4disadvantaged communities.5    (b) The Commission shall open an investigation to consider 6performance-based ratemaking tools and other financial 7mechanisms to advance the goals of affordability, equity, 8pollution reduction, energy system flexibility and 9electrification, reliability, safety, customer experience, 10cost-effectiveness, and the financial health of gas utilities 11as the gas utilities scale down their core business of 12delivering fuel-based energy through the distribution network. 13The investigation shall consider the following mechanisms, in 14addition to any others that the Commission or stakeholders 15deem necessary:16        (1) accelerated and shortened depreciation schedules;17        (2) performance metrics and benchmarking;18        (3) revenue decoupling;19        (4) cost-recovery options for nonpipeline 20    alternatives;21        (5) electrification;22        (6) networked geothermal systems;23        (7) securitization;24        (8) fuel-cost sharing;25        (9) multiyear rate plans;26        (10) performance incentive mechanisms;  HB3650- 91 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1        (11) the equalization of capital and operational 2    expenditures;3        (12) return on equity levels for different investment 4    types;5        (13) rate designs at the electric and gas nexus;6        (14) low-income rates;7        (15) luxury gas rates; and8        (16) intersectoral cost recovery.9    (c) The Commission must create a framework to evaluate 10each mechanism on its own and as part of a set of mechanisms to 11achieve the policy objectives determined by the General 12Assembly, stakeholders, and the general public after a minimum 13of 3 public hearings held at times and locations accessible 14and convenient to most people, including at least one in an 15equity investment eligible community.16    (d) The investigation shall consist of a series of 17workshops facilitated by an independent consultant that 18encourages representation from diverse stakeholders, ensures 19equitable opportunities for participation, and does not 20require formal intervention or representation by an attorney.21    (e) Any recommendations at the conclusion of the process 22must be shared with the General Assembly, and those 23recommendations already within the Commission's existing 24authorities must be adopted in the next applicable general 25rate case or relevant filing.   HB3650- 92 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1    (220 ILCS 5/24-112 new)2    Sec. 24-112. Reporting requirements.3    (a) Each gas utility in the State must report data to the 4Commission in January and July of each year that satisfy 5metrics that are set by the Commission to assess, on a system, 6segment, and neighborhood basis, the level of system safety 7and risk. The metrics must include, but are not limited to, the 8following:9        (1) the overall average leak rate of replaced and 10    to-be-replaced mains and leak-prone pipes;11        (2) the overall average leak rate using only 12    leak-prone pipe and current leaks;13        (3) the neighborhood average leak rate using only 14    remaining leak-prone pipes and current leaks; and15        (4) the neighborhood historic average leak rate using 16    leaks on leak-prone pipes for the past 2 years, on a 17    rolling basis, normalized for weather, and incorporating 18    all class 2 leaks except third-party damage.19    (b) Gas utilities must include in the report an assessment 20of whether the actions taken in the prior 3 years produced the 21best value, in terms of risk reduction, for the amounts 22expended and a prediction of how planned projects will change 23risk levels on a neighborhood, segment, and system basis. The 24report filed by Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company must also 25include updates on steps taken to implement the 26recommendations of the Final Report on Phase One of an   HB3650- 93 -LRB104 09396 AAS 19455 b1Investigation of Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company's AMRP. 2The Commission may require any other gas utility to adopt new 3and revised practices and processes by Peoples Gas Light and 4Coke Company to ensure consistency across utilities.5    (c) In its review of the data and metrics provided, the 6Commission may order adjustments in infrastructure replacement 7plans as it deems necessary to meet an acceptable level of risk 8at appropriate cost. 9    (220 ILCS 5/Art.
