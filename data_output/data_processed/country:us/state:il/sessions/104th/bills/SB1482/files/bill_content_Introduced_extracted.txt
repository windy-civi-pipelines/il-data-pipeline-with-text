19provided in the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities 20Code operates as an automatic suspension. The suspension will 21end only upon a finding by a court that the patient is no 22longer subject to involuntary admission or judicial admission 23and issues an order so finding and discharging the patient, 24and upon the recommendation of the Board to the Secretary that 25the licensee be allowed to resume the licensee's practice.26    (d) In enforcing this Section, the Department upon a   SB1482- 23 -LRB104 06901 BAB 16937 b1showing of a possible violation may compel an individual 2licensed to practice under this Act, or who has applied for 3licensure under this Act, to submit to a mental or physical 4examination, or both, which may include a substance abuse or 5sexual offender evaluation, as required by and at the expense 6of the Department.7    The Department shall specifically designate the examining 8physician licensed to practice medicine in all of its branches 9or, if applicable, the multidisciplinary team involved in 10providing the mental or physical examination or both. The 11multidisciplinary team shall be led by a physician licensed to 12practice medicine in all of its branches and may consist of one 13or more or a combination of physicians licensed to practice 14medicine in all of its branches, licensed clinical 15psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, licensed 16clinical professional counselors, and other professional and 17administrative staff. Any examining physician or member of the 18multidisciplinary team may require any person ordered to 19submit to an examination pursuant to this Section to submit to 20any additional supplemental testing deemed necessary to 21complete any examination or evaluation process, including, but 22not limited to, blood testing, urinalysis, psychological 23testing, or neuropsychological testing.24    The Department may order the examining physician or any 25member of the multidisciplinary team to provide to the 26Department any and all records, including business records,   SB1482- 24 -LRB104 06901 BAB 16937 b1that relate to the examination and evaluation, including any 2supplemental testing performed.3    The Department may order the examining physician or any 4member of the multidisciplinary team to present testimony 5concerning the mental or physical examination of the licensee 6or applicant. No information, report, record, or other 7documents in any way related to the examination shall be 8excluded by reason of any common law or statutory privilege 9relating to communications between the licensee or applicant 10and the examining physician or any member of the 11multidisciplinary team. No authorization is necessary from the 12licensee or applicant ordered to undergo an examination for 13the examining physician or any member of the multidisciplinary 14team to provide information, reports, records, or other 15documents or to provide any testimony regarding the 16examination and evaluation.17    The individual to be examined may have, at the 18individual's own expense, another physician of the 19individual's choice present during all aspects of this 20examination. However, that physician shall be present only to 21observe and may not interfere in any way with the examination.22    Failure of an individual to submit to a mental or physical 23examination, when ordered, shall result in an automatic 24suspension of the individual's license until the individual 25submits to the examination.26    If the Department finds an individual unable to practice   SB1482- 25 -LRB104 06901 BAB 16937 b1because of the reasons set forth in this Section, the 2Department may require that individual to submit to care, 3counseling, or treatment by physicians approved or designated 4by the Department, as a condition, term, or restriction for 5continued, reinstated, or renewed licensure to practice; or, 6in lieu of care, counseling, or treatment, the Department may 7file a complaint to immediately suspend, revoke, or otherwise 8discipline the license of the individual. An individual whose 9license was granted, continued, reinstated, renewed, 10disciplined, or supervised subject to such terms, conditions, 11or restrictions, and who fails to comply with such terms, 12conditions, or restrictions, shall be referred to the 13Secretary for a determination as to whether the individual 14shall have the individual's license suspended immediately, 15pending a hearing by the Department.16    In instances in which the Secretary immediately suspends 17an individual's license under this Section, a hearing on that 18individual's license must be convened by the Department within 1930 days after the suspension and completed without appreciable 20delay. The Department shall have the authority to review the 21subject individual's record of treatment and counseling 22regarding the impairment to the extent permitted by applicable 23federal statutes and regulations safeguarding the 24confidentiality of medical records.25    An individual licensed under this Act and affected under 26this Section shall be afforded an opportunity to demonstrate   SB1482- 26 -LRB104 06901 BAB 16937 b1to the Department that the individual can resume practice in 2compliance with acceptable and prevailing standards under the 3provisions of the individual's license.4    (e) An individual or organization acting in good faith, 5and not in a willful and wanton manner, in complying with this 6Section by providing a report or other information to the 7Board, by assisting in the investigation or preparation of a 8report or information, by participating in proceedings of the 9Board, or by serving as a member of the Board, shall not be 10subject to criminal prosecution or civil damages as a result 11of such actions.12    (f) Members of the Board shall be indemnified by the State 13for any actions occurring within the scope of services of the 14Board, done in good faith and not willful and wanton in nature. 15The Attorney General shall defend all such actions unless the 16Attorney General determines either that there would be a 17conflict of interest in such representation or that the 18actions complained of were not in good faith or were willful 19and wanton.20    If the Attorney General declines representation, the 21member has the right to employ counsel of the member's choice, 22whose fees shall be provided by the State, after approval by 23the Attorney General, unless there is a determination by a 24court that the member's actions were not in good faith or were 25willful and wanton.26    The member must notify the Attorney General within 7 days   SB1482- 27 -LRB104 06901 BAB 16937 b1after receipt of notice of the initiation of any action 2involving services of the Board. Failure to so notify the 3Attorney General constitutes an absolute waiver of the right 4to a defense and indemnification.5    The Attorney General shall determine, within 7 days after 6receiving such notice, whether the Attorney General will 7undertake to represent the member. 8    Section 100. Continuing education. The Department shall 9adopt rules for continuing education for persons licensed 10under this Act. The continuing education rules shall ensure 11that licensees are given the opportunity to participate in 12programs sponsored by or through their State or national 13professional organizations, hospitals, or other providers of 14continuing education. The rules shall also address waivers in 15part or in whole for good cause, including, but not limited to, 16illness or hardship. Each licensee is responsible for 17maintaining records of completion of continuing education and 18shall be prepared to produce the records when requested by the 19Department. 20    Section 105.

Upon the filing of a verified petition, the 3court with appropriate jurisdiction may issue a temporary 4restraining order without notice or bond, and may 5preliminarily and permanently enjoin such violation. If it is 6established that such person has violated or is violating the 7injunction, the court may punish the offender for contempt of 8court. Proceedings under this Section shall be in addition to 9all other remedies and penalties provided by this Act.10    (b) Whenever, in the opinion of the Department, a person 11violates any provision of this Act, the Department may issue a 12rule to show cause why an order to cease and desist should not 13be entered against such person. The rule shall clearly set 14forth the grounds relied upon by the Department and shall 15allow at least 7 days from the date of the rule to file an 16answer satisfactory to the Department. Failure to answer to 17the satisfaction of the Department shall cause an order to 18cease and desist to be issued.  19    Section 110.
