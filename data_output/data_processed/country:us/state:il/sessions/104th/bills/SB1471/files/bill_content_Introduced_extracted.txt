The arbitrator shall not establish a rebuttable 5presumption that the qualifying payment amount should be the 6total amount owed to the provider or facility by the 7combination of the issuer and the insured, beneficiary, or 8enrollee. Binding arbitration shall provide for a written 9decision within 45 days after the request is filed with the 10Department of Insurance. Both parties shall be bound by the 11arbitrator's decision.
