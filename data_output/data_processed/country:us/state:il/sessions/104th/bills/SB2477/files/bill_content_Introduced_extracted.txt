The Illinois African-American Family Commission 5Act is amended by changing Sections 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 6and 35 and by adding Section 23 as follows: 7    (20 ILCS 3903/1)8    Sec. 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the Illinois 9African American African-American Family Commission Act.10(Source: P.A. 93-867, eff. 8-5-04.) 11    (20 ILCS 3903/5)12    Sec. 5. Legislative findings. It is the policy of this 13State to promote family preservation and to preserve and 14strengthen families.15    (a) Over 12 million people live in Illinois. African 16Americans African-Americans represent 15% of the population 17and 26% of the residents living in Cook County. Despite some 18progress over the last few decades, African Americans 19African-Americans in Illinois continue to lag behind other 20racial groups relative to indicators of well-being in 21education, employment, income, and health. According to the 222000 U.S. Census, just 26% of the African American   SB2477- 2 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1African-American population over 25 years of age in Illinois 2completed their high school education; 6% held an associate's 3degree; less than 10% (9%) held a bachelor's degree; less than 45% (3%) held a master's degree; and less than one percent held 5either a professional (.8%) or doctoral (.4%) degree. 6    These levels of education attainment reflect more 7fundamental problems with retaining African Americans 8African-Americans in school. The Illinois State Board of 9Education reported that for the 2001-2002 school year, 36,373, 10or 6%, of students enrolled in public high schools dropped 11out. Thirty-nine percent of these students were African 12Americans African-Americans; 38% were White; 21% were 13Hispanic; and 2% were classified as Other. 14    Although African Americans African-Americans make up 18% 15of the high school population, they are disproportionately 16represented in the number of students who are suspended and 17expelled. In the 2001-2002 school year, 29,068 students were 18suspended from school. Forty-seven percent were White, 37% 19were African American African-American, 14% were Hispanic, and 201% were classified as Other. In regards to expulsions 21Statewide, the total number of high school students expelled 22was 1,651. Forty-three percent were African American 23African-American, 41% were White, 14% were Hispanic, and 2% 24were classified as Other. Within Chicago public schools, 448 25students were expelled. Seventy-seven of these students were 26African American African-American; 27% were White; 14% were   SB2477- 3 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1Hispanic; and 4% were classified as Other. The fact that 2African Americans African-Americans are more likely to be 3suspended or expelled from school also contributes to the high 4dropout rate among African American African-American high 5school students. 6    In addition to educational challenges, African Americans 7African-Americans face challenges in the areas of employment 8and income. In the year 2000, the unemployment rate for 9African Americans African-Americans age 16 years or older was 1015% compared to only 6% for the total Illinois population. 11Moreover, the median household income of African Americans 12African-Americans in Illinois was $31,699 compared to $46,590 13for the total Illinois population, and the percentage of 14African American African-American families below the poverty 15level in Illinois was 26% in 1999 compared to 10.7% for the 16total Illinois population in that same year. 17    Indicators of child welfare and criminal justice reveal 18still more challenges that African American African-American 19families face in Illinois. In 2000, African American 20African-American children represented 18% of children 18 years 21of age and under, but comprised 73% of children in substitute 22care. African Americans African-Americans are also 23overrepresented in the criminal justice population. Of the 24total Illinois adult inmate population in the year 2000, 65% 25were African American African-American. During this same time 26period, African American African-American youth represented   SB2477- 4 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b158% of the juvenile inmate population in Illinois. 2    While the leading causes of death among African Americans 3African-Americans are the same as those for the general 4population in Illinois, African Americans African-Americans 5have a higher rate of death per 100,000 residents. The rate of 6overall deaths per 100,000 residents among African Americans 7African-Americans in the year 2000 was 1,181; 847 for Whites; 8and 411 for those classified as Other. The rate of 9cancer-related deaths per 100,000 residents by racial or 10ethnic groups in 2000 was: 278 African Americans 11African-Americans; 206 Whites; and 110 of those classified as 12Other. The rate of diabetes-related deaths per 100,000 13residents among African Americans African-Americans in 2000 14was 41 compared to 23 for Whites and 13 for those classified as 15Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents by heart 16disease among African Americans African-Americans in 2000 was 17352 compared to 257 for Whites and 120 for those classified as 18Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents by stroke 19among African Americans African-Americans in 2000 was 75; 60 20for Whites; and 35 for those classified as Other. 21    African Americans African-Americans had higher rates of 22smoking and obesity than other racial groups in Illinois in 232001. African Americans African-Americans accounted for more 24of the new adult/adolescent AIDS cases, cumulative 25adult/adolescent AIDS cases, and number of people living with 26AIDS than other racial groups in Illinois in the year 2002.   SB2477- 5 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1Still, 23% of uninsured persons in Illinois are African 2American African-American. 3    (b) The Illinois African American African-American Family 4Commission continues to be an essential key to promoting the 5preservation and strengthening of families. As of January 1, 62015 (the effective date of Public Act 98-693), just under 13 7million people live in Illinois. African Americans 8African-Americans represent 15% of the population and 25% of 9the residents living in Cook County. Despite some progress 10over the last few decades, African Americans African-Americans 11in Illinois continue to lag behind other racial groups 12relative to indicators of well-being in education, employment, 13income, and health. According to the 2010 federal decennial 14census: just 28% of the African American African-American 15population over 25 years of age in Illinois completed their 16high school education; 36% had some college or an associate's 17degree; less than 12% held a bachelor's degree; less than 8% 18held either a graduate or professional degree.19    These levels of education attainment reflect more 20fundamental problems with retaining African Americans 21African-Americans in school. The State Board of Education 22reported that for the 2010-2011 school year, 18,210, or 2.77%, 23of students enrolled in public high schools dropped out. 39.3% 24of these students were African Americans African-Americans; 2532.6% were White; 24.2% were Hispanic; and 2% were classified 26as Other.  SB2477- 6 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1    Although African Americans African-Americans make up 20% 2of the high school population, they are disproportionately 3represented in the number of students who are suspended and 4expelled. In the 2011-2012 school year, 29,928 students were 5suspended from school. 36% were White, 34% were African 6American African-American, 26% were Hispanic, and 4% were 7classified as Other. With regard to expulsions statewide, the 8total number of high school students expelled was 982. 37% 9were African American African-American, 41% were White, 21% 10were Hispanic, and 2% were classified as Other. Within Chicago 11public schools, 294 students were expelled. 80% of these 12students were African American African-American; none were 13White; 17% were Hispanic; and 3% were classified as Other. The 14fact that African Americans African-Americans are more likely 15to be suspended or expelled from school also contributes to 16the high dropout rate among African American African-American 17high school students.18    In addition to educational challenges, African Americans 19African-Americans face challenges in the areas of employment 20and income. In the year 2010, the unemployment rate for 21African Americans African-Americans age 16 years or older was 2216% compared to only 9% for the total Illinois population. 23Moreover, the median household income of African Americans 24African-Americans in Illinois was $34,874 compared to $60,433 25for the total Illinois population, and the percentage of 26African American African-American families below the poverty   SB2477- 7 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1level in Illinois was 32% in 2012 compared to 15% for the total 2Illinois population in that same year.3    Indicators of child welfare and criminal justice reveal 4still more challenges that African American African-American 5families face in Illinois. In 2010, African American 6African-American children represented 14% of children 18 years 7of age and under, but comprised 56% of children in substitute 8care. African Americans African-Americans are also 9overrepresented in the criminal justice population. Of the 10total Illinois adult inmate population in the year 2012, 57% 11were African American African-American. During this same time 12period, African American African-American youth represented 1366% of the juvenile inmate population in Illinois.14    While the leading causes of death among African Americans 15African-Americans are the same as those for the general 16population in Illinois, African Americans African-Americans 17have a higher rate of death per 100,000 residents. The rate of 18overall deaths per 100,000 residents among African Americans 19African-Americans in the year 2010 was 898; 741 for Whites; 20and 458 for those classified as Other. The rate of 21cancer-related deaths per 100,000 residents by racial or 22ethnic groups in 2010 was 216 for African Americans 23African-Americans; 179 for Whites; and 124 for those 24classified as Other. The rate of diabetes-related deaths per 25100,000 residents among African Americans African-Americans in 262010 was 114 compared to 66 for Whites and 75 for those   SB2477- 8 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1classified as Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents 2by heart disease among African Americans African-Americans in 32010 was 232 compared to 179 for Whites and 121 for those 4classified as Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents 5by stroke among African Americans African-Americans in 2010 6was 108; 73 for Whites; and 56 for those classified as Other.7    African Americans African-Americans had higher rates of 8smoking and obesity than other racial groups in Illinois in 92013. African Americans African-Americans accounted for more 10of the new adult/adolescent AIDS cases, cumulative 11adult/adolescent AIDS cases, and number of people living with 12AIDS than other racial groups in Illinois in the year 2013. 13Still, 24% of uninsured persons in Illinois are African 14American African-American. 15    (c) These huge disparities in education, employment, 16income, child welfare, criminal justice, and health 17demonstrate the tremendous challenges facing the African 18American African-American family in Illinois. These challenges 19are severe. There is a need for government, child and family 20advocates, and other key stakeholders to create and implement 21public policies to address the health and social crises facing 22African American African-American families. The development of 23given solutions clearly transcends any one State agency and 24requires a coordinated effort. The Illinois African American 25African-American Family Commission shall assist State agencies 26with this task.   SB2477- 9 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1    The African American African-American Family Commission 2was created in October 1994 by Executive Order to assist the 3Illinois Department of Children and Family Services in 4developing and implementing programs and public policies that 5affect the State's child welfare system. The Commission has a 6proven track record of bringing State agencies, community 7providers, and consumers together to address child welfare 8issues. The ability of the Commission to address the 9above-mentioned health issues, community factors, and the 10personal well-being of African American African-American 11families and children has been limited due to the Executive 12Order's focus on child welfare. It is apparent that broader 13issues of health, mental health, criminal justice, education, 14and economic development also directly affect the health and 15well-being of African American African-American families and 16children. Accordingly, the role of the Illinois African 17American African-American Family Commission is hereby expanded 18to encompass working relationships with every department, 19agency, and commission within State government if any of its 20activities impact African American African-American children 21and families. The focus of the Commission is hereby 22restructured and shall exist by legislative mandate to engage 23State agencies in its efforts to preserve and strengthen 24African American African-American families. 25(Source: P.A. 103-154, eff. 6-30-23.)   SB2477- 10 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1    (20 ILCS 3903/10)2    Sec. 10.

The Advisory Commission on Reducing the 18Disproportionate Representation of African-American Children 19in Foster Care Act is amended by changing Section 5 as follows: 20    (20 ILCS 4104/5)21    Sec. 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds the 22following:23        (1) In 1994 the Illinois African American 24    African-American Family Commission was created by   SB2477- 43 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1    Executive Order to assist the Department of Children and 2    Family Services in developing and implementing programs 3    and public policies that affect the State's child welfare 4    system.5        (2) However, in 2004 the Commission was renamed and 6    its role expanded to focus on the development of services 7    and programs that aim to strengthen and preserve the 8    social and economic well-being of African-American 9    families.10        (3) This holistic approach to strengthening 11    African-American families and communities, though 12    necessary, has yet to adequately address the 13    disproportionate number of African-American children in 14    foster care. 15        (4) According to a 2017 fact sheet published by Child 16    Trends, in 2015 African-American children represented 50% 17    of Illinois' foster care population even though they only 18    make up 15% of the State's general child population. 19        (5) In contrast, white children represented 38% of the 20    foster care population in 2015 even though they make up 21    52% of the State's general child population. 22        (6) Hispanic children are underrepresented in 23    Illinois' foster care system as they only accounted for 9% 24    of the foster care population in 2015 despite making up 25    24% of the general child population. 26        (7) Unfortunately, the disproportionate number of   SB2477- 44 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1    African-American children in foster care is a national 2    dilemma. 3        (8) According to an April 13, 2020 report published by 4    the Annie E. Casey Foundation's KIDS COUNT Data Center, 5    even though "the share of children who are black and in 6    foster care remains much smaller than it was nearly a 7    decade ago . . . black children are still overrepresented 8    among youth in foster care relative to the general 9    population" as they account for 23% of all kids in foster 10    care even though they only represent 14% of the total 11    child population in the United States. 12        (9) In light of these grim statistics, the General 13    Assembly finds the need for a separate advisory commission 14    that is exclusively focused on identifying those causes 15    and factors that contribute to the overrepresentation of 16    African-American children in Illinois' foster care system 17    and the policy measures needed to safely reduce the number 18    of African-American children in foster care and keep them 19    with their families.20(Source: P.A. 102-470, eff. 8-20-21.) 21    Section 45.

The fact that 2African Americans African-Americans are more likely to be 3suspended or expelled from school also contributes to the high 4dropout rate among African American African-American high 5school students. 6    In addition to educational challenges, African Americans 7African-Americans face challenges in the areas of employment 8and income. In the year 2000, the unemployment rate for 9African Americans African-Americans age 16 years or older was 1015% compared to only 6% for the total Illinois population. 11Moreover, the median household income of African Americans 12African-Americans in Illinois was $31,699 compared to $46,590 13for the total Illinois population, and the percentage of 14African American African-American families below the poverty 15level in Illinois was 26% in 1999 compared to 10.7% for the 16total Illinois population in that same year. 17    Indicators of child welfare and criminal justice reveal 18still more challenges that African American African-American 19families face in Illinois. In 2000, African American 20African-American children represented 18% of children 18 years 21of age and under, but comprised 73% of children in substitute 22care. African Americans African-Americans are also 23overrepresented in the criminal justice population. Of the 24total Illinois adult inmate population in the year 2000, 65% 25were African American African-American. During this same time 26period, African American African-American youth represented   SB2477- 4 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b158% of the juvenile inmate population in Illinois. 2    While the leading causes of death among African Americans 3African-Americans are the same as those for the general 4population in Illinois, African Americans African-Americans 5have a higher rate of death per 100,000 residents. The rate of 6overall deaths per 100,000 residents among African Americans 7African-Americans in the year 2000 was 1,181; 847 for Whites; 8and 411 for those classified as Other. The rate of 9cancer-related deaths per 100,000 residents by racial or 10ethnic groups in 2000 was: 278 African Americans 11African-Americans; 206 Whites; and 110 of those classified as 12Other. The rate of diabetes-related deaths per 100,000 13residents among African Americans African-Americans in 2000 14was 41 compared to 23 for Whites and 13 for those classified as 15Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents by heart 16disease among African Americans African-Americans in 2000 was 17352 compared to 257 for Whites and 120 for those classified as 18Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents by stroke 19among African Americans African-Americans in 2000 was 75; 60 20for Whites; and 35 for those classified as Other. 21    African Americans African-Americans had higher rates of 22smoking and obesity than other racial groups in Illinois in 232001. African Americans African-Americans accounted for more 24of the new adult/adolescent AIDS cases, cumulative 25adult/adolescent AIDS cases, and number of people living with 26AIDS than other racial groups in Illinois in the year 2002.   SB2477- 5 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1Still, 23% of uninsured persons in Illinois are African 2American African-American. 3    (b) The Illinois African American African-American Family 4Commission continues to be an essential key to promoting the 5preservation and strengthening of families. As of January 1, 62015 (the effective date of Public Act 98-693), just under 13 7million people live in Illinois. African Americans 8African-Americans represent 15% of the population and 25% of 9the residents living in Cook County. Despite some progress 10over the last few decades, African Americans African-Americans 11in Illinois continue to lag behind other racial groups 12relative to indicators of well-being in education, employment, 13income, and health. According to the 2010 federal decennial 14census: just 28% of the African American African-American 15population over 25 years of age in Illinois completed their 16high school education; 36% had some college or an associate's 17degree; less than 12% held a bachelor's degree; less than 8% 18held either a graduate or professional degree.19    These levels of education attainment reflect more 20fundamental problems with retaining African Americans 21African-Americans in school. The State Board of Education 22reported that for the 2010-2011 school year, 18,210, or 2.77%, 23of students enrolled in public high schools dropped out. 39.3% 24of these students were African Americans African-Americans; 2532.6% were White; 24.2% were Hispanic; and 2% were classified 26as Other.  SB2477- 6 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1    Although African Americans African-Americans make up 20% 2of the high school population, they are disproportionately 3represented in the number of students who are suspended and 4expelled. In the 2011-2012 school year, 29,928 students were 5suspended from school. 36% were White, 34% were African 6American African-American, 26% were Hispanic, and 4% were 7classified as Other. With regard to expulsions statewide, the 8total number of high school students expelled was 982. 37% 9were African American African-American, 41% were White, 21% 10were Hispanic, and 2% were classified as Other. Within Chicago 11public schools, 294 students were expelled. 80% of these 12students were African American African-American; none were 13White; 17% were Hispanic; and 3% were classified as Other. The 14fact that African Americans African-Americans are more likely 15to be suspended or expelled from school also contributes to 16the high dropout rate among African American African-American 17high school students.18    In addition to educational challenges, African Americans 19African-Americans face challenges in the areas of employment 20and income. In the year 2010, the unemployment rate for 21African Americans African-Americans age 16 years or older was 2216% compared to only 9% for the total Illinois population. 23Moreover, the median household income of African Americans 24African-Americans in Illinois was $34,874 compared to $60,433 25for the total Illinois population, and the percentage of 26African American African-American families below the poverty   SB2477- 7 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1level in Illinois was 32% in 2012 compared to 15% for the total 2Illinois population in that same year.3    Indicators of child welfare and criminal justice reveal 4still more challenges that African American African-American 5families face in Illinois. In 2010, African American 6African-American children represented 14% of children 18 years 7of age and under, but comprised 56% of children in substitute 8care. African Americans African-Americans are also 9overrepresented in the criminal justice population. Of the 10total Illinois adult inmate population in the year 2012, 57% 11were African American African-American. During this same time 12period, African American African-American youth represented 1366% of the juvenile inmate population in Illinois.14    While the leading causes of death among African Americans 15African-Americans are the same as those for the general 16population in Illinois, African Americans African-Americans 17have a higher rate of death per 100,000 residents. The rate of 18overall deaths per 100,000 residents among African Americans 19African-Americans in the year 2010 was 898; 741 for Whites; 20and 458 for those classified as Other. The rate of 21cancer-related deaths per 100,000 residents by racial or 22ethnic groups in 2010 was 216 for African Americans 23African-Americans; 179 for Whites; and 124 for those 24classified as Other. The rate of diabetes-related deaths per 25100,000 residents among African Americans African-Americans in 262010 was 114 compared to 66 for Whites and 75 for those   SB2477- 8 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1classified as Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents 2by heart disease among African Americans African-Americans in 32010 was 232 compared to 179 for Whites and 121 for those 4classified as Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents 5by stroke among African Americans African-Americans in 2010 6was 108; 73 for Whites; and 56 for those classified as Other.7    African Americans African-Americans had higher rates of 8smoking and obesity than other racial groups in Illinois in 92013. African Americans African-Americans accounted for more 10of the new adult/adolescent AIDS cases, cumulative 11adult/adolescent AIDS cases, and number of people living with 12AIDS than other racial groups in Illinois in the year 2013. 13Still, 24% of uninsured persons in Illinois are African 14American African-American. 15    (c) These huge disparities in education, employment, 16income, child welfare, criminal justice, and health 17demonstrate the tremendous challenges facing the African 18American African-American family in Illinois. These challenges 19are severe. There is a need for government, child and family 20advocates, and other key stakeholders to create and implement 21public policies to address the health and social crises facing 22African American African-American families. The development of 23given solutions clearly transcends any one State agency and 24requires a coordinated effort. The Illinois African American 25African-American Family Commission shall assist State agencies 26with this task.   SB2477- 9 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1    The African American African-American Family Commission 2was created in October 1994 by Executive Order to assist the 3Illinois Department of Children and Family Services in 4developing and implementing programs and public policies that 5affect the State's child welfare system. The Commission has a 6proven track record of bringing State agencies, community 7providers, and consumers together to address child welfare 8issues. The ability of the Commission to address the 9above-mentioned health issues, community factors, and the 10personal well-being of African American African-American 11families and children has been limited due to the Executive 12Order's focus on child welfare. It is apparent that broader 13issues of health, mental health, criminal justice, education, 14and economic development also directly affect the health and 15well-being of African American African-American families and 16children. Accordingly, the role of the Illinois African 17American African-American Family Commission is hereby expanded 18to encompass working relationships with every department, 19agency, and commission within State government if any of its 20activities impact African American African-American children 21and families. The focus of the Commission is hereby 22restructured and shall exist by legislative mandate to engage 23State agencies in its efforts to preserve and strengthen 24African American African-American families. 25(Source: P.A. 103-154, eff. 6-30-23.)   SB2477- 10 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1    (20 ILCS 3903/10)2    Sec. 10.

The Advisory Commission on Reducing the 18Disproportionate Representation of African-American Children 19in Foster Care Act is amended by changing Section 5 as follows: 20    (20 ILCS 4104/5)21    Sec. 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds the 22following:23        (1) In 1994 the Illinois African American 24    African-American Family Commission was created by   SB2477- 43 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1    Executive Order to assist the Department of Children and 2    Family Services in developing and implementing programs 3    and public policies that affect the State's child welfare 4    system.5        (2) However, in 2004 the Commission was renamed and 6    its role expanded to focus on the development of services 7    and programs that aim to strengthen and preserve the 8    social and economic well-being of African-American 9    families.10        (3) This holistic approach to strengthening 11    African-American families and communities, though 12    necessary, has yet to adequately address the 13    disproportionate number of African-American children in 14    foster care. 15        (4) According to a 2017 fact sheet published by Child 16    Trends, in 2015 African-American children represented 50% 17    of Illinois' foster care population even though they only 18    make up 15% of the State's general child population. 19        (5) In contrast, white children represented 38% of the 20    foster care population in 2015 even though they make up 21    52% of the State's general child population. 22        (6) Hispanic children are underrepresented in 23    Illinois' foster care system as they only accounted for 9% 24    of the foster care population in 2015 despite making up 25    24% of the general child population. 26        (7) Unfortunately, the disproportionate number of   SB2477- 44 -LRB104 11836 SPS 21926 b1    African-American children in foster care is a national 2    dilemma. 3        (8) According to an April 13, 2020 report published by 4    the Annie E. Casey Foundation's KIDS COUNT Data Center, 5    even though "the share of children who are black and in 6    foster care remains much smaller than it was nearly a 7    decade ago . . . black children are still overrepresented 8    among youth in foster care relative to the general 9    population" as they account for 23% of all kids in foster 10    care even though they only represent 14% of the total 11    child population in the United States. 12        (9) In light of these grim statistics, the General 13    Assembly finds the need for a separate advisory commission 14    that is exclusively focused on identifying those causes 15    and factors that contribute to the overrepresentation of 16    African-American children in Illinois' foster care system 17    and the policy measures needed to safely reduce the number 18    of African-American children in foster care and keep them 19    with their families.20(Source: P.A. 102-470, eff. 8-20-21.) 21    Section 45.
