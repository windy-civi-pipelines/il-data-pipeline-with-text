Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Micromobility Fire Safety Act. 6    Section 5. Findings.7    (a) Micromobility devices, such as electric bicycles, 8electric scooters, and personal e-mobility devices, like 9hoverboards and electric unicycles, are increasingly popular, 10battery-powered transportation options for American consumers 11and workers.12    (b) As battery-powered devices, micromobility devices can 13be a fire and explosion safety hazard if they do not meet 14safety standards.15    (c) For micromobility devices that do not meet safety 16standards, there is a heightened risk of the lithium-ion 17batteries that power these devices experiencing a cascading 18failure where the overwhelming generation of heat triggers the 19release of toxic gases, explosions, or the spread of flames.20    (d) In 2021 and 2022, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 21Commission received reports from 39 states of at least 208 22fires or overheating events that were associated with electric 23bicycles and personal e-mobility devices that caused 19   SB2247 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 07607 SPS 17651 b1fatalities.2    (e) There are consensus standards available that mitigate 3the battery and electrical system hazards of electric bicycles 4and personal e-mobility devices that can cause fires.5    (f) In 2022, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission 6issued a letter to the manufacturers, importers, distributors, 7and retailers of electric bicycles and personal e-mobility 8devices urging these products to be "designed, manufactured, 9and certified" to the appropriate UL standard as 10"manufacturing these products in compliance with the 11applicable UL standards significantly reduces the risk of 12injuries and deaths from micromobility device fires."13    (g) In 2023, after 216 micromobility device-related fires 14in 2022 that caused 147 injuries and 6 fatalities, New York 15City enacted legislation requiring micromobility device and 16battery certification to the applicable UL safety standards by 17an ISO-accredited laboratory. 18    Section 10.
