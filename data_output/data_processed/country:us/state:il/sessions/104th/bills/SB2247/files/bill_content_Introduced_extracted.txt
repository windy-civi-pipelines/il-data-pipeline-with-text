Ram Villivalam SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act    Creates the Micromobility Fire Safety Act. Provides that all micromobility devices and traction batteries for micromobility devices manufactured, distributed, sold, or offered for lease or rent in the State shall meet specified safety standards.LRB104 07607 SPS 17651 b  A BILL FOR SB2247LRB104 07607 SPS 17651 b1    AN ACT concerning business. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Micromobility Fire Safety Act. 6    Section 5. Findings.7    (a) Micromobility devices, such as electric bicycles, 8electric scooters, and personal e-mobility devices, like 9hoverboards and electric unicycles, are increasingly popular, 10battery powered transportation options for American consumers 11and workers.12    (b) As battery powered devices, micromobility devices can 13be a fire and explosion safety hazard if they do not meet 14safety standards.15    (c) For micromobility devices that do not meet safety 16standards, there is a heightened risk of the lithium-ion 17batteries that power these devices experiencing a cascading 18failure where the overwhelming generation of heat triggers the 19release of toxic gases, explosions, or the spread of flames.20    (d) In 2021 and 2022, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety 21Commission received reports from 39 states of at least 208 22fires or overheating events that were associated with electric 23bicycles and personal e-mobility devices that caused 19   SB2247- 2 -LRB104 07607 SPS 17651 b1fatalities.2    (e) There are consensus standards available that mitigate 3the battery and electrical system hazards of electric bicycles 4and personal e-mobility devices that can cause fires, 5including standards published Underwriters Laboratories and 6the International Organization for Standardization.7    (f) In 2022, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission 8issued a letter to the manufacturers, importers, distributors, 9and retailers of electric bicycles and personal e-mobility 10devices urging these products be "designed, manufactured, and 11certified" to the appropriate UL standard as "manufacturing 12these products in compliance with the applicable UL standards 13significantly reduces the risk of injuries and deaths from 14micromobility device fires."15    (g) In 2022, after 216 micromobility device related fires 16in 2022 that caused 147 injuries and 6 fatalities, New York 17City enacted legislation requiring micromobility device 18certification to the applicable UL safety standards.19    (h) Studies have demonstrated that without conformity 20assessment performed by a nationally-accredited independent 21third-party certification organization, products are less 22likely to meet product safety standards. Product safety 23certification ensures safety is a level playing field in the 24market. 25    Section 10. Definitions. As used in this Act:  SB2247- 3 -LRB104 07607 SPS 17651 b1    "Certification" means the attestation by the certification 2body, indicated by the certification body's certification mark 3on the equipment, device, or product, that the equipment, 4device, or product has been evaluated and tested and found to 5conform to relevant standards.6    "Certification body" means an independent third-party 7organization providing certification for micromobility 8products that:9            (1) is recognized by the U.S. Occupational Safety 10        and Health Administration as a nationally-recognized 11        testing laboratory; and12            (2) has received ISO/IEC 17065 accreditation from 13        an independent accreditation body that is a member of 14        the International Accreditation Forum.15    "Certification mark" means a mark of conformity owned by a 16certification body and registered with the United States 17Patent and Trademark Office that is visible and affixed to a 18certified equipment, device, or product.19    "Electric bicycle" means a 2-wheeled or 3-wheeled 20electrical-mechanical device provided with functional pedals 21that includes one or more electric motors to either assist the 22rider when pedaling or provide motive power to the wheels when 23the rider is not pedaling.24    "ICS codes" mean codes published by the International 25Organization for Standardization (ISO) that serve as a system 26for categorizing the types of standards under the   SB2247- 4 -LRB104 07607 SPS 17651 b1International Classification for Standards.2    "Micromobility devices" means the term inclusive of 3e-bike, e-scooters, and other types of personal e-mobility 4devices.5    "Nationally-recognized testing laboratory" means an 6organization that meets the qualifications provided in 29 CFR 71910.7(b) and is recognized as a nationally-recognized testing 8laboratory by the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational 9Safety and Health Administration's Nationally-Recognized 10Testing Laboratory (NRTL) Program.11    "Personal e-mobility device" means a consumer mobility 12device intended for a single rider with a rechargeable 13electric drive train that propels the rider, and which may be 14provided with a handle for grasping while riding. This device 15may or may not be self-balancing and may or may not be seated.16    "Traction battery" means a rechargeable battery used to 17power the electric motors of the micromobility product.18    "UL standards" means standards published by Underwriters 19Laboratories for testing and manufacturing products to ensure 20their safety, security, and sustainability. 21    Section 15. Requirements for manufacturer; distribution, 22sale, lease, and rent of micromobility devices and traction 23batteries. All micromobility devices and traction batteries 24for micromobility devices manufactured, distributed, sold, or 25offered for lease or rent in this State shall meet safety   SB2247- 5 -LRB104 07607 SPS 17651 b1standards as follows:2        (1) electric bicycles shall:3            (A) be evaluated, tested, and certified to UL 2849 4        by a nationally-recognized testing laboratory with UL 5        2849 included in its scope of recognition under the 6        Nationally-Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) 7        Program; and8            (B) be affixed with a certification mark from a 9        certifying body with ICS 43.150, ICS 43.120, and UL 10        2849 included in the scope of accreditation;11        (2) personal e-mobility devices shall:12            (A) be evaluated, tested, and certified to UL 2272 13        by a nationally-recognized testing laboratory with UL 14        2849 included in its scope of recognition under the 15        Nationally-Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) 16        Program; and17            (B) be affixed with a certification mark from a 18        certifying body with ICS 29.220.99, ICS 43.120, and UL 19        2272 included in its scope of accreditation; and 20        (3) traction batteries for use in micromobility 21    devices shall:22            (A) be evaluated, tested, and certified to UL 2271 23        by a nationally-recognized testing laboratory with UL 24        2849 included in its scope of recognition under the 25        Nationally-Recognized Testing Laboratory (NRTL) 26        Program; and  SB2247- 6 -LRB104 07607 SPS 17651 b1            (B) be affixed with a certification mark from a 2        certifying body with ICS 29.220.99, ICS 43.120, and UL 3        2271 included in its scope of accreditation.
