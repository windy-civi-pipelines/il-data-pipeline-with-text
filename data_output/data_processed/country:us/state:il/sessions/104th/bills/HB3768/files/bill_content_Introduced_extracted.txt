The Illinois Insurance Code is amended by 5adding Article XLVIII as follows: 6    (215 ILCS 5/Art. XLVIII heading new)7ARTICLE XLVIII. OWNER-CONTROLLED INSURANCE PROGRAM 8    (215 ILCS 5/1800 new)9    Sec. 1800. Findings. The General Assembly finds the 10following: 11    (1) Small contractors, including many small businesses, 12minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, and 13businesses owned by persons with disabilities often struggle 14to find competitive insurance options that meet the standards 15required for public construction projects, and these 16businesses particularly struggle to obtain insurance options 17that are affordable. High insurance premiums make these 18businesses less competitive as prime contractors and 19subcontractors because the contractors and subcontractors pass 20along increased costs to public owners in the form of higher 21bid prices.22    (2) Under an Owner-Controlled Insurance Program, a single   HB3768- 2 -LRB104 09321 BAB 19379 b1policy held by the owner covers the owner and contractors of 2all levels for the entire construction project or group of 3projects, which reduces barriers by allowing contractors that 4historically struggle to obtain insurance at an affordable and 5competitive price to not only bid but be awarded the contract.6    (3) In a conventional project structure, in which many 7contractors provide insurance to the public owner, disputes 8between different carriers over liability and coverage consume 9considerable time and resources, escalating costs. In 10contrast, an Owner-Controlled Insurance Program can provide 11more efficient coverage through a single policy. Further, when 12a public owner implements an Owner-Controlled Insurance 13Program, the owner is relieved of the burden of monitoring 14that each contractor maintains coverage if the project 15continues beyond the length of an applicable policy.16    (4) Owners, in this case, the State of Illinois, can 17attain economies of scale when using an Owner-Controlled 18Insurance Program versus a traditional insurance approach.19    (5) Owner-Controlled Insurance Programs also create safe 20worksites. In contrast to a conventional project structure 21wherein contractors and subcontractors hold multiple policies 22with separate safety requirements, Owner-Controlled Insurance 23Programs typically harmonize safety standards across 24contractors. Additionally, Owner-Controlled Insurance 25Programs can allow for an integrated data platform to 26facilitate safety data collection and review.  HB3768- 3 -LRB104 09321 BAB 19379 b1    (6) It is in the interest of the State of Illinois to 2ensure efficient and uniform insurance coverage required 3throughout the duration of construction agencies projects.4    (7) It is in the interest of the State of Illinois to use 5economies of scale to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.6    (8) It is necessary to reduce barriers of entry to assist 7in the development of new and emerging construction 8contractors.9    (9) It is in the best interest of the State of Illinois to 10promote safe worksites  11    (215 ILCS 5/1805 new)12    Sec. 1805.
