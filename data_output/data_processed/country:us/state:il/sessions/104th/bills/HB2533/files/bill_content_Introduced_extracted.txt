The total amount of all of the appraisers' fees to be 16included in the transaction and closing costs shall not exceed 17the greater of $15,000 or 5% of the appraised value of the 18water or sewer utility being acquired. This rate base 19treatment shall not be deemed to violate this Act, including, 20but not limited to, any Sections in Articles VIII and IX of 21this Act that might be affected by this Section. Any 22acquisition of a water or sewer utility that affects the 23cumulative base rates of the large public utility's existing 24ratepayers in the tariff group into which the water or sewer 25utility is to be combined by less than (1) 2.5% at the time of 26the acquisition for any single acquisition completed under   HB2533- 7 -LRB104 08136 AAS 18182 b1this Section or (2) 5% for all acquisitions completed under 2this Section before the Commission's final order in the next 3rate case shall not be deemed to violate Section 7-204 or any 4other provision of this Act.5    In the Commission's order that approves the large public 6utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 7Commission shall issue its decision establishing (1) the 8ratemaking rate base of the water or sewer utility; (2) the 9district or tariff group with which the water or sewer utility 10shall be combined for ratemaking purposes, if such combination 11has been proposed by the large public utility; and (3) the 12rates to be charged to customers in the water or sewer utility.13    (e) If the water or sewer utility being acquired is owned 14by the State or any political subdivision thereof, then the 15water or sewer utility must inform the public of the terms of 16its acquisition by the large public utility by (1) holding a 17public meeting prior to the acquisition and (2) causing to be 18published, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 19that the water or sewer utility operates, a notice setting 20forth the terms of its acquisition by the large public utility 21and options that shall be available to assist customers to pay 22their bills after the acquisition. 23     At the next election following the public meeting and 24notice required by this subsection (e), a referendum, subject 25to the requirements of Section 16-7 of the Election Code, 26shall be placed on the ballot for all electors within the area   HB2533- 8 -LRB104 08136 AAS 18182 b1the water or sewer utility operates in substantially the 2following form: 3        May the (name of large public utility) acquire the 4    (name of water or sewer utility) under the terms of 5    acquisition published in (name of newspaper) on (date)?6    The votes shall be recorded as "Yes" or "No". 7    If a majority of the electors voting on the referendum 8within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in 9favor of the referendum, then the acquisition may continue as 10provided in this Section. If less than a majority of the 11electors voting on the referendum within the service area of 12the water or sewer utility vote in favor of the referendum, the 13Commission shall not approve the large public utility's 14acquisition of the water or sewer utility. 15    (f) The large public utility may recommend the district or 16tariff group of which the water or sewer utility shall, for 17ratemaking purposes, become a part after the acquisition, or 18may recommend a lesser rate for the water or sewer utility. If 19the large public utility recommends a lesser rate, it shall 20submit to the Commission its proposed rate schedule and the 21proposed final tariff group for the acquired water or sewer 22utility. The Commission's approved district or tariff group or 23rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's 24recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 25contrary to the public interest.26    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new   HB2533- 9 -LRB104 08136 AAS 18182 b1rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 2next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer 3utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 4district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 5lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and 6approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided, 7that, if the application of such rates of the large public 8utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 9using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 10total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 11utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 12the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 13the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 14reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 15results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 16or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 17sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 18latest median household income as reported by the United 19States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 20county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 21potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained, 22a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned. These 23rates shall not be deemed to violate this Act including, but 24not limited to, Section 9-101 and any other applicable 25Sections in Articles VIII and IX of this Act. The Commission 26shall issue its decision establishing the rates effective for   HB2533- 10 -LRB104 08136 AAS 18182 b1the water or sewer utility immediately following an 2acquisition in its order approving the acquisition.3    (h) In the acquiring large public utility's next rate 4case, the water or sewer utility and the district or tariff 5group ordered by the Commission and their costs of service may 6be combined under the same rate tariff. This rate tariff shall 7be based on allocation of costs of service of the acquired 8water or sewer utility and the large public utility's district 9or tariff group ordered by the Commission and utilizing a rate 10design that does not distinguish among customers on the basis 11of utility service source or type. This rate tariff shall not 12be deemed to violate this Act including, but not limited to, 13Section 9-101 of this Act. In the acquiring large public 14utility's 2 rate cases after an acquisition, but in no 15subsequent rate case, the large public utility may file a rate 16tariff for a water or sewer utility acquired under this 17Section that establishes lesser rates than the district or 18tariff group into which the water or sewer utility is to be 19combined. Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 20Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 21the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's 22existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than 232.5%. 24    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 25public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 26cost for financing set at the large public utility's   HB2533- 11 -LRB104 08136 AAS 18182 b1determined rate for allowance for funds used during 2construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax 3gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 4was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 5has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 6the time the rates are implemented in the large public 7utility's next rate case.8    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 9utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 10for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 11was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 12has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 13the time the rates are implemented in the large public 14utility's next rate case.15    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 16public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 17acquisition of water or sewer utilities. Any petitions filed 18with the Commission related to the acquisitions described in 19this Section, including petitions seeking approvals or 20certificates required by this Act, shall be deemed approved 21unless the Commission issues its final order within 11 months 22after the date the large public utility filed its initial 23petition. This Section shall only apply to utilities providing 24water or sewer service and shall not be construed in any manner 25to apply to electric corporations, natural gas corporations, 26or any other utility subject to this Act.  HB2533- 12 -LRB104 08136 AAS 18182 b1    (k) Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a party from 2declining to proceed with an acquisition or be deemed as 3establishing the final purchase price of an acquisition.4    (l) In the Commission's order that approves the large 5utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 6Commission shall address each aspect of the acquisition 7transaction for which approval is required under the Act. 8    (m) Any contractor or subcontractor that performs work on 9a water or sewer utility acquired by a large public utility 10under this Section shall be a responsible bidder as described 11in Section 30-22 of the Illinois Procurement Code. The 12contractor or subcontractor shall submit evidence of meeting 13the requirements to be a responsible bidder as described in 14Section 30-22 to the water or sewer utility. Any new water or 15sewer facility built as a result of the acquisition shall 16require the contractor to enter into a project labor 17agreement. The large public utility acquiring the water or 18sewer utility shall offer employee positions to qualified 19employees of the acquired water or sewer utility. 20    (n) This Section is repealed on June 1, 2028. 21(Source: P.A. 102-149, eff. 1-1-22.)
