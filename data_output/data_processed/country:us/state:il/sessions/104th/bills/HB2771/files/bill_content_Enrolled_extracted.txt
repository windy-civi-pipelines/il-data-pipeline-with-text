Such notice shall be   HB2771 Enrolled- 20 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b1issued at least 30 days prior to any period in which the 2assessment will be adjusted. Any additional assessment owed by 3the hospital or refund owed to the hospital shall be uniformly 4applied to the assessment owed by the hospital in monthly 5installments for the subsequent semi-annual period or calendar 6year. If no assessment is owed in the subsequent year, any 7amount owed by the hospital or refund due to the hospital, 8shall be paid in a lump sum. If the calculation that is 9computed under this Section could result in a decrease in the 10Department's federal financial participation percentage for 11payments authorized under Section 5A-12.7, then the Department 12shall instead apply a uniform percentage reduction to the 13payment rates outlined in subsection (r) of Section 5A-12.7 14for all classes as defined in subsections (g) and (h) of 15Section 5A-12.7 by an amount no more than necessary to 16maximize federal reimbursement. 17    (3) The Department shall publish all details of the 18Assessment Adjustment calculation performed each year on its 19website within 30 days of completing the calculation, and also 20submit the details of the Assessment Adjustment calculation as 21part of the Department's annual report to the General 22Assembly. 23    (b-8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, 24the Department shall reduce the assessments imposed on each 25hospital under subsections (a) and (b-5) by the uniform 26percentage necessary to reduce the total assessment imposed on   HB2771 Enrolled- 21 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b1all hospitals by an aggregate amount of $240,000,000, with 2such reduction being applied by June 30, 2022.

Pass-through 25    payments to safety-net hospitals, as defined in Section 26    5-5e.1 of this Code, shall not be reduced until all   HB2771 Enrolled- 73 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b1    pass-through payments to other hospitals have been 2    eliminated. All other hospitals shall have their 3    pass-through payments reduced proportionally. 4    (k) At least 30 days prior to each calendar year, the 5Department shall notify each hospital of changes to the 6payment methodologies in this Section, including, but not 7limited to, changes in the fixed rate directed payment rates, 8the aggregate pass-through payment amount for all hospitals, 9and the hospital's pass-through payment amount for the 10upcoming calendar year.11    (l) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, 12the Department may adopt rules to change the methodology for 13directed and pass-through payments as set forth in this 14Section, but only to the extent necessary to obtain federal 15approval of a necessary State Plan amendment or Directed 16Payment Preprint or to otherwise conform to federal law or 17federal regulation.18    (m) As used in this subsection, "managed care 19organization" or "MCO" means an entity which contracts with 20the Department to provide services where payment for medical 21services is made on a capitated basis, excluding contracted 22entities for dual eligible or Department of Children and 23Family Services youth populations.24    (n) In order to address the escalating infant mortality 25rates among minority communities in Illinois, the State shall, 26subject to appropriation, create a pool of funding of at least   HB2771 Enrolled- 74 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b1$50,000,000 annually to be disbursed among safety-net 2hospitals that maintain perinatal designation from the 3Department of Public Health.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this 16Article, for a hospital provider that did not have a 2015 17Medicare cost report, but paid an assessment in State fiscal 18year 2018 on the basis of hypothetical data, that assessment 19amount shall be used for State fiscal years 2019 and 2020.20    (4) Subject to Sections 5A-3 and 5A-10 and to subsection 21(b-8), for the period of July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 22and calendar years 2021 through 2024 2026, an annual 23assessment on inpatient services is imposed on each hospital 24provider in an amount equal to $221.50 multiplied by the 25difference of the hospital's occupied bed days less the 26hospital's Medicare bed days, provided however: for the period   HB2771 Enrolled- 5 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b1of July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, (i) the assessment 2shall be equal to 50% of the annual amount; and (ii) the amount 3of $221.50 shall be retroactively adjusted by a uniform 4percentage to generate an amount equal to 50% of the 5Assessment Adjustment, as defined in subsection (b-7). For the 6period of July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and calendar 7years 2021 through 2024 2026, a hospital's occupied bed days 8and Medicare bed days shall be determined using the most 9recent data available from each hospital's 2015 Medicare cost 10report as contained in the Healthcare Cost Report Information 11System file, for the quarter ending on March 31, 2017, without 12regard to any subsequent adjustments or changes to such data. 13If a hospital's 2015 Medicare cost report is not contained in 14the Healthcare Cost Report Information System, then the 15Illinois Department may obtain the hospital provider's 16occupied bed days and Medicare bed days from any source 17available, including, but not limited to, records maintained 18by the hospital provider, which may be inspected at all times 19during business hours of the day by the Illinois Department or 20its duly authorized agents and employees. Should the change in 21the assessment methodology for fiscal years 2021 through 22December 31, 2022 not be approved on or before June 30, 2020, 23the assessment and payments under this Article in effect for 24fiscal year 2020 shall remain in place until the new 25assessment is approved. If the assessment methodology for July 261, 2020 through December 31, 2022, is approved on or after July   HB2771 Enrolled- 6 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b11, 2020, it shall be retroactive to July 1, 2020, subject to 2federal approval and provided that the payments authorized 3under Section 5A-12.7 have the same effective date as the new 4assessment methodology. In giving retroactive effect to the 5assessment approved after June 30, 2020, credit toward the new 6assessment shall be given for any payments of the previous 7assessment for periods after June 30, 2020. Notwithstanding 8any other provision of this Article, for a hospital provider 9that did not have a 2015 Medicare cost report, but paid an 10assessment in State Fiscal Year 2020 on the basis of 11hypothetical data, the data that was the basis for the 2020 12assessment shall be used to calculate the assessment under 13this paragraph until December 31, 2023. Beginning July 1, 2022 14and through December 31, 2024, a safety-net hospital that had 15a change of ownership in calendar year 2021, and whose 16inpatient utilization had decreased by 90% from the prior year 17and prior to the change of ownership, may be eligible to pay a 18tax based on hypothetical data based on a determination of 19financial distress by the Department. Subject to federal 20approval, the Department may, by January 1, 2024, develop a 21hypothetical tax for a specialty cancer hospital which had a 22structural change of ownership during calendar year 2022 from 23a for-profit entity to a non-profit entity, and which has 24experienced a decline of 60% or greater in inpatient days of 25care as compared to the prior owners 2015 Medicare cost 26report. This change of ownership may make the hospital   HB2771 Enrolled- 7 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b1eligible for a hypothetical tax under the new hospital 2provision of the assessment defined in this Section. This new 3hypothetical tax may be applicable from January 1, 2024 4through December 31, 2026. 5    (5) Subject to Sections 5A-3 and 5A-10, beginning January 61, 2025, an annual assessment on inpatient services is imposed 7on each hospital provider in an amount equal to $362, or any 8reduction thereof in accordance with this subsection, 9multiplied by the difference of the hospital's occupied bed 10days less the hospital's Medicare bed days; however, the rate 11shall be $221.50 until the Department receives federal 12approval and implements the reimbursement rates in subsection 13(r) of Section 5A-12.7. The Department may bill for the 14difference between the assessment rate of $362, or any 15reduction thereof in accordance with this subsection, and 16$221.50 no earlier than 17 calendar days after implementing 17the reimbursement rates in subsection (r) of Section 5A-12.7.18        (A) Upon receiving federal approval for the 19    reimbursement rates in subsection (r) of Section 5A-12.7, 20    the Department shall bill the hospital for the incremental 21    difference in total tax due resulting from the increase 22    provided in this subsection for the number of months from 23    January 1, 2025 through the date of federal approval. The 24    amount shall be due and payable no later than December 31, 25    2025 and no earlier than 17 calendar days after 26    implementing the reimbursement rates in subsection (r) of   HB2771 Enrolled- 8 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b1    Section 5A-12.7. The Department shall bill hospitals in 2    the same proportional rate as the Department has 3    implemented the inpatient reimbursement rates in 4    subsection (r) of Section 5A-12.7.5        (B) Beginning January 1, 2025, a hospital's occupied 6    bed days and Medicare bed days shall be determined using 7    the most recent data available from each hospital's 2015 8    Medicare cost report as contained in the Healthcare Cost 9    Report Information System file, for the quarter ending on 10    March 31, 2017, without regard to any subsequent 11    adjustments or changes to such data. If a hospital's 2015 12    Medicare cost report is not contained in the Healthcare 13    Cost Report Information System, then the Department may 14    obtain the hospital provider's occupied bed days and 15    Medicare bed days from any source available, including, 16    but not limited to, records maintained by the hospital 17    provider, which may be inspected at all times during 18    business hours of the day by the Department or its duly 19    authorized agents and employees. If the reimbursement 20    rates in subsection (r) of Section 5A-12.7 require 21    reduction to comply with federal spending limits, then the 22    tax rate of $362 shall be reduced, in accordance with 23    subsection (s) of Section 5A-12.7, by the same percentage 24    reduction to payments required to comply with federal 25    spending limits. 26    (b) (Blank).   HB2771 Enrolled- 9 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b1    (b-5)(1) Subject to Sections 5A-3 and 5A-10, for the 2portion of State fiscal year 2012, beginning June 10, 2012 3through June 30, 2012, and for State fiscal years 2013 through 42018, or as provided in Section 5A-16, an annual assessment on 5outpatient services is imposed on each hospital provider in an 6amount equal to .008766 multiplied by the hospital's 7outpatient gross revenue, provided, however, that the amount 8of .008766 shall be increased by a uniform percentage to 9generate an amount equal to 25% of the State share of the 10payments authorized under Section 5A-12.5, with such increase 11only taking effect upon the date that a State share for such 12payments is required under federal law. For the period 13beginning June 10, 2012 through June 30, 2012, the annual 14assessment on outpatient services shall be prorated by 15multiplying the assessment amount by a fraction, the numerator 16of which is 21 days and the denominator of which is 365 days. 17For the period of April through June 2015, the amount of 18.008766 used to calculate the assessment under this paragraph 19shall, by emergency rule under subsection (s) of Section 5-45 20of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, be increased by 21a uniform percentage to generate $6,750,000 in the aggregate 22for that period from all hospitals subject to the annual 23assessment under this paragraph. 24    (2) In addition to any other assessments imposed under 25this Article, effective July 1, 2016 and semi-annually 26thereafter through June 2018, in addition to any federally   HB2771 Enrolled- 10 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b1required State share as authorized under paragraph (1), the 2amount of .008766 shall be increased by a uniform percentage 3to generate an amount equal to 25% of the ACA Assessment 4Adjustment, as defined in subsection (b-6) of this Section. 5    For the portion of State fiscal year 2012, beginning June 610, 2012 through June 30, 2012, and State fiscal years 2013 7through 2018, or as provided in Section 5A-16, a hospital's 8outpatient gross revenue shall be determined using the most 9recent data available from each hospital's 2009 Medicare cost 10report as contained in the Healthcare Cost Report Information 11System file, for the quarter ending on June 30, 2011, without 12regard to any subsequent adjustments or changes to such data. 13If a hospital's 2009 Medicare cost report is not contained in 14the Healthcare Cost Report Information System, then the 15Department may obtain the hospital provider's outpatient gross 16revenue from any source available, including, but not limited 17to, records maintained by the hospital provider, which may be 18inspected at all times during business hours of the day by the 19Department or its duly authorized agents and employees. 20    (3) Subject to Sections 5A-3, 5A-10, and 5A-16, for State 21fiscal years 2019 and 2020, an annual assessment on outpatient 22services is imposed on each hospital provider in an amount 23equal to .01358 multiplied by the hospital's outpatient gross 24revenue. For State fiscal years 2019 and 2020, a hospital's 25outpatient gross revenue shall be determined using the most 26recent data available from each hospital's 2015 Medicare cost   HB2771 Enrolled- 11 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b1report as contained in the Healthcare Cost Report Information 2System file, for the quarter ending on March 31, 2017, without 3regard to any subsequent adjustments or changes to such data. 4If a hospital's 2015 Medicare cost report is not contained in 5the Healthcare Cost Report Information System, then the 6Department may obtain the hospital provider's outpatient gross 7revenue from any source available, including, but not limited 8to, records maintained by the hospital provider, which may be 9inspected at all times during business hours of the day by the 10Department or its duly authorized agents and employees. 11Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article, for a 12hospital provider that did not have a 2015 Medicare cost 13report, but paid an assessment in State fiscal year 2018 on the 14basis of hypothetical data, that assessment amount shall be 15used for State fiscal years 2019 and 2020.16    (4) Subject to Sections 5A-3 and 5A-10 and to subsection 17(b-8), for the period of July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 18and calendar years 2021 through 2024 2026, an annual 19assessment on outpatient services is imposed on each hospital 20provider in an amount equal to .01525 multiplied by the 21hospital's outpatient gross revenue, provided however: (i) for 22the period of July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the 23assessment shall be equal to 50% of the annual amount; and (ii) 24the amount of .01525 shall be retroactively adjusted by a 25uniform percentage to generate an amount equal to 50% of the 26Assessment Adjustment, as defined in subsection (b-7). For the   HB2771 Enrolled- 12 -LRB104 08638 BDA 18691 b1period of July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 and calendar 2years 2021 through 2024 2026, a hospital's outpatient gross 3revenue shall be determined using the most recent data 4available from each hospital's 2015 Medicare cost report as 5contained in the Healthcare Cost Report Information System 6file, for the quarter ending on March 31, 2017, without regard 7to any subsequent adjustments or changes to such data.

Should the change in the assessment methodology 16above for fiscal years 2021 through calendar year 2022 not be 17approved prior to July 1, 2020, the assessment and payments 18under this Article in effect for fiscal year 2020 shall remain 19in place until the new assessment is approved. If the change in 20the assessment methodology above for July 1, 2020 through 21December 31, 2022, is approved after June 30, 2020, it shall 22have a retroactive effective date of July 1, 2020, subject to 23federal approval and provided that the payments authorized 24under Section 12A-7 have the same effective date as the new 25assessment methodology.
