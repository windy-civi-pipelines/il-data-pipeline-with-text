Notwithstanding 16any other provision of this Article, for a hospital provider 17that did not have a 2015 Medicare cost report, but paid an 18assessment in State Fiscal Year 2020 on the basis of 19hypothetical data, the data that was the basis for the 2020 20assessment shall be used to calculate the assessment under 21this paragraph until December 31, 2023. Beginning July 1, 2022 22and through December 31, 2024, a safety-net hospital that had 23a change of ownership in calendar year 2021, and whose 24inpatient utilization had decreased by 90% from the prior year 25and prior to the change of ownership, may be eligible to pay a 26tax based on hypothetical data based on a determination of   10400HB2771sam002- 7 -LRB104 08638 KTG 26961 a1financial distress by the Department. Subject to federal 2approval, the Department may, by January 1, 2024, develop a 3hypothetical tax for a specialty cancer hospital which had a 4structural change of ownership during calendar year 2022 from 5a for-profit entity to a non-profit entity, and which has 6experienced a decline of 60% or greater in inpatient days of 7care as compared to the prior owners 2015 Medicare cost 8report.

This new 11hypothetical tax may be applicable from January 1, 2024 12through December 31, 2026. 13    (5) Subject to Sections 5A-3 and 5A-10, beginning January 141, 2025, an annual assessment on inpatient services is imposed 15on each hospital provider in an amount equal to $362, or any 16reduction thereof in accordance with this subsection, 17multiplied by the difference of the hospital's occupied bed 18days less the hospital's Medicare bed days; however, the rate 19shall be $221.50 until the Department receives federal 20approval and implements the reimbursement rates in subsection 21(r) of Section 5A-12.7. The Department may bill for the 22difference between the assessment rate of $362, or any 23reduction thereof in accordance with this subsection, and 24$221.50 no earlier than 17 calendar days after implementing 25the reimbursement rates in subsection (r) of Section 5A-12.7.26        (A) Upon receiving federal approval for the   10400HB2771sam002- 8 -LRB104 08638 KTG 26961 a1    reimbursement rates in subsection (r) of Section 5A-12.7, 2    the Department shall bill the hospital for the incremental 3    difference in total tax due resulting from the increase 4    provided in this subsection for the number of months from 5    January 1, 2025 through the date of federal approval. The 6    amount shall be due and payable no later than December 31, 7    2025 and no earlier than 17 calendar days after 8    implementing the reimbursement rates in subsection (r) of 9    Section 5A-12.7. The Department shall bill hospitals in 10    the same proportional rate as the Department has 11    implemented the inpatient reimbursement rates in 12    subsection (r) of Section 5A-12.7.13        (B) Beginning January 1, 2025, a hospital's occupied 14    bed days and Medicare bed days shall be determined using 15    the most recent data available from each hospital's 2015 16    Medicare cost report as contained in the Healthcare Cost 17    Report Information System file, for the quarter ending on 18    March 31, 2017, without regard to any subsequent 19    adjustments or changes to such data. If a hospital's 2015 20    Medicare cost report is not contained in the Healthcare 21    Cost Report Information System, then the Department may 22    obtain the hospital provider's occupied bed days and 23    Medicare bed days from any source available, including, 24    but not limited to, records maintained by the hospital 25    provider, which may be inspected at all times during 26    business hours of the day by the Department or its duly   10400HB2771sam002- 9 -LRB104 08638 KTG 26961 a1    authorized agents and employees. If the reimbursement 2    rates in subsection (r) of Section 5A-12.7 require 3    reduction to comply with federal spending limits, then the 4    tax rate of $362 shall be reduced, in accordance with 5    subsection (s) of Section 5A-12.7, by the same percentage 6    reduction to payments required to comply with federal 7    spending limits. 8    (b) (Blank). 9    (b-5)(1) Subject to Sections 5A-3 and 5A-10, for the 10portion of State fiscal year 2012, beginning June 10, 2012 11through June 30, 2012, and for State fiscal years 2013 through 122018, or as provided in Section 5A-16, an annual assessment on 13outpatient services is imposed on each hospital provider in an 14amount equal to .008766 multiplied by the hospital's 15outpatient gross revenue, provided, however, that the amount 16of .008766 shall be increased by a uniform percentage to 17generate an amount equal to 25% of the State share of the 18payments authorized under Section 5A-12.5, with such increase 19only taking effect upon the date that a State share for such 20payments is required under federal law.
