If the 10petitioner is without counsel and alleges being without means 11to procure counsel, the petitioner shall state whether 12appointment of counsel is being requested. If appointment of 13counsel is being requested, the court shall appoint counsel if 14satisfied that the petitioner has no means to procure counsel.15    (f) All petitions filed under this Section shall be 16entitled to a hearing. Upon the request of the petitioner, the 17court may hold the hearing without the personal presence of 18the petitioner if it finds good cause as to why the petitioner 19cannot be present.

For 7    petitions under paragraph (1) of subsection (b), the only 8    finding that the court is required to make is whether the 9    conviction is legally invalid due to prejudicial error 10    damaging the petitioner's ability to meaningfully 11    understand, defend against, or knowingly accept the actual 12    or potential adverse immigration consequences of a 13    conviction or sentence.14    (h) An order granting or denying the petition is 15appealable, and any final judgment entered upon the petition 16shall be reviewed in the manner provided under the rules of the 17Supreme Court.18    (i) A court may issue a specific finding of ineffective 19assistance of counsel as a result of a motion brought under 20paragraph (1) of subsection (b) only if the attorney found to 21be ineffective was given, under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 22102, timely advance notice of the petition hearing by the 23petitioner or the State's Attorney for the jurisdiction in 24which the petition is filed.25    (j) If the court finds in favor of the petitioner, it shall 26enter an appropriate order with respect to the judgment or   HB3549- 8 -LRB104 10084 RLC 20156 b1sentence in the former proceedings and such supplementary 2orders as to rearraignment, retrial, custody, conditions of 3pretrial release or discharge as may be necessary and proper.4    (k) Crime victims shall be given notice by the State's 5Attorney's office of petitions filed under this Section as 6required in Section 4.5 of the Rights of Crime Victims and 7Witnesses Act.8    (l) Remedies under this Section shall apply to convictions 9and sentences entered before, on, or after the effective date 10of this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly.  1112    Section 10.

All relief heretofore obtainable and the grounds 21for such relief heretofore available, whether by any of the 22foregoing remedies or otherwise, shall be available in every 23case, by proceedings hereunder, regardless of the nature of 24the order or judgment from which relief is sought or of the   HB3549- 9 -LRB104 10084 RLC 20156 b1proceedings in which it was entered. Except as provided in the 2Illinois Parentage Act of 2015, there shall be no distinction 3between actions and other proceedings, statutory or otherwise, 4as to availability of relief, grounds for relief, or the 5relief obtainable.6    (b) The petition must be filed in the same proceeding in 7which the order or judgment was entered but is not a 8continuation thereof.

All parties to the 16petition shall be notified as provided by rule.17    (b-5) A movant may present a meritorious claim under this 18Section if the allegations in the petition establish each of 19the following by a preponderance of the evidence:20        (1) the movant was convicted of a forcible felony;21        (2) the movant's participation in the offense was 22    related to him or her previously having been a victim of 23    domestic violence or gender-based violence;24        (3) there is substantial evidence of domestic violence 25    or gender-based violence against the movant that was not 26    presented at the movant's sentencing hearing;  HB3549- 10 -LRB104 10084 RLC 20156 b1        (4) (blank); and2        (5) the evidence of domestic violence or gender-based 3    violence against the movant is material and noncumulative 4    to other evidence offered at the sentencing hearing, or 5    previous hearing under this Section filed on or after the 6    effective date of this amendatory Act of the 103rd General 7    Assembly, and is of such a conclusive character that it 8    would likely change the sentence imposed by the original 9    trial court.10    Nothing in this subsection (b-5) shall prevent a movant 11from applying for any other relief under this Section or any 12other law otherwise available to him or her. This subsection 13(b-5) applies to all eligible convictions, including, but not 14limited to, if the judge renders the sentence based on a 15negotiated plea agreement.

This subsection (b-10) applies 10to all eligible convictions, including, but not limited to, if 11the judge renders the sentence based on a negotiated plea 12agreement.

This subsection 17applies to orders or judgments entered before, on, or after 18the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 104th General 19Assembly. 20    (d) The filing of a petition under this Section does not 21affect the order or judgment, or suspend its operation.22    (e) Unless lack of jurisdiction affirmatively appears from 23the record proper, the vacation or modification of an order or 24judgment pursuant to the provisions of this Section does not 25affect the right, title, or interest in or to any real or 26personal property of any person, not a party to the original   HB3549- 14 -LRB104 10084 RLC 20156 b1action, acquired for value after the entry of the order or 2judgment but before the filing of the petition, nor affect any 3right of any person not a party to the original action under 4any certificate of sale issued before the filing of the 5petition, pursuant to a sale based on the order or judgment. 6When a petition is filed pursuant to this Section to reopen a 7foreclosure proceeding, notwithstanding the provisions of 8Section 15-1701 of this Code, the purchaser or successor 9purchaser of real property subject to a foreclosure sale who 10was not a party to the mortgage foreclosure proceedings is 11entitled to remain in possession of the property until the 12foreclosure action is defeated or the previously foreclosed 13defendant redeems from the foreclosure sale if the purchaser 14has been in possession of the property for more than 6 months. 15    (f) Nothing contained in this Section affects any existing 16right to relief from a void order or judgment, or to employ any 17existing method to procure that relief.18(Source: P.A. 102-639, eff. 8-27-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 19103-403, eff. 1-1-24; 103-968, eff. 1-1-25.)

If the State's Attorney for the 20jurisdiction in which the petition is filed does not file an 21objection to the petition, the court may grant the petition to 22vacate the conviction or sentence without a hearing.23        (1) Within 90 days after the filing and docketing of 24    each petition, the court shall examine the petition and 25    enter an order on the petition setting for calendar a 26    hearing date on the petition, except that this timeline   HB3549- 5 -LRB104 10084 RLC 20156 b1    shall be 45 days in any case in which the petitioner is in 2    the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement or 3    otherwise faces imminent removal from the United States.4        (2) Within 30 days after the entry of an order under 5    paragraph (1) of this subsection (f), or within such 6    further time as the court may set, the State may file an 7    answer.8    No other or further pleadings shall be filed except as the 9court may order on its own motion or on that of either party. 10The court may in its discretion grant leave, at any stage of 11the proceeding prior to entry of judgment, to withdraw the 12petition. The court may in its discretion make such order as to 13amendment of the petition or any other pleading, or as to 14pleading over, or filing further pleadings, or extending the 15time of filing any pleading other than the original petition, 16as shall be appropriate, just, and reasonable and as is 17generally provided in civil cases.18    (g) When ruling on the petition:19        (1) The court shall grant the petition to vacate the 20    conviction or sentence if the petitioner establishes, by a 21    preponderance of the evidence, the existence of any of the 22    grounds for relief specified in subsection (b). For a 23    motion made under paragraph (1) of subsection (b), the 24    petitioner shall also establish that the conviction or 25    sentence being challenged is currently causing or has the 26    potential to cause removal or the denial of an application   HB3549- 6 -LRB104 10084 RLC 20156 b1    for an immigration benefit, lawful status, or 2    naturalization.3        (2) A court's judicial admonishment under Section 4    113-8 at the time of the conviction or sentencing at issue 5    in the petition shall not be considered:6            (A) a sufficient basis to cure or correct the 7        prejudicial error damaging the petitioner's ability to 8        meaningfully understand, defend against, or knowingly 9        accept the actual or potential adverse immigration 10        consequences of a conviction or sentence;11            (B) mitigation for a finding of ineffective 12        assistance of counsel relating to the same conviction 13        or sentencing under this Section; or14            (C) dispositive as to whether the petitioner was 15        aware that the petitioner's criminal conviction or 16        sentence has adverse immigration consequences for 17        purposes of paragraph (2) of subsection (b). 18        (3) There is a presumption of legal invalidity for the 19    purposes of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) if the 20    petitioner pleaded guilty or nolo contendere under a 21    statute that provided that, upon completion of specific 22    requirements, proceedings would be dismissed without 23    judgment if the petitioner complied with these 24    requirements, and if the disposition under the statute has 25    been, or potentially could be, used as a basis for adverse 26    immigration consequences.  HB3549- 7 -LRB104 10084 RLC 20156 b1        (4) If the court grants the petition to vacate a 2    conviction or sentence obtained through a plea of guilty 3    or nolo contendere, the court shall allow the petitioner 4    to withdraw the plea.5        (5) When ruling on a petition under this Section, the 6    court shall specify the basis for its conclusion. For 7    petitions under paragraph (1) of subsection (b), the only 8    finding that the court is required to make is whether the 9    conviction is legally invalid due to prejudicial error 10    damaging the petitioner's ability to meaningfully 11    understand, defend against, or knowingly accept the actual 12    or potential adverse immigration consequences of a 13    conviction or sentence.14    (h) An order granting or denying the petition is 15appealable, and any final judgment entered upon the petition 16shall be reviewed in the manner provided under the rules of the 17Supreme Court.18    (i) A court may issue a specific finding of ineffective 19assistance of counsel as a result of a motion brought under 20paragraph (1) of subsection (b) only if the attorney found to 21be ineffective was given, under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 22102, timely advance notice of the petition hearing by the 23petitioner or the State's Attorney for the jurisdiction in 24which the petition is filed.25    (j) If the court finds in favor of the petitioner, it shall 26enter an appropriate order with respect to the judgment or   HB3549- 8 -LRB104 10084 RLC 20156 b1sentence in the former proceedings and such supplementary 2orders as to rearraignment, retrial, custody, conditions of 3pretrial release or discharge as may be necessary and proper.4    (k) Crime victims shall be given notice by the State's 5Attorney's office of petitions filed under this Section as 6required in Section 4.5 of the Rights of Crime Victims and 7Witnesses Act.8    (l) Remedies under this Section shall apply to convictions 9and sentences entered before, on, or after the effective date 10of this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly.  1112    Section 10. The Code of Civil Procedure is amended by 13changing Section 2-1401 as follows: 14    (735 ILCS 5/2-1401)  (from Ch. 110, par. 2-1401)15    Sec. 2-1401. Relief from judgments. 16    (a) Relief from final orders and judgments, after 30 days 17from the entry thereof, may be had upon petition as provided in 18this Section. Writs of error coram nobis and coram vobis, 19bills of review, and bills in the nature of bills of review are 20abolished. All relief heretofore obtainable and the grounds 21for such relief heretofore available, whether by any of the 22foregoing remedies or otherwise, shall be available in every 23case, by proceedings hereunder, regardless of the nature of 24the order or judgment from which relief is sought or of the   HB3549- 9 -LRB104 10084 RLC 20156 b1proceedings in which it was entered. Except as provided in the 2Illinois Parentage Act of 2015, there shall be no distinction 3between actions and other proceedings, statutory or otherwise, 4as to availability of relief, grounds for relief, or the 5relief obtainable.6    (b) The petition must be filed in the same proceeding in 7which the order or judgment was entered but is not a 8continuation thereof. The petition must be supported by an 9affidavit or other appropriate showing as to matters not of 10record. A petition to reopen a foreclosure proceeding must 11include as parties to the petition, but is not limited to, all 12parties in the original action in addition to the current 13record title holders of the property, current occupants, and 14any individual or entity that had a recorded interest in the 15property before the filing of the petition. All parties to the 16petition shall be notified as provided by rule.17    (b-5) A movant may present a meritorious claim under this 18Section if the allegations in the petition establish each of 19the following by a preponderance of the evidence:20        (1) the movant was convicted of a forcible felony;21        (2) the movant's participation in the offense was 22    related to him or her previously having been a victim of 23    domestic violence or gender-based violence;24        (3) there is substantial evidence of domestic violence 25    or gender-based violence against the movant that was not 26    presented at the movant's sentencing hearing;  HB3549- 10 -LRB104 10084 RLC 20156 b1        (4) (blank); and2        (5) the evidence of domestic violence or gender-based 3    violence against the movant is material and noncumulative 4    to other evidence offered at the sentencing hearing, or 5    previous hearing under this Section filed on or after the 6    effective date of this amendatory Act of the 103rd General 7    Assembly, and is of such a conclusive character that it 8    would likely change the sentence imposed by the original 9    trial court.10    Nothing in this subsection (b-5) shall prevent a movant 11from applying for any other relief under this Section or any 12other law otherwise available to him or her. This subsection 13(b-5) applies to all eligible convictions, including, but not 14limited to, if the judge renders the sentence based on a 15negotiated plea agreement.

This subsection (b-10) applies 10to all eligible convictions, including, but not limited to, if 11the judge renders the sentence based on a negotiated plea 12agreement.

This subsection 17applies to orders or judgments entered before, on, or after 18the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 104th General 19Assembly. 20    (d) The filing of a petition under this Section does not 21affect the order or judgment, or suspend its operation.22    (e) Unless lack of jurisdiction affirmatively appears from 23the record proper, the vacation or modification of an order or 24judgment pursuant to the provisions of this Section does not 25affect the right, title, or interest in or to any real or 26personal property of any person, not a party to the original   HB3549- 14 -LRB104 10084 RLC 20156 b1action, acquired for value after the entry of the order or 2judgment but before the filing of the petition, nor affect any 3right of any person not a party to the original action under 4any certificate of sale issued before the filing of the 5petition, pursuant to a sale based on the order or judgment. 6When a petition is filed pursuant to this Section to reopen a 7foreclosure proceeding, notwithstanding the provisions of 8Section 15-1701 of this Code, the purchaser or successor 9purchaser of real property subject to a foreclosure sale who 10was not a party to the mortgage foreclosure proceedings is 11entitled to remain in possession of the property until the 12foreclosure action is defeated or the previously foreclosed 13defendant redeems from the foreclosure sale if the purchaser 14has been in possession of the property for more than 6 months. 15    (f) Nothing contained in this Section affects any existing 16right to relief from a void order or judgment, or to employ any 17existing method to procure that relief.18(Source: P.A. 102-639, eff. 8-27-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 19103-403, eff. 1-1-24; 103-968, eff. 1-1-25.)
