Hospital worker competency validation and 22assignment despite objection.23    (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:24        (1) The State of Illinois has an obligation to ensure 25    hospitals provide quality patient care.  HB3512- 6 -LRB104 09276 BAB 19334 b1        (2) Numerous studies have linked patient outcomes, 2    including in-hospital mortality rates, to hospital worker 3    staffing.4        (3) Despite the preponderance of evidence that 5    adequate staffing improves patient outcomes, hospitals in 6    Illinois and elsewhere too often systemically and 7    intentionally understaff to maximize profit, even at the 8    expense of quality patient care.9        (4) The COVID-19 pandemic both exposed and exacerbated 10    these unsafe staffing practices.11        (5) The State asserts that, based on their 12    demonstrated competencies and training, hospital workers 13    are best positioned to identify unsafe conditions that 14    jeopardize quality patient care, especially short 15    staffing.16        (6) Hospitals perform competency validations and 17    ongoing verifications to ensure hospital workers know how 18    to perform their jobs safely and to identify unsafe 19    practices, including short staffing.20        (7) The State should require hospitals to affirm that 21    hospital workers have received the necessary training to 22    safely perform their work via competency validations and 23    ongoing verification, and empower these hospital workers 24    to identify and formally object to unsafe working 25    conditions, including short staffing. (8) To facilitate 26    this, the State should create a dispute resolution process   HB3512- 7 -LRB104 09276 BAB 19334 b1    for hospital workers to formally object to unsafe working 2    conditions.3    (b) Definitions. As used in this Section:4    "Assignment despite objection" means a formal process by 5which hospital workers notify management when they receive an 6assignment that, based on their training, is potentially 7unsafe.8    "Competent employee" means a hospital worker whose 9employer has received a competency validation or ongoing 10verification during a given calendar year.11    "Competency validation" means a determination based on a 12hospital worker's satisfactory performance of each specific 13element of their job description and of specific requirements 14of the unit in which they are employed in a safe and ethical 15manner.16    "Hospital worker" means any person who receives an hourly 17wage, directly or indirectly via a subcontractor, by a 18hospital licensed under this Act.19    "Ongoing verification" means an annual redetermination 20based on a hospital worker's satisfactory performance of each 21specific element of their job description and the specific 22requirements of the unit in which they are employed in a safe 23and ethical manner.24    "Subcontractor" means any entity, including an individual 25or individuals, that contracts with a hospital licensed under 26this Act to supply a service. "Subcontractor" includes an   HB3512- 8 -LRB104 09276 BAB 19334 b1organization that, to a significant extent, is associated or 2affiliated with, owns or is owned by, or has control of or is 3controlled by, the entity furnishing services to a hospital 4licensed under this Act.5    (c) Competency validation credential.6        (1) Hospitals licensed under this Act shall conduct a 7    competency validation for each hospital worker hired, as a 8    condition of employment, within the first month of 9    employment and at no cost to the new hire.10        (2) The competency validation formally affirms the 11    hospital has adequately trained a hospital worker to 12    perform all aspects of their job safely and to identify 13    unsafe conditions, including inadequate staffing.14        (3) Hospitals must submit documentation of each 15    hospital worker's competency validation to the Department 16    within 2 weeks of the hospital worker's start date.17        (4) Hospitals licensed under this Act shall also 18    conduct an ongoing verification for each hospital worker 19    employed during a given calendar year to determine each 20    hospital worker's continued competency to perform their 21    job. The hospitals shall submit documentation of each 22    hospital worker's ongoing verification to the Department 23    within 2 weeks of completion.24        (5) Hospitals licensed under this Act shall submit a 25    list of all competent employees currently employed at the 26    end of each calendar year.  HB3512- 9 -LRB104 09276 BAB 19334 b1        (6) The Department shall maintain, and make available 2    to the public, a registry of all competent employees that 3    includes the hospital worker's name, address, contact 4    information, and current employer.5        (7) Hospital employers that fail to comply with the 6    requirements of this Section shall receive a fine equal to 7    0.1% of annual revenue reported during the most recently 8    completed fiscal year each day until the hospital complies 9    with the law.10    (d) Assignment despite objection.11        (1) A hospital licensed under this Act must create an 12    assignment despite objection form that is applicable and 13    accessible to all hospital workers that enables the 14    hospital workers to formally object to unsafe working 15    conditions (including unsafe staffing levels) and shifts 16    liability for the unsafe working conditions to the 17    hospital.18        (2) The assignment despite objection form must include 19    the following language: "This is to confirm that I 20    notified you that, in my professional judgment derived 21    from my competency validation, today's assignment is 22    unsafe and places patients at risk. As a result, the 23    facility is responsible for any adverse effects on patient 24    care."25        (3) A hospital must retain a copy of each assignment 26    despite objection form and provide copies to the hospital   HB3512- 10 -LRB104 09276 BAB 19334 b1    worker's union (where relevant) and the Department. 2    Hospitals must provide a report of all assignment despite 3    objection forms filed annually at the end of each Calendar 4    Year and maintain these records for a minimum of 5 years.5        (4) A hospital must not retaliate against hospital 6    workers for filing an assignment despite objection form or 7    for reporting or objecting to unsafe conditions.8    (e) Resolution process.9        (1) A hospital must develop a transparent, fair, and 10    expedient assignment despite objection resolution process 11    for all hospital workers either via collective bargaining 12    or in accordance with the Department process described in 13    paragraph (3).14        (2) Hospital workers currently covered by a collective 15    bargaining agreement that includes an assignment despite 16    objection resolution process shall abide by the process 17    included in the collective bargaining agreement.18        (3) Hospital workers not covered by a collective 19    bargaining agreement that includes an assignment despite 20    objection resolution process may use the Department's 21    resolution process. The Department's resolution process 22    for an assignment despite objection shall be as follows:23            (A) Step 1: The objecting hospital worker shall 24        make a good faith effort to inform their manager or 25        supervisor at the time of the objection to assignment.26            (B) Step 2: If the manager or supervisor fails to   HB3512- 11 -LRB104 09276 BAB 19334 b1        resolve the unsafe situation to the reporting hospital 2        worker's satisfaction, the hospital worker shall then 3        complete an assignment despite objection form and 4        submit a copy to the manager or supervisor, submit a 5        copy to the representative organization if covered by 6        a collective bargaining agreement, and keep a copy for 7        the hospital worker's records.8            (C) Hospital management must respond in writing to 9        the assignment despite objection within one week of 10        its receipt and shall provide a copy of the response to 11        the hospital worker's representative organization if 12        the hospital worker is covered by a collective 13        bargaining agreement.14            (D) Should the affected hospital worker(s) be 15        unsatisfied with the management's response, the 16        hospital must convene a Safety Review Panel composed 17        of 3 representatives selected by the hospital and 3 18        representatives selected by hospital workers via a 19        transparent democratic process (the hospital workers' 20        representatives need not be hospital employees). The 21        panel shall attempt to resolve the dispute within 15 22        days of referral, unless extended by mutual consent.23            (E) In the event the Safety Review Panel cannot 24        resolve the dispute within 15 days of referral, the 25        Department shall appoint a mutually agreed upon 26        third-party neutral to assist in resolving the   HB3512- 12 -LRB104 09276 BAB 19334 b1        dispute. The third-party neutral shall make a binding 2        decision to resolve the dispute.3        (4) Hospital employers that refuse to honor the 4    Department's assignment despite objection resolution 5    process shall receive a fine equal to 0.1% of annual 6    revenue reported each day during the most recently 7    completed fiscal year until the hospital complies with the 8    resolution process.9        (5) The Department shall create a Hospital Safety 10    Advocate position responsible for enforcing the new 11    competency credentialing and assignment despite objection 12    requirements and developing additional rules, as needed. 13    (210 ILCS 85/10.25 new)14    Sec. 10.25.

Hospital worker competency validation and 22assignment despite objection.23    (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:24        (1) The State of Illinois has an obligation to ensure 25    hospitals provide quality patient care.  HB3512- 6 -LRB104 09276 BAB 19334 b1        (2) Numerous studies have linked patient outcomes, 2    including in-hospital mortality rates, to hospital worker 3    staffing.4        (3) Despite the preponderance of evidence that 5    adequate staffing improves patient outcomes, hospitals in 6    Illinois and elsewhere too often systemically and 7    intentionally understaff to maximize profit, even at the 8    expense of quality patient care.9        (4) The COVID-19 pandemic both exposed and exacerbated 10    these unsafe staffing practices.11        (5) The State asserts that, based on their 12    demonstrated competencies and training, hospital workers 13    are best positioned to identify unsafe conditions that 14    jeopardize quality patient care, especially short 15    staffing.16        (6) Hospitals perform competency validations and 17    ongoing verifications to ensure hospital workers know how 18    to perform their jobs safely and to identify unsafe 19    practices, including short staffing.20        (7) The State should require hospitals to affirm that 21    hospital workers have received the necessary training to 22    safely perform their work via competency validations and 23    ongoing verification, and empower these hospital workers 24    to identify and formally object to unsafe working 25    conditions, including short staffing. (8) To facilitate 26    this, the State should create a dispute resolution process   HB3512- 7 -LRB104 09276 BAB 19334 b1    for hospital workers to formally object to unsafe working 2    conditions.3    (b) Definitions.
