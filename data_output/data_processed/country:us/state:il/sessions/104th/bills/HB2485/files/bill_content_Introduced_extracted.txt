Any taxpayer who fails to pay an admitted or established 5liability under this Act may also be required to post bond or 6other acceptable security with the Department guaranteeing the 7payment of such admitted or established liability.8    The Department shall discharge any surety and shall 9release and return any bond or security deposit assigned, 10pledged or otherwise provided to it by a taxpayer under this 11Section within 30 days after: (1) such taxpayer becomes a 12prior continuous compliance taxpayer; or (2) such taxpayer has 13ceased to collect receipts on which he is required to remit tax 14to the Department, has filed a final tax return, and has paid 15to the Department an amount sufficient to discharge his 16remaining tax liability as determined by the Department under 17this Act.18(Source: P.A. 100-1171, eff. 1-4-19; 101-37, eff. 7-3-19.)
