LRB104 11260 AAS 21344 b  A BILL FOR SB2307LRB104 11260 AAS 21344 b1    AN ACT concerning the regulation of electricians.  2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly:  4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Electrician Licensing Act.  6    Section 5. Purpose and policy. Improper electrical wiring 7and building construction can adversely affect the well being 8of the public by causing fires due to short circuits and 9overloading of protection devices. Faulty wiring is 10potentially lethal and can cause widespread fires with 11disastrous consequences to persons and property. To protect 12the health of the public, it is essential that electrical 13wiring be installed by contractors who are registered with the 14state and passed all applicable state standards. To further 15promote health and safety, it is essential that the State 16inquire as to the potential benefits of licensing other 17building trades in consultation with labor and ownership in 18the construction industry.19    Consistent with its duty to safeguard the health of the 20people of this State, the General Assembly declares that the 21planning, inspecting, installing, altering, extending, 22repairing, and maintaining of electrical wiring systems shall 23be performed by entities demonstrating levels of proven skill.   SB2307- 2 -LRB104 11260 AAS 21344 b1Further, the General Assembly declares that a guide for 2minimum control of electrical materials and equipment, the 3design of electrical systems, and the construction and 4installation methods of electrical systems is essential for 5the protection of public health. In order to insure proper 6electrical wiring practice, this Act provides for the 7licensing of electrical contractors and supervising 8electricians and for the adoption of the National Electrical 9Code (NFPA70) as standards by the Department. This Act is 10therefore declared to be essential to the public interest.  11    Section 10. Definitions. As used in this Act: 12    "Board" means the Illinois State Electrical Licensing 13Advisory Board. 14    "Department" means the Illinois Department of Professional 15Regulation. 16    "Director" means the Director of the Illinois Department 17of Professional Regulation. 18    "Electrical contractor" means a person, firm, or 19corporation operating a business that undertakes or offers to 20undertake to plan for, lay out, supervise, or install or to 21make additions, alterations, maintenance, or repairs in the 22installation of wiring, apparatus, or equipment for electric 23light, heat, or power with or without compensation and who is 24licensed as an electrical contractor by the Department of 25Professional Regulation. An electrical contractor's license   SB2307- 3 -LRB104 11260 AAS 21344 b1does not of itself qualify its holder to perform the 2electrical work. The term electrical contractor does not 3include employees employed by such contractor to do or 4supervise such work. 5    "Governmental unit" means a city, village, incorporated 6town, or county. 7    "Owner" means a natural person who physically performs 8electrical work on premises the person owns and actually 9occupies as a single family residence or owns as a single 10family residence upon completion of construction. 11    "Supervising Electrician" means an individual not less 12than twenty-one years of age with at least three years of 13experience in the installation, alteration, repair, and 14maintenance of electrical wires, equipment, and apparatus, or 15an experience equivalent thereto and having passed an exam 16provided by the Department that sufficiently indicates the 17individual has knowledge and technical training to perform the 18work or to supervise the installation, alteration, repair and 19maintenance of electrical wires, equipment, and apparatus.  20    Section 15.

LRB104 11260 AAS 21344 b  A BILL FOR SB2307LRB104 11260 AAS 21344 b1    AN ACT concerning the regulation of electricians.  2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly:  4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Electrician Licensing Act.  6    Section 5. Purpose and policy. Improper electrical wiring 7and building construction can adversely affect the well being 8of the public by causing fires due to short circuits and 9overloading of protection devices. Faulty wiring is 10potentially lethal and can cause widespread fires with 11disastrous consequences to persons and property. To protect 12the health of the public, it is essential that electrical 13wiring be installed by contractors who are registered with the 14state and passed all applicable state standards. To further 15promote health and safety, it is essential that the State 16inquire as to the potential benefits of licensing other 17building trades in consultation with labor and ownership in 18the construction industry.19    Consistent with its duty to safeguard the health of the 20people of this State, the General Assembly declares that the 21planning, inspecting, installing, altering, extending, 22repairing, and maintaining of electrical wiring systems shall 23be performed by entities demonstrating levels of proven skill.   SB2307- 2 -LRB104 11260 AAS 21344 b1Further, the General Assembly declares that a guide for 2minimum control of electrical materials and equipment, the 3design of electrical systems, and the construction and 4installation methods of electrical systems is essential for 5the protection of public health. In order to insure proper 6electrical wiring practice, this Act provides for the 7licensing of electrical contractors and supervising 8electricians and for the adoption of the National Electrical 9Code (NFPA70) as standards by the Department.
