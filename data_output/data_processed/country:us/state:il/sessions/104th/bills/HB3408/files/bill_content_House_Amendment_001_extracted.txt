Diabetes testing is 18not required.19    Physicians licensed to practice medicine in all of its 20branches, licensed advanced practice registered nurses, or 21licensed physician assistants shall be responsible for the 22performance of the health examinations, other than dental 23examinations, eye examinations, and vision and hearing 24screening, and shall sign all report forms required by 25subsection (4) of this Section that pertain to those portions 26of the health examination for which the physician, advanced   10400HB3408ham001- 7 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1practice registered nurse, or physician assistant is 2responsible.

If the child fails to present 15proof of the developmental screening or the social and 16emotional screening portions of the health examination by 17October 15th of the school year, qualified school support 18personnel may, with a parent's or guardian's consent, offer 19the developmental screening or the social and emotional 20screening to the child. Each public, private, and parochial 21school must give notice of the developmental screening and 22social and emotional screening requirements to the parents and 23guardians of students in compliance with the rules of the 24Department of Public Health.

The duty to summarize on the 4report form does not apply to social and emotional screenings. 5The confidentiality of the information and records relating to 6the developmental screening and the social and emotional 7screening shall be determined by the statutes, rules, and 8professional ethics governing the type of provider conducting 9the screening. The individuals confirming the administration 10of required immunizations shall record as indicated on the 11form that the immunizations were administered.12    (5) If a child does not submit proof of having had either 13the health examination or the immunization as required, then 14the child shall be examined or receive the immunization, as 15the case may be, and present proof by October 15 of the current 16school year, or by an earlier date of the current school year 17established by a school district. To establish a date before 18October 15 of the current school year for the health 19examination or immunization as required, a school district 20must give notice of the requirements of this Section 60 days 21prior to the earlier established date. If for medical reasons 22one or more of the required immunizations must be given after 23October 15 of the current school year, or after an earlier 24established date of the current school year, then the child 25shall present, by October 15, or by the earlier established 26date, a schedule for the administration of the immunizations   10400HB3408ham001- 11 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1and a statement of the medical reasons causing the delay, both 2the schedule and the statement being issued by the physician, 3advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, 4registered nurse, or local health department that will be 5responsible for administration of the remaining required 6immunizations. If a child does not comply by October 15, or by 7the earlier established date of the current school year, with 8the requirements of this subsection, then the local school 9authority shall exclude that child from school until such time 10as the child presents proof of having had the health 11examination as required and presents proof of having received 12those required immunizations which are medically possible to 13receive immediately. During a child's exclusion from school 14for noncompliance with this subsection, the child's parents or 15legal guardian shall be considered in violation of Section 1626-1 and subject to any penalty imposed by Section 26-10. This 17subsection (5) does not apply to dental examinations, eye 18examinations, and the developmental screening and the social 19and emotional screening portions of the health examination. If 20the student is an out-of-state transfer student and does not 21have the proof required under this subsection (5) before 22October 15 of the current year or whatever date is set by the 23school district, then he or she may only attend classes (i) if 24he or she has proof that an appointment for the required 25vaccinations has been scheduled with a party authorized to 26submit proof of the required vaccinations. If the proof of   10400HB3408ham001- 12 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1vaccination required under this subsection (5) is not 2submitted within 30 days after the student is permitted to 3attend classes, then the student is not to be permitted to 4attend classes until proof of the vaccinations has been 5properly submitted. No school district or employee of a school 6district shall be held liable for any injury or illness to 7another person that results from admitting an out-of-state 8transfer student to class that has an appointment scheduled 9pursuant to this subsection (5). 10    (6) Every school shall report to the State Board of 11Education by November 15, in the manner which that agency 12shall require, the number of children who have received the 13necessary immunizations and the health examination (other than 14a dental examination or eye examination) as required, 15indicating, of those who have not received the immunizations 16and examination as required, the number of children who are 17exempt from health examination and immunization requirements 18on religious or medical grounds as provided in subsection (8). 19On or before December 1 of each year, every public school 20district and registered nonpublic school shall make publicly 21available the immunization data they are required to submit to 22the State Board of Education by November 15. The immunization 23data made publicly available must be identical to the data the 24school district or school has reported to the State Board of 25Education.26    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education   10400HB3408ham001- 13 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the 2number of children who have received the required dental 3examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 4required dental examination, the number of children who are 5exempt from the dental examination on religious grounds as 6provided in subsection (8) of this Section and the number of 7children who have received a waiver under subsection (1.5) of 8this Section.9    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education 10by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the 11number of children who have received the required eye 12examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 13required eye examination, the number of children who are 14exempt from the eye examination as provided in subsection (8) 15of this Section, the number of children who have received a 16waiver under subsection (1.10) of this Section, and the total 17number of children in noncompliance with the eye examination 18requirement.19    The reported information under this subsection (6) shall 20be provided to the Department of Public Health by the State 21Board of Education.22    (7) Upon determining that the number of pupils who are 23required to be in compliance with subsection (5) of this 24Section is below 90% of the number of pupils enrolled in the 25school district, 10% of each State aid payment made pursuant 26to Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 to the school district for such   10400HB3408ham001- 14 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1year may be withheld by the State Board of Education until the 2number of students in compliance with subsection (5) is the 3applicable specified percentage or higher.4    (8) Children of parents or legal guardians who object to 5health, dental, or eye examinations or any part thereof, to 6immunizations, or to vision and hearing screening tests on 7religious grounds shall not be required to undergo the 8examinations, tests, or immunizations to which they so object 9if such parents or legal guardians present to the appropriate 10local school authority a signed Certificate of Religious 11Exemption detailing the grounds for objection and the specific 12immunizations, tests, or examinations to which they object. 13The grounds for objection must set forth the specific 14religious belief that conflicts with the examination, test, 15immunization, or other medical intervention. The signed 16certificate shall also reflect the parent's or legal 17guardian's understanding of the school's exclusion policies in 18the case of a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak or 19exposure. The certificate must also be signed by the 20authorized examining health care provider responsible for the 21performance of the child's health examination confirming that 22the provider provided education to the parent or legal 23guardian on the benefits of immunization and the health risks 24to the student and to the community of the communicable 25diseases for which immunization is required in this State. 26However, the health care provider's signature on the   10400HB3408ham001- 15 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1certificate reflects only that education was provided and does 2not allow a health care provider grounds to determine a 3religious exemption. Those receiving immunizations required 4under this Code shall be provided with the relevant vaccine 5information statements that are required to be disseminated by 6the federal National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, 7which may contain information on circumstances when a vaccine 8should not be administered, prior to administering a vaccine. 9A healthcare provider may consider including without 10limitation the nationally accepted recommendations from 11federal agencies such as the Advisory Committee on 12Immunization Practices, the information outlined in the 13relevant vaccine information statement, and vaccine package 14inserts, along with the healthcare provider's clinical 15judgment, to determine whether any child may be more 16susceptible to experiencing an adverse vaccine reaction than 17the general population, and, if so, the healthcare provider 18may exempt the child from an immunization or adopt an 19individualized immunization schedule. The Certificate of 20Religious Exemption shall be created by the Department of 21Public Health and shall be made available and used by parents 22and legal guardians by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school 23year. Parents or legal guardians must submit the Certificate 24of Religious Exemption to their local school authority prior 25to entering kindergarten, sixth grade, and ninth grade for 26each child for which they are requesting an exemption. The   10400HB3408ham001- 16 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1religious objection stated need not be directed by the tenets 2of an established religious organization. However, general 3philosophical or moral reluctance to allow physical 4examinations, eye examinations, immunizations, vision and 5hearing screenings, or dental examinations does not provide a 6sufficient basis for an exception to statutory requirements. 7The local school authority is responsible for determining if 8the content of the Certificate of Religious Exemption 9constitutes a valid religious objection. The local school 10authority shall inform the parent or legal guardian of 11exclusion procedures, in accordance with the Department's 12rules under Part 690 of Title 77 of the Illinois 13Administrative Code, at the time the objection is presented. 14    If the physical condition of the child is such that any one 15or more of the immunizing agents should not be administered, 16the examining physician, advanced practice registered nurse, 17or physician assistant responsible for the performance of the 18health examination shall endorse that fact upon the health 19examination form.20    Exempting a child from the health, dental, or eye 21examination does not exempt the child from participation in 22the program of physical education training provided in 23Sections 27-5 through 27-7 of this Code.24    (8.5) The school board of a school district shall include 25informational materials regarding influenza and influenza 26vaccinations developed, provided, or approved by the   10400HB3408ham001- 17 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1Department of Public Health under Section 2310-700 of the 2Department of Public Health Powers and Duties Law of the Civil 3Administrative Code of Illinois when the board provides 4information on immunizations, infectious diseases, 5medications, or other school health issues to the parents or 6guardians of students.7    (9) For the purposes of this Section, "nursery schools" 8means those nursery schools operated by elementary school 9systems or secondary level school units or institutions of 10higher learning.11(Source: P.A. 103-985, eff. 1-1-25.) 12    Section 10. The Child Vision and Hearing Test Act is 13amended by adding Section 4.5 as follows: 14    (410 ILCS 205/4.5 new)15    Sec. 4.5. Color discrimination tests mandatory. 16Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, 17color discrimination tests shall be performed in all vision 18screening services under this Act. The Department of Public 19Health shall file rules with the Joint Committee on 20Administrative Rules within 180 days after the effective date 21of this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly. 22    Section 99. Effective date. This Act takes effect upon 23becoming law.".

The rules and 14regulations of the Department of Public Health shall specify 15that a tuberculosis skin test screening shall be included as a 16required part of each health examination included under this 17Section if the child resides in an area designated by the 18Department of Public Health as having a high incidence of 19tuberculosis. With respect to the developmental screening and 20the social and emotional screening, the Department of Public 21Health must, no later than January 1, 2019, develop rules and 22appropriate revisions to the Child Health Examination form in 23conjunction with a statewide organization representing school 24boards; a statewide organization representing pediatricians; 25statewide organizations representing individuals holding 26Illinois educator licenses with school support personnel   10400HB3408ham001- 6 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1endorsements, including school social workers, school 2psychologists, and school nurses; a statewide organization 3representing children's mental health experts; a statewide 4organization representing school principals; the Director of 5Healthcare and Family Services or his or her designee, the 6State Superintendent of Education or his or her designee; and 7representatives of other appropriate State agencies and, at a 8minimum, must recommend the use of validated screening tools 9appropriate to the child's age or grade, and, with regard to 10the social and emotional screening, require recording only 11whether or not the screening was completed.

The Department of Public Health shall specify that 16a diabetes screening as defined by rule shall be included as a 17required part of each health examination. Diabetes testing is 18not required.19    Physicians licensed to practice medicine in all of its 20branches, licensed advanced practice registered nurses, or 21licensed physician assistants shall be responsible for the 22performance of the health examinations, other than dental 23examinations, eye examinations, and vision and hearing 24screening, and shall sign all report forms required by 25subsection (4) of this Section that pertain to those portions 26of the health examination for which the physician, advanced   10400HB3408ham001- 7 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1practice registered nurse, or physician assistant is 2responsible. If a registered nurse performs any part of a 3health examination, then a physician licensed to practice 4medicine in all of its branches must review and sign all 5required report forms. Licensed dentists shall perform all 6dental examinations and shall sign all report forms required 7by subsection (4) of this Section that pertain to the dental 8examinations.

In these rules and regulations, 24the Department of Public Health shall require that individuals 25conducting vision screening tests give a child's parent or 26guardian written notification, before the vision screening is   10400HB3408ham001- 8 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1conducted, that states, "Vision screening is not a substitute 2for a complete eye and vision evaluation by an eye doctor. Your 3child is not required to undergo this vision screening if an 4optometrist or ophthalmologist has completed and signed a 5report form indicating that an examination has been 6administered within the previous 12 months.".7    (2.5) With respect to the developmental screening and the 8social and emotional screening portion of the health 9examination, each child may present proof of having been 10screened in accordance with this Section and the rules adopted 11under this Section before October 15th of the school year. 12With regard to the social and emotional screening only, the 13examining health care provider shall only record whether or 14not the screening was completed. If the child fails to present 15proof of the developmental screening or the social and 16emotional screening portions of the health examination by 17October 15th of the school year, qualified school support 18personnel may, with a parent's or guardian's consent, offer 19the developmental screening or the social and emotional 20screening to the child. Each public, private, and parochial 21school must give notice of the developmental screening and 22social and emotional screening requirements to the parents and 23guardians of students in compliance with the rules of the 24Department of Public Health. Nothing in this Section shall be 25construed to allow a school to exclude a child from attending 26because of a parent's or guardian's failure to obtain a   10400HB3408ham001- 9 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1developmental screening or a social and emotional screening 2for the child. Once a developmental screening or a social and 3emotional screening is completed and proof has been presented 4to the school, the school may, with a parent's or guardian's 5consent, make available appropriate school personnel to work 6with the parent or guardian, the child, and the provider who 7signed the screening form to obtain any appropriate 8evaluations and services as indicated on the form and in other 9information and documentation provided by the parents, 10guardians, or provider.11    (3) Every child shall, at or about the same time as he or 12she receives a health examination required by subsection (1) 13of this Section, present to the local school proof of having 14received such immunizations against preventable communicable 15diseases as the Department of Public Health shall require by 16rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this Section and 17the Communicable Disease Prevention Act.18    (4) The individuals conducting the health examination, 19dental examination, or eye examination shall record the fact 20of having conducted the examination, and such additional 21information as required, including for a health examination 22data relating to asthma and obesity (including at a minimum, 23date of birth, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, and 24date of exam), on uniform forms which the Department of Public 25Health and the State Board of Education shall prescribe for 26statewide use. The examiner shall summarize on the report form   10400HB3408ham001- 10 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1any condition that he or she suspects indicates a need for 2special services, including for a health examination factors 3relating to asthma or obesity. The duty to summarize on the 4report form does not apply to social and emotional screenings. 5The confidentiality of the information and records relating to 6the developmental screening and the social and emotional 7screening shall be determined by the statutes, rules, and 8professional ethics governing the type of provider conducting 9the screening. The individuals confirming the administration 10of required immunizations shall record as indicated on the 11form that the immunizations were administered.12    (5) If a child does not submit proof of having had either 13the health examination or the immunization as required, then 14the child shall be examined or receive the immunization, as 15the case may be, and present proof by October 15 of the current 16school year, or by an earlier date of the current school year 17established by a school district. To establish a date before 18October 15 of the current school year for the health 19examination or immunization as required, a school district 20must give notice of the requirements of this Section 60 days 21prior to the earlier established date. If for medical reasons 22one or more of the required immunizations must be given after 23October 15 of the current school year, or after an earlier 24established date of the current school year, then the child 25shall present, by October 15, or by the earlier established 26date, a schedule for the administration of the immunizations   10400HB3408ham001- 11 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1and a statement of the medical reasons causing the delay, both 2the schedule and the statement being issued by the physician, 3advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, 4registered nurse, or local health department that will be 5responsible for administration of the remaining required 6immunizations. If a child does not comply by October 15, or by 7the earlier established date of the current school year, with 8the requirements of this subsection, then the local school 9authority shall exclude that child from school until such time 10as the child presents proof of having had the health 11examination as required and presents proof of having received 12those required immunizations which are medically possible to 13receive immediately. During a child's exclusion from school 14for noncompliance with this subsection, the child's parents or 15legal guardian shall be considered in violation of Section 1626-1 and subject to any penalty imposed by Section 26-10. This 17subsection (5) does not apply to dental examinations, eye 18examinations, and the developmental screening and the social 19and emotional screening portions of the health examination. If 20the student is an out-of-state transfer student and does not 21have the proof required under this subsection (5) before 22October 15 of the current year or whatever date is set by the 23school district, then he or she may only attend classes (i) if 24he or she has proof that an appointment for the required 25vaccinations has been scheduled with a party authorized to 26submit proof of the required vaccinations. If the proof of   10400HB3408ham001- 12 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1vaccination required under this subsection (5) is not 2submitted within 30 days after the student is permitted to 3attend classes, then the student is not to be permitted to 4attend classes until proof of the vaccinations has been 5properly submitted. No school district or employee of a school 6district shall be held liable for any injury or illness to 7another person that results from admitting an out-of-state 8transfer student to class that has an appointment scheduled 9pursuant to this subsection (5). 10    (6) Every school shall report to the State Board of 11Education by November 15, in the manner which that agency 12shall require, the number of children who have received the 13necessary immunizations and the health examination (other than 14a dental examination or eye examination) as required, 15indicating, of those who have not received the immunizations 16and examination as required, the number of children who are 17exempt from health examination and immunization requirements 18on religious or medical grounds as provided in subsection (8). 19On or before December 1 of each year, every public school 20district and registered nonpublic school shall make publicly 21available the immunization data they are required to submit to 22the State Board of Education by November 15. The immunization 23data made publicly available must be identical to the data the 24school district or school has reported to the State Board of 25Education.26    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education   10400HB3408ham001- 13 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the 2number of children who have received the required dental 3examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 4required dental examination, the number of children who are 5exempt from the dental examination on religious grounds as 6provided in subsection (8) of this Section and the number of 7children who have received a waiver under subsection (1.5) of 8this Section.9    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education 10by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the 11number of children who have received the required eye 12examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 13required eye examination, the number of children who are 14exempt from the eye examination as provided in subsection (8) 15of this Section, the number of children who have received a 16waiver under subsection (1.10) of this Section, and the total 17number of children in noncompliance with the eye examination 18requirement.19    The reported information under this subsection (6) shall 20be provided to the Department of Public Health by the State 21Board of Education.22    (7) Upon determining that the number of pupils who are 23required to be in compliance with subsection (5) of this 24Section is below 90% of the number of pupils enrolled in the 25school district, 10% of each State aid payment made pursuant 26to Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 to the school district for such   10400HB3408ham001- 14 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1year may be withheld by the State Board of Education until the 2number of students in compliance with subsection (5) is the 3applicable specified percentage or higher.4    (8) Children of parents or legal guardians who object to 5health, dental, or eye examinations or any part thereof, to 6immunizations, or to vision and hearing screening tests on 7religious grounds shall not be required to undergo the 8examinations, tests, or immunizations to which they so object 9if such parents or legal guardians present to the appropriate 10local school authority a signed Certificate of Religious 11Exemption detailing the grounds for objection and the specific 12immunizations, tests, or examinations to which they object. 13The grounds for objection must set forth the specific 14religious belief that conflicts with the examination, test, 15immunization, or other medical intervention. The signed 16certificate shall also reflect the parent's or legal 17guardian's understanding of the school's exclusion policies in 18the case of a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak or 19exposure. The certificate must also be signed by the 20authorized examining health care provider responsible for the 21performance of the child's health examination confirming that 22the provider provided education to the parent or legal 23guardian on the benefits of immunization and the health risks 24to the student and to the community of the communicable 25diseases for which immunization is required in this State. 26However, the health care provider's signature on the   10400HB3408ham001- 15 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1certificate reflects only that education was provided and does 2not allow a health care provider grounds to determine a 3religious exemption. Those receiving immunizations required 4under this Code shall be provided with the relevant vaccine 5information statements that are required to be disseminated by 6the federal National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, 7which may contain information on circumstances when a vaccine 8should not be administered, prior to administering a vaccine. 9A healthcare provider may consider including without 10limitation the nationally accepted recommendations from 11federal agencies such as the Advisory Committee on 12Immunization Practices, the information outlined in the 13relevant vaccine information statement, and vaccine package 14inserts, along with the healthcare provider's clinical 15judgment, to determine whether any child may be more 16susceptible to experiencing an adverse vaccine reaction than 17the general population, and, if so, the healthcare provider 18may exempt the child from an immunization or adopt an 19individualized immunization schedule. The Certificate of 20Religious Exemption shall be created by the Department of 21Public Health and shall be made available and used by parents 22and legal guardians by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school 23year. Parents or legal guardians must submit the Certificate 24of Religious Exemption to their local school authority prior 25to entering kindergarten, sixth grade, and ninth grade for 26each child for which they are requesting an exemption. The   10400HB3408ham001- 16 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1religious objection stated need not be directed by the tenets 2of an established religious organization. However, general 3philosophical or moral reluctance to allow physical 4examinations, eye examinations, immunizations, vision and 5hearing screenings, or dental examinations does not provide a 6sufficient basis for an exception to statutory requirements. 7The local school authority is responsible for determining if 8the content of the Certificate of Religious Exemption 9constitutes a valid religious objection. The local school 10authority shall inform the parent or legal guardian of 11exclusion procedures, in accordance with the Department's 12rules under Part 690 of Title 77 of the Illinois 13Administrative Code, at the time the objection is presented. 14    If the physical condition of the child is such that any one 15or more of the immunizing agents should not be administered, 16the examining physician, advanced practice registered nurse, 17or physician assistant responsible for the performance of the 18health examination shall endorse that fact upon the health 19examination form.20    Exempting a child from the health, dental, or eye 21examination does not exempt the child from participation in 22the program of physical education training provided in 23Sections 27-5 through 27-7 of this Code.24    (8.5) The school board of a school district shall include 25informational materials regarding influenza and influenza 26vaccinations developed, provided, or approved by the   10400HB3408ham001- 17 -LRB104 11816 LNS 23281 a1Department of Public Health under Section 2310-700 of the 2Department of Public Health Powers and Duties Law of the Civil 3Administrative Code of Illinois when the board provides 4information on immunizations, infectious diseases, 5medications, or other school health issues to the parents or 6guardians of students.7    (9) For the purposes of this Section, "nursery schools" 8means those nursery schools operated by elementary school 9systems or secondary level school units or institutions of 10higher learning.11(Source: P.A. 103-985, eff. 1-1-25.) 12    Section 10. The Child Vision and Hearing Test Act is 13amended by adding Section 4.5 as follows: 14    (410 ILCS 205/4.5 new)15    Sec. 4.5. Color discrimination tests mandatory. 16Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, 17color discrimination tests shall be performed in all vision 18screening services under this Act. The Department of Public 19Health shall file rules with the Joint Committee on 20Administrative Rules within 180 days after the effective date 21of this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly. 22    Section 99.
