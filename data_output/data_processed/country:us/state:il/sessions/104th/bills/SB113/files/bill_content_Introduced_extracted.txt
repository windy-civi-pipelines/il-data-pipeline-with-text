If there is a finding of no 15probable cause, the defendant shall be released.

The Court may deny or 8    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 9    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 10    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 11    filing of the petition and the hearing.12    (d) Contents of petition.13        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 14    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 15    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 16    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 17    persons or the community, based on the specific 18    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.19        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 20    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 21    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 22    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 23    filing of the previous petition.24    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 25for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 26proving by clear and convincing evidence that:  SB0113- 11 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 2    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 3    subsection (a), and4        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 5    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 6    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 7    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 8    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 9    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 10    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 11    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 12    1986, and13        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 14    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 15    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 16    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 17    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 18    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 19    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 20    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and21        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 22    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 23    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 24    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 25    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 26    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or   SB0113- 12 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 2    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 3    appear in court as required.4    (f) Conduct of the hearings.5        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 6    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 7    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 8    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 9    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 10    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 11    hearing.12        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 13    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.14        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 15    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 16    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 17    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 18    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 19    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 20    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 21    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 22    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 23    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 24    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 25    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 26    conducted via a two-way audio-visual communication system,   SB0113- 13 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    such consultation shall not be recorded and shall be 2    undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 3        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 4    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 5    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 6    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 7    court determines that the physical health and safety of 8    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 9    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 10    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 11    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 12    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 13    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 14    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 15    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 16    Courts every 6 months. 17        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 18    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 19    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 20    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 21    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 22    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 23    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 24    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 25    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 26    the court shall state on the record the reason for   SB0113- 14 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 2    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 3    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 4    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 5    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 6    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 7    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 8    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 9    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 10    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 11    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 12    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 13    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 14    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 15    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 16    criminal history, if available, and any written or 17    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 18    statements made by any person, if in the State's 19    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 20        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 21    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 22    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 23    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 24    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 25    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 26    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for   SB0113- 15 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 2    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.3        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 4    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 5    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 6    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 7    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 8    the defendant.9        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 10    release, and detention prior to trial must be 11    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 12    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 13    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 14    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 15dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 16defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 17person or persons or the community, based on the specific 18articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 19limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:20        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 21    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 22    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.23        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 24    including:25            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 26        history indicative of violent, abusive or assaultive   SB0113- 16 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 2        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 3        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 4        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.5            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 6        psychiatric or other similar social history which 7        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 8        nature, or lack of any such history.9        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 10    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 11    nature of the threat.12        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 13    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 14    them.15        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.16        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 17    complaining witness. 18        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 19    access to any weapon or weapons.20        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 21    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 22    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release or 23    other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 24    appeal or completion of sentence for an offense under 25    federal or state law.26        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in   SB0113- 17 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 2    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 3    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 4    or lack of such behavior.5    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 6detention:7        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 8    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 9    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 10    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 11    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 12    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 13    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;14        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 15    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 16    pending trial;17        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 18    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 19    communication with others of his or her choice by 20    visitation, mail and telephone; and21        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 22    required for appearances in connection with court 23    proceedings.24    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 25detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 26Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the   SB0113- 18 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 2on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 3is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 4the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 5release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 6any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 7the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 8from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 9good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.10    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 11before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 12is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 13of any person or persons or the community, based on the 14specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 15defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 16    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 17entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 18denying his or her pretrial release.19    (k) Appeal.

If the court decides to 8    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 9    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 10    filing of the petition and the hearing.11    (d) Contents of petition.12        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 13    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 14    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 15    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 16    persons or the community, based on the specific 17    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.18        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 19    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 20    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 21    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 22    filing of the previous petition.23    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 24for pretrial release, and except as otherwise provided in 25subsection (e-1), the State shall bear the burden of proving 26by clear and convincing evidence that:  SB0113- 27 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 2    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 3    subsection (a), and4        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 5    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 6    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 7    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 8    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 9    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 10    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 11    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 12    1986, and13        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 14    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 15    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 16    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 17    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 18    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 19    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 20    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and21        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 22    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 23    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 24    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 25    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 26    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or   SB0113- 28 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 2    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 3    appear in court as required.4    (e-1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this 5Section, if the defendant is charged with a violation of 6Section 401 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act 7involving the manufacture or delivery, or possession with 8intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance, a 9counterfeit substance, or controlled substance analog of 15 10grams or more of a substance containing fentanyl, or an analog 11thereof, then the burden of proof is on the defendant to show 12by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant's pretrial 13release does not pose a real and present threat to the safety 14of any person or persons or the community, based on the 15specific articulable facts of the case. 16    (f) Conduct of the hearings.17        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 18    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 19    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 20    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 21    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 22    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 23    hearing.24        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 25    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.26        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by   SB0113- 29 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 2    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 3    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 4    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 5    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 6    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 7    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 8    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 9    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 10    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 11    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 12    conducted via a two-way audio-visual communication system, 13    such consultation shall not be recorded and shall be 14    undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 15        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 16    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 17    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 18    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 19    court determines that the physical health and safety of 20    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 21    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 22    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 23    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 24    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 25    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 26    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented   SB0113- 30 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 2    Courts every 6 months. 3        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 4    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 5    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 6    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 7    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 8    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 9    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 10    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 11    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 12    the court shall state on the record the reason for 13    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 14    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 15    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 16    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 17    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 18    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 19    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 20    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 21    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 22    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 23    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 24    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 25    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 26    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant,   SB0113- 31 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 2    criminal history, if available, and any written or 3    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 4    statements made by any person, if in the State's 5    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 6        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 7    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 8    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 9    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 10    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 11    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 12    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 13    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 14    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.15        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 16    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 17    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 18    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 19    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 20    the defendant.21        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 22    release, and detention prior to trial must be 23    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 24    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 25    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 26    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of   SB0113- 32 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 2defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 3person or persons or the community, based on the specific 4articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 5limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:6        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 7    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 8    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.9        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 10    including:11            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 12        history indicative of violent, abusive or assaultive 13        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 14        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 15        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 16        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.17            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 18        psychiatric or other similar social history which 19        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 20        nature, or lack of any such history.21        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 22    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 23    nature of the threat.24        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 25    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 26    them.  SB0113- 33 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.2        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 3    complaining witness. 4        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 5    access to any weapon or weapons.6        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 7    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 8    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release or 9    other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 10    appeal or completion of sentence for an offense under 11    federal or state law.12        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 13    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 14    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 15    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 16    or lack of such behavior.17    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 18detention:19        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 20    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 21    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 22    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 23    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 24    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 25    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;26        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the   SB0113- 34 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 2    pending trial;3        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 4    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 5    communication with others of his or her choice by 6    visitation, mail and telephone; and7        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 8    required for appearances in connection with court 9    proceedings.10    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 11detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 12Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 13offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 14on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 15is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 16the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 17release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 18any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 19the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 20from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 21good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.22    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 23before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 24is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 25of any person or persons or the community, based on the 26specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the   SB0113- 35 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 2    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 3entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 4denying his or her pretrial release.5    (k) Appeal. The State may appeal any order entered under 6this Section denying any motion for denial of pretrial 7release.8    (l) Presumption of innocence. Nothing in this Section 9shall be construed as modifying or limiting in any way the 10defendant's presumption of innocence in further criminal 11proceedings.12    (m) Interest of victims. 13    (1) Crime victims shall be given notice by the State's 14Attorney's office of this hearing as required in paragraph (1) 15of subsection (b) of Section 4.5 of the Rights of Crime Victims 16and Witnesses Act and shall be informed of their opportunity 17at this hearing to obtain a protective order. 18    (2) If the defendant is denied pretrial release, the court 19may impose a no contact provision with the victim or other 20interested party that shall be enforced while the defendant 21remains in custody. 22(Source: P.A. 102-1104, eff. 1-1-23; 103-822, eff. 1-1-25.) 23    Section 95.

If there is a finding of no 15probable cause, the defendant shall be released.

The Court may deny or 8    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 9    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 10    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 11    filing of the petition and the hearing.12    (d) Contents of petition.13        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 14    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 15    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 16    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 17    persons or the community, based on the specific 18    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.19        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 20    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 21    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 22    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 23    filing of the previous petition.24    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 25for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 26proving by clear and convincing evidence that:  SB0113- 11 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 2    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 3    subsection (a), and4        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 5    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 6    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 7    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 8    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 9    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 10    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 11    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 12    1986, and13        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 14    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 15    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 16    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 17    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 18    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 19    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 20    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and21        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 22    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 23    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 24    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 25    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 26    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or   SB0113- 12 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 2    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 3    appear in court as required.4    (f) Conduct of the hearings.5        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 6    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 7    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 8    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 9    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 10    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 11    hearing.12        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 13    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.14        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 15    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 16    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 17    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 18    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 19    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 20    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 21    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 22    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 23    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 24    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 25    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 26    conducted via a two-way audio-visual communication system,   SB0113- 13 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    such consultation shall not be recorded and shall be 2    undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 3        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 4    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 5    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 6    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 7    court determines that the physical health and safety of 8    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 9    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 10    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 11    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 12    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 13    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 14    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 15    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 16    Courts every 6 months. 17        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 18    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 19    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 20    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 21    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 22    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 23    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 24    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 25    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 26    the court shall state on the record the reason for   SB0113- 14 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 2    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 3    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 4    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 5    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 6    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 7    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 8    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 9    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 10    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 11    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 12    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 13    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 14    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 15    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 16    criminal history, if available, and any written or 17    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 18    statements made by any person, if in the State's 19    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 20        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 21    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 22    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 23    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 24    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 25    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 26    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for   SB0113- 15 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 2    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.3        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 4    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 5    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 6    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 7    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 8    the defendant.9        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 10    release, and detention prior to trial must be 11    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 12    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 13    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 14    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 15dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 16defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 17person or persons or the community, based on the specific 18articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 19limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:20        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 21    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 22    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.23        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 24    including:25            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 26        history indicative of violent, abusive or assaultive   SB0113- 16 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 2        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 3        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 4        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.5            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 6        psychiatric or other similar social history which 7        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 8        nature, or lack of any such history.9        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 10    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 11    nature of the threat.12        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 13    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 14    them.15        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.16        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 17    complaining witness. 18        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 19    access to any weapon or weapons.20        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 21    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 22    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release or 23    other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 24    appeal or completion of sentence for an offense under 25    federal or state law.26        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in   SB0113- 17 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 2    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 3    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 4    or lack of such behavior.5    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 6detention:7        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 8    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 9    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 10    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 11    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 12    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 13    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;14        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 15    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 16    pending trial;17        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 18    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 19    communication with others of his or her choice by 20    visitation, mail and telephone; and21        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 22    required for appearances in connection with court 23    proceedings.24    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 25detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 26Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the   SB0113- 18 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 2on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 3is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 4the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 5release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 6any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 7the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 8from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 9good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.10    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 11before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 12is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 13of any person or persons or the community, based on the 14specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 15defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 16    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 17entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 18denying his or her pretrial release.19    (k) Appeal. The State may appeal any order entered under 20this Section denying any motion for denial of pretrial 21release.22    (l) Presumption of innocence.

If there is a finding of no 14probable cause, the defendant shall be released. No such 15finding is necessary if the defendant is charged with a 16misdemeanor.17    (c) Timing of petition. 18        (1) A petition may be filed without prior notice to 19    the defendant at the first appearance before a judge, or 20    within the 21 calendar days, except as provided in Section 21    110-6, after arrest and release of the defendant upon 22    reasonable notice to defendant; provided that while such 23    petition is pending before the court, the defendant if 24    previously released shall not be detained.25        (2) Upon filing, the court shall immediately hold a 26    hearing on the petition unless a continuance is requested.   SB0113- 26 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    If a continuance is requested and granted, the hearing 2    shall be held within 48 hours of the defendant's first 3    appearance if the defendant is charged with first degree 4    murder or a Class X, Class 1, Class 2, or Class 3 felony, 5    and within 24 hours if the defendant is charged with a 6    Class 4 or misdemeanor offense. The Court may deny or 7    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 8    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 9    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 10    filing of the petition and the hearing.11    (d) Contents of petition.12        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 13    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 14    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 15    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 16    persons or the community, based on the specific 17    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.18        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 19    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 20    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 21    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 22    filing of the previous petition.23    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 24for pretrial release, and except as otherwise provided in 25subsection (e-1), the State shall bear the burden of proving 26by clear and convincing evidence that:  SB0113- 27 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 2    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 3    subsection (a), and4        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 5    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 6    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 7    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 8    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 9    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 10    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 11    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 12    1986, and13        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 14    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 15    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 16    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 17    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 18    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 19    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 20    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and21        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 22    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 23    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 24    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 25    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 26    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or   SB0113- 28 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 2    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 3    appear in court as required.4    (e-1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this 5Section, if the defendant is charged with a violation of 6Section 401 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act 7involving the manufacture or delivery, or possession with 8intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance, a 9counterfeit substance, or controlled substance analog of 15 10grams or more of a substance containing fentanyl, or an analog 11thereof, then the burden of proof is on the defendant to show 12by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant's pretrial 13release does not pose a real and present threat to the safety 14of any person or persons or the community, based on the 15specific articulable facts of the case. 16    (f) Conduct of the hearings.17        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 18    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 19    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 20    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 21    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 22    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 23    hearing.24        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 25    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.26        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by   SB0113- 29 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 2    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 3    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 4    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 5    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 6    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 7    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 8    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 9    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 10    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 11    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 12    conducted via a two-way audio-visual communication system, 13    such consultation shall not be recorded and shall be 14    undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 15        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 16    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 17    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 18    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 19    court determines that the physical health and safety of 20    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 21    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 22    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 23    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 24    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 25    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 26    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented   SB0113- 30 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 2    Courts every 6 months. 3        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 4    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 5    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 6    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 7    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 8    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 9    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 10    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 11    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 12    the court shall state on the record the reason for 13    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 14    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 15    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 16    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 17    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 18    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 19    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 20    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 21    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 22    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 23    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 24    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 25    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 26    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant,   SB0113- 31 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 2    criminal history, if available, and any written or 3    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 4    statements made by any person, if in the State's 5    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 6        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 7    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 8    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 9    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 10    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 11    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 12    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 13    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 14    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.15        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 16    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 17    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 18    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 19    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 20    the defendant.21        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 22    release, and detention prior to trial must be 23    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 24    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 25    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 26    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of   SB0113- 32 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 2defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 3person or persons or the community, based on the specific 4articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 5limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:6        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 7    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 8    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.9        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 10    including:11            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 12        history indicative of violent, abusive or assaultive 13        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 14        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 15        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 16        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.17            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 18        psychiatric or other similar social history which 19        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 20        nature, or lack of any such history.21        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 22    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 23    nature of the threat.24        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 25    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 26    them.  SB0113- 33 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.2        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 3    complaining witness. 4        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 5    access to any weapon or weapons.6        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 7    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 8    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release or 9    other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 10    appeal or completion of sentence for an offense under 11    federal or state law.12        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 13    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 14    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 15    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 16    or lack of such behavior.17    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 18detention:19        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 20    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 21    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 22    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 23    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 24    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 25    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;26        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the   SB0113- 34 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 2    pending trial;3        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 4    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 5    communication with others of his or her choice by 6    visitation, mail and telephone; and7        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 8    required for appearances in connection with court 9    proceedings.10    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 11detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 12Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 13offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 14on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 15is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 16the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 17release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 18any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 19the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 20from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 21good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.22    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 23before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 24is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 25of any person or persons or the community, based on the 26specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the   SB0113- 35 -LRB104 03070 RLC 13088 b1defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 2    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 3entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 4denying his or her pretrial release.5    (k) Appeal. The State may appeal any order entered under 6this Section denying any motion for denial of pretrial 7release.8    (l) Presumption of innocence. Nothing in this Section 9shall be construed as modifying or limiting in any way the 10defendant's presumption of innocence in further criminal 11proceedings.12    (m) Interest of victims. 13    (1) Crime victims shall be given notice by the State's 14Attorney's office of this hearing as required in paragraph (1) 15of subsection (b) of Section 4.5 of the Rights of Crime Victims 16and Witnesses Act and shall be informed of their opportunity 17at this hearing to obtain a protective order. 18    (2) If the defendant is denied pretrial release, the court 19may impose a no contact provision with the victim or other 20interested party that shall be enforced while the defendant 21remains in custody. 22(Source: P.A. 102-1104, eff. 1-1-23; 103-822, eff. 1-1-25.) 23    Section 95.
