The court may modify an order for 7    installment payments, from time to time, upon application 8    of either party upon notice to the other.9        (3) Compel any person cited, other than the judgment 10    debtor, to deliver up any assets so discovered, to be 11    applied in satisfaction of the judgment, in whole or in 12    part, when those assets are held under such circumstances 13    that in an action by the judgment debtor he or she could 14    recover them in specie or obtain a judgment for the 15    proceeds or value thereof as for conversion or 16    embezzlement. A judgment creditor may recover a corporate 17    judgment debtor's property on behalf of the judgment 18    debtor for use of the judgment creditor by filing an 19    appropriate petition within the citation proceedings. 20        (4) Enter any order upon or judgment against the 21    person cited that could be entered in any garnishment 22    proceeding.23        (5) Compel any person cited to execute an assignment 24    of any chose in action or a conveyance of title to real or 25    personal property or resign memberships in exchanges, 26    clubs, or other entities in the same manner and to the same   SB1501- 11 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1    extent as a court could do in any proceeding by a judgment 2    creditor to enforce payment of a judgment or in aid of the 3    enforcement of a judgment.4        (6) Authorize the judgment creditor to maintain an 5    action against any person or corporation that, it appears 6    upon proof satisfactory to the court, is indebted to the 7    judgment debtor, for the recovery of the debt, forbid the 8    transfer or other disposition of the debt until an action 9    can be commenced and prosecuted to judgment, direct that 10    the papers or proof in the possession or control of the 11    debtor and necessary in the prosecution of the action be 12    delivered to the creditor or impounded in court, and 13    provide for the disposition of any moneys in excess of the 14    sum required to pay the judgment creditor's judgment and 15    costs allowed by the court.16    (c-5) If a citation is directed to a judgment debtor who is 17a natural person, no payment order shall be entered under 18subsection (c) unless the Income and Asset Form was served 19upon the judgment debtor as required by subsection (b-1), the 20judgment debtor has had an opportunity to assert exemptions, 21and the payments are from non-exempt sources. 22    (d) No order or judgment shall be entered under subsection 23(c) in favor of the judgment creditor unless there appears of 24record a certification of mailing showing that a copy of the 25citation and a copy of the citation notice was mailed to the 26judgment debtor as required by subsection (b).  SB1501- 12 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1    (d-5) If upon examination the court determines that the 2judgment debtor does not possess any non-exempt income or 3assets, then the citation shall be dismissed. 4    (e) All property ordered to be delivered up shall, except 5as otherwise provided in this Section, be delivered to the 6sheriff to be collected by the sheriff or sold at public sale 7and the proceeds thereof applied towards the payment of costs 8and the satisfaction of the judgment. If the judgment debtor's 9property is of such a nature that it is not readily delivered 10up to the sheriff for public sale or if another method of sale 11is more appropriate to liquidate the property or enhance its 12value at sale, the court may order the sale of such property by 13the debtor, third party respondent, or by a selling agent 14other than the sheriff upon such terms as are just and 15equitable. The proceeds of sale, after deducting reasonable 16and necessary expenses, are to be turned over to the creditor 17and applied to the balance due on the judgment. 18    (f)(1) The citation may prohibit the party to whom it is 19directed from making or allowing any transfer or other 20disposition of, or interfering with, any property not exempt 21from the enforcement of a judgment therefrom, a deduction 22order or garnishment, belonging to the judgment debtor or to 23which he or she may be entitled or which may thereafter be 24acquired by or become due to him or her, and from paying over 25or otherwise disposing of any moneys not so exempt which are 26due or to become due to the judgment debtor, until the further   SB1501- 13 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1order of the court or the termination of the proceeding, 2whichever occurs first. The third party may not be obliged to 3withhold the payment of any moneys beyond double the amount of 4the balance due sought to be enforced by the judgment 5creditor. The court may punish any party who violates the 6restraining provision of a citation as and for a contempt, or 7if the party is a third party may enter judgment against him or 8her in the amount of the unpaid portion of the judgment and 9costs allowable under this Section, or in the amount of the 10value of the property transferred, whichever is lesser. 11    (2) The court may enjoin any person, whether or not a party 12to the citation proceeding, from making or allowing any 13transfer or other disposition of, or interference with, the 14property of the judgment debtor not exempt from the 15enforcement of a judgment, a deduction order or garnishment, 16or the property or debt not so exempt concerning which any 17person is required to attend and be examined until further 18direction in the premises. The injunction order shall remain 19in effect until vacated by the court or until the proceeding is 20terminated, whichever first occurs.21    (g) If it appears that any property, chose in action, 22credit or effect discovered, or any interest therein, is 23claimed by any person, the court shall, as in garnishment 24proceedings, permit or require the claimant to appear and 25maintain his or her right. The rights of the person cited and 26the rights of any adverse claimant shall be asserted and   SB1501- 14 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1determined pursuant to the law relating to garnishment 2proceedings.3    (h) Costs in proceedings authorized by this Section shall 4be allowed, assessed and paid in accordance with rules, 5provided that if the court determines, in its discretion, that 6costs incurred by the judgment creditor were improperly 7incurred, those costs shall be paid by the judgment creditor.8    (i) This Section is in addition to and does not affect 9enforcement of judgments or citation proceedings thereto, by 10any other methods now or hereafter provided by law.11    (j) This Section does not grant the power to any court to 12order installment or other payments from, or compel the sale, 13delivery, surrender, assignment or conveyance of any property 14exempt by statute from the enforcement of a judgment thereon, 15a deduction order, garnishment, attachment, sequestration, 16process or other levy or seizure.17    (k) (Blank).18    (k-3) The court may enter any order upon or judgment 19against the respondent cited that could be entered in any 20garnishment proceeding under Part 7 of Article XII of this 21Code. This subsection (k-3) shall be construed as being 22declarative of existing law and not as a new enactment.23    (k-5) If the court determines that any property held by a 24third party respondent is wages pursuant to Section 12-801, 25the court shall proceed as if a wage deduction proceeding had 26been filed and proceed to enter such necessary and proper   SB1501- 15 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1orders as would have been entered in a wage deduction 2proceeding including but not limited to the granting of the 3statutory exemptions allowed by Section 12-803 and all other 4remedies allowed plaintiff and defendant pursuant to Part 8 of 5Article 12 of this Act. 6    (k-10) If a creditor discovers personal property of the 7judgment debtor that is subject to the lien of a citation to 8discover assets, the creditor may have the court impress a 9lien against a specific item of personal property, including a 10beneficial interest in a land trust. The lien survives the 11termination of the citation proceedings and remains as a lien 12against the personal property in the same manner that a 13judgment lien recorded against real property pursuant to 14Section 12-101 remains a lien on real property. If the 15judgment is revived before dormancy, the lien shall remain. A 16lien against personal property may, but need not, be recorded 17in the office of the recorder or filed as an informational 18filing pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code. 19    (l) At any citation hearing at which the judgment debtor 20appears and seeks a declaration that certain of his or her 21income or assets are exempt, the court shall proceed to 22determine whether the property which the judgment debtor 23declares to be exempt is exempt from judgment. At any time 24before the return date specified on the citation, the judgment 25debtor may request, in writing, a hearing to declare exempt 26certain income and assets by notifying the clerk of the court   SB1501- 16 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1before that time, using forms as may be provided by the clerk 2of the court. The clerk of the court will obtain a prompt 3hearing date from the court and will provide the necessary 4forms that must be prepared by the judgment debtor or the 5attorney for the judgment debtor and sent to the judgment 6creditor, or the judgment creditor's attorney, regarding the 7time and location of the hearing. This notice may be sent by 8regular first class mail. At the hearing, the court shall 9immediately, unless for good cause shown that the hearing is 10to be continued, shall proceed to determine whether the 11property which the judgment debtor declares to be exempt is 12exempt from judgment. The restraining provisions of subsection 13(f) shall not apply to any property determined by the court to 14be exempt.15    (m) The judgment or balance due on the judgment becomes a 16lien when a citation is served in accordance with subsection 17(a) of this Section. The lien binds nonexempt personal 18property, including money, choses in action, and effects of 19the judgment debtor as follows:20        (1) When the citation is directed against the judgment 21    debtor, upon all personal property belonging to the 22    judgment debtor in the possession or control of the 23    judgment debtor or which may thereafter be acquired or 24    come due to the judgment debtor to the time of the 25    disposition of the citation.26        (2) When the citation is directed against a third   SB1501- 17 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1    party, upon all personal property belonging to the 2    judgment debtor in the possession or control of the third 3    party or which thereafter may be acquired or come due the 4    judgment debtor and comes into the possession or control 5    of the third party to the time of the disposition of the 6    citation.7    The lien established under this Section does not affect 8the rights of citation respondents in property prior to the 9service of the citation upon them and does not affect the 10rights of bona fide purchasers or lenders without notice of 11the citation. The lien is effective for the period specified 12by Supreme Court Rule.13    This subsection (m), as added by Public Act 88-48, is a 14declaration of existing law.15    (n) If any provision of this Act or its application to any 16person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity of that 17provision or application does not affect the provisions or 18applications of the Act that can be given effect without the 19invalid provision or application.20    (o) The changes to this Section made by this amendatory 21Act of the 97th General Assembly apply only to citation 22proceedings commenced under this Section on or after the 23effective date of this amendatory Act of the 97th General 24Assembly. The requirements or limitations set forth in 25subsections (b-1), (b-5), (b-10), (c-5), and (d-5) do not 26apply to the enforcement of any order or judgment resulting   SB1501- 18 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1from an adjudication of a municipal ordinance violation that 2is subject to Supreme Court Rules 570 through 579, or from an 3administrative adjudication of such an ordinance violation. 4(Source: P.A. 101-191, eff. 8-2-19.) 5    (735 ILCS 5/12-704)  (from Ch. 110, par. 12-704)6    Sec. 12-704.

The court may modify an order for 7    installment payments, from time to time, upon application 8    of either party upon notice to the other.9        (3) Compel any person cited, other than the judgment 10    debtor, to deliver up any assets so discovered, to be 11    applied in satisfaction of the judgment, in whole or in 12    part, when those assets are held under such circumstances 13    that in an action by the judgment debtor he or she could 14    recover them in specie or obtain a judgment for the 15    proceeds or value thereof as for conversion or 16    embezzlement. A judgment creditor may recover a corporate 17    judgment debtor's property on behalf of the judgment 18    debtor for use of the judgment creditor by filing an 19    appropriate petition within the citation proceedings. 20        (4) Enter any order upon or judgment against the 21    person cited that could be entered in any garnishment 22    proceeding.23        (5) Compel any person cited to execute an assignment 24    of any chose in action or a conveyance of title to real or 25    personal property or resign memberships in exchanges, 26    clubs, or other entities in the same manner and to the same   SB1501- 11 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1    extent as a court could do in any proceeding by a judgment 2    creditor to enforce payment of a judgment or in aid of the 3    enforcement of a judgment.4        (6) Authorize the judgment creditor to maintain an 5    action against any person or corporation that, it appears 6    upon proof satisfactory to the court, is indebted to the 7    judgment debtor, for the recovery of the debt, forbid the 8    transfer or other disposition of the debt until an action 9    can be commenced and prosecuted to judgment, direct that 10    the papers or proof in the possession or control of the 11    debtor and necessary in the prosecution of the action be 12    delivered to the creditor or impounded in court, and 13    provide for the disposition of any moneys in excess of the 14    sum required to pay the judgment creditor's judgment and 15    costs allowed by the court.16    (c-5) If a citation is directed to a judgment debtor who is 17a natural person, no payment order shall be entered under 18subsection (c) unless the Income and Asset Form was served 19upon the judgment debtor as required by subsection (b-1), the 20judgment debtor has had an opportunity to assert exemptions, 21and the payments are from non-exempt sources. 22    (d) No order or judgment shall be entered under subsection 23(c) in favor of the judgment creditor unless there appears of 24record a certification of mailing showing that a copy of the 25citation and a copy of the citation notice was mailed to the 26judgment debtor as required by subsection (b).  SB1501- 12 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1    (d-5) If upon examination the court determines that the 2judgment debtor does not possess any non-exempt income or 3assets, then the citation shall be dismissed. 4    (e) All property ordered to be delivered up shall, except 5as otherwise provided in this Section, be delivered to the 6sheriff to be collected by the sheriff or sold at public sale 7and the proceeds thereof applied towards the payment of costs 8and the satisfaction of the judgment. If the judgment debtor's 9property is of such a nature that it is not readily delivered 10up to the sheriff for public sale or if another method of sale 11is more appropriate to liquidate the property or enhance its 12value at sale, the court may order the sale of such property by 13the debtor, third party respondent, or by a selling agent 14other than the sheriff upon such terms as are just and 15equitable. The proceeds of sale, after deducting reasonable 16and necessary expenses, are to be turned over to the creditor 17and applied to the balance due on the judgment. 18    (f)(1) The citation may prohibit the party to whom it is 19directed from making or allowing any transfer or other 20disposition of, or interfering with, any property not exempt 21from the enforcement of a judgment therefrom, a deduction 22order or garnishment, belonging to the judgment debtor or to 23which he or she may be entitled or which may thereafter be 24acquired by or become due to him or her, and from paying over 25or otherwise disposing of any moneys not so exempt which are 26due or to become due to the judgment debtor, until the further   SB1501- 13 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1order of the court or the termination of the proceeding, 2whichever occurs first. The third party may not be obliged to 3withhold the payment of any moneys beyond double the amount of 4the balance due sought to be enforced by the judgment 5creditor. The court may punish any party who violates the 6restraining provision of a citation as and for a contempt, or 7if the party is a third party may enter judgment against him or 8her in the amount of the unpaid portion of the judgment and 9costs allowable under this Section, or in the amount of the 10value of the property transferred, whichever is lesser. 11    (2) The court may enjoin any person, whether or not a party 12to the citation proceeding, from making or allowing any 13transfer or other disposition of, or interference with, the 14property of the judgment debtor not exempt from the 15enforcement of a judgment, a deduction order or garnishment, 16or the property or debt not so exempt concerning which any 17person is required to attend and be examined until further 18direction in the premises. The injunction order shall remain 19in effect until vacated by the court or until the proceeding is 20terminated, whichever first occurs.21    (g) If it appears that any property, chose in action, 22credit or effect discovered, or any interest therein, is 23claimed by any person, the court shall, as in garnishment 24proceedings, permit or require the claimant to appear and 25maintain his or her right. The rights of the person cited and 26the rights of any adverse claimant shall be asserted and   SB1501- 14 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1determined pursuant to the law relating to garnishment 2proceedings.3    (h) Costs in proceedings authorized by this Section shall 4be allowed, assessed and paid in accordance with rules, 5provided that if the court determines, in its discretion, that 6costs incurred by the judgment creditor were improperly 7incurred, those costs shall be paid by the judgment creditor.8    (i) This Section is in addition to and does not affect 9enforcement of judgments or citation proceedings thereto, by 10any other methods now or hereafter provided by law.11    (j) This Section does not grant the power to any court to 12order installment or other payments from, or compel the sale, 13delivery, surrender, assignment or conveyance of any property 14exempt by statute from the enforcement of a judgment thereon, 15a deduction order, garnishment, attachment, sequestration, 16process or other levy or seizure.17    (k) (Blank).18    (k-3) The court may enter any order upon or judgment 19against the respondent cited that could be entered in any 20garnishment proceeding under Part 7 of Article XII of this 21Code. This subsection (k-3) shall be construed as being 22declarative of existing law and not as a new enactment.23    (k-5) If the court determines that any property held by a 24third party respondent is wages pursuant to Section 12-801, 25the court shall proceed as if a wage deduction proceeding had 26been filed and proceed to enter such necessary and proper   SB1501- 15 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1orders as would have been entered in a wage deduction 2proceeding including but not limited to the granting of the 3statutory exemptions allowed by Section 12-803 and all other 4remedies allowed plaintiff and defendant pursuant to Part 8 of 5Article 12 of this Act. 6    (k-10) If a creditor discovers personal property of the 7judgment debtor that is subject to the lien of a citation to 8discover assets, the creditor may have the court impress a 9lien against a specific item of personal property, including a 10beneficial interest in a land trust. The lien survives the 11termination of the citation proceedings and remains as a lien 12against the personal property in the same manner that a 13judgment lien recorded against real property pursuant to 14Section 12-101 remains a lien on real property. If the 15judgment is revived before dormancy, the lien shall remain. A 16lien against personal property may, but need not, be recorded 17in the office of the recorder or filed as an informational 18filing pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code. 19    (l) At any citation hearing at which the judgment debtor 20appears and seeks a declaration that certain of his or her 21income or assets are exempt, the court shall proceed to 22determine whether the property which the judgment debtor 23declares to be exempt is exempt from judgment. At any time 24before the return date specified on the citation, the judgment 25debtor may request, in writing, a hearing to declare exempt 26certain income and assets by notifying the clerk of the court   SB1501- 16 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1before that time, using forms as may be provided by the clerk 2of the court. The clerk of the court will obtain a prompt 3hearing date from the court and will provide the necessary 4forms that must be prepared by the judgment debtor or the 5attorney for the judgment debtor and sent to the judgment 6creditor, or the judgment creditor's attorney, regarding the 7time and location of the hearing. This notice may be sent by 8regular first class mail. At the hearing, the court shall 9immediately, unless for good cause shown that the hearing is 10to be continued, shall proceed to determine whether the 11property which the judgment debtor declares to be exempt is 12exempt from judgment. The restraining provisions of subsection 13(f) shall not apply to any property determined by the court to 14be exempt.15    (m) The judgment or balance due on the judgment becomes a 16lien when a citation is served in accordance with subsection 17(a) of this Section. The lien binds nonexempt personal 18property, including money, choses in action, and effects of 19the judgment debtor as follows:20        (1) When the citation is directed against the judgment 21    debtor, upon all personal property belonging to the 22    judgment debtor in the possession or control of the 23    judgment debtor or which may thereafter be acquired or 24    come due to the judgment debtor to the time of the 25    disposition of the citation.26        (2) When the citation is directed against a third   SB1501- 17 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1    party, upon all personal property belonging to the 2    judgment debtor in the possession or control of the third 3    party or which thereafter may be acquired or come due the 4    judgment debtor and comes into the possession or control 5    of the third party to the time of the disposition of the 6    citation.7    The lien established under this Section does not affect 8the rights of citation respondents in property prior to the 9service of the citation upon them and does not affect the 10rights of bona fide purchasers or lenders without notice of 11the citation. The lien is effective for the period specified 12by Supreme Court Rule.13    This subsection (m), as added by Public Act 88-48, is a 14declaration of existing law.15    (n) If any provision of this Act or its application to any 16person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity of that 17provision or application does not affect the provisions or 18applications of the Act that can be given effect without the 19invalid provision or application.20    (o) The changes to this Section made by this amendatory 21Act of the 97th General Assembly apply only to citation 22proceedings commenced under this Section on or after the 23effective date of this amendatory Act of the 97th General 24Assembly. The requirements or limitations set forth in 25subsections (b-1), (b-5), (b-10), (c-5), and (d-5) do not 26apply to the enforcement of any order or judgment resulting   SB1501- 18 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1from an adjudication of a municipal ordinance violation that 2is subject to Supreme Court Rules 570 through 579, or from an 3administrative adjudication of such an ordinance violation. 4(Source: P.A. 101-191, eff. 8-2-19.) 5    (735 ILCS 5/12-704)  (from Ch. 110, par. 12-704)6    Sec. 12-704.

In this Section, "wages" 15means any hourly pay, salaries, commissions, bonuses, or other 16compensation owed by an employer to a judgment debtor and 17"financial institution" means a bank chartered under the 18Illinois Banking Act, a savings bank chartered under the 19Illinois Savings Bank Act, a credit union incorporated under 20the Illinois Credit Union Act, an entity licensed under the 21Illinois Residential Mortgage License Act of 1987 which lent 22or originated 50 or more residential mortgage loans in the 23previous calendar year, and any other financial institution 24under the jurisdiction of the Department of Financial and 25Professional Regulation and designated as such by rule.   SB1501- 19 -LRB104 07375 JRC 17415 b1(Source: P.A. 83-707.) 2    (735 ILCS 5/12-901)  (from Ch. 110, par. 12-901)3    Sec. 12-901.
