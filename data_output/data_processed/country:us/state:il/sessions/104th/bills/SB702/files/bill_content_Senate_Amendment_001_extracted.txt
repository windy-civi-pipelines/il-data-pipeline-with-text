and 7            (B) any exclusions for fuel or energy capture. 8        (2) For purposes of determining whether reuse 9    performance targets are being met, a producer 10    responsibility plan must provide a methodology for 11    measuring the amount of reusable covered materials at the 12    point at which reusable covered materials meet the 13    following criteria as demonstrated by the producer and 14    approved by the Agency: 15            (A) whether the average minimum number of cycles 16        of reuses within a recognized reuse system has been 17        met based on the number of times an item must be reused 18        for it to have lower environmental impacts than the 19        single-use alternatives of those items; and 20            (B) whether the demonstrated or research-based 21        anticipated return rate of the covered material to the 22        reuse system has been met. 23        (3) For purposes of determining whether postconsumer 24    recycled content performance targets are being met, a 25    producer responsibility plan must provide a methodology 26    for measuring postconsumer recycled content across all   10400SB0702sam001- 61 -LRB104 07000 BDA 24293 a1    producers for a covered materials type where producers may 2    determine their postconsumer recycled content based on 3    their United States market territory if State-specific 4    postconsumer recycled content is impractical to determine. 5        (4) For other performance targets, the producer 6    responsibility organization must propose methodologies for 7    review and approval as part of the packaging producer 8    responsibility plan and recycling refund producer 9    responsibility plan. 10    (d) A packaging producer responsibility organization must 11implement an alternative collection program for covered 12materials included on an alternative collection list 13established under this Act that: 14        (1) provides year-round, convenient, statewide 15    collection opportunities, including at least one drop-off 16    collection site located in each county; 17        (2) provides tiers of service for collection, 18    convenience, number of drop-off collection sites, and 19    additional collection systems based on county population 20    size and county population density; 21        (3) ensures materials are sent to responsible markets; 22        (4) uses education and outreach strategies that can be 23    expected to significantly increase consumer awareness of 24    the program throughout the State; and 25        (5) accurately measures the amount of each covered 26    material collected and the applicable performance target.   10400SB0702sam001- 62 -LRB104 07000 BDA 24293 a1    (e) The Agency, in consultation with an advisory board, 2may require that a packaging producer responsibility 3organization or recycling refund producer responsibility 4organization obtain and pay for a third-party certification of 5any activity or achievement required by this Act if a 6third-party certification is readily available, deemed 7applicable, and of reasonable cost.
