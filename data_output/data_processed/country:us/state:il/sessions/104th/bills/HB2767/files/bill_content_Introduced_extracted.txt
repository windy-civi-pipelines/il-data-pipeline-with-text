If the applicant will 15sell tangible personal property at retail through vending 16machines, his application to register shall indicate the 17number of vending machines to be so operated. If requested by 18the Department at any time, that person shall verify the total 19number of vending machines he or she uses in his or her 20business of selling tangible personal property at retail.21    The Department shall provide by rule for an expedited 22business registration process for remote retailers required to 23register and file under subsection (b) of Section 2 who use a 24certified service provider to file their returns under this 25Act. Such expedited registration process shall allow the 26Department to register a taxpayer based upon the same   HB2767- 3 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1registration information required by the Streamlined Sales Tax 2Governing Board for states participating in the Streamlined 3Sales Tax Project. 4    The Department may deny a certificate of registration to 5any applicant if a person who is named as the owner, a partner, 6a manager or member of a limited liability company, or a 7corporate officer of the applicant on the application for the 8certificate of registration is or has been named as the owner, 9a partner, a manager or member of a limited liability company, 10or a corporate officer on the application for the certificate 11of registration of another retailer that (i) is in default for 12moneys due under this Act or any other tax or fee Act 13administered by the Department or (ii) fails to file any 14return, on or before the due date prescribed for filing that 15return (including any extensions of time granted by the 16Department), that the retailer is required to file under this 17Act or any other tax or fee Act administered by the Department. 18For purposes of this paragraph only, in determining whether a 19person is in default for moneys due, the Department shall 20include only amounts established as a final liability within 21the 23 years prior to the date of the Department's notice of 22denial of a certificate of registration. 23    The Department may require an applicant for a certificate 24of registration hereunder to, at the time of filing such 25application, furnish a bond from a surety company authorized 26to do business in the State of Illinois, or an irrevocable bank   HB2767- 4 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1letter of credit or a bond signed by 2 personal sureties who 2have filed, with the Department, sworn statements disclosing 3net assets equal to at least 3 times the amount of the bond to 4be required of such applicant, or a bond secured by an 5assignment of a bank account or certificate of deposit, stocks 6or bonds, conditioned upon the applicant paying to the State 7of Illinois all moneys becoming due under this Act and under 8any other State tax law or municipal or county tax ordinance or 9resolution under which the certificate of registration that is 10issued to the applicant under this Act will permit the 11applicant to engage in business without registering separately 12under such other law, ordinance or resolution. In making a 13determination as to whether to require a bond or other 14security, the Department shall take into consideration whether 15the owner, any partner, any manager or member of a limited 16liability company, or a corporate officer of the applicant is 17or has been the owner, a partner, a manager or member of a 18limited liability company, or a corporate officer of another 19retailer that is in default for moneys due under this Act or 20any other tax or fee Act administered by the Department; and 21whether the owner, any partner, any manager or member of a 22limited liability company, or a corporate officer of the 23applicant is or has been the owner, a partner, a manager or 24member of a limited liability company, or a corporate officer 25of another retailer whose certificate of registration has been 26revoked within the previous 5 years under this Act or any other   HB2767- 5 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1tax or fee Act administered by the Department. If a bond or 2other security is required, the Department shall fix the 3amount of the bond or other security, taking into 4consideration the amount of money expected to become due from 5the applicant under this Act and under any other State tax law 6or municipal or county tax ordinance or resolution under which 7the certificate of registration that is issued to the 8applicant under this Act will permit the applicant to engage 9in business without registering separately under such other 10law, ordinance, or resolution. The amount of security required 11by the Department shall be such as, in its opinion, will 12protect the State of Illinois against failure to pay the 13amount which may become due from the applicant under this Act 14and under any other State tax law or municipal or county tax 15ordinance or resolution under which the certificate of 16registration that is issued to the applicant under this Act 17will permit the applicant to engage in business without 18registering separately under such other law, ordinance or 19resolution, but the amount of the security required by the 20Department shall not exceed three times the amount of the 21applicant's average monthly tax liability, or $50,000.00, 22whichever amount is lower.23    No certificate of registration under this Act shall be 24issued by the Department until the applicant provides the 25Department with satisfactory security, if required, as herein 26provided for.  HB2767- 6 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1    Upon receipt of the application for certificate of 2registration in proper form, and upon approval by the 3Department of the security furnished by the applicant, if 4required, the Department shall issue to such applicant, in the 5manner and form determined by the Department, a certificate of 6registration which shall permit the person to whom it is 7issued to engage in the business of selling tangible personal 8property at retail in this State. The certificate of 9registration shall be conspicuously displayed, in the manner 10and form as the Department may require by rule, at the place of 11business which the person so registered states in his 12application to be the principal place of business from which 13he engages in the business of selling tangible personal 14property at retail in this State.15    No certificate of registration issued prior to July 1, 162017 to a taxpayer who files returns required by this Act on a 17monthly basis or renewed prior to July 1, 2017 by a taxpayer 18who files returns required by this Act on a monthly basis shall 19be valid after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its 20issuance or last renewal. No certificate of registration 21issued on or after July 1, 2017 to a taxpayer who files returns 22required by this Act on a monthly basis or renewed on or after 23July 1, 2017 by a taxpayer who files returns required by this 24Act on a monthly basis shall be valid after the expiration of 25one year from the date of its issuance or last renewal. The 26expiration date of a sub-certificate of registration shall be   HB2767- 7 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1that of the certificate of registration to which the 2sub-certificate relates. Prior to July 1, 2017, a certificate 3of registration shall automatically be renewed, subject to 4revocation as provided by this Act, for an additional 5 years 5from the date of its expiration unless otherwise notified by 6the Department as provided by this paragraph. On and after 7July 1, 2017, a certificate of registration shall 8automatically be renewed, subject to revocation as provided by 9this Act, for an additional one year from the date of its 10expiration unless otherwise notified by the Department as 11provided by this paragraph. 12    Where a taxpayer to whom a certificate of registration is 13issued under this Act is in default to the State of Illinois 14for delinquent returns or for moneys due under this Act or any 15other State tax law or municipal or county ordinance 16administered or enforced by the Department, the Department 17shall, not less than 60 days before the expiration date of such 18certificate of registration, give notice to the taxpayer to 19whom the certificate was issued of the account period of the 20delinquent returns, the amount of tax, penalty and interest 21due and owing from the taxpayer, and that the certificate of 22registration shall not be automatically renewed upon its 23expiration date unless the taxpayer, on or before the date of 24expiration, has filed and paid the delinquent returns or paid 25the defaulted amount in full. A taxpayer to whom such a notice 26is issued shall be deemed an applicant for renewal. The   HB2767- 8 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1Department shall promulgate regulations establishing 2procedures for taxpayers who file returns on a monthly basis 3but desire and qualify to change to a quarterly or yearly 4filing basis and will no longer be subject to renewal under 5this Section, and for taxpayers who file returns on a yearly or 6quarterly basis but who desire or are required to change to a 7monthly filing basis and will be subject to renewal under this 8Section.9    The Department may in its discretion approve renewal by an 10applicant who is in default if, at the time of application for 11renewal, the applicant files all of the delinquent returns or 12pays to the Department such percentage of the defaulted amount 13as may be determined by the Department and agrees in writing to 14waive all limitations upon the Department for collection of 15the remaining defaulted amount to the Department over a period 16not to exceed 5 years from the date of renewal of the 17certificate; however, no renewal application submitted by an 18applicant who is in default shall be approved if the 19immediately preceding renewal by the applicant was conditioned 20upon the installment payment agreement described in this 21Section. The payment agreement herein provided for shall be in 22addition to and not in lieu of the security that may be 23required by this Section of a taxpayer who is no longer 24considered a prior continuous compliance taxpayer. The 25execution of the payment agreement as provided in this Act 26shall not toll the accrual of interest at the statutory rate.  HB2767- 9 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1    The Department may suspend a certificate of registration 2if the Department finds that the person to whom the 3certificate of registration has been issued knowingly sold 4contraband cigarettes. 5    A certificate of registration issued under this Act more 6than 5 years before January 1, 1990 (the effective date of 7Public Act 86-383) shall expire and be subject to the renewal 8provisions of this Section on the next anniversary of the date 9of issuance of such certificate which occurs more than 6 10months after January 1, 1990 (the effective date of Public Act 1186-383). A certificate of registration issued less than 5 12years before January 1, 1990 (the effective date of Public Act 1386-383) shall expire and be subject to the renewal provisions 14of this Section on the 5th anniversary of the issuance of the 15certificate.16    If the person so registered states that he operates other 17places of business from which he engages in the business of 18selling tangible personal property at retail in this State, 19the Department shall furnish him with a sub-certificate of 20registration for each such place of business, and the 21applicant shall display the appropriate sub-certificate of 22registration at each such place of business. All 23sub-certificates of registration shall bear the same 24registration number as that appearing upon the certificate of 25registration to which such sub-certificates relate.26    If the applicant will sell tangible personal property at   HB2767- 10 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1retail through vending machines, the Department shall furnish 2him with a sub-certificate of registration for each such 3vending machine, and the applicant shall display the 4appropriate sub-certificate of registration on each such 5vending machine by attaching the sub-certificate of 6registration to a conspicuous part of such vending machine. If 7a person who is registered to sell tangible personal property 8at retail through vending machines adds an additional vending 9machine or additional vending machines to the number of 10vending machines he or she uses in his or her business of 11selling tangible personal property at retail, he or she shall 12notify the Department, on a form prescribed by the Department, 13to request an additional sub-certificate or additional 14sub-certificates of registration, as applicable. With each 15such request, the applicant shall report the number of 16sub-certificates of registration he or she is requesting as 17well as the total number of vending machines from which he or 18she makes retail sales. 19    Where the same person engages in 2 or more businesses of 20selling tangible personal property at retail in this State, 21which businesses are substantially different in character or 22engaged in under different trade names or engaged in under 23other substantially dissimilar circumstances (so that it is 24more practicable, from an accounting, auditing or bookkeeping 25standpoint, for such businesses to be separately registered), 26the Department may require or permit such person (subject to   HB2767- 11 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1the same requirements concerning the furnishing of security as 2those that are provided for hereinbefore in this Section as to 3each application for a certificate of registration) to apply 4for and obtain a separate certificate of registration for each 5such business or for any of such businesses, under a single 6certificate of registration supplemented by related 7sub-certificates of registration.8    Any person who is registered under the Retailers' 9Occupation Tax Act as of March 8, 1963, and who, during the 103-year period immediately prior to March 8, 1963, or during a 11continuous 3-year period part of which passed immediately 12before and the remainder of which passes immediately after 13March 8, 1963, has been so registered continuously and who is 14determined by the Department not to have been either 15delinquent or deficient in the payment of tax liability during 16that period under this Act or under any other State tax law or 17municipal or county tax ordinance or resolution under which 18the certificate of registration that is issued to the 19registrant under this Act will permit the registrant to engage 20in business without registering separately under such other 21law, ordinance or resolution, shall be considered to be a 22Prior Continuous Compliance taxpayer. Also any taxpayer who 23has, as verified by the Department, faithfully and 24continuously complied with the condition of his bond or other 25security under the provisions of this Act for a period of 3 26consecutive years shall be considered to be a Prior Continuous   HB2767- 12 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1Compliance taxpayer.2    Every Prior Continuous Compliance taxpayer shall be exempt 3from all requirements under this Act concerning the furnishing 4of a bond or other security as a condition precedent to his 5being authorized to engage in the business of selling tangible 6personal property at retail in this State. This exemption 7shall continue for each such taxpayer until such time as he may 8be determined by the Department to be delinquent in the filing 9of any returns, or is determined by the Department (either 10through the Department's issuance of a final assessment which 11has become final under the Act, or by the taxpayer's filing of 12a return which admits tax that is not paid to be due) to be 13delinquent or deficient in the paying of any tax under this Act 14or under any other State tax law or municipal or county tax 15ordinance or resolution under which the certificate of 16registration that is issued to the registrant under this Act 17will permit the registrant to engage in business without 18registering separately under such other law, ordinance or 19resolution, at which time that taxpayer shall become subject 20to all the financial responsibility requirements of this Act 21and, as a condition of being allowed to continue to engage in 22the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, 23may be required to post bond or other acceptable security with 24the Department covering liability which such taxpayer may 25thereafter incur. Any taxpayer who fails to pay an admitted or 26established liability under this Act may also be required to   HB2767- 13 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1post bond or other acceptable security with this Department 2guaranteeing the payment of such admitted or established 3liability.4    No certificate of registration shall be issued to any 5person who is in default to the State of Illinois for moneys 6due under this Act or under any other State tax law or 7municipal or county tax ordinance or resolution under which 8the certificate of registration that is issued to the 9applicant under this Act will permit the applicant to engage 10in business without registering separately under such other 11law, ordinance or resolution.12    Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Department 13under this Section may, within 20 days after notice of such 14decision, protest and request a hearing, whereupon the 15Department shall give notice to such person of the time and 16place fixed for such hearing and shall hold a hearing in 17conformity with the provisions of this Act and then issue its 18final administrative decision in the matter to such person. In 19the absence of such a protest within 20 days, the Department's 20decision shall become final without any further determination 21being made or notice given.22    With respect to security other than bonds (upon which the 23Department may sue in the event of a forfeiture), if the 24taxpayer fails to pay, when due, any amount whose payment such 25security guarantees, the Department shall, after such 26liability is admitted by the taxpayer or established by the   HB2767- 14 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1Department through the issuance of a final assessment that has 2become final under the law, convert the security which that 3taxpayer has furnished into money for the State, after first 4giving the taxpayer at least 10 days' written notice, by 5registered or certified mail, to pay the liability or forfeit 6such security to the Department. If the security consists of 7stocks or bonds or other securities which are listed on a 8public exchange, the Department shall sell such securities 9through such public exchange. If the security consists of an 10irrevocable bank letter of credit, the Department shall 11convert the security in the manner provided for in the Uniform 12Commercial Code. If the security consists of a bank 13certificate of deposit, the Department shall convert the 14security into money by demanding and collecting the amount of 15such bank certificate of deposit from the bank which issued 16such certificate. If the security consists of a type of stocks 17or other securities which are not listed on a public exchange, 18the Department shall sell such security to the highest and 19best bidder after giving at least 10 days' notice of the date, 20time and place of the intended sale by publication in the 21"State Official Newspaper". If the Department realizes more 22than the amount of such liability from the security, plus the 23expenses incurred by the Department in converting the security 24into money, the Department shall pay such excess to the 25taxpayer who furnished such security, and the balance shall be 26paid into the State Treasury.  HB2767- 15 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1    The Department shall discharge any surety and shall 2release and return any security deposited, assigned, pledged 3or otherwise provided to it by a taxpayer under this Section 4within 30 days after:5        (1) such taxpayer becomes a Prior Continuous 6    Compliance taxpayer; or7        (2) such taxpayer has ceased to collect receipts on 8    which he is required to remit tax to the Department, has 9    filed a final tax return, and has paid to the Department an 10    amount sufficient to discharge his remaining tax 11    liability, as determined by the Department, under this Act 12    and under every other State tax law or municipal or county 13    tax ordinance or resolution under which the certificate of 14    registration issued under this Act permits the registrant 15    to engage in business without registering separately under 16    such other law, ordinance or resolution. The Department 17    shall make a final determination of the taxpayer's 18    outstanding tax liability as expeditiously as possible 19    after his final tax return has been filed; if the 20    Department cannot make such final determination within 45 21    days after receiving the final tax return, within such 22    period it shall so notify the taxpayer, stating its 23    reasons therefor.24(Source: P.A. 102-40, eff. 6-25-21; 103-319, eff. 1-1-24; 25103-592, eff. 1-1-25.)   HB2767- 16 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1    Section 10.

Such returns shall be filed on 24forms prescribed and furnished by the Department. The 25Department may promulgate rules to require that the cigarette   HB2767- 17 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1machine operator's return be accompanied by appropriate 2computer-generated magnetic media supporting schedule data in 3the format required by the Department, unless, as provided by 4rule, the Department grants an exception upon petition of a 5cigarette machine operator.6    Cigarette machine operators shall send a copy of those 7returns, together with supporting schedule data, to the 8Attorney General's Office by the 15th day of each month for the 9period covering the preceding calendar month.10    (b) Cigarette machine operators may take a credit against 11any tax due under Section 1-10 of this Act for taxes imposed 12and paid under the Tobacco Products Tax Act of 1995 on tobacco 13products sold to a customer and used in a rolling machine 14located at the cigarette machine operator's place of business. 15To be eligible for such credit, the tobacco product must meet 16the requirements of subsection (a) of Section 1-25 of this 17Act.

The Cigarette Tax Act is amended by changing 2Sections 4b, 9, 9e, and 9f as follows: 3    (35 ILCS 130/4b)  (from Ch. 120, par. 453.4b)4    Sec. 4b. (a) The Department may, in its discretion, upon 5application, issue permits authorizing the payment of the tax 6herein imposed by out-of-State cigarette manufacturers who are 7not required to be licensed as distributors of cigarettes in 8this State, but who elect to qualify under this Act as 9distributors of cigarettes in this State, and who, to the 10satisfaction of the Department, furnish adequate security to 11insure payment of the tax, provided that any such permit shall 12extend only to cigarettes which such permittee manufacturer 13places in original packages that are contained inside a sealed 14transparent wrapper.

The amount of security required 11by the Department shall be such as, in its opinion, will 12protect the State of Illinois against failure to pay the 13amount which may become due from the applicant under this Act 14and under any other State tax law or municipal or county tax 15ordinance or resolution under which the certificate of 16registration that is issued to the applicant under this Act 17will permit the applicant to engage in business without 18registering separately under such other law, ordinance or 19resolution, but the amount of the security required by the 20Department shall not exceed three times the amount of the 21applicant's average monthly tax liability, or $50,000.00, 22whichever amount is lower.23    No certificate of registration under this Act shall be 24issued by the Department until the applicant provides the 25Department with satisfactory security, if required, as herein 26provided for.  HB2767- 6 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1    Upon receipt of the application for certificate of 2registration in proper form, and upon approval by the 3Department of the security furnished by the applicant, if 4required, the Department shall issue to such applicant, in the 5manner and form determined by the Department, a certificate of 6registration which shall permit the person to whom it is 7issued to engage in the business of selling tangible personal 8property at retail in this State. The certificate of 9registration shall be conspicuously displayed, in the manner 10and form as the Department may require by rule, at the place of 11business which the person so registered states in his 12application to be the principal place of business from which 13he engages in the business of selling tangible personal 14property at retail in this State.15    No certificate of registration issued prior to July 1, 162017 to a taxpayer who files returns required by this Act on a 17monthly basis or renewed prior to July 1, 2017 by a taxpayer 18who files returns required by this Act on a monthly basis shall 19be valid after the expiration of 5 years from the date of its 20issuance or last renewal. No certificate of registration 21issued on or after July 1, 2017 to a taxpayer who files returns 22required by this Act on a monthly basis or renewed on or after 23July 1, 2017 by a taxpayer who files returns required by this 24Act on a monthly basis shall be valid after the expiration of 25one year from the date of its issuance or last renewal. The 26expiration date of a sub-certificate of registration shall be   HB2767- 7 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1that of the certificate of registration to which the 2sub-certificate relates. Prior to July 1, 2017, a certificate 3of registration shall automatically be renewed, subject to 4revocation as provided by this Act, for an additional 5 years 5from the date of its expiration unless otherwise notified by 6the Department as provided by this paragraph. On and after 7July 1, 2017, a certificate of registration shall 8automatically be renewed, subject to revocation as provided by 9this Act, for an additional one year from the date of its 10expiration unless otherwise notified by the Department as 11provided by this paragraph. 12    Where a taxpayer to whom a certificate of registration is 13issued under this Act is in default to the State of Illinois 14for delinquent returns or for moneys due under this Act or any 15other State tax law or municipal or county ordinance 16administered or enforced by the Department, the Department 17shall, not less than 60 days before the expiration date of such 18certificate of registration, give notice to the taxpayer to 19whom the certificate was issued of the account period of the 20delinquent returns, the amount of tax, penalty and interest 21due and owing from the taxpayer, and that the certificate of 22registration shall not be automatically renewed upon its 23expiration date unless the taxpayer, on or before the date of 24expiration, has filed and paid the delinquent returns or paid 25the defaulted amount in full. A taxpayer to whom such a notice 26is issued shall be deemed an applicant for renewal. The   HB2767- 8 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1Department shall promulgate regulations establishing 2procedures for taxpayers who file returns on a monthly basis 3but desire and qualify to change to a quarterly or yearly 4filing basis and will no longer be subject to renewal under 5this Section, and for taxpayers who file returns on a yearly or 6quarterly basis but who desire or are required to change to a 7monthly filing basis and will be subject to renewal under this 8Section.9    The Department may in its discretion approve renewal by an 10applicant who is in default if, at the time of application for 11renewal, the applicant files all of the delinquent returns or 12pays to the Department such percentage of the defaulted amount 13as may be determined by the Department and agrees in writing to 14waive all limitations upon the Department for collection of 15the remaining defaulted amount to the Department over a period 16not to exceed 5 years from the date of renewal of the 17certificate; however, no renewal application submitted by an 18applicant who is in default shall be approved if the 19immediately preceding renewal by the applicant was conditioned 20upon the installment payment agreement described in this 21Section. The payment agreement herein provided for shall be in 22addition to and not in lieu of the security that may be 23required by this Section of a taxpayer who is no longer 24considered a prior continuous compliance taxpayer. The 25execution of the payment agreement as provided in this Act 26shall not toll the accrual of interest at the statutory rate.  HB2767- 9 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1    The Department may suspend a certificate of registration 2if the Department finds that the person to whom the 3certificate of registration has been issued knowingly sold 4contraband cigarettes. 5    A certificate of registration issued under this Act more 6than 5 years before January 1, 1990 (the effective date of 7Public Act 86-383) shall expire and be subject to the renewal 8provisions of this Section on the next anniversary of the date 9of issuance of such certificate which occurs more than 6 10months after January 1, 1990 (the effective date of Public Act 1186-383). A certificate of registration issued less than 5 12years before January 1, 1990 (the effective date of Public Act 1386-383) shall expire and be subject to the renewal provisions 14of this Section on the 5th anniversary of the issuance of the 15certificate.16    If the person so registered states that he operates other 17places of business from which he engages in the business of 18selling tangible personal property at retail in this State, 19the Department shall furnish him with a sub-certificate of 20registration for each such place of business, and the 21applicant shall display the appropriate sub-certificate of 22registration at each such place of business. All 23sub-certificates of registration shall bear the same 24registration number as that appearing upon the certificate of 25registration to which such sub-certificates relate.26    If the applicant will sell tangible personal property at   HB2767- 10 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1retail through vending machines, the Department shall furnish 2him with a sub-certificate of registration for each such 3vending machine, and the applicant shall display the 4appropriate sub-certificate of registration on each such 5vending machine by attaching the sub-certificate of 6registration to a conspicuous part of such vending machine. If 7a person who is registered to sell tangible personal property 8at retail through vending machines adds an additional vending 9machine or additional vending machines to the number of 10vending machines he or she uses in his or her business of 11selling tangible personal property at retail, he or she shall 12notify the Department, on a form prescribed by the Department, 13to request an additional sub-certificate or additional 14sub-certificates of registration, as applicable. With each 15such request, the applicant shall report the number of 16sub-certificates of registration he or she is requesting as 17well as the total number of vending machines from which he or 18she makes retail sales. 19    Where the same person engages in 2 or more businesses of 20selling tangible personal property at retail in this State, 21which businesses are substantially different in character or 22engaged in under different trade names or engaged in under 23other substantially dissimilar circumstances (so that it is 24more practicable, from an accounting, auditing or bookkeeping 25standpoint, for such businesses to be separately registered), 26the Department may require or permit such person (subject to   HB2767- 11 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1the same requirements concerning the furnishing of security as 2those that are provided for hereinbefore in this Section as to 3each application for a certificate of registration) to apply 4for and obtain a separate certificate of registration for each 5such business or for any of such businesses, under a single 6certificate of registration supplemented by related 7sub-certificates of registration.8    Any person who is registered under the Retailers' 9Occupation Tax Act as of March 8, 1963, and who, during the 103-year period immediately prior to March 8, 1963, or during a 11continuous 3-year period part of which passed immediately 12before and the remainder of which passes immediately after 13March 8, 1963, has been so registered continuously and who is 14determined by the Department not to have been either 15delinquent or deficient in the payment of tax liability during 16that period under this Act or under any other State tax law or 17municipal or county tax ordinance or resolution under which 18the certificate of registration that is issued to the 19registrant under this Act will permit the registrant to engage 20in business without registering separately under such other 21law, ordinance or resolution, shall be considered to be a 22Prior Continuous Compliance taxpayer. Also any taxpayer who 23has, as verified by the Department, faithfully and 24continuously complied with the condition of his bond or other 25security under the provisions of this Act for a period of 3 26consecutive years shall be considered to be a Prior Continuous   HB2767- 12 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1Compliance taxpayer.2    Every Prior Continuous Compliance taxpayer shall be exempt 3from all requirements under this Act concerning the furnishing 4of a bond or other security as a condition precedent to his 5being authorized to engage in the business of selling tangible 6personal property at retail in this State. This exemption 7shall continue for each such taxpayer until such time as he may 8be determined by the Department to be delinquent in the filing 9of any returns, or is determined by the Department (either 10through the Department's issuance of a final assessment which 11has become final under the Act, or by the taxpayer's filing of 12a return which admits tax that is not paid to be due) to be 13delinquent or deficient in the paying of any tax under this Act 14or under any other State tax law or municipal or county tax 15ordinance or resolution under which the certificate of 16registration that is issued to the registrant under this Act 17will permit the registrant to engage in business without 18registering separately under such other law, ordinance or 19resolution, at which time that taxpayer shall become subject 20to all the financial responsibility requirements of this Act 21and, as a condition of being allowed to continue to engage in 22the business of selling tangible personal property at retail, 23may be required to post bond or other acceptable security with 24the Department covering liability which such taxpayer may 25thereafter incur. Any taxpayer who fails to pay an admitted or 26established liability under this Act may also be required to   HB2767- 13 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1post bond or other acceptable security with this Department 2guaranteeing the payment of such admitted or established 3liability.4    No certificate of registration shall be issued to any 5person who is in default to the State of Illinois for moneys 6due under this Act or under any other State tax law or 7municipal or county tax ordinance or resolution under which 8the certificate of registration that is issued to the 9applicant under this Act will permit the applicant to engage 10in business without registering separately under such other 11law, ordinance or resolution.12    Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Department 13under this Section may, within 20 days after notice of such 14decision, protest and request a hearing, whereupon the 15Department shall give notice to such person of the time and 16place fixed for such hearing and shall hold a hearing in 17conformity with the provisions of this Act and then issue its 18final administrative decision in the matter to such person. In 19the absence of such a protest within 20 days, the Department's 20decision shall become final without any further determination 21being made or notice given.22    With respect to security other than bonds (upon which the 23Department may sue in the event of a forfeiture), if the 24taxpayer fails to pay, when due, any amount whose payment such 25security guarantees, the Department shall, after such 26liability is admitted by the taxpayer or established by the   HB2767- 14 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1Department through the issuance of a final assessment that has 2become final under the law, convert the security which that 3taxpayer has furnished into money for the State, after first 4giving the taxpayer at least 10 days' written notice, by 5registered or certified mail, to pay the liability or forfeit 6such security to the Department. If the security consists of 7stocks or bonds or other securities which are listed on a 8public exchange, the Department shall sell such securities 9through such public exchange. If the security consists of an 10irrevocable bank letter of credit, the Department shall 11convert the security in the manner provided for in the Uniform 12Commercial Code. If the security consists of a bank 13certificate of deposit, the Department shall convert the 14security into money by demanding and collecting the amount of 15such bank certificate of deposit from the bank which issued 16such certificate. If the security consists of a type of stocks 17or other securities which are not listed on a public exchange, 18the Department shall sell such security to the highest and 19best bidder after giving at least 10 days' notice of the date, 20time and place of the intended sale by publication in the 21"State Official Newspaper". If the Department realizes more 22than the amount of such liability from the security, plus the 23expenses incurred by the Department in converting the security 24into money, the Department shall pay such excess to the 25taxpayer who furnished such security, and the balance shall be 26paid into the State Treasury.  HB2767- 15 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1    The Department shall discharge any surety and shall 2release and return any security deposited, assigned, pledged 3or otherwise provided to it by a taxpayer under this Section 4within 30 days after:5        (1) such taxpayer becomes a Prior Continuous 6    Compliance taxpayer; or7        (2) such taxpayer has ceased to collect receipts on 8    which he is required to remit tax to the Department, has 9    filed a final tax return, and has paid to the Department an 10    amount sufficient to discharge his remaining tax 11    liability, as determined by the Department, under this Act 12    and under every other State tax law or municipal or county 13    tax ordinance or resolution under which the certificate of 14    registration issued under this Act permits the registrant 15    to engage in business without registering separately under 16    such other law, ordinance or resolution. The Department 17    shall make a final determination of the taxpayer's 18    outstanding tax liability as expeditiously as possible 19    after his final tax return has been filed; if the 20    Department cannot make such final determination within 45 21    days after receiving the final tax return, within such 22    period it shall so notify the taxpayer, stating its 23    reasons therefor.24(Source: P.A. 102-40, eff. 6-25-21; 103-319, eff. 1-1-24; 25103-592, eff. 1-1-25.)   HB2767- 16 -LRB104 10322 HLH 20396 b1    Section 10.
