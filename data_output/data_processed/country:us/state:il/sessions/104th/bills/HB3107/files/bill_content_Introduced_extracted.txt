Except in the case of an 2    action taken pursuant to a violation of Section 6-3, 6-5, 3    or 6-9, any action by the State Commission to suspend or 4    revoke a licensee's license may be limited to the license 5    for the specific premises where the violation occurred. An 6    action for a violation of this Act shall be commenced by 7    the State Commission within 2 years after the date the 8    State Commission becomes aware of the violation. 9        In lieu of suspending or revoking a license, the 10    commission may impose a fine, upon the State Commission's 11    determination and notice after hearing, that a licensee 12    has violated any provision of this Act or any rule or 13    regulation issued pursuant thereto and in effect for 30 14    days prior to such violation.15        For the purpose of this paragraph (1), when 16    determining multiple violations for the sale of alcohol to 17    a person under the age of 21, a second or subsequent 18    violation for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age 19    of 21 shall only be considered if it was committed within 5 20    years after the date when a prior violation for the sale of 21    alcohol to a person under the age of 21 was committed. 22        The fine imposed under this paragraph may not exceed 23    $500 for each violation. Each day that the activity, which 24    gave rise to the original fine, continues is a separate 25    violation. The maximum fine that may be levied against any 26    licensee, for the period of the license, shall not exceed   HB3107- 3 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    $20,000.

The accounts, forms, records, and memoranda 18    shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection 19    by authorized representatives of the State Commission or 20    by any local liquor control commissioner or his or her 21    authorized representative. The commission may, from time 22    to time, alter, amend, or repeal, in whole or in part, any 23    uniform system of accounts, or the form and manner of 24    keeping accounts. 25        (8) In the conduct of any hearing authorized to be 26    held by the State Commission, to appoint, at the   HB3107- 8 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    commission's discretion, hearing officers to conduct 2    hearings involving complex issues or issues that will 3    require a protracted period of time to resolve, to 4    examine, or cause to be examined, under oath, any 5    licensee, and to examine or cause to be examined the books 6    and records of such licensee; to hear testimony and take 7    proof material for its information in the discharge of its 8    duties hereunder; to administer or cause to be 9    administered oaths; for any such purpose to issue subpoena 10    or subpoenas to require the attendance of witnesses and 11    the production of books, which shall be effective in any 12    part of this State, and to adopt rules to implement its 13    powers under this paragraph (8). 14        Any circuit court may, by order duly entered, require 15    the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant 16    books subpoenaed by the State Commission and the court may 17    compel obedience to its order by proceedings for contempt. 18        (9) To investigate the administration of laws in 19    relation to alcoholic liquors in this and other states and 20    any foreign countries, and to recommend from time to time 21    to the Governor and through him or her to the legislature 22    of this State, such amendments to this Act, if any, as it 23    may think desirable and as will serve to further the 24    general broad purposes contained in Section 1-2 hereof. 25        (10) To adopt such rules and regulations consistent 26    with the provisions of this Act which shall be necessary   HB3107- 9 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    for the control, sale, or disposition of alcoholic liquor 2    damaged as a result of an accident, wreck, flood, fire, or 3    other similar occurrence. 4        (11) To develop industry educational programs related 5    to responsible serving and selling, particularly in the 6    areas of overserving consumers and illegal underage 7    purchasing and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 8        (11.1) To license persons providing education and 9    training to alcohol beverage sellers and servers for 10    mandatory and non-mandatory training under the Beverage 11    Alcohol Sellers and Servers Education and Training 12    (BASSET) programs and to develop and administer a public 13    awareness program in Illinois to reduce or eliminate the 14    illegal purchase and consumption of alcoholic beverage 15    products by persons under the age of 21.

The State 25    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 26    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds   HB3107- 13 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    that the exemption holder has made a material 2    misrepresentation in its application or , violated a 3    revenue or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 4    25,000 gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 5    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 6    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 7    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 8    spirits.9        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 10    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 11    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 12    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 13    production and sales information of a self-distribution 14    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 15    such information to any person.16        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 17    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 18    this Section and this Act.19        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 20    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 21    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 22    licensed Illinois distributor.23        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 24    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 25    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 26    distribution system, it is necessary to create an   HB3107- 14 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 2    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 3    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small 4    for distributor or importing distributor business 5    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 6    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 7    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 8    integrity of the 3-tier system. 9        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be 10    either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer 11    and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of 12    beer, may make application to the State Commission for a 13    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 14    than 232,500 gallons per year of the exemption holder's 15    beer to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, 16    and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of 17    Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or any 18    combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries.19        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 20    penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall 21    state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of 22    beer manufactured and sold for each year since its 23    establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor 24    relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 25    necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) 26    that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and   HB3107- 15 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any 2    other state where it is licensed.3        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 4    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 5    action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 6    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 7    if the class 1 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with 8    the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is 9    not a member of any affiliated group that manufactures, 10    directly or indirectly, more than 930,000 gallons of beer 11    per annum, 25,000 gallons of wine per annum, or 50,000 12    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) shall not annually 13    manufacture for sale more than 930,000 gallons of beer, 14    25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; (4) 15    shall not annually sell more than 232,500 gallons of its 16    beer to retail licensees and class 3 brewers and to 17    brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, 18    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 19    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 20    non-licensees at their breweries; and (5) has relinquished 21    any brew pub license held by the licensee, including any 22    ownership interest it held in the licensed brew pub.23        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 24    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 25    of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated 26    manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months. The   HB3107- 16 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 2    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 3    that the exemption holder has made a material 4    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 5    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 6    manufacture of 930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of 7    wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits in any calendar year or 8    became part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than 9    930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 10    gallons of spirits.11        (E) The State Commission shall issue rules and 12    regulations governing self-distribution exemptions 13    consistent with this Act.14        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (18) shall prohibit a 15    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 16    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 17    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 18    If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a 19    distribution agreement and has assigned distribution 20    rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then 21    the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution 22    rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a 23    reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.24        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (18) to promote 25    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 26    that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory   HB3107- 17 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 2    exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and 3    allow such smaller manufacturers of beer access to the 4    marketplace in order to develop a customer base without 5    impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system. 6        (19)(A) A class 1 craft distiller licensee or a 7    non-resident dealer who manufactures less than 50,000 8    gallons of distilled spirits per year may make application 9    to the State Commission for a self-distribution exemption 10    to allow the sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the 11    exemption holder's spirits to retail licensees per year. 12        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 13    penalty of perjury, the class 1 craft distiller licensee 14    or non-resident dealer shall state (1) the date it was 15    established; (2) its volume of spirits manufactured and 16    sold for each year since its establishment; (3) its 17    efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 18    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 19    marketing of its spirits; and (5) that it will comply with 20    the alcoholic beverage and revenue laws of the United 21    States, this State, and any other state where it is 22    licensed. 23        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 24    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 25    action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 26    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption   HB3107- 18 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    if the applicant: (1) is in compliance with State revenue 2    and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is not a member of any 3    affiliated group that produces more than 50,000 gallons of 4    spirits per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 5    25,000 gallons of wine per annum; (3) does not annually 6    manufacture for sale more than 50,000 gallons of spirits, 7    930,000 gallons of beer, or 25,000 gallons of wine; and 8    (4) does not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its 9    spirits to retail licensees. 10        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 11    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 12    of spirits during the previous 12 months and its 13    anticipated manufacture and sales of spirits for the next 14    12 months.

The 10    State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 11    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 12    that the exemption holder has made a material 13    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 14    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 15    manufacture of 465,000 gallons of beer in any calendar 16    year or became part of an affiliated group manufacturing 17    more than 465,000 gallons of beer, or exceeded the sale to 18    retail licensees, brewers, class 1 brewers, class 2 19    brewers, and class 3 brewers of 6,200 gallons per brewery 20    location or 18,600 gallons in the aggregate.21        (E) The State Commission may adopt rules governing 22    self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act.23        (F) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a 24    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 25    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 26    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor.   HB3107- 22 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a 2    distribution agreement and has assigned distribution 3    rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then 4    the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution 5    rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a 6    reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.7        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph to promote and 8    continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds that 9    in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory distribution 10    system, it is necessary to create an exception for smaller 11    manufacturers in order to afford and allow such smaller 12    manufacturers of beer access to the marketplace in order 13    to develop a customer base without impairing the integrity 14    of the 3-tier system. 15    (b) On or before April 30, 1999, the Commission shall 16present a written report to the Governor and the General 17Assembly that shall be based on a study of the impact of Public 18Act 90-739 on the business of soliciting, selling, and 19shipping alcoholic liquor from outside of this State directly 20to residents of this State. 21    As part of its report, the Commission shall provide the 22following information: 23        (i) the amount of State excise and sales tax revenues 24    generated as a result of Public Act 90-739; 25        (ii) the amount of licensing fees received as a result 26    of Public Act 90-739;   HB3107- 23 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1        (iii) the number of reported violations, the number of 2    cease and desist notices issued by the Commission, the 3    number of notices of violations issued to the Department 4    of Revenue, and the number of notices and complaints of 5    violations to law enforcement officials. 6(Source: P.A. 101-37, eff. 7-3-19; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 7101-482, eff. 8-23-19; 102-442, eff. 8-20-21; 102-558, eff. 88-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.) 9    (235 ILCS 5/5-1)  (from Ch. 43, par. 115)10    Sec. 5-1.

Such complaints shall be in 23    writing, signed and sworn to by the person making the 24    complaint, and shall state with specificity the facts in 25    relation to the alleged violation. If the State Commission 26    has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaint   HB3107- 6 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    substantially alleges a violation of this Act or rules and 2    regulations adopted pursuant to this Act, it shall conduct 3    an investigation. If, after conducting an investigation, 4    the State Commission is satisfied that the alleged 5    violation did occur, it shall proceed with disciplinary 6    action against the licensee as provided in this Act. 7        (5.4) To make arrests and issue notices of civil 8    violations where necessary for the enforcement of this 9    Act. 10        (5.5) To investigate any and all unlicensed activity. 11        (5.6) To impose civil penalties or fines to any person 12    who, without holding a valid license, engages in conduct 13    that requires a license pursuant to this Act, in an amount 14    not to exceed $20,000 for each offense as determined by 15    the State Commission. A civil penalty shall be assessed by 16    the State Commission after a hearing is held in accordance 17    with the provisions set forth in this Act regarding the 18    provision of a hearing for the revocation or suspension of 19    a license. 20        (6) To hear and determine appeals from orders of a 21    local commission in accordance with the provisions of this 22    Act, as hereinafter set forth. Hearings under this 23    subsection shall be held in Springfield or Chicago, at 24    whichever location is the more convenient for the majority 25    of persons who are parties to the hearing. 26        (7) The State Commission shall establish uniform   HB3107- 7 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    systems of accounts to be kept by all retail licensees 2    having more than 4 employees, and for this purpose the 3    State Commission may classify all retail licensees having 4    more than 4 employees and establish a uniform system of 5    accounts for each class and prescribe the manner in which 6    such accounts shall be kept. The State Commission may also 7    prescribe the forms of accounts to be kept by all retail 8    licensees having more than 4 employees, including, but not 9    limited to, accounts of earnings and expenses and any 10    distribution, payment, or other distribution of earnings 11    or assets, and any other forms, records, and memoranda 12    which in the judgment of the commission may be necessary 13    or appropriate to carry out any of the provisions of this 14    Act, including, but not limited to, such forms, records, 15    and memoranda as will readily and accurately disclose at 16    all times the beneficial ownership of such retail licensed 17    business. The accounts, forms, records, and memoranda 18    shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection 19    by authorized representatives of the State Commission or 20    by any local liquor control commissioner or his or her 21    authorized representative. The commission may, from time 22    to time, alter, amend, or repeal, in whole or in part, any 23    uniform system of accounts, or the form and manner of 24    keeping accounts. 25        (8) In the conduct of any hearing authorized to be 26    held by the State Commission, to appoint, at the   HB3107- 8 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    commission's discretion, hearing officers to conduct 2    hearings involving complex issues or issues that will 3    require a protracted period of time to resolve, to 4    examine, or cause to be examined, under oath, any 5    licensee, and to examine or cause to be examined the books 6    and records of such licensee; to hear testimony and take 7    proof material for its information in the discharge of its 8    duties hereunder; to administer or cause to be 9    administered oaths; for any such purpose to issue subpoena 10    or subpoenas to require the attendance of witnesses and 11    the production of books, which shall be effective in any 12    part of this State, and to adopt rules to implement its 13    powers under this paragraph (8). 14        Any circuit court may, by order duly entered, require 15    the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant 16    books subpoenaed by the State Commission and the court may 17    compel obedience to its order by proceedings for contempt. 18        (9) To investigate the administration of laws in 19    relation to alcoholic liquors in this and other states and 20    any foreign countries, and to recommend from time to time 21    to the Governor and through him or her to the legislature 22    of this State, such amendments to this Act, if any, as it 23    may think desirable and as will serve to further the 24    general broad purposes contained in Section 1-2 hereof. 25        (10) To adopt such rules and regulations consistent 26    with the provisions of this Act which shall be necessary   HB3107- 9 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    for the control, sale, or disposition of alcoholic liquor 2    damaged as a result of an accident, wreck, flood, fire, or 3    other similar occurrence. 4        (11) To develop industry educational programs related 5    to responsible serving and selling, particularly in the 6    areas of overserving consumers and illegal underage 7    purchasing and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 8        (11.1) To license persons providing education and 9    training to alcohol beverage sellers and servers for 10    mandatory and non-mandatory training under the Beverage 11    Alcohol Sellers and Servers Education and Training 12    (BASSET) programs and to develop and administer a public 13    awareness program in Illinois to reduce or eliminate the 14    illegal purchase and consumption of alcoholic beverage 15    products by persons under the age of 21.

As part of its report, the State 2    Commission shall provide all of the following information:3            (A) The amount of State excise and sales tax 4        revenues generated.5            (B) The amount of licensing fees received.6            (C) The number of cases of wine shipped from 7        inside and outside of this State directly to residents 8        of this State.9            (D) The number of alcohol compliance operations 10        conducted.11            (E) The number of winery shipper's licenses 12        issued.13            (F) The number of each of the following: reported 14        violations; cease and desist notices issued by the 15        Commission; notices of violations issued by the 16        Commission and to the Department of Revenue; and 17        notices and complaints of violations to law 18        enforcement officials, including, without limitation, 19        the Illinois Attorney General and the U.S. Department 20        of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade 21        Bureau.22        (15) As a means to reduce the underage consumption of 23    alcoholic liquors, the State Commission shall conduct 24    alcohol compliance operations to investigate whether 25    businesses that are soliciting, selling, and shipping wine 26    from inside or outside of this State directly to residents   HB3107- 11 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    of this State are licensed by this State or are selling or 2    attempting to sell wine to persons under 21 years of age in 3    violation of this Act.4        (16) The State Commission shall, in addition to 5    notifying any appropriate law enforcement agency, submit 6    notices of complaints or violations of Sections 6-29 and 7    6-29.1 by persons who do not hold a winery shipper's 8    license under this Act to the Illinois Attorney General 9    and to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Alcohol and 10    Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.11        (17)(A) A person licensed to make wine under the laws 12    of another state who has a winery shipper's license under 13    this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of 14    wine or a person who has a first-class or second-class 15    wine manufacturer's license, a first-class or second-class 16    wine-maker's license, or a limited wine manufacturer's 17    license under this Act and annually produces less than 18    25,000 gallons of wine may make application to the 19    Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the 20    sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the exemption 21    holder's wine to retail licensees per year and to sell 22    cider, mead, or both cider and mead to brewers, class 1 23    brewers, class 2 brewers, and class 3 brewers that, 24    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 25    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 26    non-licensees at their breweries.  HB3107- 12 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 2    penalty of perjury, such person shall state (1) the date 3    it was established; (2) its volume of production and sales 4    for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to 5    establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 6    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 7    marketing of its wine; and (5) that it will comply with the 8    liquor and revenue laws of the United States, this State, 9    and any other state where it is licensed.10        (C) The State Commission shall approve the application 11    for a self-distribution exemption if such person: (1) is 12    in compliance with State revenue and liquor laws; (2) is 13    not a member of any affiliated group that produces 14    directly or indirectly more than 25,000 gallons of wine 15    per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 50,000 16    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) will not annually 17    produce for sale more than 25,000 gallons of wine, 930,000 18    gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; and (4) 19    will not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its wine 20    to retail licensees.21        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 22    annually certify to the State Commission its production of 23    wine in the previous 12 months and its anticipated 24    production and sales for the next 12 months. The State 25    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 26    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds   HB3107- 13 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    that the exemption holder has made a material 2    misrepresentation in its application or , violated a 3    revenue or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 4    25,000 gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 5    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 6    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 7    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 8    spirits.9        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 10    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 11    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 12    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 13    production and sales information of a self-distribution 14    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 15    such information to any person.16        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 17    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 18    this Section and this Act.19        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 20    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 21    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 22    licensed Illinois distributor.23        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 24    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 25    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 26    distribution system, it is necessary to create an   HB3107- 14 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 2    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 3    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small 4    for distributor or importing distributor business 5    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 6    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 7    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 8    integrity of the 3-tier system. 9        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be 10    either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer 11    and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of 12    beer, may make application to the State Commission for a 13    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 14    than 232,500 gallons per year of the exemption holder's 15    beer to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, 16    and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of 17    Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or any 18    combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries.19        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 20    penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall 21    state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of 22    beer manufactured and sold for each year since its 23    establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor 24    relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 25    necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) 26    that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and   HB3107- 15 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any 2    other state where it is licensed.3        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 4    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 5    action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 6    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 7    if the class 1 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with 8    the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is 9    not a member of any affiliated group that manufactures, 10    directly or indirectly, more than 930,000 gallons of beer 11    per annum, 25,000 gallons of wine per annum, or 50,000 12    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) shall not annually 13    manufacture for sale more than 930,000 gallons of beer, 14    25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; (4) 15    shall not annually sell more than 232,500 gallons of its 16    beer to retail licensees and class 3 brewers and to 17    brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, 18    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 19    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 20    non-licensees at their breweries; and (5) has relinquished 21    any brew pub license held by the licensee, including any 22    ownership interest it held in the licensed brew pub.23        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 24    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 25    of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated 26    manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months. The   HB3107- 16 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 2    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 3    that the exemption holder has made a material 4    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 5    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 6    manufacture of 930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of 7    wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits in any calendar year or 8    became part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than 9    930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 10    gallons of spirits.11        (E) The State Commission shall issue rules and 12    regulations governing self-distribution exemptions 13    consistent with this Act.14        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (18) shall prohibit a 15    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 16    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 17    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 18    If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a 19    distribution agreement and has assigned distribution 20    rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then 21    the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution 22    rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a 23    reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.24        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (18) to promote 25    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 26    that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory   HB3107- 17 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 2    exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and 3    allow such smaller manufacturers of beer access to the 4    marketplace in order to develop a customer base without 5    impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system. 6        (19)(A) A class 1 craft distiller licensee or a 7    non-resident dealer who manufactures less than 50,000 8    gallons of distilled spirits per year may make application 9    to the State Commission for a self-distribution exemption 10    to allow the sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the 11    exemption holder's spirits to retail licensees per year. 12        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 13    penalty of perjury, the class 1 craft distiller licensee 14    or non-resident dealer shall state (1) the date it was 15    established; (2) its volume of spirits manufactured and 16    sold for each year since its establishment; (3) its 17    efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 18    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 19    marketing of its spirits; and (5) that it will comply with 20    the alcoholic beverage and revenue laws of the United 21    States, this State, and any other state where it is 22    licensed. 23        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 24    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 25    action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 26    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption   HB3107- 18 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    if the applicant: (1) is in compliance with State revenue 2    and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is not a member of any 3    affiliated group that produces more than 50,000 gallons of 4    spirits per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 5    25,000 gallons of wine per annum; (3) does not annually 6    manufacture for sale more than 50,000 gallons of spirits, 7    930,000 gallons of beer, or 25,000 gallons of wine; and 8    (4) does not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its 9    spirits to retail licensees. 10        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 11    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 12    of spirits during the previous 12 months and its 13    anticipated manufacture and sales of spirits for the next 14    12 months. The State Commission may fine, suspend, or 15    revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it 16    finds that the exemption holder has made a material 17    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 18    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 19    manufacture of 50,000 gallons of spirits, 930,000 gallons 20    of beer, or 25,000 gallons of wine in any calendar year, or 21    has become part of an affiliated group manufacturing more 22    than 50,000 gallons of spirits, 930,000 gallons of beer, 23    or 25,000 gallons of wine. 24        (E) The State Commission shall adopt rules governing 25    self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act. 26        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (19) shall prohibit a   HB3107- 19 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 2    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 3    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 4        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (19) to promote 5    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 6    that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 7    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 8    exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and 9    allow such smaller manufacturers of spirits access to the 10    marketplace in order to develop a customer base without 11    impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system. 12        (20)(A) A class 3 brewer licensee who must manufacture 13    less than 465,000 gallons of beer in the aggregate and not 14    more than 155,000 gallons at any single brewery premises 15    may make application to the State Commission for a 16    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 17    than 6,200 gallons of beer from each in-state or 18    out-of-state class 3 brewery premises, which shall not 19    exceed 18,600 gallons annually in the aggregate, that is 20    manufactured at a wholly owned class 3 brewer's in-state 21    or out-of-state licensed premises to retail licensees and 22    class 3 brewers and to brewers, class 1 brewers, class 2 23    brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4, 24    sell beer, cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees 25    at their licensed breweries.26        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under   HB3107- 20 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    penalty of perjury, the class 3 brewer licensee shall 2    state:3            (1) the date it was established;4            (2) its volume of beer manufactured and sold for 5        each year since its establishment;6            (3) its efforts to establish distributor 7        relationships;8            (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 9        necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and10            (5) that it will comply with the alcoholic 11        beverage and revenue laws of the United States, this 12        State, and any other state where it is licensed.13        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 14    State Commission's website at least 45 days before action 15    by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 16    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 17    if the class 3 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with 18    the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is 19    not a member of any affiliated group that manufacturers, 20    directly or indirectly, more than 465,000 gallons of beer 21    per annum; (3) shall not annually manufacture for sale 22    more than 465,000 gallons of beer or more than 155,000 23    gallons at any single brewery premises; and (4) shall not 24    annually sell more than 6,200 gallons of beer from each 25    in-state or out-of-state class 3 brewery premises, and 26    shall not exceed 18,600 gallons annually in the aggregate,   HB3107- 21 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    to retail licensees and class 3 brewers and to brewers, 2    class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to 3    subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, 4    cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees at their 5    breweries.6        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 7    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 8    of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated 9    manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months. The 10    State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 11    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 12    that the exemption holder has made a material 13    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 14    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 15    manufacture of 465,000 gallons of beer in any calendar 16    year or became part of an affiliated group manufacturing 17    more than 465,000 gallons of beer, or exceeded the sale to 18    retail licensees, brewers, class 1 brewers, class 2 19    brewers, and class 3 brewers of 6,200 gallons per brewery 20    location or 18,600 gallons in the aggregate.21        (E) The State Commission may adopt rules governing 22    self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act.23        (F) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a 24    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 25    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 26    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor.   HB3107- 22 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1    If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a 2    distribution agreement and has assigned distribution 3    rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then 4    the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution 5    rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a 6    reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.7        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph to promote and 8    continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds that 9    in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory distribution 10    system, it is necessary to create an exception for smaller 11    manufacturers in order to afford and allow such smaller 12    manufacturers of beer access to the marketplace in order 13    to develop a customer base without impairing the integrity 14    of the 3-tier system. 15    (b) On or before April 30, 1999, the Commission shall 16present a written report to the Governor and the General 17Assembly that shall be based on a study of the impact of Public 18Act 90-739 on the business of soliciting, selling, and 19shipping alcoholic liquor from outside of this State directly 20to residents of this State. 21    As part of its report, the Commission shall provide the 22following information: 23        (i) the amount of State excise and sales tax revenues 24    generated as a result of Public Act 90-739; 25        (ii) the amount of licensing fees received as a result 26    of Public Act 90-739;   HB3107- 23 -LRB104 10613 RPS 20689 b1        (iii) the number of reported violations, the number of 2    cease and desist notices issued by the Commission, the 3    number of notices of violations issued to the Department 4    of Revenue, and the number of notices and complaints of 5    violations to law enforcement officials. 6(Source: P.A. 101-37, eff. 7-3-19; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 7101-482, eff. 8-23-19; 102-442, eff. 8-20-21; 102-558, eff. 88-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.) 9    (235 ILCS 5/5-1)  (from Ch. 43, par. 115)10    Sec. 5-1.
