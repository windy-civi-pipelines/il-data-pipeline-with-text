Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Wetlands Protection Act. 6    Section 5. Findings and intent. The General Assembly 7finds:8    (1) In 1818, Illinois contained an estimated 8.2 million 9acres of wetlands. Based on the Illinois portion of the 10National Wetlands Inventory, less than 9% of those original 11acres of wetlands remain.12    (2) As a result of the significant loss in wetland 13acreage, there has been a corresponding loss in the functional 14values and benefits that wetlands provide.15    (3) Illinois is bordered by 880 miles of rivers, which are 16critical to navigation, commerce, recreation, and ecosystem 17health at home and downstream to the Gulf of Mexico, and the 18health of Illinois rivers is heavily influenced by the health 19of the tributaries and streams that flow into them.20    (4) In Illinois, 9,894 total miles of streams provide 21water for surface water intakes, supplying public drinking 22water systems that rely at least in part on intermittent, 23ephemeral, or headwater streams.  SB2401- 2 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1    (5) Continued loss of Illinois' wetlands and streams may 2deprive the People of the State of some or all of the benefits 3that they provide, including:4        (A) reducing flood damages and protecting vulnerable 5    communities by absorbing, storing, and conveying peak 6    flows from storms;7        (B) improving water quality by serving as 8    sedimentation and filtering basins and as natural 9    biological treatment areas;10        (C) providing breeding, nesting, foraging, and 11    protective habitat for approximately 40% of the State's 12    threatened and endangered plants and animals, in addition 13    to other forms of fish, wildlife, game, waterfowl, and 14    shorebirds;15        (D) protecting underground water resources and helping 16    to recharge rivers, streams, and local or regional 17    underground water supplies;18        (E) serving as recreational areas for hunting, 19    fishing, boating, hiking, bird watching, photography, and 20    other uses;21        (F) providing open space and aesthetic values, 22    particularly in rapidly developing areas; 23        (G) providing unique educational and research 24    opportunities because of their high diversity of plants 25    and animals, their support for a high incidence of 26    threatened and endangered species, and their function as a   SB2401- 3 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1    natural buffer for rivers, lakes, and streams;2        (H) supplying nutrients in freshwater food cycles and 3    serving as nursery areas and sanctuaries for young fish; 4    and5        (I) helping to protect shorelines from the forces of 6    water erosion.7    (6) Our changing climate and its more extreme and less 8predictable weather patterns heighten the need for some or all 9of the benefits that Illinois' wetlands provide, including 10flood control, coastal resilience, water quality, aquifer 11recharge, habitat, and maintenance of baseflow to recharge 12rivers, streams, and local or regional underground water 13supplies.14    (7) Illinois historically relied on the federal Clean 15Water Act's permit program administered by the U.S. Army Corps 16of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to 17prevent harm to aquatic resources from unauthorized discharges 18of dredge or fill material.19    (8) After rejection of the 1989 Wetland Delineation Manual 20and in light of uncertainty about federal protections for some 21"isolated" wetlands, the General Assembly passed the 22Interagency Wetland Policy Act of 1989 to protect these 23wetlands from State agency actions and achieve no net loss of 24wetlands.25    (9) The Supreme Court's May 25, 2023 decision in Sackett 26v. EPA rolled back the scope of waters of the United States,   SB2401- 4 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1thereby removing federal Clean Water Act protections for many 2waters of the United States, including wetlands that provide 3significant flood control protections, such as bottomland 4hardwood forested wetlands that are separated from the 5Illinois River by levees.6    (10) It is important for Illinois to adopt protections 7under State law to reinstate protections lost by rolling back 8the scope of the federal Clean Water Act. 9    Section 10.

Applicability. 8    (a) The requirements of this Act apply to all State 9jurisdictional wetlands as that term is defined in this Act. 10If a wetland ceases to meet that definition because it becomes 11subject to regulation under the federal Clean Water Act, it 12shall no longer be subject to the provisions of this Act. The 13Department may enter into an agreement with the Corps of 14Engineers to coordinate the permit program under this Act with 15the Corps of Engineers permit program under Section 404 of the 16federal Clean Water Act. 17    (b) The following are presumed to be adjacent or have a 18significant nexus to maintaining the chemical, physical, or 19biological integrity of a navigable water and as such are 20State jurisdictional wetlands for purposes of this Act: 21        (1) wetlands that are wholly or partially located 22    within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark of a 23    navigable water, interstate water, or tributary; 24        (2) wetlands that are wholly or partially located in 25    the 100-year floodplain and are within 1,500 feet of the   SB2401- 18 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1    ordinary high water mark of a navigable water, interstate 2    water, or tributary; 3        (3) wetlands that are wholly or partially within 1,500 4    feet of the ordinary high water mark of Lake Michigan; or 5        (4) wetlands that have a visible surface water or a 6    regular shallow subsurface water connection to a navigable 7    water. 8    (c) An affected property owner or developer may introduce 9information that is relevant to demonstrate that a particular 10wetland is not a State jurisdictional wetland, thereby 11rebutting the presumption in subsection (b). The Department 12shall consider information presented to rebut the presumption 13and determine whether the presumption has been rebutted. If 14the Department determines that the presumption is rebutted and 15the wetland is not a jurisdictional wetland for the purpose of 16this Act, the wetland shall not be subject to this Act. 17    Section 25. Regulated activities; individual permits; 18wetland classification; mitigation; delineation.19    (a) No person may discharge dredged or fill material into 20a State jurisdictional wetland protected by this Act except in 21accordance with the terms of an individual or general permit 22issued by the Department under this Section or Section 30 of 23this Act. This subsection (a) becomes effective on the date 24the Department adopts rules under Section 40 of this Act.25    (b) No permit shall be required under this Act, and the   SB2401- 19 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1requirements of the Act shall not apply to, renewable energy 2facility construction, maintenance, repair, improvement, or 3reconstruction that commenced construction before the 4effective date of rules adopted under Section 40 of this Act. 5For purposes of this subsection, "commenced construction" 6means:7        (1) to have begun a continuous program of on-site 8    physical construction, such as the placement, assembly, or 9    installation of facilities or equipment or the conducting 10    of site preparation work, including clearing, excavation, 11    or removal of existing structures;12        (2) to have submitted a binding application or bid to 13    the Illinois Power Agency to execute a Renewable Energy 14    Credit Contract under Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power 15    Agency Act;16        (3) to have entered into a binding contractual 17    agreement for the purchase and sale of electricity; or18        (4) to have obtained municipal or county siting 19    approval, a special use permit, or building approval.20    (c) Wetlands shall be classified as follows:21        (1) The Department shall classify a wetland as Class I 22    if the wetland:23            (A) is or encompasses a bog, bottomland hardwood 24        forest, fen, panne, or cypress swamp;25            (B) has been designated a Ramsar wetland of 26        international importance under the Convention on   SB2401- 20 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1        Wetlands;2            (C) is designated for important flood protection 3        services under paragraph (3);4            (D) is occupied or suitable habitat for a 5        threatened or endangered species listed under State or 6        federal law;7            (E) has a Floristic Quality Index that is equal to 8        or greater than 20 or a mean coefficient of 9        conservatism (Mean C) equal to or greater than 3.5, 10        determined in accordance with rules adopted by the 11        Department; or12            (F) is a High-Quality Aquatic Resource.13        (2) The Department shall classify a non-Class I 14    wetland as a Class II wetland if the wetland, including 15    its contiguous area, is larger than 0.5 acres. However, if 16    a non-Class I wetland is smaller than 0.5 acres it shall be 17    designated a Class III wetland. If a Class III wetland is 18    1/10th of an acre or smaller, there is no permit required.19        (3) The Department may, in consultation with the 20    Illinois Emergency Management Agency and Office of 21    Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency 22    or local authorities, designate a wetland as a Class I 23    wetland due to important flood protection services 24    protecting human life and property if the wetland is no 25    longer protected under the federal Clean Water Act. 26    (c) Mitigation shall be required in accordance with this   SB2401- 21 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1Act for permitted activities and shall be conducted according 2to the following preferred order:3        (1) Discharges impacting Class I wetlands shall be 4    mitigated through either on-site mitigation or off-site 5    mitigation at an approved wetland mitigation bank within 6    the same watershed as the location of the proposed fill. 7    Mitigation shall be in kind, restoring to the maximum 8    degree practicable, as determined by the Department, both 9    the type and functions of the wetland that will be 10    affected by the regulated activity. The mitigation ratio 11    shall be 5:1 unless the Director, for good cause shown and 12    on a case-by-case basis, authorizes a higher mitigation 13    ratio not to exceed 6:1 or a lower mitigation ratio not 14    less than 4:1. In lieu fee mitigation may be used for 15    mitigation when there are no available mitigation credits 16    within the watershed.17        (2) Discharges impacting Class II wetlands shall be 18    mitigated through either on-site mitigation or off-site 19    mitigation at an approved wetland mitigation bank within 20    the same watershed as the location of the proposed fill. 21    Mitigation shall be in kind, restoring to the maximum 22    degree practicable as determined by the Department, both 23    the type and functions of the wetland that will be 24    affected by the regulated activity. The mitigation ratio 25    shall be 3:1 unless the Director, for good cause shown and 26    on a case-by-case basis, authorizes a higher mitigation   SB2401- 22 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1    ratio not to exceed 3.5:1 or a lower mitigation ratio not 2    less than 2.5:1. In lieu fee mitigation may be used for 3    mitigation when there are no available mitigation credits 4    within the watershed.5        (3) Discharges impacting Class III wetlands shall be 6    mitigated through either participation in an approved 7    wetland mitigation bank or an approved in-lieu fee 8    program, unless the Department for good cause requires in 9    kind on-site mitigation or off-site mitigation at an 10    approved mitigation bank. The mitigation ratio shall be 11    1.5:1 for compensation through an approved wetland 12    mitigation bank and 2:1 for compensation through an 13    approved in-lieu fee program. The Director, for good cause 14    shown and on a case-by-case basis, may authorize a higher 15    or lower mitigation ratio.16    (d) Persons seeking a permit are responsible for wetland 17delineation and classification made by or under the 18supervision of an approved wetland specialist. Wetland 19delineations shall be made in accordance with the Corps of 20Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual. Classifications shall be 21in accordance with this Section or an approved program under 22Section 55. Delineations by the Corps of Engineers, by 23approved counties, or by Corps of Engineers approved agencies 24shall be honored.25    (e) Persons seeking an individual permit shall provide the 26Department with a complete application, including, at a   SB2401- 23 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1minimum, the following items: (i) a map of the area that will 2be affected by the activity, including wetland and water 3boundaries for the areas affected and the existing uses and 4structures; (ii) a wetland delineation made in accordance with 5the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual by or under 6the supervision of an approved wetland specialist and this 7Section; (iii) a description of the proposed activity, 8including its purpose, the location and dimensions of any 9structures, grading or fills, drainage, roads, sewers and 10water supply, parking lots, stormwater facilities, discharge 11of pollutants and on-site waste disposal; (iv) a description 12of any public benefit to be derived from the proposed project; 13(v) a description of avoidance, minimization, and mitigation, 14including a mitigation plan; and (vi) the names and addresses 15of adjacent landowners as determined by the current tax 16assessment rolls. The Department shall notify the applicant 17within 20 business days if the permit application is 18incomplete and provide a reasonable time for the applicant to 19correct deficiencies in the permit application. Within 90 20business days of receipt of a complete permit application, the 21Department shall either issue the permit, deny the permit, or 22issue the permit with conditions. All individual permit 23decisions are subject to public comment. If a public hearing 24is held, the deadline to make a permit determination is 25extended by 45 business days.26    (f) The Department shall evaluate individual permit   SB2401- 24 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1requests through the following sequence: (i) avoidance of 2impacts to aquatic resources if a less environmentally 3damaging practicable alternative exists; (ii) minimization of 4unavoidable impacts by taking appropriate and practicable 5steps such as reduction of the footprint of the fill; (iii) 6compensatory mitigation for any remaining impacts to aquatic 7resources in accordance with this Act. The Department shall 8not issue an individual permit pursuant to this Section unless 9the Agency has certified to the Department that the proposed 10activity will not cause or contribute to a violation of a State 11water quality standard. The Agency shall, within 80 business 12days of receipt of a complete application, approve, deny, or 13approve with conditions the water quality certification. The 14applicant for a permit may mutually agree to extend the 80-day 15deadline up to an additional 80 business days in which the 16Agency must take final action on the water quality 17certification under this paragraph. If the Agency does not 18approve, deny, or approve with conditions the water quality 19certification within the extended time period, the 20certification requirements shall be waived and the Department 21may issue their permit decision consistent with the sections 22of this Act.23    (g) Upon request by an applicant, the Department may issue 24an after-the-fact permit if the Department determines that the 25activities covered by the after-the-fact permit were 26undertaken and conducted in response to emergency   SB2401- 25 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1circumstances that constituted an imminent threat to persons, 2public infrastructure, personal property, or uninterrupted 3utility service. The request for an after-the-fact permit must 4be made as soon as reasonably possible after the event. The 5Department shall require compensatory mitigation. If the 6Department for good cause shown denies an after-the-fact 7permit, the applicant shall be in violation of this Act. 8However, the applicant and Department may, through mutual 9agreement, provide for compensatory mitigation, restoration, 10or other measures to resolve the violation. In such an 11instance, the applicant may appeal the denial of an 12after-the-fact permit consistent with the appeals procedures 13in this Act.14    (h) The permit applicant and the Department may waive or 15extend the permit deadlines in this Section through mutual 16agreement. If the Department is unable to comply with the 17permit deadlines and they are not waived or extended through 18mutual agreement, the permit application will be denied 19without prejudice.  20    Section 30. General permits.21    (a) Notwithstanding Section 25, any person who intends to 22conduct a regulated activity within the State may do so in 23accordance with a general permit issued by the Department 24under this Section. A general permit pre-authorizes a category 25of activities that are similar in nature and impact on water   SB2401- 26 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1quality, will have only minimal adverse effects when performed 2separately, will have minimal cumulative impacts on water 3quality provided the permittee complies with all of the 4conditions of the general permit, and will not cause or 5contribute to a violation of State water quality standards.6    (b) Permits for all categories of activities, subject to 7the same permit limitations and conditions, that are the 8subject of a nationwide permit issued by the Corps of 9Engineers, in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, 10are adopted as general permits covering regulated activities 11subject to this Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all such 12permits will include a preconstruction notification 13requirement and compensatory mitigation, unless the permit 14states compensatory mitigation is not required because the 15work is designed to improve water quality or, with respect to 16voluntary aquatic habitat restoration, to provide net increase 17in wetland function. In any case, compensatory mitigation is 18not required for impacts below 1/10 of an acre.19    (c) The Department may, through rulemaking in accordance 20with the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, adopt general 21permits covering activities not covered by general permits 22under subsection (b) of this Section if the Department 23determines that the activities in the category would be 24subject to the same permit limitations and conditions and will 25cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when 26performed separately, will have only minimal cumulative   SB2401- 27 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1adverse effect on the environment, will not cause or 2contribute to a violation of State water quality standards 3when performed separately, and will have only a minimal 4cumulative adverse effect on water quality. The Department 5shall prescribe best management practices for any general 6permit issued under this Section. The Department shall include 7compensatory mitigation requirements in general permits for 8impacts that exceed 1/10 of an acre.9    (d) The Department shall adopt a general permit for:10        (1) construction or maintenance of access roads for 11    utility lines, substations, or related equipment or 12    facilities with adequate culverts, bridges, or other 13    structures to provide freshwater connectivity and passage 14    for fish or other aquatic life;15        (2) activities for the purpose of preserving and 16    enhancing aviation safety or to prevent an airport hazard; 17    and18        (3) conservation activities, such as voluntary aquatic 19    habitat restoration and fish passage.20    The Department shall develop the general permit under 21paragraph (3) in consultation with local, state, and federal 22resource agencies, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 23and qualified non-profit organizations engaged in aquatic 24habitat restoration as a central part of their mission.25    (e) No general permit adopted under subsection (b), (c), 26or (d) of this Section shall be for a period of more than 5   SB2401- 28 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1years after the date of its adoption, and the Department shall 2revoke or modify such a general permit, after opportunity for 3public hearing, if the Department determines that the 4activities authorized by the general permit have an adverse 5impact on the environment, cause or contribute to a violation 6of State water quality standards, or are more appropriately 7authorized by individual permits.8    (f) Compliance with the terms of a general permit shall be 9deemed compliance with the provisions of this Act if the 10applicant:11        (1) files a preconstruction notification in accordance 12    with regulations adopted under this Act, including the 13    specific requirements of the general permit;14        (2) files all reports required by the general permit;15        (3) complies with all limitations required by the 16    general permit; and 17        (4) complies with applicable compensatory mitigation 18    requirements.19    (g) The Department may respond to a preconstruction 20notification issued under this Section within 30 days after 21the Department receives the notice. In any response, the 22Department may require the applicant to: 23        (1) provide more information to determine whether the 24    applicant's proposed regulated activity is covered by the 25    general permit; 26        (2) file a preconstruction notification for a   SB2401- 29 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1    different general permit if the Department determines the 2    applicant's proposed activity is not covered by the 3    general permit for which the notification was filed; or 4        (3) apply for an individual permit if the Department 5    determines that the proposed activity does not fall within 6    the scope of any valid general permit. 7    (h) If a person files a preconstruction discharge 8notification and receives no response under subsection (g) of 9this Section for a general permit that is valid at the time of 10the notification but that general permit is later modified, 11revoked, or expires, that person may proceed as if that 12general permit were still valid for the purposes of the 13project for which the preconstruction discharge notification 14was filed. 15    (i) The Department may require bonds or letters of credit 16in favor of the State, including conditions sufficient to 17secure compliance with conditions and limitations of a permit 18under this Act. 19    Section 35.

Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Wetlands Protection Act. 6    Section 5. Findings and intent. The General Assembly 7finds:8    (1) In 1818, Illinois contained an estimated 8.2 million 9acres of wetlands. Based on the Illinois portion of the 10National Wetlands Inventory, less than 9% of those original 11acres of wetlands remain.12    (2) As a result of the significant loss in wetland 13acreage, there has been a corresponding loss in the functional 14values and benefits that wetlands provide.15    (3) Illinois is bordered by 880 miles of rivers, which are 16critical to navigation, commerce, recreation, and ecosystem 17health at home and downstream to the Gulf of Mexico, and the 18health of Illinois rivers is heavily influenced by the health 19of the tributaries and streams that flow into them.20    (4) In Illinois, 9,894 total miles of streams provide 21water for surface water intakes, supplying public drinking 22water systems that rely at least in part on intermittent, 23ephemeral, or headwater streams.  SB2401- 2 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1    (5) Continued loss of Illinois' wetlands and streams may 2deprive the People of the State of some or all of the benefits 3that they provide, including:4        (A) reducing flood damages and protecting vulnerable 5    communities by absorbing, storing, and conveying peak 6    flows from storms;7        (B) improving water quality by serving as 8    sedimentation and filtering basins and as natural 9    biological treatment areas;10        (C) providing breeding, nesting, foraging, and 11    protective habitat for approximately 40% of the State's 12    threatened and endangered plants and animals, in addition 13    to other forms of fish, wildlife, game, waterfowl, and 14    shorebirds;15        (D) protecting underground water resources and helping 16    to recharge rivers, streams, and local or regional 17    underground water supplies;18        (E) serving as recreational areas for hunting, 19    fishing, boating, hiking, bird watching, photography, and 20    other uses;21        (F) providing open space and aesthetic values, 22    particularly in rapidly developing areas; 23        (G) providing unique educational and research 24    opportunities because of their high diversity of plants 25    and animals, their support for a high incidence of 26    threatened and endangered species, and their function as a   SB2401- 3 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1    natural buffer for rivers, lakes, and streams;2        (H) supplying nutrients in freshwater food cycles and 3    serving as nursery areas and sanctuaries for young fish; 4    and5        (I) helping to protect shorelines from the forces of 6    water erosion.7    (6) Our changing climate and its more extreme and less 8predictable weather patterns heighten the need for some or all 9of the benefits that Illinois' wetlands provide, including 10flood control, coastal resilience, water quality, aquifer 11recharge, habitat, and maintenance of baseflow to recharge 12rivers, streams, and local or regional underground water 13supplies.14    (7) Illinois historically relied on the federal Clean 15Water Act's permit program administered by the U.S. Army Corps 16of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to 17prevent harm to aquatic resources from unauthorized discharges 18of dredge or fill material.19    (8) After rejection of the 1989 Wetland Delineation Manual 20and in light of uncertainty about federal protections for some 21"isolated" wetlands, the General Assembly passed the 22Interagency Wetland Policy Act of 1989 to protect these 23wetlands from State agency actions and achieve no net loss of 24wetlands.25    (9) The Supreme Court's May 25, 2023 decision in Sackett 26v. EPA rolled back the scope of waters of the United States,   SB2401- 4 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1thereby removing federal Clean Water Act protections for many 2waters of the United States, including wetlands that provide 3significant flood control protections, such as bottomland 4hardwood forested wetlands that are separated from the 5Illinois River by levees.6    (10) It is important for Illinois to adopt protections 7under State law to reinstate protections lost by rolling back 8the scope of the federal Clean Water Act. 9    Section 10.

Applicability. 8    (a) The requirements of this Act apply to all State 9jurisdictional wetlands as that term is defined in this Act. 10If a wetland ceases to meet that definition because it becomes 11subject to regulation under the federal Clean Water Act, it 12shall no longer be subject to the provisions of this Act. The 13Department may enter into an agreement with the Corps of 14Engineers to coordinate the permit program under this Act with 15the Corps of Engineers permit program under Section 404 of the 16federal Clean Water Act. 17    (b) The following are presumed to be adjacent or have a 18significant nexus to maintaining the chemical, physical, or 19biological integrity of a navigable water and as such are 20State jurisdictional wetlands for purposes of this Act: 21        (1) wetlands that are wholly or partially located 22    within 100 feet of the ordinary high water mark of a 23    navigable water, interstate water, or tributary; 24        (2) wetlands that are wholly or partially located in 25    the 100-year floodplain and are within 1,500 feet of the   SB2401- 18 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1    ordinary high water mark of a navigable water, interstate 2    water, or tributary; 3        (3) wetlands that are wholly or partially within 1,500 4    feet of the ordinary high water mark of Lake Michigan; or 5        (4) wetlands that have a visible surface water or a 6    regular shallow subsurface water connection to a navigable 7    water. 8    (c) An affected property owner or developer may introduce 9information that is relevant to demonstrate that a particular 10wetland is not a State jurisdictional wetland, thereby 11rebutting the presumption in subsection (b). The Department 12shall consider information presented to rebut the presumption 13and determine whether the presumption has been rebutted. If 14the Department determines that the presumption is rebutted and 15the wetland is not a jurisdictional wetland for the purpose of 16this Act, the wetland shall not be subject to this Act. 17    Section 25. Regulated activities; individual permits; 18wetland classification; mitigation; delineation.19    (a) No person may discharge dredged or fill material into 20a State jurisdictional wetland protected by this Act except in 21accordance with the terms of an individual or general permit 22issued by the Department under this Section or Section 30 of 23this Act. This subsection (a) becomes effective on the date 24the Department adopts rules under Section 40 of this Act.25    (b) No permit shall be required under this Act, and the   SB2401- 19 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1requirements of the Act shall not apply to, renewable energy 2facility construction, maintenance, repair, improvement, or 3reconstruction that commenced construction before the 4effective date of rules adopted under Section 40 of this Act. 5For purposes of this subsection, "commenced construction" 6means:7        (1) to have begun a continuous program of on-site 8    physical construction, such as the placement, assembly, or 9    installation of facilities or equipment or the conducting 10    of site preparation work, including clearing, excavation, 11    or removal of existing structures;12        (2) to have submitted a binding application or bid to 13    the Illinois Power Agency to execute a Renewable Energy 14    Credit Contract under Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power 15    Agency Act;16        (3) to have entered into a binding contractual 17    agreement for the purchase and sale of electricity; or18        (4) to have obtained municipal or county siting 19    approval, a special use permit, or building approval.20    (c) Wetlands shall be classified as follows:21        (1) The Department shall classify a wetland as Class I 22    if the wetland:23            (A) is or encompasses a bog, bottomland hardwood 24        forest, fen, panne, or cypress swamp;25            (B) has been designated a Ramsar wetland of 26        international importance under the Convention on   SB2401- 20 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1        Wetlands;2            (C) is designated for important flood protection 3        services under paragraph (3);4            (D) is occupied or suitable habitat for a 5        threatened or endangered species listed under State or 6        federal law;7            (E) has a Floristic Quality Index that is equal to 8        or greater than 20 or a mean coefficient of 9        conservatism (Mean C) equal to or greater than 3.5, 10        determined in accordance with rules adopted by the 11        Department; or12            (F) is a High-Quality Aquatic Resource.13        (2) The Department shall classify a non-Class I 14    wetland as a Class II wetland if the wetland, including 15    its contiguous area, is larger than 0.5 acres. However, if 16    a non-Class I wetland is smaller than 0.5 acres it shall be 17    designated a Class III wetland. If a Class III wetland is 18    1/10th of an acre or smaller, there is no permit required.19        (3) The Department may, in consultation with the 20    Illinois Emergency Management Agency and Office of 21    Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency 22    or local authorities, designate a wetland as a Class I 23    wetland due to important flood protection services 24    protecting human life and property if the wetland is no 25    longer protected under the federal Clean Water Act. 26    (c) Mitigation shall be required in accordance with this   SB2401- 21 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1Act for permitted activities and shall be conducted according 2to the following preferred order:3        (1) Discharges impacting Class I wetlands shall be 4    mitigated through either on-site mitigation or off-site 5    mitigation at an approved wetland mitigation bank within 6    the same watershed as the location of the proposed fill. 7    Mitigation shall be in kind, restoring to the maximum 8    degree practicable, as determined by the Department, both 9    the type and functions of the wetland that will be 10    affected by the regulated activity. The mitigation ratio 11    shall be 5:1 unless the Director, for good cause shown and 12    on a case-by-case basis, authorizes a higher mitigation 13    ratio not to exceed 6:1 or a lower mitigation ratio not 14    less than 4:1. In lieu fee mitigation may be used for 15    mitigation when there are no available mitigation credits 16    within the watershed.17        (2) Discharges impacting Class II wetlands shall be 18    mitigated through either on-site mitigation or off-site 19    mitigation at an approved wetland mitigation bank within 20    the same watershed as the location of the proposed fill. 21    Mitigation shall be in kind, restoring to the maximum 22    degree practicable as determined by the Department, both 23    the type and functions of the wetland that will be 24    affected by the regulated activity. The mitigation ratio 25    shall be 3:1 unless the Director, for good cause shown and 26    on a case-by-case basis, authorizes a higher mitigation   SB2401- 22 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1    ratio not to exceed 3.5:1 or a lower mitigation ratio not 2    less than 2.5:1. In lieu fee mitigation may be used for 3    mitigation when there are no available mitigation credits 4    within the watershed.5        (3) Discharges impacting Class III wetlands shall be 6    mitigated through either participation in an approved 7    wetland mitigation bank or an approved in-lieu fee 8    program, unless the Department for good cause requires in 9    kind on-site mitigation or off-site mitigation at an 10    approved mitigation bank. The mitigation ratio shall be 11    1.5:1 for compensation through an approved wetland 12    mitigation bank and 2:1 for compensation through an 13    approved in-lieu fee program. The Director, for good cause 14    shown and on a case-by-case basis, may authorize a higher 15    or lower mitigation ratio.16    (d) Persons seeking a permit are responsible for wetland 17delineation and classification made by or under the 18supervision of an approved wetland specialist. Wetland 19delineations shall be made in accordance with the Corps of 20Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual. Classifications shall be 21in accordance with this Section or an approved program under 22Section 55. Delineations by the Corps of Engineers, by 23approved counties, or by Corps of Engineers approved agencies 24shall be honored.25    (e) Persons seeking an individual permit shall provide the 26Department with a complete application, including, at a   SB2401- 23 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1minimum, the following items: (i) a map of the area that will 2be affected by the activity, including wetland and water 3boundaries for the areas affected and the existing uses and 4structures; (ii) a wetland delineation made in accordance with 5the Corps of Engineers Wetland Delineation Manual by or under 6the supervision of an approved wetland specialist and this 7Section; (iii) a description of the proposed activity, 8including its purpose, the location and dimensions of any 9structures, grading or fills, drainage, roads, sewers and 10water supply, parking lots, stormwater facilities, discharge 11of pollutants and on-site waste disposal; (iv) a description 12of any public benefit to be derived from the proposed project; 13(v) a description of avoidance, minimization, and mitigation, 14including a mitigation plan; and (vi) the names and addresses 15of adjacent landowners as determined by the current tax 16assessment rolls. The Department shall notify the applicant 17within 20 business days if the permit application is 18incomplete and provide a reasonable time for the applicant to 19correct deficiencies in the permit application. Within 90 20business days of receipt of a complete permit application, the 21Department shall either issue the permit, deny the permit, or 22issue the permit with conditions. All individual permit 23decisions are subject to public comment. If a public hearing 24is held, the deadline to make a permit determination is 25extended by 45 business days.26    (f) The Department shall evaluate individual permit   SB2401- 24 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1requests through the following sequence: (i) avoidance of 2impacts to aquatic resources if a less environmentally 3damaging practicable alternative exists; (ii) minimization of 4unavoidable impacts by taking appropriate and practicable 5steps such as reduction of the footprint of the fill; (iii) 6compensatory mitigation for any remaining impacts to aquatic 7resources in accordance with this Act. The Department shall 8not issue an individual permit pursuant to this Section unless 9the Agency has certified to the Department that the proposed 10activity will not cause or contribute to a violation of a State 11water quality standard. The Agency shall, within 80 business 12days of receipt of a complete application, approve, deny, or 13approve with conditions the water quality certification. The 14applicant for a permit may mutually agree to extend the 80-day 15deadline up to an additional 80 business days in which the 16Agency must take final action on the water quality 17certification under this paragraph. If the Agency does not 18approve, deny, or approve with conditions the water quality 19certification within the extended time period, the 20certification requirements shall be waived and the Department 21may issue their permit decision consistent with the sections 22of this Act.23    (g) Upon request by an applicant, the Department may issue 24an after-the-fact permit if the Department determines that the 25activities covered by the after-the-fact permit were 26undertaken and conducted in response to emergency   SB2401- 25 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1circumstances that constituted an imminent threat to persons, 2public infrastructure, personal property, or uninterrupted 3utility service. The request for an after-the-fact permit must 4be made as soon as reasonably possible after the event. The 5Department shall require compensatory mitigation. If the 6Department for good cause shown denies an after-the-fact 7permit, the applicant shall be in violation of this Act. 8However, the applicant and Department may, through mutual 9agreement, provide for compensatory mitigation, restoration, 10or other measures to resolve the violation. In such an 11instance, the applicant may appeal the denial of an 12after-the-fact permit consistent with the appeals procedures 13in this Act.14    (h) The permit applicant and the Department may waive or 15extend the permit deadlines in this Section through mutual 16agreement. If the Department is unable to comply with the 17permit deadlines and they are not waived or extended through 18mutual agreement, the permit application will be denied 19without prejudice.  20    Section 30. General permits.21    (a) Notwithstanding Section 25, any person who intends to 22conduct a regulated activity within the State may do so in 23accordance with a general permit issued by the Department 24under this Section. A general permit pre-authorizes a category 25of activities that are similar in nature and impact on water   SB2401- 26 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1quality, will have only minimal adverse effects when performed 2separately, will have minimal cumulative impacts on water 3quality provided the permittee complies with all of the 4conditions of the general permit, and will not cause or 5contribute to a violation of State water quality standards.6    (b) Permits for all categories of activities, subject to 7the same permit limitations and conditions, that are the 8subject of a nationwide permit issued by the Corps of 9Engineers, in effect on the date of the enactment of this Act, 10are adopted as general permits covering regulated activities 11subject to this Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all such 12permits will include a preconstruction notification 13requirement and compensatory mitigation, unless the permit 14states compensatory mitigation is not required because the 15work is designed to improve water quality or, with respect to 16voluntary aquatic habitat restoration, to provide net increase 17in wetland function. In any case, compensatory mitigation is 18not required for impacts below 1/10 of an acre.19    (c) The Department may, through rulemaking in accordance 20with the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, adopt general 21permits covering activities not covered by general permits 22under subsection (b) of this Section if the Department 23determines that the activities in the category would be 24subject to the same permit limitations and conditions and will 25cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when 26performed separately, will have only minimal cumulative   SB2401- 27 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1adverse effect on the environment, will not cause or 2contribute to a violation of State water quality standards 3when performed separately, and will have only a minimal 4cumulative adverse effect on water quality. The Department 5shall prescribe best management practices for any general 6permit issued under this Section. The Department shall include 7compensatory mitigation requirements in general permits for 8impacts that exceed 1/10 of an acre.9    (d) The Department shall adopt a general permit for:10        (1) construction or maintenance of access roads for 11    utility lines, substations, or related equipment or 12    facilities with adequate culverts, bridges, or other 13    structures to provide freshwater connectivity and passage 14    for fish or other aquatic life;15        (2) activities for the purpose of preserving and 16    enhancing aviation safety or to prevent an airport hazard; 17    and18        (3) conservation activities, such as voluntary aquatic 19    habitat restoration and fish passage.20    The Department shall develop the general permit under 21paragraph (3) in consultation with local, state, and federal 22resource agencies, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 23and qualified non-profit organizations engaged in aquatic 24habitat restoration as a central part of their mission.25    (e) No general permit adopted under subsection (b), (c), 26or (d) of this Section shall be for a period of more than 5   SB2401- 28 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1years after the date of its adoption, and the Department shall 2revoke or modify such a general permit, after opportunity for 3public hearing, if the Department determines that the 4activities authorized by the general permit have an adverse 5impact on the environment, cause or contribute to a violation 6of State water quality standards, or are more appropriately 7authorized by individual permits.8    (f) Compliance with the terms of a general permit shall be 9deemed compliance with the provisions of this Act if the 10applicant:11        (1) files a preconstruction notification in accordance 12    with regulations adopted under this Act, including the 13    specific requirements of the general permit;14        (2) files all reports required by the general permit;15        (3) complies with all limitations required by the 16    general permit; and 17        (4) complies with applicable compensatory mitigation 18    requirements.19    (g) The Department may respond to a preconstruction 20notification issued under this Section within 30 days after 21the Department receives the notice. In any response, the 22Department may require the applicant to: 23        (1) provide more information to determine whether the 24    applicant's proposed regulated activity is covered by the 25    general permit; 26        (2) file a preconstruction notification for a   SB2401- 29 -LRB104 09737 BDA 19803 b1    different general permit if the Department determines the 2    applicant's proposed activity is not covered by the 3    general permit for which the notification was filed; or 4        (3) apply for an individual permit if the Department 5    determines that the proposed activity does not fall within 6    the scope of any valid general permit. 7    (h) If a person files a preconstruction discharge 8notification and receives no response under subsection (g) of 9this Section for a general permit that is valid at the time of 10the notification but that general permit is later modified, 11revoked, or expires, that person may proceed as if that 12general permit were still valid for the purposes of the 13project for which the preconstruction discharge notification 14was filed. 15    (i) The Department may require bonds or letters of credit 16in favor of the State, including conditions sufficient to 17secure compliance with conditions and limitations of a permit 18under this Act. 19    Section 35.
