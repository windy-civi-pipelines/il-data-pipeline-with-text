The General 24Assembly finds that the minimum live racing guarantees 25contained in subsections (e-1), (e-2), and (e-3) are in the 26best interest of the sport of horse racing, and that such   10400SB1473sam001- 16 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1guarantees may only be reduced in the calendar year in which 2they will be conducted in the limited circumstances described 3in this subsection. The Board may decrease the number of 4racing days without affecting an organization licensee's 5ability to conduct gaming pursuant to an organization gaming 6license issued under the Illinois Gambling Act only if the 7Board determines, after notice and hearing, that: 8        (i) a decrease is necessary to maintain a sufficient 9    number of betting interests per race to ensure the 10    integrity of racing; 11        (ii) there are unsafe track conditions due to weather 12    or acts of God;13        (iii) there is an agreement between an organization 14    licensee and the breed association that is applicable to 15    the involved live racing guarantee, such association 16    representing either the largest number of thoroughbred 17    owners and trainers or the largest number of standardbred 18    owners, trainers and drivers who race horses at the 19    involved organization licensee's racing meeting, so long 20    as the agreement does not compromise the integrity of the 21    sport of horse racing; or22        (iv) the horse population or purse levels are 23    insufficient to provide the number of racing opportunities 24    otherwise required in this Act. 25    In decreasing the number of racing dates in accordance 26with this subsection, the Board shall hold a hearing and shall   10400SB1473sam001- 17 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1provide the public and all interested parties notice and an 2opportunity to be heard. The Board shall accept testimony from 3all interested parties, including any association representing 4owners, trainers, jockeys, or drivers who will be affected by 5the decrease in racing dates. The Board shall provide a 6written explanation of the reasons for the decrease and the 7Board's findings. The written explanation shall include a 8listing and content of all communication between any party and 9any Illinois Racing Board member or staff that does not take 10place at a public meeting of the Board. 11    (e-5) In reviewing an application for the purpose of 12granting an organization license consistent with the best 13interests of the public and the sport of horse racing, the 14Board shall consider: 15        (1) the character, reputation, experience, and 16    financial integrity of the applicant and of any other 17    separate person that either: 18            (i) controls the applicant, directly or 19        indirectly, or 20            (ii) is controlled, directly or indirectly, by 21        that applicant or by a person who controls, directly 22        or indirectly, that applicant; 23        (2) the applicant's facilities or proposed facilities 24    for conducting horse racing; 25        (3) the total revenue without regard to Section 32.1 26    to be derived by the State and horsemen from the   10400SB1473sam001- 18 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    applicant's conducting a race meeting; 2        (4) the applicant's good faith affirmative action plan 3    to recruit, train, and upgrade minorities in all 4    employment classifications; 5        (5) the applicant's financial ability to purchase and 6    maintain adequate liability and casualty insurance; 7        (6) the applicant's proposed and prior year's 8    promotional and marketing activities and expenditures of 9    the applicant associated with those activities; 10        (7) an agreement, if any, among organization licensees 11    as provided in subsection (b) of Section 21 of this Act; 12    and 13        (8) the extent to which the applicant exceeds or meets 14    other standards for the issuance of an organization 15    license that the Board shall adopt by rule.16    In granting organization licenses and allocating dates for 17horse race meetings, the Board shall have discretion to 18determine an overall schedule, including required simulcasts 19of Illinois races by host tracks that will, in its judgment, be 20conducive to the best interests of the public and the sport of 21horse racing.22    (e-10) The Illinois Administrative Procedure Act shall 23apply to administrative procedures of the Board under this Act 24for the granting of an organization license, except that (1) 25notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 2610-40 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding   10400SB1473sam001- 19 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1cross-examination, the Board may prescribe rules limiting the 2right of an applicant or participant in any proceeding to 3award an organization license to conduct cross-examination of 4witnesses at that proceeding where that cross-examination 5would unduly obstruct the timely award of an organization 6license under subsection (e) of Section 20 of this Act; (2) the 7provisions of Section 10-45 of the Illinois Administrative 8Procedure Act regarding proposals for decision are excluded 9under this Act; (3) notwithstanding the provisions of 10subsection (a) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois Administrative 11Procedure Act regarding ex parte communications, the Board may 12prescribe rules allowing ex parte communications with 13applicants or participants in a proceeding to award an 14organization license where conducting those communications 15would be in the best interest of racing, provided all those 16communications are made part of the record of that proceeding 17pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois 18Administrative Procedure Act; (4) the provisions of Section 1914a of this Act and the rules of the Board promulgated under 20that Section shall apply instead of the provisions of Article 2110 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding 22administrative law judges; and (5) the provisions of 23subsection (d) of Section 10-65 of the Illinois Administrative 24Procedure Act that prevent summary suspension of a license 25pending revocation or other action shall not apply.26    (f) The Board may allot racing dates to an organization   10400SB1473sam001- 20 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1licensee for more than one calendar year but for no more than 3 2successive calendar years in advance, provided that the Board 3shall review such allotment for more than one calendar year 4prior to each year for which such allotment has been made.

Organization licenses shall be subject to revocation 12if the organization licensee has violated any provision of 13this Act or the rules and regulations promulgated under this 14Act or has been convicted of a crime or has failed to disclose 15or has stated falsely any information called for in the 16application for an organization license. Any organization 17license revocation proceeding shall be in accordance with 18Section 16 regarding suspension and revocation of occupation 19licenses.20    (f-5) If, (i) an applicant does not file an acceptance of 21the racing dates awarded by the Board as required under part 22(1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20, or (ii) an 23organization licensee has its license suspended or revoked 24under this Act, the Board, upon conducting an emergency 25hearing as provided for in this Act, may reaward on an 26emergency basis pursuant to rules established by the Board,   10400SB1473sam001- 21 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1racing dates not accepted or the racing dates associated with 2any suspension or revocation period to one or more 3organization licensees, new applicants, or any combination 4thereof, upon terms and conditions that the Board determines 5are in the best interest of racing, provided, the organization 6licensees or new applicants receiving the awarded racing dates 7file an acceptance of those reawarded racing dates as required 8under paragraph (1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20 and 9comply with the other provisions of this Act. The Illinois 10Administrative Procedure Act shall not apply to the 11administrative procedures of the Board in conducting the 12emergency hearing and the reallocation of racing dates on an 13emergency basis.14    (g) (Blank).15    (h) The Board shall send the applicant a copy of its 16formally executed order by certified mail addressed to the 17applicant at the address stated in his application, which 18notice shall be mailed within 5 days of the date the formal 19order is executed.20    Each applicant notified shall, within 10 days after 21receipt of the final executed order of the Board awarding 22racing dates: 23        (1) file with the Board an acceptance of such award in 24    the form prescribed by the Board; 25        (2) pay to the Board an additional amount equal to 26    $110 for each racing date awarded; and   10400SB1473sam001- 22 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1        (3) file with the Board the bonds required in Sections 2    21 and 25 at least 20 days prior to the first day of each 3    race meeting.4Upon compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), 5and (3) of this subsection (h), the applicant shall be issued 6an organization license.7    If any applicant fails to comply with this Section or 8fails to pay the organization license fees herein provided, no 9organization license shall be issued to such applicant.10(Source: P.A. 101-31, eff. 6-28-19.) 11    (230 ILCS 5/26)  (from Ch. 8, par. 37-26)12    Sec. 26. Wagering. 13    (a) Any licensee may conduct and supervise the pari-mutuel 14system of wagering, as defined in Section 3.12 of this Act, on 15horse races conducted by an Illinois organization licensee or 16conducted at a racetrack located in another state or country 17in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 26 of this Act. 18Subject to the prior consent of the Board, licensees may 19supplement any pari-mutuel pool in order to guarantee a 20minimum distribution. Such pari-mutuel method of wagering 21shall not, under any circumstances if conducted under the 22provisions of this Act, be held or construed to be unlawful, 23other statutes of this State to the contrary notwithstanding. 24Subject to rules for advance wagering promulgated by the 25Board, any licensee may accept wagers in advance of the day the   10400SB1473sam001- 23 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1race wagered upon occurs.2    (b) Except for those gaming activities for which a license 3is obtained and authorized under the Illinois Lottery Law, the 4Charitable Games Act, the Raffles and Poker Runs Act, or the 5Illinois Gambling Act, no other method of betting, pool 6making, wagering or gambling shall be used or permitted by the 7licensee. Each licensee may retain, subject to the payment of 8all applicable taxes and purses, an amount not to exceed 17% of 9all money wagered under subsection (a) of this Section, except 10as may otherwise be permitted under this Act.11    (b-5) An individual may place a wager under the 12pari-mutuel system from any licensed location authorized under 13this Act provided that wager is electronically recorded in the 14manner described in Section 3.12 of this Act. Any wager made 15electronically by an individual while physically on the 16premises of a licensee shall be deemed to have been made at the 17premises of that licensee.18    (c) (Blank).19    (c-5) The sum held by any licensee for payment of 20outstanding pari-mutuel tickets, if unclaimed prior to 21December 31 of the next year, shall be retained by the licensee 22for payment of such tickets until that date. Within 10 days 23thereafter, the balance of such sum remaining unclaimed, less 24any uncashed supplements contributed by such licensee for the 25purpose of guaranteeing minimum distributions of any 26pari-mutuel pool, shall be evenly distributed to the purse   10400SB1473sam001- 24 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1account of the organization licensee and the organization 2licensee, except that the balance of the sum of all 3outstanding pari-mutuel tickets generated from simulcast 4wagering and inter-track wagering by an organization licensee 5located in a county with a population in excess of 230,000 and 6borders the Mississippi River or any licensee that derives its 7license from that organization licensee shall be evenly 8distributed to the purse account of the organization licensee 9and the organization licensee.10    (d) A pari-mutuel ticket shall be honored until December 1131 of the next calendar year, and the licensee shall pay the 12same and may charge the amount thereof against unpaid money 13similarly accumulated on account of pari-mutuel tickets not 14presented for payment.15    (e) No licensee shall knowingly permit any minor, other 16than an employee of such licensee or an owner, trainer, 17jockey, driver, or employee thereof, to be admitted during a 18racing program unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, or 19any minor to be a patron of the pari-mutuel system of wagering 20conducted or supervised by it. The admission of any 21unaccompanied minor, other than an employee of the licensee or 22an owner, trainer, jockey, driver, or employee thereof at a 23race track is a Class C misdemeanor.24    (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Act, an 25organization licensee may contract with an entity in another 26state or country to permit any legal wagering entity in   10400SB1473sam001- 25 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1another state or country to accept wagers solely within such 2other state or country on races conducted by the organization 3licensee in this State. Beginning January 1, 2000, these 4wagers shall not be subject to State taxation. Until January 51, 2000, when the out-of-State entity conducts a pari-mutuel 6pool separate from the organization licensee, a privilege tax 7equal to 7 1/2% of all monies received by the organization 8licensee from entities in other states or countries pursuant 9to such contracts is imposed on the organization licensee, and 10such privilege tax shall be remitted to the Department of 11Revenue within 48 hours of receipt of the moneys from the 12simulcast. When the out-of-State entity conducts a combined 13pari-mutuel pool with the organization licensee, the tax shall 14be 10% of all monies received by the organization licensee 15with 25% of the receipts from this 10% tax to be distributed to 16the county in which the race was conducted.17    An organization licensee may permit one or more of its 18races to be utilized for pari-mutuel wagering at one or more 19locations in other states and may transmit audio and visual 20signals of races the organization licensee conducts to one or 21more locations outside the State or country and may also 22permit pari-mutuel pools in other states or countries to be 23combined with its gross or net wagering pools or with wagering 24pools established by other states.25    (g) A host track may accept interstate simulcast wagers on 26horse races conducted in other states or countries and shall   10400SB1473sam001- 26 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1control the number of signals and types of breeds of racing in 2its simulcast program, subject to the disapproval of the 3Board. The Board may prohibit a simulcast program only if it 4finds that the simulcast program is clearly adverse to the 5integrity of racing. The host track simulcast program shall 6include the signal of live racing of all organization 7licensees. All non-host licensees and advance deposit wagering 8licensees shall carry the signal of and accept wagers on live 9racing of all organization licensees. Advance deposit wagering 10licensees shall not be permitted to accept out-of-state wagers 11on any Illinois signal provided pursuant to this Section 12without the approval and consent of the organization licensee 13providing the signal. For one year after August 15, 2014 (the 14effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host licensees may 15carry the host track simulcast program and shall accept wagers 16on all races included as part of the simulcast program of horse 17races conducted at race tracks located within North America 18upon which wagering is permitted. For a period of one year 19after August 15, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 2098-968), on horse races conducted at race tracks located 21outside of North America, non-host licensees may accept wagers 22on all races included as part of the simulcast program upon 23which wagering is permitted. Beginning August 15, 2015 (one 24year after the effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host 25licensees may carry the host track simulcast program and shall 26accept wagers on all races included as part of the simulcast   10400SB1473sam001- 27 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1program upon which wagering is permitted. All organization 2licensees shall provide their live signal to all advance 3deposit wagering licensees for a simulcast commission fee not 4to exceed 6% of the advance deposit wagering licensee's 5Illinois handle on the organization licensee's signal without 6prior approval by the Board. The Board may adopt rules under 7which it may permit simulcast commission fees in excess of 6%. 8The Board shall adopt rules limiting the interstate commission 9fees charged to an advance deposit wagering licensee. The 10Board shall adopt rules regarding advance deposit wagering on 11interstate simulcast races that shall reflect, among other 12things, the General Assembly's desire to maximize revenues to 13the State, horsemen purses, and organization licensees. 14However, organization licensees providing live signals 15pursuant to the requirements of this subsection (g) may 16petition the Board to withhold their live signals from an 17advance deposit wagering licensee if the organization licensee 18discovers and the Board finds reputable or credible 19information that the advance deposit wagering licensee is 20under investigation by another state or federal governmental 21agency, the advance deposit wagering licensee's license has 22been suspended in another state, or the advance deposit 23wagering licensee's license is in revocation proceedings in 24another state. The organization licensee's provision of their 25live signal to an advance deposit wagering licensee under this 26subsection (g) pertains to wagers placed from within Illinois.   10400SB1473sam001- 28 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1Advance deposit wagering licensees may place advance deposit 2wagering terminals at wagering facilities as a convenience to 3customers. The advance deposit wagering licensee shall not 4charge or collect any fee from purses for the placement of the 5advance deposit wagering terminals. The costs and expenses of 6the host track and non-host licensees associated with 7interstate simulcast wagering, other than the interstate 8commission fee, shall be borne by the host track and all 9non-host licensees incurring these costs. The interstate 10commission fee shall not exceed 5% of Illinois handle on the 11interstate simulcast race or races without prior approval of 12the Board. The Board shall promulgate rules under which it may 13permit interstate commission fees in excess of 5%. The 14interstate commission fee and other fees charged by the 15sending racetrack, including, but not limited to, satellite 16decoder fees, shall be uniformly applied to the host track and 17all non-host licensees.18    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an 19organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 20association representing the largest number of owners, 21trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 22that organization licensee's racing meeting, may maintain a 23system whereby advance deposit wagering may take place or an 24organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 25association representing the largest number of owners, 26trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at   10400SB1473sam001- 29 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1that organization licensee's racing meeting, may contract with 2another person to carry out a system of advance deposit 3wagering. Such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Only 4with respect to an appeal to the Board that consent for an 5organization licensee that maintains its own advance deposit 6wagering system is being unreasonably withheld, the Board 7shall issue a final order within 30 days after initiation of 8the appeal, and the organization licensee's advance deposit 9wagering system may remain operational during that 30-day 10period. The actions of any organization licensee who conducts 11advance deposit wagering or any person who has a contract with 12an organization licensee to conduct advance deposit wagering 13who conducts advance deposit wagering on or after January 1, 142013 and prior to June 7, 2013 (the effective date of Public 15Act 98-18) taken in reliance on the changes made to this 16subsection (g) by Public Act 98-18 are hereby validated, 17provided payment of all applicable pari-mutuel taxes are 18remitted to the Board. All advance deposit wagers placed from 19within Illinois must be placed through a Board-approved 20advance deposit wagering licensee; no other entity may accept 21an advance deposit wager from a person within Illinois. All 22advance deposit wagering is subject to any rules adopted by 23the Board. The Board may adopt rules necessary to regulate 24advance deposit wagering through the use of emergency 25rulemaking in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Illinois 26Administrative Procedure Act. The General Assembly finds that   10400SB1473sam001- 30 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1the adoption of rules to regulate advance deposit wagering is 2deemed an emergency and necessary for the public interest, 3safety, and welfare. An advance deposit wagering licensee may 4retain all moneys as agreed to by contract with an 5organization licensee. Any moneys retained by the organization 6licensee from advance deposit wagering, not including moneys 7retained by the advance deposit wagering licensee, shall be 8paid 50% to the organization licensee's purse account and 50% 9to the organization licensee. With the exception of any 10organization licensee that is owned by a publicly traded 11company that is incorporated in a state other than Illinois 12and advance deposit wagering licensees under contract with 13such organization licensees, organization licensees that 14maintain advance deposit wagering systems and advance deposit 15wagering licensees that contract with organization licensees 16shall provide sufficiently detailed monthly accountings to the 17horsemen association representing the largest number of 18owners, trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race 19horses at that organization licensee's racing meeting so that 20the horsemen association, as an interested party, can confirm 21the accuracy of the amounts paid to the purse account at the 22horsemen association's affiliated organization licensee from 23advance deposit wagering. If more than one breed races at the 24same race track facility, then the 50% of the moneys to be paid 25to an organization licensee's purse account shall be allocated 26among all organization licensees' purse accounts operating at   10400SB1473sam001- 31 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1that race track facility proportionately based on the actual 2number of host days that the Board grants to that breed at that 3race track facility in the current calendar year. To the 4extent any fees from advance deposit wagering conducted in 5Illinois for wagers in Illinois or other states have been 6placed in escrow or otherwise withheld from wagers pending a 7determination of the legality of advance deposit wagering, no 8action shall be brought to declare such wagers or the 9disbursement of any fees previously escrowed illegal.10        (1) Between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. an 11    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 12    may supplement the host track simulcast program with 13    additional simulcast races or race programs, provided that 14    between January 1 and the third Friday in February of any 15    year, inclusive, if no live thoroughbred racing is 16    occurring in Illinois during this period, only 17    thoroughbred races may be used for supplemental interstate 18    simulcast purposes. The Board shall withhold approval for 19    a supplemental interstate simulcast only if it finds that 20    the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 21    racing. A supplemental interstate simulcast may be 22    transmitted from an inter-track wagering licensee to its 23    affiliated non-host licensees. The interstate commission 24    fee for a supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid 25    by the non-host licensee and its affiliated non-host 26    licensees receiving the simulcast.  10400SB1473sam001- 32 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1        (2) Between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. an 2    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 3    may receive supplemental interstate simulcasts only with 4    the consent of the host track, except when the Board finds 5    that the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 6    racing. Consent granted under this paragraph (2) to any 7    inter-track wagering licensee shall be deemed consent to 8    all non-host licensees. The interstate commission fee for 9    the supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid by all 10    participating non-host licensees.11        (3) Each licensee conducting interstate simulcast 12    wagering may retain, subject to the payment of all 13    applicable taxes and the purses, an amount not to exceed 14    17% of all money wagered. If any licensee conducts the 15    pari-mutuel system wagering on races conducted at 16    racetracks in another state or country, each such race or 17    race program shall be considered a separate racing day for 18    the purpose of determining the daily handle and computing 19    the privilege tax of that daily handle as provided in 20    subsection (a) of Section 27. Until January 1, 2000, from 21    the sums permitted to be retained pursuant to this 22    subsection, each inter-track wagering location licensee 23    shall pay 1% of the pari-mutuel handle wagered on 24    simulcast wagering to the Horse Racing Tax Allocation 25    Fund, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of 26    paragraph (11) of subsection (h) of Section 26 of this   10400SB1473sam001- 33 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    Act.2        (4) A licensee who receives an interstate simulcast 3    may combine its gross or net pools with pools at the 4    sending racetracks pursuant to rules established by the 5    Board. All licensees combining their gross pools at a 6    sending racetrack shall adopt the takeout percentages of 7    the sending racetrack. A licensee may also establish a 8    separate pool and takeout structure for wagering purposes 9    on races conducted at race tracks outside of the State of 10    Illinois. The licensee may permit pari-mutuel wagers 11    placed in other states or countries to be combined with 12    its gross or net wagering pools or other wagering pools.13        (5) After the payment of the interstate commission fee 14    (except for the interstate commission fee on a 15    supplemental interstate simulcast, which shall be paid by 16    the host track and by each non-host licensee through the 17    host track) and all applicable State and local taxes, 18    except as provided in subsection (g) of Section 27 of this 19    Act, the remainder of moneys retained from simulcast 20    wagering pursuant to this subsection (g), and Section 26.2 21    shall be divided as follows:22            (A) For interstate simulcast wagers made at a host 23        track, 50% to the host track and 50% to purses at the 24        host track.25            (B) For wagers placed on interstate simulcast 26        races, supplemental simulcasts as defined in   10400SB1473sam001- 34 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1        subparagraphs (1) and (2), and separately pooled races 2        conducted outside of the State of Illinois made at a 3        non-host licensee, 25% to the host track, 25% to the 4        non-host licensee, and 50% to the purses at the host 5        track.6        (6) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the 7    contrary, non-host licensees who derive their licenses 8    from a track located in a county with a population in 9    excess of 230,000 and that borders the Mississippi River 10    may receive supplemental interstate simulcast races at all 11    times subject to Board approval, which shall be withheld 12    only upon a finding that a supplemental interstate 13    simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of racing.14        (7) Effective January 1, 2017, notwithstanding any 15    provision of this Act to the contrary, after payment of 16    all applicable State and local taxes and interstate 17    commission fees, non-host licensees who derive their 18    licenses from a track located in a county with a 19    population in excess of 230,000 and that borders the 20    Mississippi River shall retain 50% of the retention from 21    interstate simulcast wagers and shall pay 50% to purses at 22    the track from which the non-host licensee derives its 23    license.24        (7.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 25    to the contrary, if no standardbred racing is conducted at 26    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar   10400SB1473sam001- 35 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, all moneys 2    derived by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and 3    inter-track wagering that (1) are to be used for purses 4    and (2) are generated between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 5    6:30 a.m. during that calendar year shall be paid as 6    follows:7            (A) If the licensee that conducts horse racing at 8        that racetrack requests from the Board at least as 9        many racing dates as were conducted in calendar year 10        2000, 80% shall be paid to its thoroughbred purse 11        account; and12            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 13        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund and shall 14        be paid to purses for standardbred races for Illinois 15        conceived and foaled horses conducted at any county 16        fairgrounds. The moneys deposited into the Fund 17        pursuant to this subparagraph (B) shall be deposited 18        within 2 weeks after the day they were generated, 19        shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other 20        moneys paid to standardbred purses under this Act, and 21        shall not be commingled with other moneys paid into 22        that Fund. The moneys deposited pursuant to this 23        subparagraph (B) shall be allocated as provided by the 24        Department of Agriculture, with the advice and 25        assistance of the Illinois Standardbred Breeders Fund 26        Advisory Board.  10400SB1473sam001- 36 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1        (7.2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 2    to the contrary, if no thoroughbred racing is conducted at 3    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar 4    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, all moneys 5    derived by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and 6    inter-track wagering that (1) are to be used for purses 7    and (2) are generated between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 8    6:30 p.m. during that calendar year shall be deposited as 9    follows:10            (A) If the licensee that conducts horse racing at 11        that racetrack requests from the Board at least as 12        many racing dates as were conducted in calendar year 13        2000, 80% shall be deposited into its standardbred 14        purse account; and15            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 16        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund.

In awarding racing 9dates under this subsection (e-2), the Board shall have the 10discretion to allocate those thoroughbred racing dates among 11these Cook County organization licensees.12    (e-3) In awarding racing dates for calendar year 2020 and 13thereafter in connection with a racetrack in Madison County, 14the Board shall award racing dates and such organization 15licensee shall run at least 700 thoroughbred races at the 16racetrack in Madison County each year. 17    Notwithstanding Section 7.7 of the Illinois Gambling Act 18or any provision of this Act other than subsection (e-4.5), 19for each calendar year for which an organization gaming 20licensee located in Madison County requests racing dates 21resulting in less than 700 live thoroughbred races at its 22racetrack facility, the organization gaming licensee may not 23conduct gaming pursuant to an organization gaming license 24issued under the Illinois Gambling Act for the calendar year 25of such requested live races. 26    (e-4) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.7 of the   10400SB1473sam001- 15 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1Illinois Gambling Act or any provision of this Act other than 2subsections (e-3) and (e-4.5), for each calendar year for 3which an organization gaming licensee requests thoroughbred 4racing dates which results in a number of live races under its 5organization license that is less than the total number of 6live races which it conducted in 2017 at its racetrack 7facility, the organization gaming licensee may not conduct 8gaming pursuant to its organization gaming license for the 9calendar year of such requested live races. 10    (e-4.1) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.7 of 11the Illinois Gambling Act or any provision of this Act other 12than subsections (e-3) and (e-4.5), for each calendar year for 13which an organization licensee requests racing dates for 14standardbred racing which results in a number of live races 15that is less than the total number of live races required in 16subsection (e-1), the organization gaming licensee may not 17conduct gaming pursuant to its organization gaming license for 18the calendar year of such requested live races. 19    (e-4.5) The Board shall award the minimum live racing 20guarantees contained in subsections (e-1), (e-2), and (e-3) to 21ensure that each organization licensee shall individually run 22a sufficient number of races per year to qualify for an 23organization gaming license under this Act. The General 24Assembly finds that the minimum live racing guarantees 25contained in subsections (e-1), (e-2), and (e-3) are in the 26best interest of the sport of horse racing, and that such   10400SB1473sam001- 16 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1guarantees may only be reduced in the calendar year in which 2they will be conducted in the limited circumstances described 3in this subsection. The Board may decrease the number of 4racing days without affecting an organization licensee's 5ability to conduct gaming pursuant to an organization gaming 6license issued under the Illinois Gambling Act only if the 7Board determines, after notice and hearing, that: 8        (i) a decrease is necessary to maintain a sufficient 9    number of betting interests per race to ensure the 10    integrity of racing; 11        (ii) there are unsafe track conditions due to weather 12    or acts of God;13        (iii) there is an agreement between an organization 14    licensee and the breed association that is applicable to 15    the involved live racing guarantee, such association 16    representing either the largest number of thoroughbred 17    owners and trainers or the largest number of standardbred 18    owners, trainers and drivers who race horses at the 19    involved organization licensee's racing meeting, so long 20    as the agreement does not compromise the integrity of the 21    sport of horse racing; or22        (iv) the horse population or purse levels are 23    insufficient to provide the number of racing opportunities 24    otherwise required in this Act. 25    In decreasing the number of racing dates in accordance 26with this subsection, the Board shall hold a hearing and shall   10400SB1473sam001- 17 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1provide the public and all interested parties notice and an 2opportunity to be heard. The Board shall accept testimony from 3all interested parties, including any association representing 4owners, trainers, jockeys, or drivers who will be affected by 5the decrease in racing dates. The Board shall provide a 6written explanation of the reasons for the decrease and the 7Board's findings. The written explanation shall include a 8listing and content of all communication between any party and 9any Illinois Racing Board member or staff that does not take 10place at a public meeting of the Board. 11    (e-5) In reviewing an application for the purpose of 12granting an organization license consistent with the best 13interests of the public and the sport of horse racing, the 14Board shall consider: 15        (1) the character, reputation, experience, and 16    financial integrity of the applicant and of any other 17    separate person that either: 18            (i) controls the applicant, directly or 19        indirectly, or 20            (ii) is controlled, directly or indirectly, by 21        that applicant or by a person who controls, directly 22        or indirectly, that applicant; 23        (2) the applicant's facilities or proposed facilities 24    for conducting horse racing; 25        (3) the total revenue without regard to Section 32.1 26    to be derived by the State and horsemen from the   10400SB1473sam001- 18 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    applicant's conducting a race meeting; 2        (4) the applicant's good faith affirmative action plan 3    to recruit, train, and upgrade minorities in all 4    employment classifications; 5        (5) the applicant's financial ability to purchase and 6    maintain adequate liability and casualty insurance; 7        (6) the applicant's proposed and prior year's 8    promotional and marketing activities and expenditures of 9    the applicant associated with those activities; 10        (7) an agreement, if any, among organization licensees 11    as provided in subsection (b) of Section 21 of this Act; 12    and 13        (8) the extent to which the applicant exceeds or meets 14    other standards for the issuance of an organization 15    license that the Board shall adopt by rule.16    In granting organization licenses and allocating dates for 17horse race meetings, the Board shall have discretion to 18determine an overall schedule, including required simulcasts 19of Illinois races by host tracks that will, in its judgment, be 20conducive to the best interests of the public and the sport of 21horse racing.22    (e-10) The Illinois Administrative Procedure Act shall 23apply to administrative procedures of the Board under this Act 24for the granting of an organization license, except that (1) 25notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 2610-40 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding   10400SB1473sam001- 19 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1cross-examination, the Board may prescribe rules limiting the 2right of an applicant or participant in any proceeding to 3award an organization license to conduct cross-examination of 4witnesses at that proceeding where that cross-examination 5would unduly obstruct the timely award of an organization 6license under subsection (e) of Section 20 of this Act; (2) the 7provisions of Section 10-45 of the Illinois Administrative 8Procedure Act regarding proposals for decision are excluded 9under this Act; (3) notwithstanding the provisions of 10subsection (a) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois Administrative 11Procedure Act regarding ex parte communications, the Board may 12prescribe rules allowing ex parte communications with 13applicants or participants in a proceeding to award an 14organization license where conducting those communications 15would be in the best interest of racing, provided all those 16communications are made part of the record of that proceeding 17pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois 18Administrative Procedure Act; (4) the provisions of Section 1914a of this Act and the rules of the Board promulgated under 20that Section shall apply instead of the provisions of Article 2110 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding 22administrative law judges; and (5) the provisions of 23subsection (d) of Section 10-65 of the Illinois Administrative 24Procedure Act that prevent summary suspension of a license 25pending revocation or other action shall not apply.26    (f) The Board may allot racing dates to an organization   10400SB1473sam001- 20 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1licensee for more than one calendar year but for no more than 3 2successive calendar years in advance, provided that the Board 3shall review such allotment for more than one calendar year 4prior to each year for which such allotment has been made. The 5granting of an organization license to a person constitutes a 6privilege to conduct a horse race meeting under the provisions 7of this Act, and no person granted an organization license 8shall be deemed to have a vested interest, property right, or 9future expectation to receive an organization license in any 10subsequent year as a result of the granting of an organization 11license. Organization licenses shall be subject to revocation 12if the organization licensee has violated any provision of 13this Act or the rules and regulations promulgated under this 14Act or has been convicted of a crime or has failed to disclose 15or has stated falsely any information called for in the 16application for an organization license. Any organization 17license revocation proceeding shall be in accordance with 18Section 16 regarding suspension and revocation of occupation 19licenses.20    (f-5) If, (i) an applicant does not file an acceptance of 21the racing dates awarded by the Board as required under part 22(1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20, or (ii) an 23organization licensee has its license suspended or revoked 24under this Act, the Board, upon conducting an emergency 25hearing as provided for in this Act, may reaward on an 26emergency basis pursuant to rules established by the Board,   10400SB1473sam001- 21 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1racing dates not accepted or the racing dates associated with 2any suspension or revocation period to one or more 3organization licensees, new applicants, or any combination 4thereof, upon terms and conditions that the Board determines 5are in the best interest of racing, provided, the organization 6licensees or new applicants receiving the awarded racing dates 7file an acceptance of those reawarded racing dates as required 8under paragraph (1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20 and 9comply with the other provisions of this Act. The Illinois 10Administrative Procedure Act shall not apply to the 11administrative procedures of the Board in conducting the 12emergency hearing and the reallocation of racing dates on an 13emergency basis.14    (g) (Blank).15    (h) The Board shall send the applicant a copy of its 16formally executed order by certified mail addressed to the 17applicant at the address stated in his application, which 18notice shall be mailed within 5 days of the date the formal 19order is executed.20    Each applicant notified shall, within 10 days after 21receipt of the final executed order of the Board awarding 22racing dates: 23        (1) file with the Board an acceptance of such award in 24    the form prescribed by the Board; 25        (2) pay to the Board an additional amount equal to 26    $110 for each racing date awarded; and   10400SB1473sam001- 22 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1        (3) file with the Board the bonds required in Sections 2    21 and 25 at least 20 days prior to the first day of each 3    race meeting.4Upon compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), 5and (3) of this subsection (h), the applicant shall be issued 6an organization license.7    If any applicant fails to comply with this Section or 8fails to pay the organization license fees herein provided, no 9organization license shall be issued to such applicant.10(Source: P.A. 101-31, eff. 6-28-19.) 11    (230 ILCS 5/26)  (from Ch. 8, par. 37-26)12    Sec. 26. Wagering. 13    (a) Any licensee may conduct and supervise the pari-mutuel 14system of wagering, as defined in Section 3.12 of this Act, on 15horse races conducted by an Illinois organization licensee or 16conducted at a racetrack located in another state or country 17in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 26 of this Act. 18Subject to the prior consent of the Board, licensees may 19supplement any pari-mutuel pool in order to guarantee a 20minimum distribution. Such pari-mutuel method of wagering 21shall not, under any circumstances if conducted under the 22provisions of this Act, be held or construed to be unlawful, 23other statutes of this State to the contrary notwithstanding. 24Subject to rules for advance wagering promulgated by the 25Board, any licensee may accept wagers in advance of the day the   10400SB1473sam001- 23 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1race wagered upon occurs.2    (b) Except for those gaming activities for which a license 3is obtained and authorized under the Illinois Lottery Law, the 4Charitable Games Act, the Raffles and Poker Runs Act, or the 5Illinois Gambling Act, no other method of betting, pool 6making, wagering or gambling shall be used or permitted by the 7licensee. Each licensee may retain, subject to the payment of 8all applicable taxes and purses, an amount not to exceed 17% of 9all money wagered under subsection (a) of this Section, except 10as may otherwise be permitted under this Act.11    (b-5) An individual may place a wager under the 12pari-mutuel system from any licensed location authorized under 13this Act provided that wager is electronically recorded in the 14manner described in Section 3.12 of this Act. Any wager made 15electronically by an individual while physically on the 16premises of a licensee shall be deemed to have been made at the 17premises of that licensee.18    (c) (Blank).19    (c-5) The sum held by any licensee for payment of 20outstanding pari-mutuel tickets, if unclaimed prior to 21December 31 of the next year, shall be retained by the licensee 22for payment of such tickets until that date. Within 10 days 23thereafter, the balance of such sum remaining unclaimed, less 24any uncashed supplements contributed by such licensee for the 25purpose of guaranteeing minimum distributions of any 26pari-mutuel pool, shall be evenly distributed to the purse   10400SB1473sam001- 24 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1account of the organization licensee and the organization 2licensee, except that the balance of the sum of all 3outstanding pari-mutuel tickets generated from simulcast 4wagering and inter-track wagering by an organization licensee 5located in a county with a population in excess of 230,000 and 6borders the Mississippi River or any licensee that derives its 7license from that organization licensee shall be evenly 8distributed to the purse account of the organization licensee 9and the organization licensee.10    (d) A pari-mutuel ticket shall be honored until December 1131 of the next calendar year, and the licensee shall pay the 12same and may charge the amount thereof against unpaid money 13similarly accumulated on account of pari-mutuel tickets not 14presented for payment.15    (e) No licensee shall knowingly permit any minor, other 16than an employee of such licensee or an owner, trainer, 17jockey, driver, or employee thereof, to be admitted during a 18racing program unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, or 19any minor to be a patron of the pari-mutuel system of wagering 20conducted or supervised by it. The admission of any 21unaccompanied minor, other than an employee of the licensee or 22an owner, trainer, jockey, driver, or employee thereof at a 23race track is a Class C misdemeanor.24    (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Act, an 25organization licensee may contract with an entity in another 26state or country to permit any legal wagering entity in   10400SB1473sam001- 25 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1another state or country to accept wagers solely within such 2other state or country on races conducted by the organization 3licensee in this State. Beginning January 1, 2000, these 4wagers shall not be subject to State taxation. Until January 51, 2000, when the out-of-State entity conducts a pari-mutuel 6pool separate from the organization licensee, a privilege tax 7equal to 7 1/2% of all monies received by the organization 8licensee from entities in other states or countries pursuant 9to such contracts is imposed on the organization licensee, and 10such privilege tax shall be remitted to the Department of 11Revenue within 48 hours of receipt of the moneys from the 12simulcast. When the out-of-State entity conducts a combined 13pari-mutuel pool with the organization licensee, the tax shall 14be 10% of all monies received by the organization licensee 15with 25% of the receipts from this 10% tax to be distributed to 16the county in which the race was conducted.17    An organization licensee may permit one or more of its 18races to be utilized for pari-mutuel wagering at one or more 19locations in other states and may transmit audio and visual 20signals of races the organization licensee conducts to one or 21more locations outside the State or country and may also 22permit pari-mutuel pools in other states or countries to be 23combined with its gross or net wagering pools or with wagering 24pools established by other states.25    (g) A host track may accept interstate simulcast wagers on 26horse races conducted in other states or countries and shall   10400SB1473sam001- 26 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1control the number of signals and types of breeds of racing in 2its simulcast program, subject to the disapproval of the 3Board. The Board may prohibit a simulcast program only if it 4finds that the simulcast program is clearly adverse to the 5integrity of racing. The host track simulcast program shall 6include the signal of live racing of all organization 7licensees. All non-host licensees and advance deposit wagering 8licensees shall carry the signal of and accept wagers on live 9racing of all organization licensees. Advance deposit wagering 10licensees shall not be permitted to accept out-of-state wagers 11on any Illinois signal provided pursuant to this Section 12without the approval and consent of the organization licensee 13providing the signal. For one year after August 15, 2014 (the 14effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host licensees may 15carry the host track simulcast program and shall accept wagers 16on all races included as part of the simulcast program of horse 17races conducted at race tracks located within North America 18upon which wagering is permitted. For a period of one year 19after August 15, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 2098-968), on horse races conducted at race tracks located 21outside of North America, non-host licensees may accept wagers 22on all races included as part of the simulcast program upon 23which wagering is permitted. Beginning August 15, 2015 (one 24year after the effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host 25licensees may carry the host track simulcast program and shall 26accept wagers on all races included as part of the simulcast   10400SB1473sam001- 27 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1program upon which wagering is permitted. All organization 2licensees shall provide their live signal to all advance 3deposit wagering licensees for a simulcast commission fee not 4to exceed 6% of the advance deposit wagering licensee's 5Illinois handle on the organization licensee's signal without 6prior approval by the Board. The Board may adopt rules under 7which it may permit simulcast commission fees in excess of 6%. 8The Board shall adopt rules limiting the interstate commission 9fees charged to an advance deposit wagering licensee. The 10Board shall adopt rules regarding advance deposit wagering on 11interstate simulcast races that shall reflect, among other 12things, the General Assembly's desire to maximize revenues to 13the State, horsemen purses, and organization licensees. 14However, organization licensees providing live signals 15pursuant to the requirements of this subsection (g) may 16petition the Board to withhold their live signals from an 17advance deposit wagering licensee if the organization licensee 18discovers and the Board finds reputable or credible 19information that the advance deposit wagering licensee is 20under investigation by another state or federal governmental 21agency, the advance deposit wagering licensee's license has 22been suspended in another state, or the advance deposit 23wagering licensee's license is in revocation proceedings in 24another state. The organization licensee's provision of their 25live signal to an advance deposit wagering licensee under this 26subsection (g) pertains to wagers placed from within Illinois.   10400SB1473sam001- 28 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1Advance deposit wagering licensees may place advance deposit 2wagering terminals at wagering facilities as a convenience to 3customers. The advance deposit wagering licensee shall not 4charge or collect any fee from purses for the placement of the 5advance deposit wagering terminals. The costs and expenses of 6the host track and non-host licensees associated with 7interstate simulcast wagering, other than the interstate 8commission fee, shall be borne by the host track and all 9non-host licensees incurring these costs. The interstate 10commission fee shall not exceed 5% of Illinois handle on the 11interstate simulcast race or races without prior approval of 12the Board. The Board shall promulgate rules under which it may 13permit interstate commission fees in excess of 5%. The 14interstate commission fee and other fees charged by the 15sending racetrack, including, but not limited to, satellite 16decoder fees, shall be uniformly applied to the host track and 17all non-host licensees.18    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an 19organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 20association representing the largest number of owners, 21trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 22that organization licensee's racing meeting, may maintain a 23system whereby advance deposit wagering may take place or an 24organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 25association representing the largest number of owners, 26trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at   10400SB1473sam001- 29 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1that organization licensee's racing meeting, may contract with 2another person to carry out a system of advance deposit 3wagering. Such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Only 4with respect to an appeal to the Board that consent for an 5organization licensee that maintains its own advance deposit 6wagering system is being unreasonably withheld, the Board 7shall issue a final order within 30 days after initiation of 8the appeal, and the organization licensee's advance deposit 9wagering system may remain operational during that 30-day 10period. The actions of any organization licensee who conducts 11advance deposit wagering or any person who has a contract with 12an organization licensee to conduct advance deposit wagering 13who conducts advance deposit wagering on or after January 1, 142013 and prior to June 7, 2013 (the effective date of Public 15Act 98-18) taken in reliance on the changes made to this 16subsection (g) by Public Act 98-18 are hereby validated, 17provided payment of all applicable pari-mutuel taxes are 18remitted to the Board. All advance deposit wagers placed from 19within Illinois must be placed through a Board-approved 20advance deposit wagering licensee; no other entity may accept 21an advance deposit wager from a person within Illinois. All 22advance deposit wagering is subject to any rules adopted by 23the Board. The Board may adopt rules necessary to regulate 24advance deposit wagering through the use of emergency 25rulemaking in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Illinois 26Administrative Procedure Act. The General Assembly finds that   10400SB1473sam001- 30 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1the adoption of rules to regulate advance deposit wagering is 2deemed an emergency and necessary for the public interest, 3safety, and welfare. An advance deposit wagering licensee may 4retain all moneys as agreed to by contract with an 5organization licensee. Any moneys retained by the organization 6licensee from advance deposit wagering, not including moneys 7retained by the advance deposit wagering licensee, shall be 8paid 50% to the organization licensee's purse account and 50% 9to the organization licensee. With the exception of any 10organization licensee that is owned by a publicly traded 11company that is incorporated in a state other than Illinois 12and advance deposit wagering licensees under contract with 13such organization licensees, organization licensees that 14maintain advance deposit wagering systems and advance deposit 15wagering licensees that contract with organization licensees 16shall provide sufficiently detailed monthly accountings to the 17horsemen association representing the largest number of 18owners, trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race 19horses at that organization licensee's racing meeting so that 20the horsemen association, as an interested party, can confirm 21the accuracy of the amounts paid to the purse account at the 22horsemen association's affiliated organization licensee from 23advance deposit wagering. If more than one breed races at the 24same race track facility, then the 50% of the moneys to be paid 25to an organization licensee's purse account shall be allocated 26among all organization licensees' purse accounts operating at   10400SB1473sam001- 31 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1that race track facility proportionately based on the actual 2number of host days that the Board grants to that breed at that 3race track facility in the current calendar year. To the 4extent any fees from advance deposit wagering conducted in 5Illinois for wagers in Illinois or other states have been 6placed in escrow or otherwise withheld from wagers pending a 7determination of the legality of advance deposit wagering, no 8action shall be brought to declare such wagers or the 9disbursement of any fees previously escrowed illegal.10        (1) Between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. an 11    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 12    may supplement the host track simulcast program with 13    additional simulcast races or race programs, provided that 14    between January 1 and the third Friday in February of any 15    year, inclusive, if no live thoroughbred racing is 16    occurring in Illinois during this period, only 17    thoroughbred races may be used for supplemental interstate 18    simulcast purposes. The Board shall withhold approval for 19    a supplemental interstate simulcast only if it finds that 20    the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 21    racing. A supplemental interstate simulcast may be 22    transmitted from an inter-track wagering licensee to its 23    affiliated non-host licensees. The interstate commission 24    fee for a supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid 25    by the non-host licensee and its affiliated non-host 26    licensees receiving the simulcast.  10400SB1473sam001- 32 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1        (2) Between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. an 2    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 3    may receive supplemental interstate simulcasts only with 4    the consent of the host track, except when the Board finds 5    that the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 6    racing. Consent granted under this paragraph (2) to any 7    inter-track wagering licensee shall be deemed consent to 8    all non-host licensees. The interstate commission fee for 9    the supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid by all 10    participating non-host licensees.11        (3) Each licensee conducting interstate simulcast 12    wagering may retain, subject to the payment of all 13    applicable taxes and the purses, an amount not to exceed 14    17% of all money wagered. If any licensee conducts the 15    pari-mutuel system wagering on races conducted at 16    racetracks in another state or country, each such race or 17    race program shall be considered a separate racing day for 18    the purpose of determining the daily handle and computing 19    the privilege tax of that daily handle as provided in 20    subsection (a) of Section 27. Until January 1, 2000, from 21    the sums permitted to be retained pursuant to this 22    subsection, each inter-track wagering location licensee 23    shall pay 1% of the pari-mutuel handle wagered on 24    simulcast wagering to the Horse Racing Tax Allocation 25    Fund, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of 26    paragraph (11) of subsection (h) of Section 26 of this   10400SB1473sam001- 33 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    Act.2        (4) A licensee who receives an interstate simulcast 3    may combine its gross or net pools with pools at the 4    sending racetracks pursuant to rules established by the 5    Board. All licensees combining their gross pools at a 6    sending racetrack shall adopt the takeout percentages of 7    the sending racetrack. A licensee may also establish a 8    separate pool and takeout structure for wagering purposes 9    on races conducted at race tracks outside of the State of 10    Illinois. The licensee may permit pari-mutuel wagers 11    placed in other states or countries to be combined with 12    its gross or net wagering pools or other wagering pools.13        (5) After the payment of the interstate commission fee 14    (except for the interstate commission fee on a 15    supplemental interstate simulcast, which shall be paid by 16    the host track and by each non-host licensee through the 17    host track) and all applicable State and local taxes, 18    except as provided in subsection (g) of Section 27 of this 19    Act, the remainder of moneys retained from simulcast 20    wagering pursuant to this subsection (g), and Section 26.2 21    shall be divided as follows:22            (A) For interstate simulcast wagers made at a host 23        track, 50% to the host track and 50% to purses at the 24        host track.25            (B) For wagers placed on interstate simulcast 26        races, supplemental simulcasts as defined in   10400SB1473sam001- 34 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1        subparagraphs (1) and (2), and separately pooled races 2        conducted outside of the State of Illinois made at a 3        non-host licensee, 25% to the host track, 25% to the 4        non-host licensee, and 50% to the purses at the host 5        track.6        (6) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the 7    contrary, non-host licensees who derive their licenses 8    from a track located in a county with a population in 9    excess of 230,000 and that borders the Mississippi River 10    may receive supplemental interstate simulcast races at all 11    times subject to Board approval, which shall be withheld 12    only upon a finding that a supplemental interstate 13    simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of racing.14        (7) Effective January 1, 2017, notwithstanding any 15    provision of this Act to the contrary, after payment of 16    all applicable State and local taxes and interstate 17    commission fees, non-host licensees who derive their 18    licenses from a track located in a county with a 19    population in excess of 230,000 and that borders the 20    Mississippi River shall retain 50% of the retention from 21    interstate simulcast wagers and shall pay 50% to purses at 22    the track from which the non-host licensee derives its 23    license.24        (7.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 25    to the contrary, if no standardbred racing is conducted at 26    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar   10400SB1473sam001- 35 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, all moneys 2    derived by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and 3    inter-track wagering that (1) are to be used for purses 4    and (2) are generated between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 5    6:30 a.m. during that calendar year shall be paid as 6    follows:7            (A) If the licensee that conducts horse racing at 8        that racetrack requests from the Board at least as 9        many racing dates as were conducted in calendar year 10        2000, 80% shall be paid to its thoroughbred purse 11        account; and12            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 13        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund and shall 14        be paid to purses for standardbred races for Illinois 15        conceived and foaled horses conducted at any county 16        fairgrounds. The moneys deposited into the Fund 17        pursuant to this subparagraph (B) shall be deposited 18        within 2 weeks after the day they were generated, 19        shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other 20        moneys paid to standardbred purses under this Act, and 21        shall not be commingled with other moneys paid into 22        that Fund. The moneys deposited pursuant to this 23        subparagraph (B) shall be allocated as provided by the 24        Department of Agriculture, with the advice and 25        assistance of the Illinois Standardbred Breeders Fund 26        Advisory Board.  10400SB1473sam001- 36 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1        (7.2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 2    to the contrary, if no thoroughbred racing is conducted at 3    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar 4    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, all moneys 5    derived by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and 6    inter-track wagering that (1) are to be used for purses 7    and (2) are generated between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 8    6:30 p.m. during that calendar year shall be deposited as 9    follows:10            (A) If the licensee that conducts horse racing at 11        that racetrack requests from the Board at least as 12        many racing dates as were conducted in calendar year 13        2000, 80% shall be deposited into its standardbred 14        purse account; and15            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 16        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund. Moneys 17        deposited into the Illinois Colt Stakes Purse 18        Distribution Fund pursuant to this subparagraph (B) 19        shall be paid to Illinois conceived and foaled 20        thoroughbred breeders' programs and to thoroughbred 21        purses for races conducted at any county fairgrounds 22        for Illinois conceived and foaled horses at the 23        discretion of the Department of Agriculture, with the 24        advice and assistance of the Illinois Thoroughbred 25        Breeders Fund Advisory Board. The moneys deposited 26        into the Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund   10400SB1473sam001- 37 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1        pursuant to this subparagraph (B) shall be deposited 2        within 2 weeks after the day they were generated, 3        shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other 4        moneys paid to thoroughbred purses under this Act, and 5        shall not be commingled with other moneys deposited 6        into that Fund.7        (8) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the 8    contrary, an organization licensee from a track located in 9    a county with a population in excess of 230,000 and that 10    borders the Mississippi River and its affiliated non-host 11    licensees shall not be entitled to share in any retention 12    generated on racing, inter-track wagering, or simulcast 13    wagering at any other Illinois wagering facility.14        (8.1) Notwithstanding any provisions in this Act to 15    the contrary, if 2 organization licensees are conducting 16    standardbred race meetings concurrently between the hours 17    of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m., after payment of all 18    applicable State and local taxes and interstate commission 19    fees, the remainder of the amount retained from simulcast 20    wagering otherwise attributable to the host track and to 21    host track purses shall be split daily between the 2 22    organization licensees and the purses at the tracks of the 23    2 organization licensees, respectively, based on each 24    organization licensee's share of the total live handle for 25    that day, provided that this provision shall not apply to 26    any non-host licensee that derives its license from a   10400SB1473sam001- 38 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    track located in a county with a population in excess of 2    230,000 and that borders the Mississippi River.3        (9) (Blank).4        (10) (Blank).5        (11) (Blank).6        (12) The Board shall have authority to compel all host 7    tracks to receive the simulcast of any or all races 8    conducted at the Springfield or DuQuoin State fairgrounds 9    and include all such races as part of their simulcast 10    programs.11        (13) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, 12    in the event that the total Illinois pari-mutuel handle on 13    Illinois horse races at all wagering facilities in any 14    calendar year is less than 75% of the total Illinois 15    pari-mutuel handle on Illinois horse races at all such 16    wagering facilities for calendar year 1994, then each 17    wagering facility that has an annual total Illinois 18    pari-mutuel handle on Illinois horse races that is less 19    than 75% of the total Illinois pari-mutuel handle on 20    Illinois horse races at such wagering facility for 21    calendar year 1994, shall be permitted to receive, from 22    any amount otherwise payable to the purse account at the 23    race track with which the wagering facility is affiliated 24    in the succeeding calendar year, an amount equal to 2% of 25    the differential in total Illinois pari-mutuel handle on 26    Illinois horse races at the wagering facility between that   10400SB1473sam001- 39 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    calendar year in question and 1994 provided, however, that 2    a wagering facility shall not be entitled to any such 3    payment until the Board certifies in writing to the 4    wagering facility the amount to which the wagering 5    facility is entitled and a schedule for payment of the 6    amount to the wagering facility, based on: (i) the racing 7    dates awarded to the race track affiliated with the 8    wagering facility during the succeeding year; (ii) the 9    sums available or anticipated to be available in the purse 10    account of the race track affiliated with the wagering 11    facility for purses during the succeeding year; and (iii) 12    the need to ensure reasonable purse levels during the 13    payment period. The Board's certification shall be 14    provided no later than January 31 of the succeeding year. 15    In the event a wagering facility entitled to a payment 16    under this paragraph (13) is affiliated with a race track 17    that maintains purse accounts for both standardbred and 18    thoroughbred racing, the amount to be paid to the wagering 19    facility shall be divided between each purse account pro 20    rata, based on the amount of Illinois handle on Illinois 21    standardbred and thoroughbred racing respectively at the 22    wagering facility during the previous calendar year. 23    Annually, the General Assembly shall appropriate 24    sufficient funds from the General Revenue Fund to the 25    Department of Agriculture for payment into the 26    thoroughbred and standardbred horse racing purse accounts   10400SB1473sam001- 40 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    at Illinois pari-mutuel tracks. The amount paid to each 2    purse account shall be the amount certified by the 3    Illinois Racing Board in January to be transferred from 4    each account to each eligible racing facility in 5    accordance with the provisions of this Section. Beginning 6    in the calendar year in which an organization licensee 7    that is eligible to receive payment under this paragraph 8    (13) begins to receive funds from gaming pursuant to an 9    organization gaming license issued under the Illinois 10    Gambling Act, the amount of the payment due to all 11    wagering facilities licensed under that organization 12    licensee under this paragraph (13) shall be the amount 13    certified by the Board in January of that year. An 14    organization licensee and its related wagering facilities 15    shall no longer be able to receive payments under this 16    paragraph (13) beginning in the year subsequent to the 17    first year in which the organization licensee begins to 18    receive funds from gaming pursuant to an organization 19    gaming license issued under the Illinois Gambling Act.20    (h) The Board may approve and license the conduct of 21inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering by inter-track 22wagering licensees and inter-track wagering location licensees 23subject to the following terms and conditions:24        (1) Any person licensed to conduct a race meeting (i) 25    at a track where 60 or more days of racing were conducted 26    during the immediately preceding calendar year or where   10400SB1473sam001- 41 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    over the 5 immediately preceding calendar years an average 2    of 30 or more days of racing were conducted annually may be 3    issued an inter-track wagering license; (ii) at a track 4    located in a county that is bounded by the Mississippi 5    River, which has a population of less than 150,000 6    according to the 1990 decennial census, and an average of 7    at least 60 days of racing per year between 1985 and 1993 8    may be issued an inter-track wagering license; (iii) at a 9    track awarded standardbred racing dates; or (iv) at a 10    track located in Madison County that conducted at least 11    100 days of live racing during the immediately preceding 12    calendar year may be issued an inter-track wagering 13    license, unless a lesser schedule of live racing is the 14    result of (A) weather, unsafe track conditions, or other 15    acts of God; (B) an agreement between the organization 16    licensee and the associations representing the largest 17    number of owners, trainers, jockeys, or standardbred 18    drivers who race horses at that organization licensee's 19    racing meeting; or (C) a finding by the Board of 20    extraordinary circumstances and that it was in the best 21    interest of the public and the sport to conduct fewer than 22    100 days of live racing. Any such person having operating 23    control of the racing facility may receive inter-track 24    wagering location licenses. An eligible race track located 25    in a county that has a population of more than 230,000 and 26    that is bounded by the Mississippi River may establish up   10400SB1473sam001- 42 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    to 18 9 inter-track wagering locations, an eligible race 2    track located in Stickney Township in Cook County may 3    establish up to 16 inter-track wagering locations, and an 4    eligible race track located in Palatine Township in Cook 5    County may establish up to 18 inter-track wagering 6    locations.

If found to be in 20    compliance with the Act and rules and regulations of the 21    Board, the Board may then issue a license to conduct 22    inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering to such 23    applicant. All such applications shall be acted upon by 24    the Board at a meeting to be held on such date as may be 25    fixed by the Board.26        (3) In granting licenses to conduct inter-track   10400SB1473sam001- 43 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    wagering and simulcast wagering, the Board shall give due 2    consideration to the best interests of the public, of 3    horse racing, and of maximizing revenue to the State.4        (4) Prior to the issuance of a license to conduct 5    inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering, the applicant 6    shall file with the Board a bond payable to the State of 7    Illinois in the sum of $50,000, executed by the applicant 8    and a surety company or companies authorized to do 9    business in this State, and conditioned upon (i) the 10    payment by the licensee of all taxes due under Section 27 11    or 27.1 and any other monies due and payable under this 12    Act, and (ii) distribution by the licensee, upon 13    presentation of the winning ticket or tickets, of all sums 14    payable to the patrons of pari-mutuel pools.15        (5) Each license to conduct inter-track wagering and 16    simulcast wagering shall specify the person to whom it is 17    issued, the dates on which such wagering is permitted, and 18    the track or location where the wagering is to be 19    conducted.20        (6) All wagering under such license is subject to this 21    Act and to the rules and regulations from time to time 22    prescribed by the Board, and every such license issued by 23    the Board shall contain a recital to that effect.24        (7) An inter-track wagering licensee or inter-track 25    wagering location licensee may accept wagers at the track 26    or location where it is licensed, or as otherwise provided   10400SB1473sam001- 44 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    under this Act.2        (8) Inter-track wagering or simulcast wagering shall 3    not be conducted at any track less than 4 miles from a 4    track at which a racing meeting is in progress.5        (8.1) Inter-track wagering location licensees who 6    derive their licenses from a particular organization 7    licensee shall conduct inter-track wagering and simulcast 8    wagering only at locations that are within 160 miles of 9    that race track where the particular organization licensee 10    is licensed to conduct racing. However, inter-track 11    wagering and simulcast wagering shall not be conducted by 12    those licensees at any location within 5 miles of any race 13    track at which a horse race meeting has been licensed in 14    the current year, unless the person having operating 15    control of such race track has given its written consent 16    to such inter-track wagering location licensees, which 17    consent must be filed with the Board at or prior to the 18    time application is made. In the case of any inter-track 19    wagering location licensee initially licensed after 20    December 31, 2013, inter-track wagering and simulcast 21    wagering shall not be conducted by those inter-track 22    wagering location licensees that are located outside the 23    City of Chicago at any location within 8 miles of any race 24    track at which a horse race meeting has been licensed in 25    the current year, unless the person having operating 26    control of such race track has given its written consent   10400SB1473sam001- 45 -LRB104 09432 LNS 26474 a1    to such inter-track wagering location licensees, which 2    consent must be filed with the Board at or prior to the 3    time application is made. 4        (8.2) Inter-track wagering or simulcast wagering shall 5    not be conducted by an inter-track wagering location 6    licensee at any location within 100 feet of an existing 7    church, an existing elementary or secondary public school, 8    or an existing elementary or secondary private school 9    registered with or recognized by the State Board of 10    Education.

However, inter-track wagering 15    or simulcast wagering may be conducted at a site within 16    100 feet of a church or school if such church or school has 17    been erected or established after the Board issues the 18    original inter-track wagering location license at the site 19    in question. Inter-track wagering location licensees may 20    conduct inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering only 21    in areas that are zoned for commercial or manufacturing 22    purposes or in areas for which a special use has been 23    approved by the local zoning authority.

However, 4    inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering may be 5    conducted at a site if such ordinance or resolution is 6    enacted after the Board licenses the original inter-track 7    wagering location licensee for the site in question.8        (9) (Blank).9        (10) An inter-track wagering licensee or an 10    inter-track wagering location licensee may retain, subject 11    to the payment of the privilege taxes and the purses, an 12    amount not to exceed 17% of all money wagered.
