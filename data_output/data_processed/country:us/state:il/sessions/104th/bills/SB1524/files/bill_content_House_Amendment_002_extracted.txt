Any oral, written, or sign language statement of a 4minor made as a result of an interrogation under this 5subsection shall be presumed to be inadmissible as evidence 6against the minor in any criminal proceeding or juvenile court 7proceeding, unless the recording is substantially accurate and 8not intentionally altered.9    (c) Every electronic recording made under this Section 10must be preserved until such time as the minor's adjudication 11for any offense relating to the statement is final and all 12direct and habeas corpus appeals are exhausted, or the 13prosecution of such offenses is barred by law.14    (d) If the court finds, by a preponderance of the 15evidence, that the minor was subjected to a custodial 16interrogation in violation of this Section, then any 17statements made by the minor during or following that 18non-recorded custodial interrogation, even if otherwise in 19compliance with this Section, are presumed to be inadmissible 20in any criminal proceeding or juvenile court proceeding 21against the minor except for the purposes of impeachment. 22    (e) Nothing in this Section precludes the admission (i) of 23a statement made by the minor in open court in any criminal 24proceeding or juvenile court proceeding, before a grand jury, 25or at a preliminary hearing, (ii) of a statement made during a 26custodial interrogation that was not recorded as required by   10400SB1524ham002- 10 -LRB104 08042 JDS 26966 a1this Section because electronic recording was not feasible, 2(iii) of a voluntary statement, whether or not the result of a 3custodial interrogation, that has a bearing on the credibility 4of the accused as a witness, (iv) of a spontaneous statement 5that is not made in response to a question, (v) of a statement 6made after questioning that is routinely asked during the 7processing of the arrest of the suspect, (vi) of a statement 8made during a custodial interrogation by a suspect who 9requests, prior to making the statement, to respond to the 10interrogator's questions only if an electronic recording is 11not made of the statement, provided that an electronic 12recording is made of the statement of agreeing to respond to 13the interrogator's question, only if a recording is not made 14of the statement, (vii) of a statement made during a custodial 15interrogation that is conducted out-of-state, (viii) of a 16statement given in violation of subsection (b) at a time when 17the interrogators are unaware that a death has in fact 18occurred, (ix) (blank), or (x) of any other statement that may 19be admissible under law.
