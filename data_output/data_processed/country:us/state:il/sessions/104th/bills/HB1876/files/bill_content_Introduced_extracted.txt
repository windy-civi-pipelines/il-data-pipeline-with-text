Short title. This Act may be cited as the Carpet 5Stewardship Act. 6    Section 5. Findings and purpose. The General Assembly 7finds that:8        (1) Based on data contained in the Illinois Commodity 9    Waste Generation and Characterization Study, commissioned 10    in 2014 by the Illinois Department of Commerce and 11    Economic Opportunity, approximately 229,000 tons of carpet 12    and carpet padding are landfilled each year, 1.5% of the 13    total waste landfilled in this State.14        (2) Old carpet and padding are currently being 15    recovered in this State at a carpet recovery rate 16    estimated to be less than 1%, compared to a 29% carpet 17    recovery rate for the second quarter in 2021 in 18    California, which has enacted Extended Producer 19    Responsibility legislation for carpet.20        (3) Carpet recovery can be significantly expanded by 21    utilizing an Extended Producer Responsibility approach 22    which will lead to job creation through the collection, 23    processing, and marketing of old carpet and padding. In   HB1876- 2 -LRB104 09324 BDA 19382 b1    California, this approach has created approximately 150 2    direct jobs.3        (4) According to the U.S. Environmental Protection 4    Agency, the carpet recovery of old carpet has a positive 5    impact on the reduction of greenhouse gases when compared 6    to the landfilling or incineration of old carpet, which 7    increases the generation of greenhouse gases.8        (5) Due to the detrimental environmental impacts of 9    improper management of old carpet and padding at the end 10    of its intended use, it is the purpose of this Act to 11    utilize a market share liability approach to recover the 12    funding necessary to implement the clearinghouse program 13    required by this Act. 14    Section 10.

The General Assembly 7finds that:8        (1) Based on data contained in the Illinois Commodity 9    Waste Generation and Characterization Study, commissioned 10    in 2014 by the Illinois Department of Commerce and 11    Economic Opportunity, approximately 229,000 tons of carpet 12    and carpet padding are landfilled each year, 1.5% of the 13    total waste landfilled in this State.14        (2) Old carpet and padding are currently being 15    recovered in this State at a carpet recovery rate 16    estimated to be less than 1%, compared to a 29% carpet 17    recovery rate for the second quarter in 2021 in 18    California, which has enacted Extended Producer 19    Responsibility legislation for carpet.20        (3) Carpet recovery can be significantly expanded by 21    utilizing an Extended Producer Responsibility approach 22    which will lead to job creation through the collection, 23    processing, and marketing of old carpet and padding. In   HB1876- 2 -LRB104 09324 BDA 19382 b1    California, this approach has created approximately 150 2    direct jobs.3        (4) According to the U.S. Environmental Protection 4    Agency, the carpet recovery of old carpet has a positive 5    impact on the reduction of greenhouse gases when compared 6    to the landfilling or incineration of old carpet, which 7    increases the generation of greenhouse gases.8        (5) Due to the detrimental environmental impacts of 9    improper management of old carpet and padding at the end 10    of its intended use, it is the purpose of this Act to 11    utilize a market share liability approach to recover the 12    funding necessary to implement the clearinghouse program 13    required by this Act. 14    Section 10.
