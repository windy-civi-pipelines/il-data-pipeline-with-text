The Consumer Installment Loan Act is amended by 5changing Sections 15, 15d, 16, 17, and 17.5 as follows: 6    (205 ILCS 670/15)  (from Ch. 17, par. 5415)7    Sec. 15. Charges permitted. 8    (a) Every licensee may lend a principal amount not 9exceeding $40,000 and may charge, contract for and receive 10thereon an annual percentage rate of no more than 36% plus the 11Federal Funds Rate, subject to the provisions of this Act. For 12purposes of this Section, the annual percentage rate shall be 13calculated as such rate is calculated using the system for 14calculating the annual percentage rate under the federal Truth 15in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq., and its implementing 16regulations under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.1 et seq. As used 17in this subsection, "Federal Funds Rate" means the rate 18published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 19System in its Statistical Release H.15 Selected Interest Rates 20in effect on the first day of the month immediately preceding 21the month during which the loan is consummated. If the Federal 22Reserve System stops publication of the Federal Funds Rate, 23the Director of the Division of Financial Institutions shall   HB3455- 2 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1designate a substantially equivalent index a military annual 2percentage rate under Section 232.4 of Title 32 of the Code of 3Federal Regulations as in effect on the effective date of this 4amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly.5    (b) For purpose of this Section, the following terms shall 6have the meanings ascribed herein.7    "Applicable interest" for a precomputed loan contract 8means the amount of interest attributable to each monthly 9installment period. It is computed as if each installment 10period were one month and any interest charged for extending 11the first installment period beyond one month is ignored. The 12applicable interest for any monthly installment period is that 13portion of the precomputed interest that bears the same ratio 14to the total precomputed interest as the balances scheduled to 15be outstanding during that month bear to the sum of all 16scheduled monthly outstanding balances in the original 17contract. 18    "Interest-bearing loan" means a loan in which the debt is 19expressed as a principal amount plus interest charged on 20actual unpaid principal balances for the time actually 21outstanding.22    "Precomputed loan" means a loan in which the debt is 23expressed as the sum of the original principal amount plus 24interest computed actuarially in advance, assuming all 25payments will be made when scheduled.26    "Substantially equal installment" includes a last   HB3455- 3 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1regularly scheduled payment that may be less than, but not 2more than 5% larger than, the previous scheduled payment 3according to a disclosed payment schedule agreed to by the 4parties.5    (c) Loans may be interest-bearing or precomputed.6    (d) To compute time for either interest-bearing or 7precomputed loans for the calculation of interest and other 8purposes, a month shall be a calendar month and a day shall be 9considered 1/30th of a month when calculation is made for a 10fraction of a month. A month shall be 1/12th of a year. A 11calendar month is that period from a given date in one month to 12the same numbered date in the following month, and if there is 13no same numbered date, to the last day of the following month. 14When a period of time includes a month and a fraction of a 15month, the fraction of the month is considered to follow the 16whole month. In the alternative, for interest-bearing loans, 17the licensee may charge interest at the rate of 1/365th of the 18agreed annual rate for each day actually elapsed.19    (d-5) No licensee or other person may condition an 20extension of credit to a consumer on the consumer's repayment 21by preauthorized electronic fund transfers. Payment options, 22including, but not limited to, electronic fund transfers and 23Automatic Clearing House (ACH) transactions may be offered to 24consumers as a choice and method of payment chosen by the 25consumer. 26    (e) With respect to interest-bearing loans:  HB3455- 4 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1        (1) Interest shall be computed on unpaid principal 2    balances outstanding from time to time, for the time 3    outstanding, until fully paid. Each payment shall be 4    applied first to the accumulated interest and the 5    remainder of the payment applied to the unpaid principal 6    balance; provided however, that if the amount of the 7    payment is insufficient to pay the accumulated interest, 8    the unpaid interest continues to accumulate to be paid 9    from the proceeds of subsequent payments and is not added 10    to the principal balance.11        (2) Interest shall not be payable in advance or 12    compounded. However, if part or all of the consideration 13    for a new loan contract is the unpaid principal balance of 14    a prior loan, then the principal amount payable under the 15    new loan contract may include any unpaid interest which 16    has accrued. The unpaid principal balance of a precomputed 17    loan is the balance due after refund or credit of unearned 18    interest as provided in paragraph (f), clause (3). The 19    resulting loan contract shall be deemed a new and separate 20    loan transaction for all purposes.21        (3) Loans must be fully amortizing and be repayable in 22    substantially equal and consecutive weekly, biweekly, 23    semimonthly, or monthly installments. Notwithstanding this 24    requirement, rates may vary according to an index that is 25    independently verifiable and beyond the control of the 26    licensee.  HB3455- 5 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1        (4) The lender or creditor may, if the contract 2    provides, collect a delinquency or collection charge on 3    each installment in default for a period of not less than 4    10 days in an amount not exceeding 5% of the installment on 5    installments in excess of $200, or $10 on installments of 6    $200 or less, but only one delinquency and collection 7    charge may be collected on any installment regardless of 8    the period during which it remains in default.9    (f) With respect to precomputed loans:10        (1) Loans shall be repayable in substantially equal 11    and consecutive weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly 12    installments of principal and interest combined, except 13    that the first installment period may be longer than one 14    month by not more than 15 days, and the first installment 15    payment amount may be larger than the remaining payments 16    by the amount of interest charged for the extra days; and 17    provided further that monthly installment payment dates 18    may be omitted to accommodate borrowers with seasonal 19    income.20        (2) Payments may be applied to the combined total of 21    principal and precomputed interest until the loan is fully 22    paid. Payments shall be applied in the order in which they 23    become due, except that any insurance proceeds received as 24    a result of any claim made on any insurance, unless 25    sufficient to prepay the contract in full, may be applied 26    to the unpaid installments of the total of payments in   HB3455- 6 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1    inverse order.2        (3) When any loan contract is paid in full by cash, 3    renewal or refinancing, or a new loan, one month or more 4    before the final installment due date, a licensee shall 5    refund or credit the obligor with the total of the 6    applicable interest for all fully unexpired installment 7    periods, as originally scheduled or as deferred, which 8    follow the day of prepayment; provided, if the prepayment 9    occurs prior to the first installment due date, the 10    licensee may retain 1/30 of the applicable interest for a 11    first installment period of one month for each day from 12    the date of the loan to the date of prepayment, and shall 13    refund or credit the obligor with the balance of the total 14    interest contracted for. If the maturity of the loan is 15    accelerated for any reason and judgment is entered, the 16    licensee shall credit the borrower with the same refund as 17    if prepayment in full had been made on the date the 18    judgment is entered.19        (4) The lender or creditor may, if the contract 20    provides, collect a delinquency or collection charge on 21    each installment in default for a period of not less than 22    10 days in an amount not exceeding 5% of the installment on 23    installments in excess of $200, or $10 on installments of 24    $200 or less, but only one delinquency or collection 25    charge may be collected on any installment regardless of 26    the period during which it remains in default.  HB3455- 7 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1        (5) If the parties agree in writing, either in the 2    loan contract or in a subsequent agreement, to a deferment 3    of wholly unpaid installments, a licensee may grant a 4    deferment and may collect a deferment charge as provided 5    in this Section. A deferment postpones the scheduled due 6    date of the earliest unpaid installment and all subsequent 7    installments as originally scheduled, or as previously 8    deferred, for a period equal to the deferment period. The 9    deferment period is that period during which no 10    installment is scheduled to be paid by reason of the 11    deferment. The deferment charge for a one-month period may 12    not exceed the applicable interest for the installment 13    period immediately following the due date of the last 14    undeferred payment. A proportionate charge may be made for 15    deferment for periods of more or less than one month. A 16    deferment charge is earned pro rata during the deferment 17    period and is fully earned on the last day of the deferment 18    period. Should a loan be prepaid in full during a 19    deferment period, the licensee shall credit to the obligor 20    a refund of the unearned deferment charge in addition to 21    any other refund or credit made for prepayment of the loan 22    in full.23        (6) If 2 or more installments are delinquent one full 24    month or more on any due date, and if the contract so 25    provides, the licensee may reduce the unpaid balance by 26    the refund credit which would be required for prepayment   HB3455- 8 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1    in full on the due date of the most recent maturing 2    installment in default. Thereafter, and in lieu of any 3    other default or deferment charges, the agreed rate of 4    interest may be charged on the unpaid balance until fully 5    paid.6        (7) Fifteen days after the final installment as 7    originally scheduled or deferred, the licensee, for any 8    loan contract which has not previously been converted to 9    interest-bearing under paragraph (f), clause (6), may 10    compute and charge interest on any balance remaining 11    unpaid, including unpaid default or deferment charges, at 12    the agreed rate of interest until fully paid. At the time 13    of payment of said final installment, the licensee shall 14    give notice to the obligor stating any amounts unpaid.15    (g) A licensee shall not charge, impose, or receive any 16penalty for the prepayment of a loan. 17(Source: P.A. 103-1014, eff. 8-9-24.) 18    (205 ILCS 670/15d)  (from Ch. 17, par. 5419)19    Sec. 15d. Extra charges prohibited; exceptions. 20    (a) No amount in addition to the charges authorized by 21this Act shall be directly or indirectly charged, contracted 22for, or received, except (1) lawful fees paid to any public 23officer or agency to record, file or release security; (2) (i) 24costs and disbursements actually incurred in connection with a 25real estate loan, for any title insurance, title examination,   HB3455- 9 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1abstract of title, survey, or appraisal, or paid to a trustee 2in connection with a trust deed, and (ii) in connection with a 3real estate loan those charges authorized by Section 4.1a of 4the Interest Act, whether called "points" or otherwise, which 5charges are imposed as a condition for making the loan and are 6not refundable in the event of prepayment of the loan; (3) 7costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorney's fees, 8incurred in legal proceedings to collect a loan or to realize 9on a security after default; and (4) an amount not exceeding 10$25, plus any actual expenses incurred in connection with a 11check or draft that is not honored because of insufficient or 12uncollected funds or because no such account exists; and (5) 13an administrative fee of up to $75 on loans up to $5,000 as 14described in subsection (b). This Section does not prohibit 15the receipt of a commission, dividend, charge, or other 16benefit by the licensee or by an employee, affiliate, or 17associate of the licensee from the insurance permitted by 18Sections 15a and 15b of this Act or from insurance in lieu of 19perfecting a security interest provided that the premiums for 20such insurance do not exceed the fees that otherwise could be 21contracted for by the licensee under this Section. Obtaining 22any of the items referred to in clause (i) of item (2) of this 23Section through the licensee or from any person specified by 24the licensee shall not be a condition precedent to the 25granting of the loan.26    (b) A licensee may contract for and receive an   HB3455- 10 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1administrative fee that shall be fully earned immediately upon 2making the loan with a principal amount of not more than 3$5,000, excluding the administrative fee, at a rate not to 4exceed $75. No administrative fee may be contracted for or 5received in connection with the refinancing of a loan unless 6at least one year has elapsed since the receipt of a previous 7administrative fee paid by the borrower. Only one 8administrative fee may be contracted for or received after the 9consummation of the loan. An administrative fee shall not be 10considered as a penalty for the prepayment of a loan.11(Source: P.A. 101-658, eff. 3-23-21.) 12    (205 ILCS 670/16)  (from Ch. 17, par. 5420)13    Sec. 16.

The Consumer Installment Loan Act is amended by 5changing Sections 15, 15d, 16, 17, and 17.5 as follows: 6    (205 ILCS 670/15)  (from Ch. 17, par. 5415)7    Sec. 15. Charges permitted. 8    (a) Every licensee may lend a principal amount not 9exceeding $40,000 and may charge, contract for and receive 10thereon an annual percentage rate of no more than 36% plus the 11Federal Funds Rate, subject to the provisions of this Act. For 12purposes of this Section, the annual percentage rate shall be 13calculated as such rate is calculated using the system for 14calculating the annual percentage rate under the federal Truth 15in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq., and its implementing 16regulations under Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.1 et seq. As used 17in this subsection, "Federal Funds Rate" means the rate 18published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 19System in its Statistical Release H.15 Selected Interest Rates 20in effect on the first day of the month immediately preceding 21the month during which the loan is consummated. If the Federal 22Reserve System stops publication of the Federal Funds Rate, 23the Director of the Division of Financial Institutions shall   HB3455- 2 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1designate a substantially equivalent index a military annual 2percentage rate under Section 232.4 of Title 32 of the Code of 3Federal Regulations as in effect on the effective date of this 4amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly.5    (b) For purpose of this Section, the following terms shall 6have the meanings ascribed herein.7    "Applicable interest" for a precomputed loan contract 8means the amount of interest attributable to each monthly 9installment period. It is computed as if each installment 10period were one month and any interest charged for extending 11the first installment period beyond one month is ignored. The 12applicable interest for any monthly installment period is that 13portion of the precomputed interest that bears the same ratio 14to the total precomputed interest as the balances scheduled to 15be outstanding during that month bear to the sum of all 16scheduled monthly outstanding balances in the original 17contract. 18    "Interest-bearing loan" means a loan in which the debt is 19expressed as a principal amount plus interest charged on 20actual unpaid principal balances for the time actually 21outstanding.22    "Precomputed loan" means a loan in which the debt is 23expressed as the sum of the original principal amount plus 24interest computed actuarially in advance, assuming all 25payments will be made when scheduled.26    "Substantially equal installment" includes a last   HB3455- 3 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1regularly scheduled payment that may be less than, but not 2more than 5% larger than, the previous scheduled payment 3according to a disclosed payment schedule agreed to by the 4parties.5    (c) Loans may be interest-bearing or precomputed.6    (d) To compute time for either interest-bearing or 7precomputed loans for the calculation of interest and other 8purposes, a month shall be a calendar month and a day shall be 9considered 1/30th of a month when calculation is made for a 10fraction of a month. A month shall be 1/12th of a year. A 11calendar month is that period from a given date in one month to 12the same numbered date in the following month, and if there is 13no same numbered date, to the last day of the following month. 14When a period of time includes a month and a fraction of a 15month, the fraction of the month is considered to follow the 16whole month. In the alternative, for interest-bearing loans, 17the licensee may charge interest at the rate of 1/365th of the 18agreed annual rate for each day actually elapsed.19    (d-5) No licensee or other person may condition an 20extension of credit to a consumer on the consumer's repayment 21by preauthorized electronic fund transfers. Payment options, 22including, but not limited to, electronic fund transfers and 23Automatic Clearing House (ACH) transactions may be offered to 24consumers as a choice and method of payment chosen by the 25consumer. 26    (e) With respect to interest-bearing loans:  HB3455- 4 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1        (1) Interest shall be computed on unpaid principal 2    balances outstanding from time to time, for the time 3    outstanding, until fully paid. Each payment shall be 4    applied first to the accumulated interest and the 5    remainder of the payment applied to the unpaid principal 6    balance; provided however, that if the amount of the 7    payment is insufficient to pay the accumulated interest, 8    the unpaid interest continues to accumulate to be paid 9    from the proceeds of subsequent payments and is not added 10    to the principal balance.11        (2) Interest shall not be payable in advance or 12    compounded. However, if part or all of the consideration 13    for a new loan contract is the unpaid principal balance of 14    a prior loan, then the principal amount payable under the 15    new loan contract may include any unpaid interest which 16    has accrued. The unpaid principal balance of a precomputed 17    loan is the balance due after refund or credit of unearned 18    interest as provided in paragraph (f), clause (3). The 19    resulting loan contract shall be deemed a new and separate 20    loan transaction for all purposes.21        (3) Loans must be fully amortizing and be repayable in 22    substantially equal and consecutive weekly, biweekly, 23    semimonthly, or monthly installments. Notwithstanding this 24    requirement, rates may vary according to an index that is 25    independently verifiable and beyond the control of the 26    licensee.  HB3455- 5 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1        (4) The lender or creditor may, if the contract 2    provides, collect a delinquency or collection charge on 3    each installment in default for a period of not less than 4    10 days in an amount not exceeding 5% of the installment on 5    installments in excess of $200, or $10 on installments of 6    $200 or less, but only one delinquency and collection 7    charge may be collected on any installment regardless of 8    the period during which it remains in default.9    (f) With respect to precomputed loans:10        (1) Loans shall be repayable in substantially equal 11    and consecutive weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly 12    installments of principal and interest combined, except 13    that the first installment period may be longer than one 14    month by not more than 15 days, and the first installment 15    payment amount may be larger than the remaining payments 16    by the amount of interest charged for the extra days; and 17    provided further that monthly installment payment dates 18    may be omitted to accommodate borrowers with seasonal 19    income.20        (2) Payments may be applied to the combined total of 21    principal and precomputed interest until the loan is fully 22    paid. Payments shall be applied in the order in which they 23    become due, except that any insurance proceeds received as 24    a result of any claim made on any insurance, unless 25    sufficient to prepay the contract in full, may be applied 26    to the unpaid installments of the total of payments in   HB3455- 6 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1    inverse order.2        (3) When any loan contract is paid in full by cash, 3    renewal or refinancing, or a new loan, one month or more 4    before the final installment due date, a licensee shall 5    refund or credit the obligor with the total of the 6    applicable interest for all fully unexpired installment 7    periods, as originally scheduled or as deferred, which 8    follow the day of prepayment; provided, if the prepayment 9    occurs prior to the first installment due date, the 10    licensee may retain 1/30 of the applicable interest for a 11    first installment period of one month for each day from 12    the date of the loan to the date of prepayment, and shall 13    refund or credit the obligor with the balance of the total 14    interest contracted for. If the maturity of the loan is 15    accelerated for any reason and judgment is entered, the 16    licensee shall credit the borrower with the same refund as 17    if prepayment in full had been made on the date the 18    judgment is entered.19        (4) The lender or creditor may, if the contract 20    provides, collect a delinquency or collection charge on 21    each installment in default for a period of not less than 22    10 days in an amount not exceeding 5% of the installment on 23    installments in excess of $200, or $10 on installments of 24    $200 or less, but only one delinquency or collection 25    charge may be collected on any installment regardless of 26    the period during which it remains in default.  HB3455- 7 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1        (5) If the parties agree in writing, either in the 2    loan contract or in a subsequent agreement, to a deferment 3    of wholly unpaid installments, a licensee may grant a 4    deferment and may collect a deferment charge as provided 5    in this Section. A deferment postpones the scheduled due 6    date of the earliest unpaid installment and all subsequent 7    installments as originally scheduled, or as previously 8    deferred, for a period equal to the deferment period. The 9    deferment period is that period during which no 10    installment is scheduled to be paid by reason of the 11    deferment. The deferment charge for a one-month period may 12    not exceed the applicable interest for the installment 13    period immediately following the due date of the last 14    undeferred payment. A proportionate charge may be made for 15    deferment for periods of more or less than one month. A 16    deferment charge is earned pro rata during the deferment 17    period and is fully earned on the last day of the deferment 18    period. Should a loan be prepaid in full during a 19    deferment period, the licensee shall credit to the obligor 20    a refund of the unearned deferment charge in addition to 21    any other refund or credit made for prepayment of the loan 22    in full.23        (6) If 2 or more installments are delinquent one full 24    month or more on any due date, and if the contract so 25    provides, the licensee may reduce the unpaid balance by 26    the refund credit which would be required for prepayment   HB3455- 8 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1    in full on the due date of the most recent maturing 2    installment in default. Thereafter, and in lieu of any 3    other default or deferment charges, the agreed rate of 4    interest may be charged on the unpaid balance until fully 5    paid.6        (7) Fifteen days after the final installment as 7    originally scheduled or deferred, the licensee, for any 8    loan contract which has not previously been converted to 9    interest-bearing under paragraph (f), clause (6), may 10    compute and charge interest on any balance remaining 11    unpaid, including unpaid default or deferment charges, at 12    the agreed rate of interest until fully paid. At the time 13    of payment of said final installment, the licensee shall 14    give notice to the obligor stating any amounts unpaid.15    (g) A licensee shall not charge, impose, or receive any 16penalty for the prepayment of a loan. 17(Source: P.A. 103-1014, eff. 8-9-24.) 18    (205 ILCS 670/15d)  (from Ch. 17, par. 5419)19    Sec. 15d. Extra charges prohibited; exceptions. 20    (a) No amount in addition to the charges authorized by 21this Act shall be directly or indirectly charged, contracted 22for, or received, except (1) lawful fees paid to any public 23officer or agency to record, file or release security; (2) (i) 24costs and disbursements actually incurred in connection with a 25real estate loan, for any title insurance, title examination,   HB3455- 9 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1abstract of title, survey, or appraisal, or paid to a trustee 2in connection with a trust deed, and (ii) in connection with a 3real estate loan those charges authorized by Section 4.1a of 4the Interest Act, whether called "points" or otherwise, which 5charges are imposed as a condition for making the loan and are 6not refundable in the event of prepayment of the loan; (3) 7costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorney's fees, 8incurred in legal proceedings to collect a loan or to realize 9on a security after default; and (4) an amount not exceeding 10$25, plus any actual expenses incurred in connection with a 11check or draft that is not honored because of insufficient or 12uncollected funds or because no such account exists; and (5) 13an administrative fee of up to $75 on loans up to $5,000 as 14described in subsection (b). This Section does not prohibit 15the receipt of a commission, dividend, charge, or other 16benefit by the licensee or by an employee, affiliate, or 17associate of the licensee from the insurance permitted by 18Sections 15a and 15b of this Act or from insurance in lieu of 19perfecting a security interest provided that the premiums for 20such insurance do not exceed the fees that otherwise could be 21contracted for by the licensee under this Section. Obtaining 22any of the items referred to in clause (i) of item (2) of this 23Section through the licensee or from any person specified by 24the licensee shall not be a condition precedent to the 25granting of the loan.26    (b) A licensee may contract for and receive an   HB3455- 10 -LRB104 07584 SPS 17628 b1administrative fee that shall be fully earned immediately upon 2making the loan with a principal amount of not more than 3$5,000, excluding the administrative fee, at a rate not to 4exceed $75. No administrative fee may be contracted for or 5received in connection with the refinancing of a loan unless 6at least one year has elapsed since the receipt of a previous 7administrative fee paid by the borrower. Only one 8administrative fee may be contracted for or received after the 9consummation of the loan. An administrative fee shall not be 10considered as a penalty for the prepayment of a loan.11(Source: P.A. 101-658, eff. 3-23-21.) 12    (205 ILCS 670/16)  (from Ch. 17, par. 5420)13    Sec. 16.
