Short title. This Act may be cited as the Small 5Business Financing Transparency Act. 6    Section 2. Purpose and construction. The purpose of this 7Act is to protect small businesses. This Act shall be 8liberally construed to effectuate its purpose. 9    Section 5. Definitions. As used in this Act:10    "Advance fee" means any consideration that is charged or 11collected by a broker prior to the closing of a commercial 12financing transaction.13    "Applicant" means a person who has submitted an 14application for a registration under this Act. 15    "Broker" means any person who, for compensation or the 16expectation of compensation, obtains a commercial financing 17transaction or an offer for a commercial financing transaction 18from a third party that would, if executed, be binding upon 19that third party and communicates that offer to a business 20located in this State. The term "broker" excludes a provider, 21or any individual or entity whose compensation is not based or 22dependent on the terms of the specific commercial financing   HB3477 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 09252 BAB 19310 b1transaction obtained or offered.2    "Closed-end financing" means a closed-end extension of 3credit, secured or unsecured, that the recipient does not 4intend to use for personal, family, or household purposes. 5"Closed-end financing" includes financing with an established 6principal amount and duration.7    "Commercial financing" means open-end financing, 8closed-end financing, sales-based financing, factoring 9transaction, or other form of financing, the proceeds of which 10the recipient does not intend to use primarily for personal, 11family, or household purposes. For purposes of determining 12whether a financing is a commercial financing, the provider 13may rely on any statement of intended purposes by the 14recipient. The statement may be a separate statement signed by 15the recipient; may be contained in the financing application, 16financing agreement, or other document signed or consented to 17by the recipient; or may be provided orally by the recipient so 18long as it is documented in the recipient's application file 19by the provider. Electronic signatures and consents are valid 20for purposes of the foregoing sentence. The provider shall not 21be required to ascertain that the proceeds of a commercial 22financing are used in accordance with the recipient's 23statement of intended purposes.24    "Commercial financing facility" means a commercial 25financing agreement pursuant to which the provider reasonably 26contemplates repeated transactions with the recipient over a   HB3477 Engrossed- 3 -LRB104 09252 BAB 19310 b1period of time, and the agreement sets forth the terms and 2conditions governing the use of the facility.
