For purposes of this subparagraph, 16        the taxpayer's separate taxable income shall be 17        determined as if the election provided by Section 18        243(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code had been in 19        effect for all such years;20            (F) Cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative 21        corporation or association, the taxable income of such 22        organization determined in accordance with the 23        provisions of Section 1381 through 1388 of the 24        Internal Revenue Code, but without regard to the 25        prohibition against offsetting losses from patronage 26        activities against income from nonpatronage   HB1093- 104 -LRB104 04198 HLH 14222 b1        activities; except that a cooperative corporation or 2        association may make an election to follow its federal 3        income tax treatment of patronage losses and 4        nonpatronage losses. In the event such election is 5        made, such losses shall be computed and carried over 6        in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of Section 7        207 of this Act and apportioned by the apportionment 8        factor reported by the cooperative on its Illinois 9        income tax return filed for the taxable year in which 10        the losses are incurred.

In addition, 13        the cooperative may file an amended return or returns, 14        as allowed under this Act, to provide that the 15        election shall be effective for losses incurred or 16        carried forward for taxable years occurring prior to 17        the date of the election.

Notwithstanding any other law to the 25    contrary, if in prior years income from an asset or 26    business has been classified as business income and in a   HB1093- 106 -LRB104 04198 HLH 14222 b1    later year is demonstrated to be non-business income, then 2    all expenses, without limitation, deducted in such later 3    year and in the 2 immediately preceding taxable years 4    related to that asset or business that generated the 5    non-business income shall be added back and recaptured as 6    business income in the year of the disposition of the 7    asset or business. Such amount shall be apportioned to 8    Illinois using the greater of the apportionment fraction 9    computed for the business under Section 304 of this Act 10    for the taxable year or the average of the apportionment 11    fractions computed for the business under Section 304 of 12    this Act for the taxable year and for the 2 immediately 13    preceding taxable years.  14    (f) Valuation limitation amount.15        (1) In general. The valuation limitation amount 16    referred to in subsections (a)(2)(G), (c)(2)(I) and 17    (d)(2)(E) is an amount equal to:18            (A) The sum of the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 19        amounts (to the extent consisting of gain reportable 20        under the provisions of Section 1245 or 1250 of the 21        Internal Revenue Code) for all property in respect of 22        which such gain was reported for the taxable year; 23        plus24            (B) The lesser of (i) the sum of the pre-August 1, 25        1969 appreciation amounts (to the extent consisting of   HB1093- 107 -LRB104 04198 HLH 14222 b1        capital gain) for all property in respect of which 2        such gain was reported for federal income tax purposes 3        for the taxable year, or (ii) the net capital gain for 4        the taxable year, reduced in either case by any amount 5        of such gain included in the amount determined under 6        subsection (a)(2)(F) or (c)(2)(H).7        (2) Pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation amount.8            (A) If the fair market value of property referred 9        to in paragraph (1) was readily ascertainable on 10        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 11        amount for such property is the lesser of (i) the 12        excess of such fair market value over the taxpayer's 13        basis (for determining gain) for such property on that 14        date (determined under the Internal Revenue Code as in 15        effect on that date), or (ii) the total gain realized 16        and reportable for federal income tax purposes in 17        respect of the sale, exchange or other disposition of 18        such property.19            (B) If the fair market value of property referred 20        to in paragraph (1) was not readily ascertainable on 21        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 22        amount for such property is that amount which bears 23        the same ratio to the total gain reported in respect of 24        the property for federal income tax purposes for the 25        taxable year, as the number of full calendar months in 26        that part of the taxpayer's holding period for the   HB1093- 108 -LRB104 04198 HLH 14222 b1        property ending July 31, 1969 bears to the number of 2        full calendar months in the taxpayer's entire holding 3        period for the property.4            (C) The Department shall prescribe such 5        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the 6        purposes of this paragraph. 7    (g) Double deductions. Unless specifically provided 8otherwise, nothing in this Section shall permit the same item 9to be deducted more than once. 10    (h) Legislative intention.

The addition modification required by this 15        subparagraph shall be reduced to the extent that 16        dividends were included in base income of the unitary 17        group for the same taxable year and received by the 18        taxpayer or by a member of the taxpayer's unitary 19        business group (including amounts included in gross 20        income under Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal 21        Revenue Code and amounts included in gross income 22        under Section 78 of the Internal Revenue Code) with 23        respect to the stock of the same person to whom the 24        intangible expenses and costs were directly or 25        indirectly paid, incurred, or accrued.
