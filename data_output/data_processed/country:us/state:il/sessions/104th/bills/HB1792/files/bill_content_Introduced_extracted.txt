The individuals confirming the administration 26of required immunizations shall record as indicated on the   HB1792- 10 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1form that the immunizations were administered.2    (5) If a child does not submit proof of having had either 3the health examination or the immunization as required, then 4the child shall be examined or receive the immunization, as 5the case may be, and present proof by October 15 of the current 6school year, or by an earlier date of the current school year 7established by a school district. To establish a date before 8October 15 of the current school year for the health 9examination or immunization as required, a school district 10must give notice of the requirements of this Section 60 days 11prior to the earlier established date. If for medical reasons 12one or more of the required immunizations must be given after 13October 15 of the current school year, or after an earlier 14established date of the current school year, then the child 15shall present, by October 15, or by the earlier established 16date, a schedule for the administration of the immunizations 17and a statement of the medical reasons causing the delay, both 18the schedule and the statement being issued by the physician, 19advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, 20registered nurse, or local health department that will be 21responsible for administration of the remaining required 22immunizations. If a child does not comply by October 15, or by 23the earlier established date of the current school year, with 24the requirements of this subsection, then the local school 25authority shall exclude that child from school until such time 26as the child presents proof of having had the health   HB1792- 11 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1examination as required and presents proof of having received 2those required immunizations which are medically possible to 3receive immediately.

This 7subsection (5) does not apply to dental examinations, eye 8examinations, and the developmental screening and the social 9and emotional screening portions of the health examination. If 10the student is an out-of-state transfer student and does not 11have the proof required under this subsection (5) before 12October 15 of the current year or whatever date is set by the 13school district, then he or she may only attend classes (i) if 14he or she has proof that an appointment for the required 15vaccinations has been scheduled with a party authorized to 16submit proof of the required vaccinations. If the proof of 17vaccination required under this subsection (5) is not 18submitted within 30 days after the student is permitted to 19attend classes, then the student is not to be permitted to 20attend classes until proof of the vaccinations has been 21properly submitted. No school district or employee of a school 22district shall be held liable for any injury or illness to 23another person that results from admitting an out-of-state 24transfer student to class that has an appointment scheduled 25pursuant to this subsection (5). 26    (6) Every school shall report to the State Board of   HB1792- 12 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1Education by November 15, in the manner which that agency 2shall require, the number of children who have received the 3necessary immunizations and the health examination (other than 4a dental examination or eye examination) as required, 5indicating, of those who have not received the immunizations 6and examination as required, the number of children who are 7exempt from health examination and immunization requirements 8on religious or medical grounds as provided in subsection (8). 9On or before December 1 of each year, every public school 10district and registered nonpublic school shall make publicly 11available the immunization data they are required to submit to 12the State Board of Education by November 15. The immunization 13data made publicly available must be identical to the data the 14school district or school has reported to the State Board of 15Education.16    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education 17by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the 18number of children who have received the required dental 19examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 20required dental examination, the number of children who are 21exempt from the dental examination on religious grounds as 22provided in subsection (8) of this Section and the number of 23children who have received a waiver under subsection (1.5) of 24this Section.25    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education 26by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the   HB1792- 13 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1number of children who have received the required eye 2examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 3required eye examination, the number of children who are 4exempt from the eye examination as provided in subsection (8) 5of this Section, the number of children who have received a 6waiver under subsection (1.10) of this Section, and the total 7number of children in noncompliance with the eye examination 8requirement.9    The reported information under this subsection (6) shall 10be provided to the Department of Public Health by the State 11Board of Education.12    (7) Upon determining that the number of pupils who are 13required to be in compliance with subsection (5) of this 14Section is below 90% of the number of pupils enrolled in the 15school district, 10% of each State aid payment made pursuant 16to Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 to the school district for such 17year may be withheld by the State Board of Education until the 18number of students in compliance with subsection (5) is the 19applicable specified percentage or higher.20    (8) Children of parents or legal guardians who object to 21health, dental, or eye examinations or any part thereof, to 22immunizations, or to vision and hearing screening tests on 23religious grounds shall not be required to undergo the 24examinations, tests, or immunizations to which they so object 25if such parents or legal guardians present to the appropriate 26local school authority a signed Certificate of Religious   HB1792- 14 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1Exemption detailing the grounds for objection and the specific 2immunizations, tests, or examinations to which they object. 3The grounds for objection must set forth the specific 4religious belief that conflicts with the examination, test, 5immunization, or other medical intervention. The signed 6certificate shall also reflect the parent's or legal 7guardian's understanding of the school's exclusion policies in 8the case of a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak or 9exposure. The certificate must also be signed by the 10authorized examining health care provider responsible for the 11performance of the child's health examination confirming that 12the provider provided education to the parent or legal 13guardian on the benefits of immunization and the health risks 14to the student and to the community of the communicable 15diseases for which immunization is required in this State. 16However, the health care provider's signature on the 17certificate reflects only that education was provided and does 18not allow a health care provider grounds to determine a 19religious exemption. Those receiving immunizations required 20under this Code shall be provided with the relevant vaccine 21information statements that are required to be disseminated by 22the federal National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, 23which may contain information on circumstances when a vaccine 24should not be administered, prior to administering a vaccine. 25A healthcare provider may consider including without 26limitation the nationally accepted recommendations from   HB1792- 15 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1federal agencies such as the Advisory Committee on 2Immunization Practices, the information outlined in the 3relevant vaccine information statement, and vaccine package 4inserts, along with the healthcare provider's clinical 5judgment, to determine whether any child may be more 6susceptible to experiencing an adverse vaccine reaction than 7the general population, and, if so, the healthcare provider 8may exempt the child from an immunization or adopt an 9individualized immunization schedule. The Certificate of 10Religious Exemption shall be created by the Department of 11Public Health and shall be made available and used by parents 12and legal guardians by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school 13year. Parents or legal guardians must submit the Certificate 14of Religious Exemption to their local school authority prior 15to entering kindergarten, sixth grade, and ninth grade for 16each child for which they are requesting an exemption. The 17religious objection stated need not be directed by the tenets 18of an established religious organization. However, general 19philosophical or moral reluctance to allow physical 20examinations, eye examinations, immunizations, vision and 21hearing screenings, or dental examinations does not provide a 22sufficient basis for an exception to statutory requirements. 23The local school authority is responsible for determining if 24the content of the Certificate of Religious Exemption 25constitutes a valid religious objection. The local school 26authority shall inform the parent or legal guardian of   HB1792- 16 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1exclusion procedures, in accordance with the Department's 2rules under Part 690 of Title 77 of the Illinois 3Administrative Code, at the time the objection is presented. 4    If the physical condition of the child is such that any one 5or more of the immunizing agents should not be administered, 6the examining physician, advanced practice registered nurse, 7or physician assistant responsible for the performance of the 8health examination shall endorse that fact upon the health 9examination form.10    Exempting a child from the health, dental, or eye 11examination does not exempt the child from participation in 12the program of physical education training provided in 13Sections 27-5 through 27-7 of this Code.14    (8.5) The school board of a school district shall include 15informational materials regarding influenza and influenza 16vaccinations developed, provided, or approved by the 17Department of Public Health under Section 2310-700 of the 18Department of Public Health Powers and Duties Law of the Civil 19Administrative Code of Illinois when the board provides 20information on immunizations, infectious diseases, 21medications, or other school health issues to the parents or 22guardians of students.23    (9) For the purposes of this Section, "nursery schools" 24means those nursery schools operated by elementary school 25systems or secondary level school units or institutions of 26higher learning.  HB1792- 17 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1(Source: P.A. 103-985, eff. 1-1-25.) 2    Section 10. The Communicable Disease Prevention Act is 3amended by adding Section 2f as follows: 4    (410 ILCS 315/2f new)5    Sec. 2f. COVID-19 vaccine. Pursuant to Section 27-8.1 of 6the School Code and notwithstanding Section 2 of this Act, the 7Department of Public Health may not adopt any rules requiring 8children to receive an immunization against COVID-19. 9    Section 99.

A school may not withhold a child's 2report card during a school year in which the Governor has 3declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant 4to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act. 5The Department of Public Health shall establish, by rule, a 6waiver for children who show an undue burden or a lack of 7access to a physician licensed to practice medicine in all of 8its branches who provides eye examinations or to a licensed 9optometrist. Each public, private, and parochial school must 10give notice of this eye examination requirement to the parents 11and guardians of students in compliance with rules of the 12Department of Public Health. Nothing in this Section shall be 13construed to allow a school to exclude a child from attending 14because of a parent's or guardian's failure to obtain an eye 15examination for the child. 16    (2) The Department of Public Health shall promulgate rules 17and regulations specifying the examinations and procedures 18that constitute a health examination, which shall include an 19age-appropriate developmental screening, an age-appropriate 20social and emotional screening, and the collection of data 21relating to asthma and obesity (including at a minimum, date 22of birth, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, and date of 23exam), and a dental examination and may recommend by rule that 24certain additional examinations be performed. The rules and 25regulations of the Department of Public Health shall specify 26that a tuberculosis skin test screening shall be included as a   HB1792- 5 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1required part of each health examination included under this 2Section if the child resides in an area designated by the 3Department of Public Health as having a high incidence of 4tuberculosis. With respect to the developmental screening and 5the social and emotional screening, the Department of Public 6Health must, no later than January 1, 2019, develop rules and 7appropriate revisions to the Child Health Examination form in 8conjunction with a statewide organization representing school 9boards; a statewide organization representing pediatricians; 10statewide organizations representing individuals holding 11Illinois educator licenses with school support personnel 12endorsements, including school social workers, school 13psychologists, and school nurses; a statewide organization 14representing children's mental health experts; a statewide 15organization representing school principals; the Director of 16Healthcare and Family Services or his or her designee, the 17State Superintendent of Education or his or her designee; and 18representatives of other appropriate State agencies and, at a 19minimum, must recommend the use of validated screening tools 20appropriate to the child's age or grade, and, with regard to 21the social and emotional screening, require recording only 22whether or not the screening was completed. The rules shall 23take into consideration the screening recommendations of the 24American Academy of Pediatrics and must be consistent with the 25State Board of Education's social and emotional learning 26standards. The Department of Public Health shall specify that   HB1792- 6 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1a diabetes screening as defined by rule shall be included as a 2required part of each health examination. Diabetes testing is 3not required.4    Physicians licensed to practice medicine in all of its 5branches, licensed advanced practice registered nurses, or 6licensed physician assistants shall be responsible for the 7performance of the health examinations, other than dental 8examinations, eye examinations, and vision and hearing 9screening, and shall sign all report forms required by 10subsection (4) of this Section that pertain to those portions 11of the health examination for which the physician, advanced 12practice registered nurse, or physician assistant is 13responsible. If a registered nurse performs any part of a 14health examination, then a physician licensed to practice 15medicine in all of its branches must review and sign all 16required report forms. Licensed dentists shall perform all 17dental examinations and shall sign all report forms required 18by subsection (4) of this Section that pertain to the dental 19examinations.

Vision 3and hearing screening tests, which shall not be considered 4examinations as that term is used in this Section, shall be 5conducted in accordance with rules and regulations of the 6Department of Public Health, and by individuals whom the 7Department of Public Health has certified. In these rules and 8regulations, the Department of Public Health shall require 9that individuals conducting vision screening tests give a 10child's parent or guardian written notification, before the 11vision screening is conducted, that states, "Vision screening 12is not a substitute for a complete eye and vision evaluation by 13an eye doctor. Your child is not required to undergo this 14vision screening if an optometrist or ophthalmologist has 15completed and signed a report form indicating that an 16examination has been administered within the previous 12 17months.".18    (2.5) With respect to the developmental screening and the 19social and emotional screening portion of the health 20examination, each child may present proof of having been 21screened in accordance with this Section and the rules adopted 22under this Section before October 15th of the school year. 23With regard to the social and emotional screening only, the 24examining health care provider shall only record whether or 25not the screening was completed. If the child fails to present 26proof of the developmental screening or the social and   HB1792- 8 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1emotional screening portions of the health examination by 2October 15th of the school year, qualified school support 3personnel may, with a parent's or guardian's consent, offer 4the developmental screening or the social and emotional 5screening to the child. Each public, private, and parochial 6school must give notice of the developmental screening and 7social and emotional screening requirements to the parents and 8guardians of students in compliance with the rules of the 9Department of Public Health. Nothing in this Section shall be 10construed to allow a school to exclude a child from attending 11because of a parent's or guardian's failure to obtain a 12developmental screening or a social and emotional screening 13for the child. Once a developmental screening or a social and 14emotional screening is completed and proof has been presented 15to the school, the school may, with a parent's or guardian's 16consent, make available appropriate school personnel to work 17with the parent or guardian, the child, and the provider who 18signed the screening form to obtain any appropriate 19evaluations and services as indicated on the form and in other 20information and documentation provided by the parents, 21guardians, or provider.22    (3) Every child shall, at or about the same time as he or 23she receives a health examination required by subsection (1) 24of this Section, present to the local school proof of having 25received such immunizations against preventable communicable 26diseases as the Department of Public Health shall require by   HB1792- 9 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this Section and 2the Communicable Disease Prevention Act.3    (3.5) Notwithstanding any other law or rule to the 4contrary, no child may be required to submit proof of having 5received an immunization against COVID-19 upon enrolling in 6school nor may a child already enrolled in school be required 7to receive an immunization against COVID-19.8    (4) The individuals conducting the health examination, 9dental examination, or eye examination shall record the fact 10of having conducted the examination, and such additional 11information as required, including for a health examination 12data relating to asthma and obesity (including at a minimum, 13date of birth, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, and 14date of exam), on uniform forms which the Department of Public 15Health and the State Board of Education shall prescribe for 16statewide use. The examiner shall summarize on the report form 17any condition that he or she suspects indicates a need for 18special services, including for a health examination factors 19relating to asthma or obesity. The duty to summarize on the 20report form does not apply to social and emotional screenings. 21The confidentiality of the information and records relating to 22the developmental screening and the social and emotional 23screening shall be determined by the statutes, rules, and 24professional ethics governing the type of provider conducting 25the screening. The individuals confirming the administration 26of required immunizations shall record as indicated on the   HB1792- 10 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1form that the immunizations were administered.2    (5) If a child does not submit proof of having had either 3the health examination or the immunization as required, then 4the child shall be examined or receive the immunization, as 5the case may be, and present proof by October 15 of the current 6school year, or by an earlier date of the current school year 7established by a school district. To establish a date before 8October 15 of the current school year for the health 9examination or immunization as required, a school district 10must give notice of the requirements of this Section 60 days 11prior to the earlier established date. If for medical reasons 12one or more of the required immunizations must be given after 13October 15 of the current school year, or after an earlier 14established date of the current school year, then the child 15shall present, by October 15, or by the earlier established 16date, a schedule for the administration of the immunizations 17and a statement of the medical reasons causing the delay, both 18the schedule and the statement being issued by the physician, 19advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, 20registered nurse, or local health department that will be 21responsible for administration of the remaining required 22immunizations. If a child does not comply by October 15, or by 23the earlier established date of the current school year, with 24the requirements of this subsection, then the local school 25authority shall exclude that child from school until such time 26as the child presents proof of having had the health   HB1792- 11 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1examination as required and presents proof of having received 2those required immunizations which are medically possible to 3receive immediately. During a child's exclusion from school 4for noncompliance with this subsection, the child's parents or 5legal guardian shall be considered in violation of Section 626-1 and subject to any penalty imposed by Section 26-10. This 7subsection (5) does not apply to dental examinations, eye 8examinations, and the developmental screening and the social 9and emotional screening portions of the health examination. If 10the student is an out-of-state transfer student and does not 11have the proof required under this subsection (5) before 12October 15 of the current year or whatever date is set by the 13school district, then he or she may only attend classes (i) if 14he or she has proof that an appointment for the required 15vaccinations has been scheduled with a party authorized to 16submit proof of the required vaccinations. If the proof of 17vaccination required under this subsection (5) is not 18submitted within 30 days after the student is permitted to 19attend classes, then the student is not to be permitted to 20attend classes until proof of the vaccinations has been 21properly submitted. No school district or employee of a school 22district shall be held liable for any injury or illness to 23another person that results from admitting an out-of-state 24transfer student to class that has an appointment scheduled 25pursuant to this subsection (5). 26    (6) Every school shall report to the State Board of   HB1792- 12 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1Education by November 15, in the manner which that agency 2shall require, the number of children who have received the 3necessary immunizations and the health examination (other than 4a dental examination or eye examination) as required, 5indicating, of those who have not received the immunizations 6and examination as required, the number of children who are 7exempt from health examination and immunization requirements 8on religious or medical grounds as provided in subsection (8). 9On or before December 1 of each year, every public school 10district and registered nonpublic school shall make publicly 11available the immunization data they are required to submit to 12the State Board of Education by November 15. The immunization 13data made publicly available must be identical to the data the 14school district or school has reported to the State Board of 15Education.16    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education 17by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the 18number of children who have received the required dental 19examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 20required dental examination, the number of children who are 21exempt from the dental examination on religious grounds as 22provided in subsection (8) of this Section and the number of 23children who have received a waiver under subsection (1.5) of 24this Section.25    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education 26by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the   HB1792- 13 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1number of children who have received the required eye 2examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 3required eye examination, the number of children who are 4exempt from the eye examination as provided in subsection (8) 5of this Section, the number of children who have received a 6waiver under subsection (1.10) of this Section, and the total 7number of children in noncompliance with the eye examination 8requirement.9    The reported information under this subsection (6) shall 10be provided to the Department of Public Health by the State 11Board of Education.12    (7) Upon determining that the number of pupils who are 13required to be in compliance with subsection (5) of this 14Section is below 90% of the number of pupils enrolled in the 15school district, 10% of each State aid payment made pursuant 16to Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 to the school district for such 17year may be withheld by the State Board of Education until the 18number of students in compliance with subsection (5) is the 19applicable specified percentage or higher.20    (8) Children of parents or legal guardians who object to 21health, dental, or eye examinations or any part thereof, to 22immunizations, or to vision and hearing screening tests on 23religious grounds shall not be required to undergo the 24examinations, tests, or immunizations to which they so object 25if such parents or legal guardians present to the appropriate 26local school authority a signed Certificate of Religious   HB1792- 14 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1Exemption detailing the grounds for objection and the specific 2immunizations, tests, or examinations to which they object. 3The grounds for objection must set forth the specific 4religious belief that conflicts with the examination, test, 5immunization, or other medical intervention. The signed 6certificate shall also reflect the parent's or legal 7guardian's understanding of the school's exclusion policies in 8the case of a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak or 9exposure. The certificate must also be signed by the 10authorized examining health care provider responsible for the 11performance of the child's health examination confirming that 12the provider provided education to the parent or legal 13guardian on the benefits of immunization and the health risks 14to the student and to the community of the communicable 15diseases for which immunization is required in this State. 16However, the health care provider's signature on the 17certificate reflects only that education was provided and does 18not allow a health care provider grounds to determine a 19religious exemption. Those receiving immunizations required 20under this Code shall be provided with the relevant vaccine 21information statements that are required to be disseminated by 22the federal National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, 23which may contain information on circumstances when a vaccine 24should not be administered, prior to administering a vaccine. 25A healthcare provider may consider including without 26limitation the nationally accepted recommendations from   HB1792- 15 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1federal agencies such as the Advisory Committee on 2Immunization Practices, the information outlined in the 3relevant vaccine information statement, and vaccine package 4inserts, along with the healthcare provider's clinical 5judgment, to determine whether any child may be more 6susceptible to experiencing an adverse vaccine reaction than 7the general population, and, if so, the healthcare provider 8may exempt the child from an immunization or adopt an 9individualized immunization schedule. The Certificate of 10Religious Exemption shall be created by the Department of 11Public Health and shall be made available and used by parents 12and legal guardians by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school 13year. Parents or legal guardians must submit the Certificate 14of Religious Exemption to their local school authority prior 15to entering kindergarten, sixth grade, and ninth grade for 16each child for which they are requesting an exemption. The 17religious objection stated need not be directed by the tenets 18of an established religious organization. However, general 19philosophical or moral reluctance to allow physical 20examinations, eye examinations, immunizations, vision and 21hearing screenings, or dental examinations does not provide a 22sufficient basis for an exception to statutory requirements. 23The local school authority is responsible for determining if 24the content of the Certificate of Religious Exemption 25constitutes a valid religious objection. The local school 26authority shall inform the parent or legal guardian of   HB1792- 16 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1exclusion procedures, in accordance with the Department's 2rules under Part 690 of Title 77 of the Illinois 3Administrative Code, at the time the objection is presented. 4    If the physical condition of the child is such that any one 5or more of the immunizing agents should not be administered, 6the examining physician, advanced practice registered nurse, 7or physician assistant responsible for the performance of the 8health examination shall endorse that fact upon the health 9examination form.10    Exempting a child from the health, dental, or eye 11examination does not exempt the child from participation in 12the program of physical education training provided in 13Sections 27-5 through 27-7 of this Code.14    (8.5) The school board of a school district shall include 15informational materials regarding influenza and influenza 16vaccinations developed, provided, or approved by the 17Department of Public Health under Section 2310-700 of the 18Department of Public Health Powers and Duties Law of the Civil 19Administrative Code of Illinois when the board provides 20information on immunizations, infectious diseases, 21medications, or other school health issues to the parents or 22guardians of students.23    (9) For the purposes of this Section, "nursery schools" 24means those nursery schools operated by elementary school 25systems or secondary level school units or institutions of 26higher learning.  HB1792- 17 -LRB104 04061 LNS 14085 b1(Source: P.A. 103-985, eff. 1-1-25.) 2    Section 10.
