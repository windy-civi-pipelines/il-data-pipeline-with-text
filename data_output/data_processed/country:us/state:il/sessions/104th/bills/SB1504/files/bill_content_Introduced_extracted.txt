The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 8services as soon as the report is determined to be 9"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 10family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 11or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 12investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 13Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 14willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 15investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 16child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 17child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 18services available from other agencies in the community, even 19if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 20in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 21subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 22child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 23voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 24child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 25alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 26"differential response program" provided for in subsection   SB1504- 12 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 2Reporting Act.3    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 4children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 5care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 6as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 7requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 8Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 9be committed to the Department by any court without the 10approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 11effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 122017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 13Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 14adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 15or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 16less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 17Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 18for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 19exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 20minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 21to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 222-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 232017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 24Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 25adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 26or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor   SB1504- 13 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 2Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 3for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 4exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 5minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 6to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 72-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 8exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 9or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 10circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 11delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 12attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 13the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 14hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 15release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 16    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 17date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 18implement a special program of family preservation services to 19support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 20experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 21stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 22pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 23that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 24safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 25family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 26and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer   SB1504- 14 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1the child or family to services available from other agencies 2in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 3home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 4future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 5of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 6develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 7health and social service providers and the general public 8about these special family preservation services. The nature 9and scope of the services offered and the number of families 10served under the special program implemented under this 11paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 12Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 13"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 14a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 15Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 16edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 17Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.18    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 19interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 20most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 21possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 22the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 23concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 24earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 25include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of 26the family when the child can be cared for at home without   SB1504- 15 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 2the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 3is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 4permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.5    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 6respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 7making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 8shall be the paramount concern.9    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 10shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 11prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 12child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 13reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 14occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 15Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 16where the Department believes that further reunification 17services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 18the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 19The Department is not required to provide further 20reunification services after such a finding.21    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 22made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 23best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 24also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 25placement made is the best available placement to provide 26permanency for the child.  SB1504- 16 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 2planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 3shall consider the following factors when determining 4appropriateness of concurrent planning:5        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;6        (2) the past history of the family;7        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 8    the family;9        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;10        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 11    family to reunite;12        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 13    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;14        (7) the age of the child;15        (8) placement of siblings.16    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 17child if:18        (1) it has received a written consent to such 19    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 20    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 21    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 22    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 23    or24        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 25    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 26    located.  SB1504- 17 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1If the child is found in the child's residence without a 2parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 3Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 4temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 5Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 6guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 7willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 8and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 9relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 10child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 11a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 12such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 13resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 14home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 15follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 165-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.17    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 18and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 19pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 20Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 21custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 22Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 23acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 24limited custody, the Department, during the period of 25temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 26judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or   SB1504- 18 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b15-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 2authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 3of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 4the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.5    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 6custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 7examination.8    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 9temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 10the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 11Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 12the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 13The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1410 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 15the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 16Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 17Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 18the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 19the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 20custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 21later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 22the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 23temporary custody of the child shall terminate.24    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 25age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 26that cares for children who are in need of secure living   SB1504- 19 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 2determination is made by the facility director and the 3Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 4facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 5of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 6subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 7pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 8unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 9of the Department before being subject to placement in a 10correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 11has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.12    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 13age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 14the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 15preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 16child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 17placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 18clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 19in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 20Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 21those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 22guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 23Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 24facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 25of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 26maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for   SB1504- 20 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 2However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 3where children require specialized care and treatment for 4problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 5social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 6facilities for the placement of such children are not 7available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 8this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 9be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 10garnishment or otherwise.11    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 12welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 13sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 14minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 15subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 161987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 17provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 18yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 19responsibility for the development and delivery of services 20under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 21under this Section through the Department of Children and 22Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 23Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 24shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 25an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 26the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A   SB1504- 21 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 2youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 3Department shall continue child welfare services under this 4Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 5of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 6self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 7The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 8clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 9child welfare services under this Section and how such 10services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 11Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 12disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 13adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 14minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 15independent adults. 16    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 17review and appeal process for children and families who 18request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 19Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 20agencies, and foster families with whom those youth are 21placed, shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal 22rights as children and families in the case of placement by the 23Department, including the right to an initial review of a 24private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 25ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 26youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children   SB1504- 22 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1and foster families. The Department shall accept for 2administrative review and an appeal hearing a complaint made 3by (i) a child or foster family concerning a decision 4following an initial review by a private child welfare agency 5or (ii) a prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation 6of subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 7concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 8conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 9current foster home placement is necessary and appropriate 10under Section 2-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not 11constitute a judicial determination on the merits of an 12administrative appeal, filed by a former foster parent, 13involving a change of placement decision.14    (p) (Blank).15    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 16for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 17money or other property which is received on behalf of such 18children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 19or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 20the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 215.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 22under Section 5.46.23    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 24interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 25institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 26responsible and who have been determined eligible for   SB1504- 23 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 2allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 3parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 4Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 5miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 6be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 7with this subsection.8    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 9Department shall:10        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 11    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 12    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 13    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 14    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 15    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 16    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 17    account for any purpose.18        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 19    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 20    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 21    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 22    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 23    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 24    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 25    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 26    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.  SB1504- 24 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 2    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 3    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 4    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 5    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.6    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 7encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 8the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 9who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 10hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 11of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 12of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 13Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 14confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 15of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 16adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 17such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 18agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 19Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 20confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 21of the child.22    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 23establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and 24private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the 25Department of Children and Family Services for damages 26sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or   SB1504- 25 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third 2party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions 3of foster children to other individuals. Such coverage will be 4secondary to the foster parent liability insurance policy, if 5applicable. The program shall be funded through appropriations 6from the General Revenue Fund, specifically designated for 7such purposes.8    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 9investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 10as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 11Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:12        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 13    directs the Department to perform such services; and14        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 15    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 16    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 17    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 18    party is financially able to pay.19    The Department shall provide written notification to the 20court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 21and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 22The Department shall send to the court information related to 23the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 24determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The 25court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.26    (u) In addition to other information that must be   SB1504- 26 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1provided, whenever the Department places a child with a 2prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster 3home, group home, or child care institution, or in a relative 4home, the Department shall provide to the prospective adoptive 5parent or parents or other caretaker:6        (1) available detailed information concerning the 7    child's educational and health history, copies of 8    immunization records (including insurance and medical card 9    information), a history of the child's previous 10    placements, if any, and reasons for placement changes 11    excluding any information that identifies or reveals the 12    location of any previous caretaker;13        (2) a copy of the child's portion of the client 14    service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and 15    all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; 16    and17        (3) information containing details of the child's 18    individualized educational plan when the child is 19    receiving special education services.20    The caretaker shall be informed of any known social or 21behavioral information (including, but not limited to, 22criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual 23abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to 24care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently 25in the home. The Department may prepare a written summary of 26the information required by this paragraph, which may be   SB1504- 27 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1provided to the foster or prospective adoptive parent in 2advance of a placement. The foster or prospective adoptive 3parent may review the supporting documents in the child's file 4in the presence of casework staff. In the case of an emergency 5placement, casework staff shall at least provide known 6information verbally, if necessary, and must subsequently 7provide the information in writing as required by this 8subsection. 9    The information described in this subsection shall be 10provided in writing. In the case of emergency placements when 11time does not allow prior review, preparation, and collection 12of written information, the Department shall provide such 13information as it becomes available. Within 10 business days 14after placement, the Department shall obtain from the 15prospective adoptive parent or parents or other caretaker a 16signed verification of receipt of the information provided. 17Within 10 business days after placement, the Department shall 18provide to the child's guardian ad litem a copy of the 19information provided to the prospective adoptive parent or 20parents or other caretaker.

If the child remains 5placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the 6Department shall submit evidence at each status and permanency 7hearing: 8        (1) demonstrating that on-going assessment of the 9    strengths and needs of the child continues to support the 10    determination that the child's needs cannot be met through 11    placement in a foster family home, that the placement 12    provides the most effective and appropriate level of care 13    for the child in the least restrictive, appropriate 14    environment, and that the placement is consistent with the 15    short-term and long-term permanency goal for the child, as 16    specified in the permanency plan for the child; 17        (2) documenting the specific treatment or service 18    needs that should be met for the child in the placement and 19    the length of time the child is expected to need the 20    treatment or services; and 21        (3) the efforts made by the agency to prepare the 22    child to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing 23    relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a 24    foster family home. 25    (2) The first permanency hearing shall be conducted by the 26judge. Subsequent permanency hearings may be heard by a judge   SB1504- 40 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1or by hearing officers appointed or approved by the court in 2the manner set forth in Section 2-28.1 of this Act. The initial 3hearing shall be held (a) within 12 months from the date 4temporary custody was taken, regardless of whether an 5adjudication or dispositional hearing has been completed 6within that time frame, (b) if the parental rights of both 7parents have been terminated in accordance with the procedure 8described in subsection (5) of Section 2-21, within 30 days of 9the order for termination of parental rights and appointment 10of a guardian with power to consent to adoption, or (c) in 11accordance with subsection (2) of Section 2-13.1. Subsequent 12permanency hearings shall be held every 6 months or more 13frequently if necessary in the court's determination following 14the initial permanency hearing, in accordance with the 15standards set forth in this Section, until the court 16determines that the plan and goal have been achieved. Once the 17plan and goal have been achieved, if the minor remains in 18substitute care, the case shall be reviewed at least every 6 19months thereafter, subject to the provisions of this Section, 20unless the minor is placed in the guardianship of a suitable 21relative or other person and the court determines that further 22monitoring by the court does not further the health, safety, 23or best interest of the child and that this is a stable 24permanent placement. The permanency hearings must occur within 25the time frames set forth in this subsection and may not be 26delayed in anticipation of a report from any source or due to   SB1504- 41 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1the agency's failure to timely file its written report (this 2written report means the one required under the next paragraph 3and does not mean the service plan also referred to in that 4paragraph).5    The public agency that is the custodian or guardian of the 6minor, or another agency responsible for the minor's care, 7shall ensure that all parties to the permanency hearings are 8provided a copy of the most recent service plan prepared 9within the prior 6 months at least 14 days in advance of the 10hearing. If not contained in the agency's service plan, the 11agency shall also include a report setting forth (i) any 12special physical, psychological, educational, medical, 13emotional, or other needs of the minor or the minor's family 14that are relevant to a permanency or placement determination 15and (ii) for any minor age 16 or over, a written description of 16the programs and services that will enable the minor to 17prepare for independent living. If not contained in the 18agency's service plan, the agency's report shall specify if a 19minor is placed in a licensed child care facility under a 20corrective plan by the Department due to concerns impacting 21the minor's safety and well-being. The report shall explain 22the steps the Department is taking to ensure the safety and 23well-being of the minor and that the minor's needs are met in 24the facility. The agency's written report must detail what 25progress or lack of progress the parent has made in correcting 26the conditions requiring the child to be in care; whether the   SB1504- 42 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1child can be returned home without jeopardizing the child's 2health, safety, and welfare, and, if not, what permanency goal 3is recommended to be in the best interests of the child, and 4why the other permanency goals are not appropriate. The 5caseworker must appear and testify at the permanency hearing. 6If a permanency hearing has not previously been scheduled by 7the court, the moving party shall move for the setting of a 8permanency hearing and the entry of an order within the time 9frames set forth in this subsection.10    At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine the 11future status of the child. The court shall set one of the 12following permanency goals:13        (A) The minor will be returned home by a specific date 14    within 5 months.15        (B) The minor will be in short-term care with a 16    continued goal to return home within a period not to 17    exceed one year, where the progress of the parent or 18    parents is substantial giving particular consideration to 19    the age and individual needs of the minor.20        (B-1) The minor will be in short-term care with a 21    continued goal to return home pending a status hearing. 22    When the court finds that a parent has not made reasonable 23    efforts or reasonable progress to date, the court shall 24    identify what actions the parent and the Department must 25    take in order to justify a finding of reasonable efforts 26    or reasonable progress and shall set a status hearing to   SB1504- 43 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    be held not earlier than 9 months from the date of 2    adjudication nor later than 11 months from the date of 3    adjudication during which the parent's progress will again 4    be reviewed.5        (C) The minor will be in substitute care pending court 6    determination on termination of parental rights.7        (D) Adoption, provided that parental rights have been 8    terminated or relinquished.9        (E) The guardianship of the minor will be transferred 10    to an individual or couple on a permanent basis provided 11    that goals (A) through (D) have been deemed inappropriate 12    and not in the child's best interests. The court shall 13    confirm that the Department has discussed adoption, if 14    appropriate, and guardianship with the caregiver prior to 15    changing a goal to guardianship.16        (F) The minor over age 15 will be in substitute care 17    pending independence. In selecting this permanency goal, 18    the Department of Children and Family Services may provide 19    services to enable reunification and to strengthen the 20    minor's connections with family, fictive kin, and other 21    responsible adults, provided the services are in the 22    minor's best interest. The services shall be documented in 23    the service plan. 24        (G) The minor will be in substitute care because the 25    minor cannot be provided for in a home environment due to 26    developmental disabilities or mental illness or because   SB1504- 44 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    the minor is a danger to self or others, provided that 2    goals (A) through (D) have been deemed inappropriate and 3    not in the child's best interests.4    In selecting any permanency goal, the court shall indicate 5in writing the reasons the goal was selected and why the 6preceding goals were deemed inappropriate and not in the 7child's best interest. Where the court has selected a 8permanency goal other than (A), (B), or (B-1), the Department 9of Children and Family Services shall not provide further 10reunification services, except as provided in paragraph (F) of 11this subsection (2), but shall provide services consistent 12with the goal selected.13        (H) Notwithstanding any other provision in this 14    Section, the court may select the goal of continuing 15    foster care as a permanency goal if: 16            (1) The Department of Children and Family Services 17        has custody and guardianship of the minor; 18            (2) The court has deemed all other permanency 19        goals inappropriate based on the child's best 20        interest; 21            (3) The court has found compelling reasons, based 22        on written documentation reviewed by the court, to 23        place the minor in continuing foster care. Compelling 24        reasons include: 25                (a) the child does not wish to be adopted or to 26            be placed in the guardianship of the minor's   SB1504- 45 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1            relative or foster care placement; 2                (b) the child exhibits an extreme level of 3            need such that the removal of the child from the 4            minor's placement would be detrimental to the 5            child; or 6                (c) the child who is the subject of the 7            permanency hearing has existing close and strong 8            bonds with a sibling, and achievement of another 9            permanency goal would substantially interfere with 10            the subject child's sibling relationship, taking 11            into consideration the nature and extent of the 12            relationship, and whether ongoing contact is in 13            the subject child's best interest, including 14            long-term emotional interest, as compared with the 15            legal and emotional benefit of permanence; 16            (4) The child has lived with the relative or 17        foster parent for at least one year; and 18            (5) The relative or foster parent currently caring 19        for the child is willing and capable of providing the 20        child with a stable and permanent environment. 21    The court shall set a permanency goal that is in the best 22interest of the child. In determining that goal, the court 23shall consult with the minor in an age-appropriate manner 24regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan for the 25minor. The court's determination shall include the following 26factors:  SB1504- 46 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (1) Age of the child.2        (2) Options available for permanence, including both 3    out-of-state and in-state placement options.4        (3) Current placement of the child and the intent of 5    the family regarding adoption.6        (4) Emotional, physical, and mental status or 7    condition of the child.8        (5) Types of services previously offered and whether 9    or not the services were successful and, if not 10    successful, the reasons the services failed.11        (6) Availability of services currently needed and 12    whether the services exist.13        (7) Status of siblings of the minor.14    The court shall consider (i) the permanency goal contained 15in the service plan, (ii) the appropriateness of the services 16contained in the plan and whether those services have been 17provided, (iii) whether reasonable efforts have been made by 18all the parties to the service plan to achieve the goal, and 19(iv) whether the plan and goal have been achieved. All 20evidence relevant to determining these questions, including 21oral and written reports, may be admitted and may be relied on 22to the extent of their probative value.23    The court shall make findings as to whether, in violation 24of Section 8.2 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting 25Act, any portion of the service plan compels a child or parent 26to engage in any activity or refrain from any activity that is   SB1504- 47 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1not reasonably related to remedying a condition or conditions 2that gave rise or which could give rise to any finding of child 3abuse or neglect. The services contained in the service plan 4shall include services reasonably related to remedy the 5conditions that gave rise to removal of the child from the home 6of the child's parents, guardian, or legal custodian or that 7the court has found must be remedied prior to returning the 8child home. Any tasks the court requires of the parents, 9guardian, or legal custodian or child prior to returning the 10child home must be reasonably related to remedying a condition 11or conditions that gave rise to or which could give rise to any 12finding of child abuse or neglect. 13    If the permanency goal is to return home, the court shall 14make findings that identify any problems that are causing 15continued placement of the children away from the home and 16identify what outcomes would be considered a resolution to 17these problems. The court shall explain to the parents that 18these findings are based on the information that the court has 19at that time and may be revised, should additional evidence be 20presented to the court. 21    The court shall review the Sibling Contact Support Plan 22developed or modified under subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of 23the Children and Family Services Act, if applicable. If the 24Department has not convened a meeting to develop or modify a 25Sibling Contact Support Plan, or if the court finds that the 26existing Plan is not in the child's best interest, the court   SB1504- 48 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1may enter an order requiring the Department to develop, 2modify, or implement a Sibling Contact Support Plan, or order 3mediation. 4    If the goal has been achieved, the court shall enter 5orders that are necessary to conform the minor's legal custody 6and status to those findings.7    If, after receiving evidence, the court determines that 8the services contained in the plan are not reasonably 9calculated to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, 10the court shall put in writing the factual basis supporting 11the determination and enter specific findings based on the 12evidence. The court also shall enter an order for the 13Department to develop and implement a new service plan or to 14implement changes to the current service plan consistent with 15the court's findings. The new service plan shall be filed with 16the court and served on all parties within 45 days of the date 17of the order. The court shall continue the matter until the new 18service plan is filed. Except as authorized by subsection 19(2.5) of this Section and as otherwise specifically authorized 20by law, the court is not empowered under this Section to order 21specific placements, specific services, or specific service 22providers to be included in the service plan.23    A guardian or custodian appointed by the court pursuant to 24this Act shall file updated case plans with the court every 6 25months.26    Rights of wards of the court under this Act are   SB1504- 49 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1enforceable against any public agency by complaints for relief 2by mandamus filed in any proceedings brought under this Act.3    (2.5) If, after reviewing the evidence, including evidence 4from the Department, the court determines that the minor's 5current or planned placement is not necessary or appropriate 6to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court 7shall put in writing the factual basis supporting its 8determination and enter specific findings based on the 9evidence. If the court finds that the minor's current or 10planned placement is not necessary or appropriate, the court 11may enter an order directing the Department to implement a 12recommendation by the minor's treating clinician or a 13clinician contracted by the Department to evaluate the minor 14or a recommendation made by the Department. If the Department 15places a minor in a placement under an order entered under this 16subsection (2.5), the Department has the authority to remove 17the minor from that placement when a change in circumstances 18necessitates the removal to protect the minor's health, 19safety, and best interest. If the Department determines 20removal is necessary, the Department shall notify the parties 21of the planned placement change in writing no later than 10 22days prior to the implementation of its determination unless 23remaining in the placement poses an imminent risk of harm to 24the minor, in which case the Department shall notify the 25parties of the placement change in writing immediately 26following the implementation of its decision. The Department   SB1504- 50 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1shall notify others of the decision to change the minor's 2placement as required by Department rule. 3    (3) Following the permanency hearing, the court shall 4enter a written order that includes the determinations 5required under subsection (2) of this Section and sets forth 6the following:7        (a) The future status of the minor, including the 8    permanency goal, and any order necessary to conform the 9    minor's legal custody and status to such determination; or10        (b) If the permanency goal of the minor cannot be 11    achieved immediately, the specific reasons for continuing 12    the minor in the care of the Department of Children and 13    Family Services or other agency for short-term placement, 14    and the following determinations:15            (i) (Blank).16            (ii) Whether the services required by the court 17        and by any service plan prepared within the prior 6 18        months have been provided and (A) if so, whether the 19        services were reasonably calculated to facilitate the 20        achievement of the permanency goal or (B) if not 21        provided, why the services were not provided.22            (iii) Whether the minor's current or planned 23        placement is necessary, and appropriate to the plan 24        and goal, recognizing the right of minors to the least 25        restrictive (most family-like) setting available and 26        in close proximity to the parents' home consistent   SB1504- 51 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        with the health, safety, best interest, and special 2        needs of the minor and, if the minor is placed 3        out-of-state, whether the out-of-state placement 4        continues to be appropriate and consistent with the 5        health, safety, and best interest of the minor.6            (iv) (Blank).7            (v) (Blank).8        (c) If the permanency goal is independence or home 9    environment not appropriate and the minor is 18 years old 10    or older, the court shall schedule Successful Transition 11    to Adulthood Review hearings consistent with Section 12    2-28.2. 13    (4) The minor or any person interested in the minor may 14apply to the court for a change in custody of the minor and the 15appointment of a new custodian or guardian of the person or for 16the restoration of the minor to the custody of the minor's 17parents or former guardian or custodian.18    When return home is not selected as the permanency goal:19        (a) The Department, the minor, or the current foster 20    parent or relative caregiver seeking private guardianship 21    may file a motion for private guardianship of the minor. 22    Appointment of a guardian under this Section requires 23    approval of the court.24        (b) The State's Attorney may file a motion to 25    terminate parental rights of any parent who has failed to 26    make reasonable efforts to correct the conditions which   SB1504- 52 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    led to the removal of the child or reasonable progress 2    toward the return of the child, as defined in subdivision 3    (D)(m) of Section 1 of the Adoption Act or for whom any 4    other unfitness ground for terminating parental rights as 5    defined in subdivision (D) of Section 1 of the Adoption 6    Act exists.7        When parental rights have been terminated for a 8    minimum of 3 years and the child who is the subject of the 9    permanency hearing is 13 years old or older and is not 10    currently placed in a placement likely to achieve 11    permanency, the Department of Children and Family Services 12    shall make reasonable efforts to locate parents whose 13    rights have been terminated, except when the Court 14    determines that those efforts would be futile or 15    inconsistent with the subject child's best interests. The 16    Department of Children and Family Services shall assess 17    the appropriateness of the parent whose rights have been 18    terminated, and shall, as appropriate, foster and support 19    connections between the parent whose rights have been 20    terminated and the youth. The Department of Children and 21    Family Services shall document its determinations and 22    efforts to foster connections in the child's case plan. 23    Custody of the minor shall not be restored to any parent, 24guardian, or legal custodian in any case in which the minor is 25found to be neglected or abused under Section 2-3 or dependent 26under Section 2-4 of this Act, unless the minor can be cared   SB1504- 53 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1for at home without endangering the minor's health or safety 2and it is in the best interest of the minor, and if such 3neglect, abuse, or dependency is found by the court under 4paragraph (1) of Section 2-21 of this Act to have come about 5due to the acts or omissions or both of such parent, guardian, 6or legal custodian, until such time as an investigation is 7made as provided in paragraph (5) and a hearing is held on the 8issue of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor and 9the fitness of such parent, guardian, or legal custodian to 10care for the minor and the court enters an order that such 11parent, guardian, or legal custodian is fit to care for the 12minor. If a motion is filed to modify or vacate a private 13guardianship order and return the child to a parent, guardian, 14or legal custodian, the court may order the Department of 15Children and Family Services to assess the minor's current and 16proposed living arrangements and to provide ongoing monitoring 17of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor during 18the pendency of the motion to assist the court in making that 19determination. In the event that the minor has attained 18 20years of age and the guardian or custodian petitions the court 21for an order terminating the minor's guardianship or custody, 22guardianship or custody shall terminate automatically 30 days 23after the receipt of the petition unless the court orders 24otherwise. No legal custodian or guardian of the person may be 25removed without the legal custodian's or guardian's consent 26until given notice and an opportunity to be heard by the court.  SB1504- 54 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    When the court orders a child restored to the custody of 2the parent or parents, the court shall order the parent or 3parents to cooperate with the Department of Children and 4Family Services and comply with the terms of an after-care 5plan, or risk the loss of custody of the child and possible 6termination of their parental rights. The court may also enter 7an order of protective supervision in accordance with Section 82-24.9    If the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, 10legal custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, 11and an Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the 12court may order the Department of Children and Family Services 13to arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 14arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 15and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 16protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 172-24. 18    (5) Whenever a parent, guardian, or legal custodian files 19a motion for restoration of custody of the minor, and the minor 20was adjudicated neglected, abused, or dependent as a result of 21physical abuse, the court shall cause to be made an 22investigation as to whether the movant has ever been charged 23with or convicted of any criminal offense which would indicate 24the likelihood of any further physical abuse to the minor. 25Evidence of such criminal convictions shall be taken into 26account in determining whether the minor can be cared for at   SB1504- 55 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1home without endangering the minor's health or safety and 2fitness of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian.3        (a) Any agency of this State or any subdivision 4    thereof shall cooperate with the agent of the court in 5    providing any information sought in the investigation.6        (b) The information derived from the investigation and 7    any conclusions or recommendations derived from the 8    information shall be provided to the parent, guardian, or 9    legal custodian seeking restoration of custody prior to 10    the hearing on fitness and the movant shall have an 11    opportunity at the hearing to refute the information or 12    contest its significance.13        (c) All information obtained from any investigation 14    shall be confidential as provided in Section 5-150 of this 15    Act.16(Source: P.A. 102-193, eff. 7-30-21; 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 17102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-154, eff. 186-30-23; 103-171, eff. 1-1-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24.) 19    (705 ILCS 405/2-28.2 new)20    Sec. 2-28.2. Successful Transition to Adulthood Review 21hearings.22    (a) The court shall conduct Successful Transition to 23Adulthood Review hearings for minors who are 18 years old and 24older for whom the court has entered a goal of independence or 25home environment not appropriate in accordance with Section   SB1504- 56 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b12-28. At a minimum, the court shall conduct such hearings 2within 6 months of the minor's 18th, 19th, and 20th birthdays. 3The court may schedule additional review hearings as necessary 4and in the minor's best interest.

With respect to children who 14are in substitute care pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of 151987, family preservation services shall not be offered if a 16goal other than those of subdivisions (A), (B), or (B-1) of 17subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act has been set, except 18that reunification services may be offered as provided in 19paragraph (F) of subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act. 20Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create a 21private right of action or claim on the part of any individual 22or child welfare agency, except that when a child is the 23subject of an action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act 24of 1987 and the child's service plan calls for services to 25facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court 26hearing the action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act   SB1504- 11 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1of 1987 may order the Department to provide the services set 2out in the plan, if those services are not provided with 3reasonable promptness and if those services are available.4    The Department shall notify the child and the child's 5family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 6family preservation services as identified in the service 7plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 8services as soon as the report is determined to be 9"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 10family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 11or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 12investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 13Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 14willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 15investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 16child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 17child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 18services available from other agencies in the community, even 19if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 20in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 21subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 22child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 23voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 24child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 25alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 26"differential response program" provided for in subsection   SB1504- 12 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 2Reporting Act.3    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 4children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 5care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 6as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 7requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 8Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 9be committed to the Department by any court without the 10approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 11effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 122017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 13Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 14adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 15or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 16less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 17Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 18for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 19exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 20minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 21to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 222-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 232017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 24Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 25adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 26or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor   SB1504- 13 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 2Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 3for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 4exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 5minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 6to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 72-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 8exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 9or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 10circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 11delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 12attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 13the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 14hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 15release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 16    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 17date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 18implement a special program of family preservation services to 19support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 20experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 21stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 22pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 23that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 24safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 25family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 26and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer   SB1504- 14 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1the child or family to services available from other agencies 2in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 3home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 4future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 5of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 6develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 7health and social service providers and the general public 8about these special family preservation services. The nature 9and scope of the services offered and the number of families 10served under the special program implemented under this 11paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 12Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 13"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 14a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 15Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 16edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 17Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.18    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 19interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 20most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 21possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 22the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 23concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 24earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 25include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of 26the family when the child can be cared for at home without   SB1504- 15 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 2the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 3is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 4permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.5    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 6respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 7making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 8shall be the paramount concern.9    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 10shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 11prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 12child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 13reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 14occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 15Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 16where the Department believes that further reunification 17services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 18the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 19The Department is not required to provide further 20reunification services after such a finding.21    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 22made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 23best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 24also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 25placement made is the best available placement to provide 26permanency for the child.  SB1504- 16 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 2planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 3shall consider the following factors when determining 4appropriateness of concurrent planning:5        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;6        (2) the past history of the family;7        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 8    the family;9        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;10        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 11    family to reunite;12        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 13    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;14        (7) the age of the child;15        (8) placement of siblings.16    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 17child if:18        (1) it has received a written consent to such 19    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 20    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 21    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 22    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 23    or24        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 25    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 26    located.  SB1504- 17 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1If the child is found in the child's residence without a 2parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 3Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 4temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 5Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 6guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 7willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 8and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 9relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 10child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 11a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 12such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 13resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 14home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 15follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 165-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.17    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 18and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 19pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 20Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 21custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 22Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 23acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 24limited custody, the Department, during the period of 25temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 26judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or   SB1504- 18 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b15-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 2authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 3of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 4the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.5    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 6custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 7examination.8    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 9temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 10the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 11Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 12the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 13The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1410 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 15the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 16Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 17Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 18the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 19the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 20custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 21later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 22the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 23temporary custody of the child shall terminate.24    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 25age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 26that cares for children who are in need of secure living   SB1504- 19 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 2determination is made by the facility director and the 3Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 4facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 5of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 6subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 7pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 8unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 9of the Department before being subject to placement in a 10correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 11has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.12    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 13age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 14the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 15preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 16child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 17placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 18clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 19in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 20Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 21those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 22guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 23Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 24facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 25of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 26maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for   SB1504- 20 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 2However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 3where children require specialized care and treatment for 4problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 5social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 6facilities for the placement of such children are not 7available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 8this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 9be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 10garnishment or otherwise.11    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 12welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 13sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 14minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 15subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 161987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 17provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 18yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 19responsibility for the development and delivery of services 20under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 21under this Section through the Department of Children and 22Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 23Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 24shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 25an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 26the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A   SB1504- 21 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 2youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 3Department shall continue child welfare services under this 4Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 5of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 6self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 7The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 8clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 9child welfare services under this Section and how such 10services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 11Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 12disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 13adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 14minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 15independent adults. 16    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 17review and appeal process for children and families who 18request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 19Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 20agencies, and foster families with whom those youth are 21placed, shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal 22rights as children and families in the case of placement by the 23Department, including the right to an initial review of a 24private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 25ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 26youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children   SB1504- 22 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1and foster families. The Department shall accept for 2administrative review and an appeal hearing a complaint made 3by (i) a child or foster family concerning a decision 4following an initial review by a private child welfare agency 5or (ii) a prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation 6of subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 7concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 8conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 9current foster home placement is necessary and appropriate 10under Section 2-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not 11constitute a judicial determination on the merits of an 12administrative appeal, filed by a former foster parent, 13involving a change of placement decision.14    (p) (Blank).15    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 16for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 17money or other property which is received on behalf of such 18children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 19or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 20the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 215.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 22under Section 5.46.23    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 24interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 25institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 26responsible and who have been determined eligible for   SB1504- 23 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 2allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 3parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 4Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 5miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 6be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 7with this subsection.8    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 9Department shall:10        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 11    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 12    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 13    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 14    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 15    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 16    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 17    account for any purpose.18        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 19    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 20    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 21    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 22    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 23    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 24    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 25    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 26    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.  SB1504- 24 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 2    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 3    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 4    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 5    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.6    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 7encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 8the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 9who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 10hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 11of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 12of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 13Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 14confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 15of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 16adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 17such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 18agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 19Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 20confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 21of the child.22    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 23establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and 24private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the 25Department of Children and Family Services for damages 26sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or   SB1504- 25 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third 2party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions 3of foster children to other individuals. Such coverage will be 4secondary to the foster parent liability insurance policy, if 5applicable. The program shall be funded through appropriations 6from the General Revenue Fund, specifically designated for 7such purposes.8    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 9investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 10as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 11Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:12        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 13    directs the Department to perform such services; and14        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 15    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 16    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 17    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 18    party is financially able to pay.19    The Department shall provide written notification to the 20court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 21and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 22The Department shall send to the court information related to 23the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 24determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The 25court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.26    (u) In addition to other information that must be   SB1504- 26 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1provided, whenever the Department places a child with a 2prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster 3home, group home, or child care institution, or in a relative 4home, the Department shall provide to the prospective adoptive 5parent or parents or other caretaker:6        (1) available detailed information concerning the 7    child's educational and health history, copies of 8    immunization records (including insurance and medical card 9    information), a history of the child's previous 10    placements, if any, and reasons for placement changes 11    excluding any information that identifies or reveals the 12    location of any previous caretaker;13        (2) a copy of the child's portion of the client 14    service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and 15    all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; 16    and17        (3) information containing details of the child's 18    individualized educational plan when the child is 19    receiving special education services.20    The caretaker shall be informed of any known social or 21behavioral information (including, but not limited to, 22criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual 23abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to 24care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently 25in the home. The Department may prepare a written summary of 26the information required by this paragraph, which may be   SB1504- 27 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1provided to the foster or prospective adoptive parent in 2advance of a placement. The foster or prospective adoptive 3parent may review the supporting documents in the child's file 4in the presence of casework staff. In the case of an emergency 5placement, casework staff shall at least provide known 6information verbally, if necessary, and must subsequently 7provide the information in writing as required by this 8subsection. 9    The information described in this subsection shall be 10provided in writing. In the case of emergency placements when 11time does not allow prior review, preparation, and collection 12of written information, the Department shall provide such 13information as it becomes available. Within 10 business days 14after placement, the Department shall obtain from the 15prospective adoptive parent or parents or other caretaker a 16signed verification of receipt of the information provided. 17Within 10 business days after placement, the Department shall 18provide to the child's guardian ad litem a copy of the 19information provided to the prospective adoptive parent or 20parents or other caretaker. The information provided to the 21prospective adoptive parent or parents or other caretaker 22shall be reviewed and approved regarding accuracy at the 23supervisory level. 24    (u-5) Effective July 1, 1995, only foster care placements 25licensed as foster family homes pursuant to the Child Care Act 26of 1969 shall be eligible to receive foster care payments from   SB1504- 28 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1the Department. Relative caregivers who, as of July 1, 1995, 2were approved pursuant to approved relative placement rules 3previously promulgated by the Department at 89 Ill. Adm. Code 4335 and had submitted an application for licensure as a foster 5family home may continue to receive foster care payments only 6until the Department determines that they may be licensed as a 7foster family home or that their application for licensure is 8denied or until September 30, 1995, whichever occurs first.9    (v) The Department shall access criminal history record 10information as defined in the Illinois Uniform Conviction 11Information Act and information maintained in the adjudicatory 12and dispositional record system as defined in Section 2605-355 13of the Illinois State Police Law if the Department determines 14the information is necessary to perform its duties under the 15Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, the Child Care Act 16of 1969, and the Children and Family Services Act. The 17Department shall provide for interactive computerized 18communication and processing equipment that permits direct 19on-line communication with the Illinois State Police's central 20criminal history data repository. The Department shall comply 21with all certification requirements and provide certified 22operators who have been trained by personnel from the Illinois 23State Police. In addition, one Office of the Inspector General 24investigator shall have training in the use of the criminal 25history information access system and have access to the 26terminal. The Department of Children and Family Services and   SB1504- 29 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1its employees shall abide by rules and regulations established 2by the Illinois State Police relating to the access and 3dissemination of this information.4    (v-1) Prior to final approval for placement of a child, 5the Department shall conduct a criminal records background 6check of the prospective foster or adoptive parent, including 7fingerprint-based checks of national crime information 8databases. Final approval for placement shall not be granted 9if the record check reveals a felony conviction for child 10abuse or neglect, for spousal abuse, for a crime against 11children, or for a crime involving violence, including rape, 12sexual assault, or homicide, but not including other physical 13assault or battery, or if there is a felony conviction for 14physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense committed 15within the past 5 years.16    (v-2) Prior to final approval for placement of a child, 17the Department shall check its child abuse and neglect 18registry for information concerning prospective foster and 19adoptive parents, and any adult living in the home.

The Juvenile Court Act of 1987 is amended by 11changing Sections 2-28, 2-33, and 5-745 and by adding Section 122-28.2 as follows: 13    (705 ILCS 405/2-28)14    Sec. 2-28. Court review. 15    (1) The court may require any legal custodian or guardian 16of the person appointed under this Act to report periodically 17to the court or may cite the legal custodian or guardian into 18court and require the legal custodian, guardian, or the legal 19custodian's or guardian's agency to make a full and accurate 20report of the doings of the legal custodian, guardian, or 21agency on behalf of the minor. The custodian or guardian, 22within 10 days after such citation, or earlier if the court 23determines it to be necessary to protect the health, safety, 24or welfare of the minor, shall make the report, either in   SB1504- 37 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1writing verified by affidavit or orally under oath in open 2court, or otherwise as the court directs. Upon the hearing of 3the report the court may remove the custodian or guardian and 4appoint another in the custodian's or guardian's stead or 5restore the minor to the custody of the minor's parents or 6former guardian or custodian. However, custody of the minor 7shall not be restored to any parent, guardian, or legal 8custodian in any case in which the minor is found to be 9neglected or abused under Section 2-3 or dependent under 10Section 2-4 of this Act, unless the minor can be cared for at 11home without endangering the minor's health or safety and it 12is in the best interests of the minor, and if such neglect, 13abuse, or dependency is found by the court under paragraph (1) 14of Section 2-21 of this Act to have come about due to the acts 15or omissions or both of such parent, guardian, or legal 16custodian, until such time as an investigation is made as 17provided in paragraph (5) and a hearing is held on the issue of 18the fitness of such parent, guardian, or legal custodian to 19care for the minor and the court enters an order that such 20parent, guardian, or legal custodian is fit to care for the 21minor.22    (1.5) The public agency that is the custodian or guardian 23of the minor shall file a written report with the court no 24later than 15 days after a minor in the agency's care remains:25        (1) in a shelter placement beyond 30 days;26        (2) in a psychiatric hospital past the time when the   SB1504- 38 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    minor is clinically ready for discharge or beyond medical 2    necessity for the minor's health; or3        (3) in a detention center or Department of Juvenile 4    Justice facility solely because the public agency cannot 5    find an appropriate placement for the minor.6    The report shall explain the steps the agency is taking to 7ensure the minor is placed appropriately, how the minor's 8needs are being met in the minor's shelter placement, and if a 9future placement has been identified by the Department, why 10the anticipated placement is appropriate for the needs of the 11minor and the anticipated placement date. 12    (1.6) Within 30 days after placing a child in its care in a 13qualified residential treatment program, as defined by the 14federal Social Security Act, the Department of Children and 15Family Services shall prepare a written report for filing with 16the court and send copies of the report to all parties. Within 1720 days of the filing of the report, or as soon thereafter as 18the court's schedule allows but not more than 60 days from the 19date of placement, the court shall hold a hearing to consider 20the Department's report and determine whether placement of the 21child in a qualified residential treatment program provides 22the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child 23in the least restrictive environment and if the placement is 24consistent with the short-term and long-term goals for the 25child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child. The 26court shall approve or disapprove the placement. If   SB1504- 39 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1applicable, the requirements of Sections 2-27.1 and 2-27.2 2must also be met. The Department's written report and the 3court's written determination shall be included in and made 4part of the case plan for the child. If the child remains 5placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the 6Department shall submit evidence at each status and permanency 7hearing: 8        (1) demonstrating that on-going assessment of the 9    strengths and needs of the child continues to support the 10    determination that the child's needs cannot be met through 11    placement in a foster family home, that the placement 12    provides the most effective and appropriate level of care 13    for the child in the least restrictive, appropriate 14    environment, and that the placement is consistent with the 15    short-term and long-term permanency goal for the child, as 16    specified in the permanency plan for the child; 17        (2) documenting the specific treatment or service 18    needs that should be met for the child in the placement and 19    the length of time the child is expected to need the 20    treatment or services; and 21        (3) the efforts made by the agency to prepare the 22    child to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing 23    relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a 24    foster family home. 25    (2) The first permanency hearing shall be conducted by the 26judge. Subsequent permanency hearings may be heard by a judge   SB1504- 40 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1or by hearing officers appointed or approved by the court in 2the manner set forth in Section 2-28.1 of this Act. The initial 3hearing shall be held (a) within 12 months from the date 4temporary custody was taken, regardless of whether an 5adjudication or dispositional hearing has been completed 6within that time frame, (b) if the parental rights of both 7parents have been terminated in accordance with the procedure 8described in subsection (5) of Section 2-21, within 30 days of 9the order for termination of parental rights and appointment 10of a guardian with power to consent to adoption, or (c) in 11accordance with subsection (2) of Section 2-13.1. Subsequent 12permanency hearings shall be held every 6 months or more 13frequently if necessary in the court's determination following 14the initial permanency hearing, in accordance with the 15standards set forth in this Section, until the court 16determines that the plan and goal have been achieved. Once the 17plan and goal have been achieved, if the minor remains in 18substitute care, the case shall be reviewed at least every 6 19months thereafter, subject to the provisions of this Section, 20unless the minor is placed in the guardianship of a suitable 21relative or other person and the court determines that further 22monitoring by the court does not further the health, safety, 23or best interest of the child and that this is a stable 24permanent placement. The permanency hearings must occur within 25the time frames set forth in this subsection and may not be 26delayed in anticipation of a report from any source or due to   SB1504- 41 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1the agency's failure to timely file its written report (this 2written report means the one required under the next paragraph 3and does not mean the service plan also referred to in that 4paragraph).5    The public agency that is the custodian or guardian of the 6minor, or another agency responsible for the minor's care, 7shall ensure that all parties to the permanency hearings are 8provided a copy of the most recent service plan prepared 9within the prior 6 months at least 14 days in advance of the 10hearing. If not contained in the agency's service plan, the 11agency shall also include a report setting forth (i) any 12special physical, psychological, educational, medical, 13emotional, or other needs of the minor or the minor's family 14that are relevant to a permanency or placement determination 15and (ii) for any minor age 16 or over, a written description of 16the programs and services that will enable the minor to 17prepare for independent living. If not contained in the 18agency's service plan, the agency's report shall specify if a 19minor is placed in a licensed child care facility under a 20corrective plan by the Department due to concerns impacting 21the minor's safety and well-being. The report shall explain 22the steps the Department is taking to ensure the safety and 23well-being of the minor and that the minor's needs are met in 24the facility. The agency's written report must detail what 25progress or lack of progress the parent has made in correcting 26the conditions requiring the child to be in care; whether the   SB1504- 42 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1child can be returned home without jeopardizing the child's 2health, safety, and welfare, and, if not, what permanency goal 3is recommended to be in the best interests of the child, and 4why the other permanency goals are not appropriate. The 5caseworker must appear and testify at the permanency hearing. 6If a permanency hearing has not previously been scheduled by 7the court, the moving party shall move for the setting of a 8permanency hearing and the entry of an order within the time 9frames set forth in this subsection.10    At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine the 11future status of the child. The court shall set one of the 12following permanency goals:13        (A) The minor will be returned home by a specific date 14    within 5 months.15        (B) The minor will be in short-term care with a 16    continued goal to return home within a period not to 17    exceed one year, where the progress of the parent or 18    parents is substantial giving particular consideration to 19    the age and individual needs of the minor.20        (B-1) The minor will be in short-term care with a 21    continued goal to return home pending a status hearing. 22    When the court finds that a parent has not made reasonable 23    efforts or reasonable progress to date, the court shall 24    identify what actions the parent and the Department must 25    take in order to justify a finding of reasonable efforts 26    or reasonable progress and shall set a status hearing to   SB1504- 43 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    be held not earlier than 9 months from the date of 2    adjudication nor later than 11 months from the date of 3    adjudication during which the parent's progress will again 4    be reviewed.5        (C) The minor will be in substitute care pending court 6    determination on termination of parental rights.7        (D) Adoption, provided that parental rights have been 8    terminated or relinquished.9        (E) The guardianship of the minor will be transferred 10    to an individual or couple on a permanent basis provided 11    that goals (A) through (D) have been deemed inappropriate 12    and not in the child's best interests. The court shall 13    confirm that the Department has discussed adoption, if 14    appropriate, and guardianship with the caregiver prior to 15    changing a goal to guardianship.16        (F) The minor over age 15 will be in substitute care 17    pending independence. In selecting this permanency goal, 18    the Department of Children and Family Services may provide 19    services to enable reunification and to strengthen the 20    minor's connections with family, fictive kin, and other 21    responsible adults, provided the services are in the 22    minor's best interest. The services shall be documented in 23    the service plan. 24        (G) The minor will be in substitute care because the 25    minor cannot be provided for in a home environment due to 26    developmental disabilities or mental illness or because   SB1504- 44 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    the minor is a danger to self or others, provided that 2    goals (A) through (D) have been deemed inappropriate and 3    not in the child's best interests.4    In selecting any permanency goal, the court shall indicate 5in writing the reasons the goal was selected and why the 6preceding goals were deemed inappropriate and not in the 7child's best interest. Where the court has selected a 8permanency goal other than (A), (B), or (B-1), the Department 9of Children and Family Services shall not provide further 10reunification services, except as provided in paragraph (F) of 11this subsection (2), but shall provide services consistent 12with the goal selected.13        (H) Notwithstanding any other provision in this 14    Section, the court may select the goal of continuing 15    foster care as a permanency goal if: 16            (1) The Department of Children and Family Services 17        has custody and guardianship of the minor; 18            (2) The court has deemed all other permanency 19        goals inappropriate based on the child's best 20        interest; 21            (3) The court has found compelling reasons, based 22        on written documentation reviewed by the court, to 23        place the minor in continuing foster care. Compelling 24        reasons include: 25                (a) the child does not wish to be adopted or to 26            be placed in the guardianship of the minor's   SB1504- 45 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1            relative or foster care placement; 2                (b) the child exhibits an extreme level of 3            need such that the removal of the child from the 4            minor's placement would be detrimental to the 5            child; or 6                (c) the child who is the subject of the 7            permanency hearing has existing close and strong 8            bonds with a sibling, and achievement of another 9            permanency goal would substantially interfere with 10            the subject child's sibling relationship, taking 11            into consideration the nature and extent of the 12            relationship, and whether ongoing contact is in 13            the subject child's best interest, including 14            long-term emotional interest, as compared with the 15            legal and emotional benefit of permanence; 16            (4) The child has lived with the relative or 17        foster parent for at least one year; and 18            (5) The relative or foster parent currently caring 19        for the child is willing and capable of providing the 20        child with a stable and permanent environment. 21    The court shall set a permanency goal that is in the best 22interest of the child. In determining that goal, the court 23shall consult with the minor in an age-appropriate manner 24regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan for the 25minor. The court's determination shall include the following 26factors:  SB1504- 46 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (1) Age of the child.2        (2) Options available for permanence, including both 3    out-of-state and in-state placement options.4        (3) Current placement of the child and the intent of 5    the family regarding adoption.6        (4) Emotional, physical, and mental status or 7    condition of the child.8        (5) Types of services previously offered and whether 9    or not the services were successful and, if not 10    successful, the reasons the services failed.11        (6) Availability of services currently needed and 12    whether the services exist.13        (7) Status of siblings of the minor.14    The court shall consider (i) the permanency goal contained 15in the service plan, (ii) the appropriateness of the services 16contained in the plan and whether those services have been 17provided, (iii) whether reasonable efforts have been made by 18all the parties to the service plan to achieve the goal, and 19(iv) whether the plan and goal have been achieved. All 20evidence relevant to determining these questions, including 21oral and written reports, may be admitted and may be relied on 22to the extent of their probative value.23    The court shall make findings as to whether, in violation 24of Section 8.2 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting 25Act, any portion of the service plan compels a child or parent 26to engage in any activity or refrain from any activity that is   SB1504- 47 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1not reasonably related to remedying a condition or conditions 2that gave rise or which could give rise to any finding of child 3abuse or neglect. The services contained in the service plan 4shall include services reasonably related to remedy the 5conditions that gave rise to removal of the child from the home 6of the child's parents, guardian, or legal custodian or that 7the court has found must be remedied prior to returning the 8child home. Any tasks the court requires of the parents, 9guardian, or legal custodian or child prior to returning the 10child home must be reasonably related to remedying a condition 11or conditions that gave rise to or which could give rise to any 12finding of child abuse or neglect. 13    If the permanency goal is to return home, the court shall 14make findings that identify any problems that are causing 15continued placement of the children away from the home and 16identify what outcomes would be considered a resolution to 17these problems. The court shall explain to the parents that 18these findings are based on the information that the court has 19at that time and may be revised, should additional evidence be 20presented to the court. 21    The court shall review the Sibling Contact Support Plan 22developed or modified under subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of 23the Children and Family Services Act, if applicable. If the 24Department has not convened a meeting to develop or modify a 25Sibling Contact Support Plan, or if the court finds that the 26existing Plan is not in the child's best interest, the court   SB1504- 48 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1may enter an order requiring the Department to develop, 2modify, or implement a Sibling Contact Support Plan, or order 3mediation. 4    If the goal has been achieved, the court shall enter 5orders that are necessary to conform the minor's legal custody 6and status to those findings.7    If, after receiving evidence, the court determines that 8the services contained in the plan are not reasonably 9calculated to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, 10the court shall put in writing the factual basis supporting 11the determination and enter specific findings based on the 12evidence. The court also shall enter an order for the 13Department to develop and implement a new service plan or to 14implement changes to the current service plan consistent with 15the court's findings. The new service plan shall be filed with 16the court and served on all parties within 45 days of the date 17of the order. The court shall continue the matter until the new 18service plan is filed. Except as authorized by subsection 19(2.5) of this Section and as otherwise specifically authorized 20by law, the court is not empowered under this Section to order 21specific placements, specific services, or specific service 22providers to be included in the service plan.23    A guardian or custodian appointed by the court pursuant to 24this Act shall file updated case plans with the court every 6 25months.26    Rights of wards of the court under this Act are   SB1504- 49 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1enforceable against any public agency by complaints for relief 2by mandamus filed in any proceedings brought under this Act.3    (2.5) If, after reviewing the evidence, including evidence 4from the Department, the court determines that the minor's 5current or planned placement is not necessary or appropriate 6to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court 7shall put in writing the factual basis supporting its 8determination and enter specific findings based on the 9evidence. If the court finds that the minor's current or 10planned placement is not necessary or appropriate, the court 11may enter an order directing the Department to implement a 12recommendation by the minor's treating clinician or a 13clinician contracted by the Department to evaluate the minor 14or a recommendation made by the Department.
