The Department may continue to provide financial 17assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was 18determined eligible for financial assistance under this 19subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the 20child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization 21of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or 22parents.

The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 2services as soon as the report is determined to be 3"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 4family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 5or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 6investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 7Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 8willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 9investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 10child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 11child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 12services available from other agencies in the community, even 13if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 14in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 15subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 16child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 17voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 18child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 19alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 20"differential response program" provided for in subsection 21(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 22Reporting Act.23    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 24children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 25care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 26as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor   SB1504 Enrolled- 12 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 2Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 3be committed to the Department by any court without the 4approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 5effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 62017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 7Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 8adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 9or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 10less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 11Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 12for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 13exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 14minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 15to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 162-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 172017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 18Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 19adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 20or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 21less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 22Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 23for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 24exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 25minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 26to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section   SB1504 Enrolled- 13 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b12-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 2exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 3or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 4circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 5delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 6attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 7the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 8hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 9release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 10    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 11date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 12implement a special program of family preservation services to 13support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 14experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 15stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 16pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 17that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 18safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 19family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 20and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 21the child or family to services available from other agencies 22in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 23home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 24future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 25of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 26develop and implement a public information campaign to alert   SB1504 Enrolled- 14 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1health and social service providers and the general public 2about these special family preservation services. The nature 3and scope of the services offered and the number of families 4served under the special program implemented under this 5paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 6Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 7"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 8a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 9Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 10edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 11Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.12    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 13interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 14most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 15possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 16the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 17concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 18earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 19include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of 20the family when the child can be cared for at home without 21endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 22the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 23is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 24permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.25    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 26respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in   SB1504 Enrolled- 15 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 2shall be the paramount concern.3    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 4shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 5prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 6child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 7reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 8occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 9Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 10where the Department believes that further reunification 11services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 12the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 13The Department is not required to provide further 14reunification services after such a finding.15    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 16made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 17best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 18also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 19placement made is the best available placement to provide 20permanency for the child.21    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 22planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 23shall consider the following factors when determining 24appropriateness of concurrent planning:25        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;26        (2) the past history of the family;  SB1504 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 2    the family;3        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;4        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 5    family to reunite;6        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 7    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;8        (7) the age of the child;9        (8) placement of siblings.10    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 11child if:12        (1) it has received a written consent to such 13    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 14    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 15    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 16    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 17    or18        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 19    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 20    located.21If the child is found in the child's residence without a 22parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 23Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 24temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 25Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 26guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a   SB1504 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 2and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 3relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 4child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 5a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 6such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 7resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 8home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 9follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 105-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.11    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 12and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 13pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 14Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 15custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 16Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 17acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 18limited custody, the Department, during the period of 19temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 20judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 215-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 22authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 23of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 24the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.25    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 26custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical   SB1504 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1examination.2    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 3temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 4the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 5Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 6the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 7The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 810 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 9the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 10Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 11Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 12the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 13the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 14custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 15later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 16the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 17temporary custody of the child shall terminate.18    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 19age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 20that cares for children who are in need of secure living 21arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 22determination is made by the facility director and the 23Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 24facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 25of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 26subject to placement in a correctional facility operated   SB1504 Enrolled- 19 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 2unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 3of the Department before being subject to placement in a 4correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 5has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.6    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 7age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 8the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 9preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 10child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 11placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 12clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 13in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 14Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 15those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 16guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 17Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 18facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 19of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 20maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 21dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 22However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 23where children require specialized care and treatment for 24problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 25social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 26facilities for the placement of such children are not   SB1504 Enrolled- 20 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 2this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 3be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 4garnishment or otherwise.5    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 6welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 7sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 8minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 9subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 101987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 11provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 12yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 13responsibility for the development and delivery of services 14under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 15under this Section through the Department of Children and 16Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 17Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 18shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 19an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 20the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 21homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 22youth receiving child welfare services under this Section.

The Department may also provide categories of 4financial assistance and education assistance grants, and 5shall establish rules and regulations for the assistance and 6grants, to persons appointed guardian of the person under 7Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, 84-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 for children 9who were youth in care for 12 months immediately prior to the 10appointment of the guardian.11    The amount of assistance may vary, depending upon the 12needs of the child and the adoptive parents or subsidized 13guardians, as set forth in the annual assistance agreement. 14Special purpose grants are allowed where the child requires 15special service but such costs may not exceed the amounts 16which similar services would cost the Department if it were to 17provide or secure them as guardian of the child.18    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 19inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, 20garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 21a judgment or debt.22    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 23of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 24either outside of the Department region handling the case, or 25outside of the State of Illinois.26    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any   SB1504 Enrolled- 42 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 2dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 3or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.4    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 5services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and 6Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including 7adoptive and extended families. Family preservation services 8shall be offered (i) to prevent the placement of children in 9substitute care when the children can be cared for at home or 10in the custody of the person responsible for the children's 11welfare, (ii) to reunite children with their families, or 12(iii) to maintain an adoption or subsidized guardianship. 13Family preservation services shall only be offered when doing 14so will not endanger the children's health or safety. With 15respect to children who are in substitute care pursuant to the 16Juvenile Court Act of 1987, family preservation services shall 17not be offered if a goal other than those of subdivisions (A), 18(B), or (B-1) of subsection (2.3) of Section 2-28 of that Act 19has been set, except that reunification services may be 20offered as provided in paragraph (F) of subsection (2.3) of 21Section 2-28 of that Act. Nothing in this paragraph shall be 22construed to create a private right of action or claim on the 23part of any individual or child welfare agency, except that 24when a child is the subject of an action under Article II of 25the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 and the child's service plan 26calls for services to facilitate achievement of the permanency   SB1504 Enrolled- 43 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1goal, the court hearing the action under Article II of the 2Juvenile Court Act of 1987 may order the Department to provide 3the services set out in the plan, if those services are not 4provided with reasonable promptness and if those services are 5available.6    The Department shall notify the child and the child's 7family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 8family preservation services as identified in the service 9plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 10services as soon as the report is determined to be 11"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 12family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 13or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 14investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 15Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 16willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 17investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 18child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 19child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 20services available from other agencies in the community, even 21if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 22in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 23subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 24child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 25voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 26child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an   SB1504 Enrolled- 44 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 2"differential response program" provided for in subsection 3(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 4Reporting Act.5    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 6children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 7care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 8as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 9requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 10Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 11be committed to the Department by any court without the 12approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 13effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 142017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 15Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 16adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 17or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 18less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 19Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 20for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 21exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 22minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 23to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 242-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 252017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 26Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or   SB1504 Enrolled- 45 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 2or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 3less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 4Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 5for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 6exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 7minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 8to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 92-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 10exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 11or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 12circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 13delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 14attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 15the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 16hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 17release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 18    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 19implement a special program of family preservation services to 20support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 21are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 22stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 23pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 24that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 25safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 26family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused   SB1504 Enrolled- 46 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 2the child or family to services available from other agencies 3in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 4home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 5future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 6of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 7develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 8health and social service providers and the general public 9about these special family preservation services. The nature 10and scope of the services offered and the number of families 11served under the special program implemented under this 12paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 13Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 14"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 15a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 16Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 17edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 18Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.19    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 20interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 21most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 22option for the child, consistent with the child's best 23interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 24Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is 25practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General 26Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family   SB1504 Enrolled- 47 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 2occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 3arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 4outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 5at home without endangering the child's health or safety; 6reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if 7temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 8toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 9status.10    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 11respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 12making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 13shall be the paramount concern.14    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 15shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 16prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 17child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 18reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 19occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 20Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 21where the Department believes that further reunification 22services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 23the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 24The Department is not required to provide further 25reunification services after such a finding.26    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be   SB1504 Enrolled- 48 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 2best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 3place the child with a relative, document those diligent 4efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 5secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue 6preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative 7is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 8concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 9Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 10in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 112025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 12diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 13relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 14should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 15delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 16permanent placement for the child.17    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 18planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 19shall consider the following factors when determining 20appropriateness of concurrent planning:21        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;22        (2) the past history of the family;23        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 24    the family;25        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;26        (4.5) the child's wishes;   SB1504 Enrolled- 49 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 2    family to reunite;3        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 4    provide a permanent placement;5        (7) the age of the child;6        (8) placement of siblings; and7        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 8    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 9    the child. 10    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 11child if:12        (1) it has received a written consent to such 13    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 14    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 15    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 16    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 17    or18        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 19    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 20    located.21If the child is found in the child's residence without a 22parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 23Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 24temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 25Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 26guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a   SB1504 Enrolled- 50 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 2and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 3relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 4child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 5a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 6such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 7resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 8home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 9follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 105-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.11    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 12and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 13pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 14Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 15custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 16Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 17acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 18limited custody, the Department, during the period of 19temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 20judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 215-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 22authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 23of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 24the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.25    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 26custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical   SB1504 Enrolled- 51 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1examination.2    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 3temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 4the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 5Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 6the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 7The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 810 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 9the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 10Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 11Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 12the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 13the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 14custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 15later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 16the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 17temporary custody of the child shall terminate.18    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 19age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 20that cares for children who are in need of secure living 21arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 22determination is made by the facility director and the 23Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 24facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 25of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 26subject to placement in a correctional facility operated   SB1504 Enrolled- 52 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 2unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 3of the Department before being subject to placement in a 4correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 5has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.6    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 7age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 8the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 9preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 10child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 11placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 12clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 13in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 14Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 15those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 16guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 17Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 18facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 19of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 20maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 21dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 22However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 23where children require specialized care and treatment for 24problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 25social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 26facilities for the placement of such children are not   SB1504 Enrolled- 53 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 2this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 3be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 4garnishment or otherwise.5    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 6welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 7sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 8minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 9subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 101987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 11provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 12yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 13responsibility for the development and delivery of services 14under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 15under this Section through the Department of Children and 16Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 17Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 18shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 19an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 20the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 21homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 22youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 23Department shall continue child welfare services under this 24Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 25of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 26self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan.   SB1504 Enrolled- 54 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 2clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 3child welfare services under this Section and how such 4services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 5Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 6disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 7adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 8minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 9independent adults. 10    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 11review and appeal process for children and families who 12request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 13Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 14agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 15shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 16children and families in the case of placement by the 17Department, including the right to an initial review of a 18private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 19ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 20youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 21and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 22Department shall accept for administrative review and an 23appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 24with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following 25an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a 26prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of   SB1504 Enrolled- 55 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 2concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 3conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 4current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 52-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a 6judicial determination on the merits of an administrative 7appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 8placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 9shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 10review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 11placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 12identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 13criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 14interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 15of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 16multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 17rules regarding placement changes shall be followed. The rules 18shall outline the essential elements of each form used in the 19implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this 20amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 21    (p) (Blank).22    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 23for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 24money or other property which is received on behalf of such 25children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 26or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of   SB1504 Enrolled- 56 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 25.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 3under Section 5.46.4    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 5interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 6institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 7responsible and who have been determined eligible for 8Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 9allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 10parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 11Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 12miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 13be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 14with this subsection.15    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 16Department shall:17        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 18    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 19    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 20    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 21    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 22    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 23    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 24    account for any purpose.25        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 26    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care   SB1504 Enrolled- 57 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 2    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 3    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 4    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 5    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 6    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 7    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.8        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 9    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 10    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 11    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 12    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.13    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 14encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 15the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 16who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 17hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 18of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 19of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 20Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 21confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 22of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 23adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 24such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 25agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists.

If the child remains 4placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the 5Department shall submit evidence at each status and permanency 6hearing: 7        (A) demonstrating that on-going assessment of the 8    strengths and needs of the child continues to support the 9    determination that the child's needs cannot be met through 10    placement in a foster family home, that the placement 11    provides the most effective and appropriate level of care 12    for the child in the least restrictive, appropriate 13    environment, and that the placement is consistent with the 14    short-term and long-term permanency goal for the child, as 15    specified in the permanency plan for the child; 16        (B) documenting the specific treatment or service 17    needs that should be met for the child in the placement and 18    the length of time the child is expected to need the 19    treatment or services; 20        (C) detailing the efforts made by the agency to 21    prepare the child to return home or to be placed with a fit 22    and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive 23    parent, or in a foster family home; and 24        (D) beginning July 1, 2025, documenting the 25    Department's efforts regarding ongoing family finding and 26    relative engagement required under Section 2-27.3; and .   SB1504 Enrolled- 79 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (E) detailing efforts to ensure the minor is engaged 2    in age and developmentally appropriate activities to 3    develop life skills, which may include extracurricular 4    activities, coaching by caregivers, or instruction in 5    individual or group settings. For minors who have 6    participated in life skills assessments, the results of 7    such assessments and how the minor's identified needs are 8    being addressed. 9    (2) The first permanency hearing shall be conducted by the 10judge. Subsequent permanency hearings may be heard by a judge 11or by hearing officers appointed or approved by the court in 12the manner set forth in Section 2-28.1 of this Act. The initial 13hearing shall be held (a) within 12 months from the date 14temporary custody was taken, regardless of whether an 15adjudication or dispositional hearing has been completed 16within that time frame, (b) if the parental rights of both 17parents have been terminated in accordance with the procedure 18described in subsection (5) of Section 2-21, within 30 days of 19the order for termination of parental rights and appointment 20of a guardian with power to consent to adoption, or (c) in 21accordance with subsection (2) of Section 2-13.1. Subsequent 22permanency hearings shall be held every 6 months or more 23frequently if necessary in the court's determination following 24the initial permanency hearing, in accordance with the 25standards set forth in this Section, until the court 26determines that the plan and goal have been achieved. Once the   SB1504 Enrolled- 80 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1plan and goal have been achieved, if the minor remains in 2substitute care, the case shall be reviewed at least every 6 3months thereafter, subject to the provisions of this Section, 4unless the minor is placed in the guardianship of a suitable 5relative or other person and the court determines that further 6monitoring by the court does not further the health, safety, 7or best interest of the child and that this is a stable 8permanent placement. The permanency hearings must occur within 9the time frames set forth in this subsection and may not be 10delayed in anticipation of a report from any source or due to 11the agency's failure to timely file its written report (this 12written report means the one required under the next paragraph 13and does not mean the service plan also referred to in that 14paragraph).15    The public agency that is the custodian or guardian of the 16minor, or another agency responsible for the minor's care, 17shall ensure that all parties to the permanency hearings are 18provided a copy of the most recent service plan prepared 19within the prior 6 months at least 14 days in advance of the 20hearing. If not contained in the agency's service plan, the 21agency shall also include a report setting forth the 22following:23        (A) any special physical, psychological, educational, 24    medical, emotional, or other needs of the minor or the 25    minor's family that are relevant to a permanency or 26    placement determination, and for any minor age 16 or over,   SB1504 Enrolled- 81 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    a written description of the programs and services that 2    will enable the minor to prepare for independent living; 3        (B) beginning July 1, 2025, a written description of 4    ongoing family finding and relative engagement efforts in 5    accordance with the requirements under Section 2-27.3 the 6    agency has undertaken since the most recent report to the 7    court to plan for the emotional and legal permanency of 8    the minor;9        (C) whether a minor is placed in a licensed child care 10    facility under a corrective plan by the Department due to 11    concerns impacting the minor's safety and well-being. The 12    report shall explain the steps the Department is taking to 13    ensure the safety and well-being of the minor and that the 14    minor's needs are met in the facility;15        (D) detail regarding what progress or lack of progress 16    the parent has made in correcting the conditions requiring 17    the child to be in care; whether the child can be returned 18    home without jeopardizing the child's health, safety, and 19    welfare, what permanency goal is recommended to be in the 20    best interests of the child, and the reasons for the 21    recommendation. If a permanency goal under paragraph (A), 22    (B), or (B-1) of subsection (2.3) have been deemed 23    inappropriate and not in the minor's best interest, the 24    report must include the following information:25            (i) confirmation that the caseworker has discussed 26        the permanency options and subsidies available for   SB1504 Enrolled- 82 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        guardianship and adoption with the minor's caregivers, 2        the minor's parents, as appropriate, and has discussed 3        the available permanency options with the minor in an 4        age-appropriate manner;5            (ii) confirmation that the caseworker has 6        discussed with the minor's caregivers, the minor's 7        parents, as appropriate, and the minor as 8        age-appropriate, the distinctions between guardianship 9        and adoption, including, but not limited to, that 10        guardianship does not require termination of the 11        parent's rights or the consent of the parent;12            (iii) a description of the stated preferences and 13        concerns, if any, the minor, the parent as 14        appropriate, and the caregiver expressed relating to 15        the options of guardianship and adoption, and the 16        reasons for the preferences;17            (iv) if the minor is not currently in a placement 18        that will provide permanency, identification of all 19        persons presently willing and able to provide 20        permanency to the minor through either guardianship or 21        adoption, and beginning July 1, 2025, if none are 22        available, a description of the efforts made in 23        accordance with Section 2-27.3; and24            (v) state the recommended permanency goal, why 25        that goal is recommended, and why the other potential 26        goals were not recommended.   SB1504 Enrolled- 83 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    The caseworker must appear and testify at the permanency 2hearing. If a permanency hearing has not previously been 3scheduled by the court, the moving party shall move for the 4setting of a permanency hearing and the entry of an order 5within the time frames set forth in this subsection.6    (2.3) At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine 7the permanency goal of the child. The court shall set one of 8the following permanency goals:9        (A) The minor will be returned home by a specific date 10    within 5 months.11        (B) The minor will be in short-term care with a 12    continued goal to return home within a period not to 13    exceed one year, where the progress of the parent or 14    parents is substantial giving particular consideration to 15    the age and individual needs of the minor.16        (B-1) The minor will be in short-term care with a 17    continued goal to return home pending a status hearing. 18    When the court finds that a parent has not made reasonable 19    efforts or reasonable progress to date, the court shall 20    identify what actions the parent and the Department must 21    take in order to justify a finding of reasonable efforts 22    or reasonable progress and shall set a status hearing to 23    be held not earlier than 9 months from the date of 24    adjudication nor later than 11 months from the date of 25    adjudication during which the parent's progress will again 26    be reviewed.  SB1504 Enrolled- 84 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        If the court has determined that goals (A), (B), and 2    (B-1) are not appropriate and not in the minor's best 3    interest, the court may select one of the following goals: 4    (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) for the minor as appropriate and 5    based on the best interests of the minor. The court shall 6    determine the appropriate goal for the minor based on best 7    interest factors and any considerations outlined in that 8    goal. 9        (C) The guardianship of the minor shall be transferred 10    to an individual or couple on a permanent basis. Prior to 11    changing the goal to guardianship, the court shall 12    consider the following: 13            (i) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 14        guardianship with the caregiver and what preference, 15        if any, the caregiver has as to the permanency goal;16            (ii) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 17        guardianship with the minor, as age-appropriate, and 18        what preference, if any, the minor has as to the 19        permanency goal;20            (iii) whether the minor is of sufficient age to 21        remember the minor's parents and if the child values 22        this familial identity;23            (iv) whether the minor is placed with a relative, 24        and beginning July 1, 2025, whether the minor is 25        placed in a relative home as defined in Section 4d of 26        the Children and Family Services Act or in a certified   SB1504 Enrolled- 85 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        relative caregiver home as defined in Section 2.36 of 2        the Child Care Act of 1969; and3            (v) whether the parent or parents have been 4        informed about guardianship and adoption, and, if 5        appropriate, what preferences, if any, the parent or 6        parents have as to the permanency goal. 7        (D) The minor will be in substitute care pending court 8    determination on termination of parental rights. Prior to 9    changing the goal to substitute care pending court 10    determination on termination of parental rights, the court 11    shall consider the following: 12            (i) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 13        guardianship with the caregiver and what preference, 14        if any, the caregiver has as to the permanency goal;15            (ii) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 16        guardianship with the minor, as age-appropriate, and 17        what preference, if any, the minor has as to the 18        permanency goal;19            (iii) whether the minor is of sufficient age to 20        remember the minor's parents and if the child values 21        this familial identity;22            (iv) whether the minor is placed with a relative, 23        and beginning July 1, 2025, whether the minor is 24        placed in a relative home as defined in Section 4d of 25        the Children and Family Services Act, in a certified 26        relative caregiver home as defined in Section 2.36 of   SB1504 Enrolled- 86 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        the Child Care Act of 1969;2            (v) whether the minor is already placed in a 3        pre-adoptive home, and if not, whether such a home has 4        been identified; and5            (vi) whether the parent or parents have been 6        informed about guardianship and adoption, and, if 7        appropriate, what preferences, if any, the parent or 8        parents have as to the permanency goal.9        (E) Adoption, provided that parental rights have been 10    terminated or relinquished.11        (F) Provided that permanency goals (A) through (E) 12    have been deemed inappropriate and not in the minor's best 13    interests, the minor over age 15 will be in substitute 14    care pending independence. In selecting this permanency 15    goal, the Department of Children and Family Services may 16    provide services to enable reunification and to strengthen 17    the minor's connections with family, fictive kin, and 18    other responsible adults, provided the services are in the 19    minor's best interest. The services shall be documented in 20    the service plan. 21        (G) The minor will be in substitute care because the 22    minor cannot be provided for in a home environment due to 23    developmental disabilities or mental illness or because 24    the minor is a danger to self or others, provided that 25    goals (A) through (E) have been deemed inappropriate and 26    not in the child's best interests.  SB1504 Enrolled- 87 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    In selecting any permanency goal, the court shall indicate 2in writing the reasons the goal was selected and why the 3preceding goals were deemed inappropriate and not in the 4child's best interest. Where the court has selected a 5permanency goal other than (A), (B), or (B-1), the Department 6of Children and Family Services shall not provide further 7reunification services, except as provided in paragraph (F) of 8this subsection (2.3), but shall provide services consistent 9with the goal selected.10        (H) Notwithstanding any other provision in this 11    Section, the court may select the goal of continuing 12    foster care as a permanency goal if: 13            (1) The Department of Children and Family Services 14        has custody and guardianship of the minor; 15            (2) The court has deemed all other permanency 16        goals inappropriate based on the child's best 17        interest; 18            (3) The court has found compelling reasons, based 19        on written documentation reviewed by the court, to 20        place the minor in continuing foster care. Compelling 21        reasons include: 22                (a) the child does not wish to be adopted or to 23            be placed in the guardianship of the minor's 24            relative, certified relative caregiver, or foster 25            care placement; 26                (b) the child exhibits an extreme level of   SB1504 Enrolled- 88 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1            need such that the removal of the child from the 2            minor's placement would be detrimental to the 3            child; or 4                (c) the child who is the subject of the 5            permanency hearing has existing close and strong 6            bonds with a sibling, and achievement of another 7            permanency goal would substantially interfere with 8            the subject child's sibling relationship, taking 9            into consideration the nature and extent of the 10            relationship, and whether ongoing contact is in 11            the subject child's best interest, including 12            long-term emotional interest, as compared with the 13            legal and emotional benefit of permanence; 14            (4) The child has lived with the relative, 15        certified relative caregiver, or foster parent for at 16        least one year; and 17            (5) The relative, certified relative caregiver, or 18        foster parent currently caring for the child is 19        willing and capable of providing the child with a 20        stable and permanent environment. 21    (2.4) The court shall set a permanency goal that is in the 22best interest of the child. In determining that goal, the 23court shall consult with the minor in an age-appropriate 24manner regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan 25for the minor. The court's determination shall include the 26following factors:  SB1504 Enrolled- 89 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (A) Age of the child.2        (B) Options available for permanence, including both 3    out-of-state and in-state placement options.4        (C) Current placement of the child and the intent of 5    the family regarding subsidized guardianship and adoption.6        (D) Emotional, physical, and mental status or 7    condition of the child.8        (E) Types of services previously offered and whether 9    or not the services were successful and, if not 10    successful, the reasons the services failed.11        (F) Availability of services currently needed and 12    whether the services exist.13        (G) Status of siblings of the minor.14        (H) If the minor is not currently in a placement 15    likely to achieve permanency, whether there is an 16    identified and willing potential permanent caregiver for 17    the minor, and if so, that potential permanent caregiver's 18    intent regarding guardianship and adoption. 19    The court shall consider (i) the permanency goal contained 20in the service plan, (ii) the appropriateness of the services 21contained in the plan and whether those services have been 22provided, (iii) whether reasonable efforts have been made by 23all the parties to the service plan to achieve the goal, and 24(iv) whether the plan and goal have been achieved. All 25evidence relevant to determining these questions, including 26oral and written reports, may be admitted and may be relied on   SB1504 Enrolled- 90 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1to the extent of their probative value.2    The court shall make findings as to whether, in violation 3of Section 8.2 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting 4Act, any portion of the service plan compels a child or parent 5to engage in any activity or refrain from any activity that is 6not reasonably related to remedying a condition or conditions 7that gave rise or which could give rise to any finding of child 8abuse or neglect. The services contained in the service plan 9shall include services reasonably related to remedy the 10conditions that gave rise to removal of the child from the home 11of the child's parents, guardian, or legal custodian or that 12the court has found must be remedied prior to returning the 13child home. Any tasks the court requires of the parents, 14guardian, or legal custodian or child prior to returning the 15child home must be reasonably related to remedying a condition 16or conditions that gave rise to or which could give rise to any 17finding of child abuse or neglect. 18    If the permanency goal is to return home, the court shall 19make findings that identify any problems that are causing 20continued placement of the children away from the home and 21identify what outcomes would be considered a resolution to 22these problems. The court shall explain to the parents that 23these findings are based on the information that the court has 24at that time and may be revised, should additional evidence be 25presented to the court. 26    The court shall review the Sibling Contact Support Plan   SB1504 Enrolled- 91 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1developed or modified under subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of 2the Children and Family Services Act, if applicable. If the 3Department has not convened a meeting to develop or modify a 4Sibling Contact Support Plan, or if the court finds that the 5existing Plan is not in the child's best interest, the court 6may enter an order requiring the Department to develop, 7modify, or implement a Sibling Contact Support Plan, or order 8mediation. 9    The court shall review the Department's efforts to provide 10the minor with age and developmentally appropriate life 11skills. If the court finds the Department's efforts are not in 12the minor's best interest, the court may enter an order 13requiring the Department to develop, modify, or implement the 14service plan to develop the minor's life skills in an age and 15developmentally appropriate manner. 16    Beginning July 1, 2025, the court shall review the Ongoing 17Family Finding and Relative Engagement Plan required under 18Section 2-27.3. If the court finds that the plan is not in the 19minor's best interest, the court shall enter specific factual 20findings and order the Department to modify the plan 21consistent with the court's findings. 22    If the goal has been achieved, the court shall enter 23orders that are necessary to conform the minor's legal custody 24and status to those findings.25    If, after receiving evidence, the court determines that 26the services contained in the plan are not reasonably   SB1504 Enrolled- 92 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1calculated to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, 2the court shall put in writing the factual basis supporting 3the determination and enter specific findings based on the 4evidence. The court also shall enter an order for the 5Department to develop and implement a new service plan or to 6implement changes to the current service plan consistent with 7the court's findings. The new service plan shall be filed with 8the court and served on all parties within 45 days of the date 9of the order. The court shall continue the matter until the new 10service plan is filed. Except as authorized by subsection 11(2.5) of this Section and as otherwise specifically authorized 12by law, the court is not empowered under this Section to order 13specific placements, specific services, or specific service 14providers to be included in the service plan.15    A guardian or custodian appointed by the court pursuant to 16this Act shall file updated case plans with the court every 6 17months.18    Rights of wards of the court under this Act are 19enforceable against any public agency by complaints for relief 20by mandamus filed in any proceedings brought under this Act.21    (2.5) If, after reviewing the evidence, including evidence 22from the Department, the court determines that the minor's 23current or planned placement is not necessary or appropriate 24to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court 25shall put in writing the factual basis supporting its 26determination and enter specific findings based on the   SB1504 Enrolled- 93 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1evidence. If the court finds that the minor's current or 2planned placement is not necessary or appropriate, the court 3may enter an order directing the Department to implement a 4recommendation by the minor's treating clinician or a 5clinician contracted by the Department to evaluate the minor 6or a recommendation made by the Department. If the Department 7places a minor in a placement under an order entered under this 8subsection (2.5), the Department has the authority to remove 9the minor from that placement when a change in circumstances 10necessitates the removal to protect the minor's health, 11safety, and best interest. If the Department determines 12removal is necessary, the Department shall notify the parties 13of the planned placement change in writing no later than 10 14days prior to the implementation of its determination unless 15remaining in the placement poses an imminent risk of harm to 16the minor, in which case the Department shall notify the 17parties of the placement change in writing immediately 18following the implementation of its decision. The Department 19shall notify others of the decision to change the minor's 20placement as required by Department rule. 21    (3) Following the permanency hearing, the court shall 22enter a written order that includes the determinations 23required under subsections (2) and (2.3) of this Section and 24sets forth the following:25        (a) The future status of the minor, including the 26    permanency goal, and any order necessary to conform the   SB1504 Enrolled- 94 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    minor's legal custody and status to such determination; or2        (b) If the permanency goal of the minor cannot be 3    achieved immediately, the specific reasons for continuing 4    the minor in the care of the Department of Children and 5    Family Services or other agency for short-term placement, 6    and the following determinations:7            (i) (Blank).8            (ii) Whether the services required by the court 9        and by any service plan prepared within the prior 6 10        months have been provided and (A) if so, whether the 11        services were reasonably calculated to facilitate the 12        achievement of the permanency goal or (B) if not 13        provided, why the services were not provided.14            (iii) Whether the minor's current or planned 15        placement is necessary, and appropriate to the plan 16        and goal, recognizing the right of minors to the least 17        restrictive (most family-like) setting available and 18        in close proximity to the parents' home consistent 19        with the health, safety, best interest, and special 20        needs of the minor and, if the minor is placed 21        out-of-state, whether the out-of-state placement 22        continues to be appropriate and consistent with the 23        health, safety, and best interest of the minor.24            (iv) (Blank).25            (v) (Blank).26    If the court sets a permanency goal of independence or if   SB1504 Enrolled- 95 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1the minor is 17 years of age or older, the court shall schedule 2a Successful Transition to Adulthood Review hearing in 3accordance with Section 2-28.2. 4    (4) The minor or any person interested in the minor may 5apply to the court for a change in custody of the minor and the 6appointment of a new custodian or guardian of the person or for 7the restoration of the minor to the custody of the minor's 8parents or former guardian or custodian.9    When return home is not selected as the permanency goal:10        (a) The Department, the minor, or the current foster 11    parent or relative caregiver seeking private guardianship 12    may file a motion for private guardianship of the minor. 13    Appointment of a guardian under this Section requires 14    approval of the court.15        (b) The State's Attorney may file a motion to 16    terminate parental rights of any parent who has failed to 17    make reasonable efforts to correct the conditions which 18    led to the removal of the child or reasonable progress 19    toward the return of the child, as defined in subdivision 20    (D)(m) of Section 1 of the Adoption Act or for whom any 21    other unfitness ground for terminating parental rights as 22    defined in subdivision (D) of Section 1 of the Adoption 23    Act exists.24        When parental rights have been terminated for a 25    minimum of 3 years and the child who is the subject of the 26    permanency hearing is 13 years old or older and is not   SB1504 Enrolled- 96 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    currently placed in a placement likely to achieve 2    permanency, the Department of Children and Family Services 3    shall make reasonable efforts to locate parents whose 4    rights have been terminated, except when the Court 5    determines that those efforts would be futile or 6    inconsistent with the subject child's best interests. The 7    Department of Children and Family Services shall assess 8    the appropriateness of the parent whose rights have been 9    terminated, and shall, as appropriate, foster and support 10    connections between the parent whose rights have been 11    terminated and the youth. The Department of Children and 12    Family Services shall document its determinations and 13    efforts to foster connections in the child's case plan. 14    Custody of the minor shall not be restored to any parent, 15guardian, or legal custodian in any case in which the minor is 16found to be neglected or abused under Section 2-3 or dependent 17under Section 2-4 of this Act, unless the minor can be cared 18for at home without endangering the minor's health or safety 19and it is in the best interest of the minor, and if such 20neglect, abuse, or dependency is found by the court under 21paragraph (1) of Section 2-21 of this Act to have come about 22due to the acts or omissions or both of such parent, guardian, 23or legal custodian, until such time as an investigation is 24made as provided in paragraph (5) and a hearing is held on the 25issue of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor and 26the fitness of such parent, guardian, or legal custodian to   SB1504 Enrolled- 97 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1care for the minor and the court enters an order that such 2parent, guardian, or legal custodian is fit to care for the 3minor. If a motion is filed to modify or vacate a private 4guardianship order and return the child to a parent, guardian, 5or legal custodian, the court may order the Department of 6Children and Family Services to assess the minor's current and 7proposed living arrangements and to provide ongoing monitoring 8of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor during 9the pendency of the motion to assist the court in making that 10determination.

The requirements of this 20Section concerning advance disbursements shall not apply with 21respect to the following: payments to local public agencies 22for child day care services as authorized by Section 5a of this 23Act; and youth service programs receiving grant funds under 24Section 17a-4.25    (e) (Blank).26    (f) (Blank).  SB1504 Enrolled- 6 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    (g) The Department shall establish rules and regulations 2concerning its operation of programs designed to meet the 3goals of child safety and protection, family preservation, 4family reunification, and adoption, including, but not limited 5to:6        (1) adoption;7        (2) foster care;8        (3) family counseling;9        (4) protective services;10        (5) (blank);11        (6) homemaker service;12        (7) return of runaway children;13        (8) (blank);14        (9) placement under Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court 15    Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, 4-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile 16    Court Act of 1987 in accordance with the federal Adoption 17    Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980; and18        (10) interstate services.19    Rules and regulations established by the Department shall 20include provisions for training Department staff and the staff 21of Department grantees, through contracts with other agencies 22or resources, in screening techniques to identify substance 23use disorders, as defined in the Substance Use Disorder Act, 24approved by the Department of Human Services, as a successor 25to the Department of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, for the 26purpose of identifying children and adults who should be   SB1504 Enrolled- 7 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1referred for an assessment at an organization appropriately 2licensed by the Department of Human Services for substance use 3disorder treatment.4    (h) If the Department finds that there is no appropriate 5program or facility within or available to the Department for 6a youth in care and that no licensed private facility has an 7adequate and appropriate program or none agrees to accept the 8youth in care, the Department shall create an appropriate 9individualized, program-oriented plan for such youth in care. 10The plan may be developed within the Department or through 11purchase of services by the Department to the extent that it is 12within its statutory authority to do.13    (i) Service programs shall be available throughout the 14State and shall include but not be limited to the following 15services:16        (1) case management;17        (2) homemakers;18        (3) counseling;19        (4) parent education;20        (5) day care; and21        (6) emergency assistance and advocacy.22    In addition, the following services may be made available 23to assess and meet the needs of children and families:24        (1) comprehensive family-based services;25        (2) assessments;26        (3) respite care; and  SB1504 Enrolled- 8 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (4) in-home health services.2    The Department shall provide transportation for any of the 3services it makes available to children or families or for 4which it refers children or families.5    (j) The Department may provide categories of financial 6assistance and education assistance grants, and shall 7establish rules and regulations concerning the assistance and 8grants, to persons who adopt children with physical or mental 9disabilities, children who are older, or other hard-to-place 10children who (i) immediately prior to their adoption were 11youth in care or (ii) were determined eligible for financial 12assistance with respect to a prior adoption and who become 13available for adoption because the prior adoption has been 14dissolved and the parental rights of the adoptive parents have 15been terminated or because the child's adoptive parents have 16died. The Department may continue to provide financial 17assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was 18determined eligible for financial assistance under this 19subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the 20child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization 21of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or 22parents. The Department may also provide categories of 23financial assistance and education assistance grants, and 24shall establish rules and regulations for the assistance and 25grants, to persons appointed guardian of the person under 26Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court Act or Section 2-27, 3-28,   SB1504 Enrolled- 9 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b14-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 for children 2who were youth in care for 12 months immediately prior to the 3appointment of the guardian.4    The amount of assistance may vary, depending upon the 5needs of the child and the adoptive parents, as set forth in 6the annual assistance agreement. Special purpose grants are 7allowed where the child requires special service but such 8costs may not exceed the amounts which similar services would 9cost the Department if it were to provide or secure them as 10guardian of the child.11    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 12inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, 13garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 14a judgment or debt.15    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 16of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 17either outside of the Department region handling the case, or 18outside of the State of Illinois.19    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any 20child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 21dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 22or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.23    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 24services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and 25Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including 26adoptive and extended families. Family preservation services   SB1504 Enrolled- 10 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1shall be offered (i) to prevent the placement of children in 2substitute care when the children can be cared for at home or 3in the custody of the person responsible for the children's 4welfare, (ii) to reunite children with their families, or 5(iii) to maintain an adoptive placement. Family preservation 6services shall only be offered when doing so will not endanger 7the children's health or safety. With respect to children who 8are in substitute care pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of 91987, family preservation services shall not be offered if a 10goal other than those of subdivisions (A), (B), or (B-1) of 11subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act has been set, except 12that reunification services may be offered as provided in 13paragraph (F) of subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act. 14Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create a 15private right of action or claim on the part of any individual 16or child welfare agency, except that when a child is the 17subject of an action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act 18of 1987 and the child's service plan calls for services to 19facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court 20hearing the action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act 21of 1987 may order the Department to provide the services set 22out in the plan, if those services are not provided with 23reasonable promptness and if those services are available.24    The Department shall notify the child and the child's 25family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 26family preservation services as identified in the service   SB1504 Enrolled- 11 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 2services as soon as the report is determined to be 3"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 4family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 5or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 6investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 7Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 8willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 9investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 10child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 11child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 12services available from other agencies in the community, even 13if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 14in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 15subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 16child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 17voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 18child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 19alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 20"differential response program" provided for in subsection 21(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 22Reporting Act.23    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 24children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 25care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 26as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor   SB1504 Enrolled- 12 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 2Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 3be committed to the Department by any court without the 4approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 5effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 62017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 7Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 8adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 9or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 10less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 11Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 12for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 13exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 14minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 15to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 162-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 172017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 18Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 19adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 20or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 21less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 22Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 23for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 24exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 25minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 26to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section   SB1504 Enrolled- 13 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b12-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 2exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 3or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 4circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 5delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 6attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 7the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 8hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 9release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 10    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 11date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 12implement a special program of family preservation services to 13support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 14experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 15stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 16pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 17that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 18safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 19family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 20and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 21the child or family to services available from other agencies 22in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 23home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 24future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 25of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 26develop and implement a public information campaign to alert   SB1504 Enrolled- 14 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1health and social service providers and the general public 2about these special family preservation services. The nature 3and scope of the services offered and the number of families 4served under the special program implemented under this 5paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 6Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 7"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 8a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 9Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 10edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 11Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.12    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 13interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 14most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 15possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 16the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 17concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 18earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 19include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of 20the family when the child can be cared for at home without 21endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 22the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 23is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 24permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.25    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 26respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in   SB1504 Enrolled- 15 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 2shall be the paramount concern.3    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 4shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 5prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 6child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 7reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 8occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 9Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 10where the Department believes that further reunification 11services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 12the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 13The Department is not required to provide further 14reunification services after such a finding.15    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 16made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 17best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 18also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 19placement made is the best available placement to provide 20permanency for the child.21    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 22planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 23shall consider the following factors when determining 24appropriateness of concurrent planning:25        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;26        (2) the past history of the family;  SB1504 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 2    the family;3        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;4        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 5    family to reunite;6        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 7    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;8        (7) the age of the child;9        (8) placement of siblings.10    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 11child if:12        (1) it has received a written consent to such 13    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 14    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 15    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 16    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 17    or18        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 19    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 20    located.21If the child is found in the child's residence without a 22parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 23Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 24temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 25Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 26guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a   SB1504 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 2and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 3relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 4child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 5a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 6such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 7resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 8home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 9follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 105-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.11    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 12and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 13pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 14Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 15custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 16Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 17acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 18limited custody, the Department, during the period of 19temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 20judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 215-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 22authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 23of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 24the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.25    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 26custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical   SB1504 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1examination.2    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 3temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 4the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 5Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 6the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 7The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 810 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 9the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 10Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 11Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 12the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 13the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 14custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 15later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 16the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 17temporary custody of the child shall terminate.18    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 19age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 20that cares for children who are in need of secure living 21arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 22determination is made by the facility director and the 23Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 24facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 25of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 26subject to placement in a correctional facility operated   SB1504 Enrolled- 19 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 2unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 3of the Department before being subject to placement in a 4correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 5has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.6    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 7age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 8the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 9preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 10child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 11placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 12clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 13in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 14Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 15those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 16guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 17Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 18facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 19of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 20maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 21dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 22However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 23where children require specialized care and treatment for 24problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 25social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 26facilities for the placement of such children are not   SB1504 Enrolled- 20 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 2this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 3be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 4garnishment or otherwise.5    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 6welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 7sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 8minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 9subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 101987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 11provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 12yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 13responsibility for the development and delivery of services 14under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 15under this Section through the Department of Children and 16Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 17Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 18shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 19an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 20the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 21homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 22youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 23Department shall continue child welfare services under this 24Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 25of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 26self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan.   SB1504 Enrolled- 21 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 2clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 3child welfare services under this Section and how such 4services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 5Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 6disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 7adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 8minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 9independent adults. 10    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 11review and appeal process for children and families who 12request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 13Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 14agencies, and foster families with whom those youth are 15placed, shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal 16rights as children and families in the case of placement by the 17Department, including the right to an initial review of a 18private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 19ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 20youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 21and foster families. The Department shall accept for 22administrative review and an appeal hearing a complaint made 23by (i) a child or foster family concerning a decision 24following an initial review by a private child welfare agency 25or (ii) a prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation 26of subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision   SB1504 Enrolled- 22 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 2conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 3current foster home placement is necessary and appropriate 4under Section 2-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not 5constitute a judicial determination on the merits of an 6administrative appeal, filed by a former foster parent, 7involving a change of placement decision.8    (p) (Blank).9    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 10for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 11money or other property which is received on behalf of such 12children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 13or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 14the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 155.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 16under Section 5.46.17    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 18interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 19institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 20responsible and who have been determined eligible for 21Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 22allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 23parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 24Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 25miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 26be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance   SB1504 Enrolled- 23 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1with this subsection.2    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 3Department shall:4        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 5    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 6    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 7    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 8    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 9    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 10    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 11    account for any purpose.12        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 13    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 14    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 15    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 16    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 17    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 18    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 19    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 20    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.21        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 22    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 23    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 24    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 25    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.26    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations   SB1504 Enrolled- 24 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 2the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 3who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 4hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 5of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 6of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 7Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 8confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 9of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 10adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 11such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 12agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 13Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 14confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 15of the child.16    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 17establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and 18private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the 19Department of Children and Family Services for damages 20sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or 21negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third 22party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions 23of foster children to other individuals.

The Department shall assign a caseworker to 14attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 15the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 16hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 17release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 18    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 19implement a special program of family preservation services to 20support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 21are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 22stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 23pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 24that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 25safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 26family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused   SB1504 Enrolled- 46 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 2the child or family to services available from other agencies 3in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 4home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 5future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 6of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 7develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 8health and social service providers and the general public 9about these special family preservation services. The nature 10and scope of the services offered and the number of families 11served under the special program implemented under this 12paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 13Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 14"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 15a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 16Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 17edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 18Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.19    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 20interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 21most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 22option for the child, consistent with the child's best 23interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 24Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is 25practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General 26Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family   SB1504 Enrolled- 47 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 2occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 3arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 4outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 5at home without endangering the child's health or safety; 6reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if 7temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 8toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 9status.10    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 11respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 12making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 13shall be the paramount concern.14    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 15shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 16prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 17child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 18reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 19occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 20Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 21where the Department believes that further reunification 22services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 23the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 24The Department is not required to provide further 25reunification services after such a finding.26    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be   SB1504 Enrolled- 48 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 2best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 3place the child with a relative, document those diligent 4efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 5secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue 6preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative 7is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 8concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 9Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 10in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 112025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 12diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 13relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 14should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 15delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 16permanent placement for the child.17    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 18planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 19shall consider the following factors when determining 20appropriateness of concurrent planning:21        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;22        (2) the past history of the family;23        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 24    the family;25        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;26        (4.5) the child's wishes;   SB1504 Enrolled- 49 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 2    family to reunite;3        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 4    provide a permanent placement;5        (7) the age of the child;6        (8) placement of siblings; and7        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 8    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 9    the child. 10    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 11child if:12        (1) it has received a written consent to such 13    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 14    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 15    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 16    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 17    or18        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 19    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 20    located.21If the child is found in the child's residence without a 22parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 23Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 24temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 25Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 26guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a   SB1504 Enrolled- 50 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 2and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 3relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 4child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 5a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 6such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 7resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 8home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 9follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 105-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.11    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 12and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 13pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 14Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 15custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 16Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 17acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 18limited custody, the Department, during the period of 19temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 20judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 215-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 22authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 23of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 24the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.25    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 26custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical   SB1504 Enrolled- 51 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1examination.2    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 3temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 4the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 5Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 6the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 7The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 810 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 9the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 10Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 11Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 12the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 13the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 14custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 15later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 16the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 17temporary custody of the child shall terminate.18    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 19age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 20that cares for children who are in need of secure living 21arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 22determination is made by the facility director and the 23Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 24facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 25of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 26subject to placement in a correctional facility operated   SB1504 Enrolled- 52 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 2unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 3of the Department before being subject to placement in a 4correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 5has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.6    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 7age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 8the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 9preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 10child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 11placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 12clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 13in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 14Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 15those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 16guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 17Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 18facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 19of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 20maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 21dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 22However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 23where children require specialized care and treatment for 24problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 25social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 26facilities for the placement of such children are not   SB1504 Enrolled- 53 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 2this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 3be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 4garnishment or otherwise.5    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 6welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 7sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 8minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 9subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 101987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 11provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 12yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 13responsibility for the development and delivery of services 14under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 15under this Section through the Department of Children and 16Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 17Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 18shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 19an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 20the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 21homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 22youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 23Department shall continue child welfare services under this 24Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 25of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 26self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan.   SB1504 Enrolled- 54 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 2clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 3child welfare services under this Section and how such 4services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 5Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 6disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 7adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 8minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 9independent adults. 10    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 11review and appeal process for children and families who 12request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 13Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 14agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 15shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 16children and families in the case of placement by the 17Department, including the right to an initial review of a 18private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 19ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 20youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 21and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 22Department shall accept for administrative review and an 23appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 24with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following 25an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a 26prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of   SB1504 Enrolled- 55 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 2concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 3conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 4current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 52-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a 6judicial determination on the merits of an administrative 7appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 8placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 9shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 10review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 11placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 12identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 13criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 14interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 15of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 16multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 17rules regarding placement changes shall be followed. The rules 18shall outline the essential elements of each form used in the 19implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this 20amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 21    (p) (Blank).22    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 23for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 24money or other property which is received on behalf of such 25children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 26or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of   SB1504 Enrolled- 56 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 25.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 3under Section 5.46.4    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 5interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 6institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 7responsible and who have been determined eligible for 8Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 9allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 10parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 11Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 12miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 13be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 14with this subsection.15    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 16Department shall:17        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 18    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 19    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 20    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 21    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 22    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 23    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 24    account for any purpose.25        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 26    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care   SB1504 Enrolled- 57 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 2    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 3    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 4    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 5    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 6    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 7    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.8        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 9    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 10    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 11    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 12    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.13    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 14encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 15the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 16who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 17hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 18of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 19of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 20Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 21confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 22of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 23adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 24such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 25agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 26Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the   SB1504 Enrolled- 58 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 2of the child.3    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 4establish and implement a program to reimburse caregivers 5licensed, certified, or otherwise approved by the Department 6of Children and Family Services for damages sustained by the 7caregivers as a result of the malicious or negligent acts of 8children placed by the Department, as well as providing third 9party coverage for such caregivers with regard to actions of 10children placed by the Department to other individuals. Such 11coverage will be secondary to the caregiver's liability 12insurance policy, if applicable. The program shall be funded 13through appropriations from the General Revenue Fund, 14specifically designated for such purposes.15    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 16investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 17as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 18Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:19        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 20    directs the Department to perform such services; and21        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 22    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 23    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 24    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 25    party is financially able to pay.26    The Department shall provide written notification to the   SB1504 Enrolled- 59 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 2and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 3The Department shall send to the court information related to 4the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 5determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The 6court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.7    (u) In addition to other information that must be 8provided, whenever the Department places a child with a 9prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster 10home, group home, or child care institution, in a relative 11home, or in a certified relative caregiver home, the 12Department shall provide to the caregiver, appropriate 13facility staff, or prospective adoptive parent or parents:14        (1) available detailed information concerning the 15    child's educational and health history, copies of 16    immunization records (including insurance and medical card 17    information), a history of the child's previous 18    placements, if any, and reasons for placement changes 19    excluding any information that identifies or reveals the 20    location of any previous caregiver or adoptive parents;21        (2) a copy of the child's portion of the client 22    service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and 23    all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; 24    and25        (3) information containing details of the child's 26    individualized educational plan when the child is   SB1504 Enrolled- 60 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    receiving special education services.2    The caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective 3adoptive parent or parents, shall be informed of any known 4social or behavioral information (including, but not limited 5to, criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual 6abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to 7care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently 8in the home or setting. The Department may prepare a written 9summary of the information required by this paragraph, which 10may be provided to the caregiver, appropriate facility staff, 11or prospective adoptive parent in advance of a placement. The 12caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive 13parent may review the supporting documents in the child's file 14in the presence of casework staff. In the case of an emergency 15placement, casework staff shall at least provide known 16information verbally, if necessary, and must subsequently 17provide the information in writing as required by this 18subsection. 19    The information described in this subsection shall be 20provided in writing. In the case of emergency placements when 21time does not allow prior review, preparation, and collection 22of written information, the Department shall provide such 23information as it becomes available. Within 10 business days 24after placement, the Department shall obtain from the 25caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive 26parent or parents a signed verification of receipt of the   SB1504 Enrolled- 61 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1information provided. Within 10 business days after placement, 2the Department shall provide to the child's guardian ad litem 3a copy of the information provided to the caregiver, 4appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive parent or 5parents.

Beginning July 1, 2025, relative homes 14providing care to a child placed by the Department that are not 15a certified relative caregiver home under Section 3.4 of the 16Child Care Act of 1969 or a licensed foster family home shall 17be eligible to receive payments from the Department in an 18amount no less 90% of the payments made to licensed foster 19family homes and certified relative caregiver homes.20    (u-6) To assist relative and certified relative 21caregivers, no later than July 1, 2025, the Department shall 22adopt rules to implement a relative support program, as 23follows: 24        (1) For relative and certified relative caregivers, 25    the Department is authorized to reimburse or prepay 26    reasonable expenditures to remedy home conditions   SB1504 Enrolled- 62 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    necessary to fulfill the home safety-related requirements 2    of relative caregiver homes. 3        (2) The Department may provide short-term emergency 4    funds to relative and certified relative caregiver homes 5    experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 6    stress associated with adding youth in care as new 7    household members. 8        (3) Consistent with federal law, the Department shall 9    include in any State Plan made in accordance with the 10    Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, Titles 11    IV-E and XIX of the Social Security Act, and any other 12    applicable federal laws the provision of kinship navigator 13    program services. The Department shall apply for and 14    administer all relevant federal aid in accordance with 15    law. Federal funds acquired for the kinship navigator 16    program shall be used for the development, implementation, 17    and operation of kinship navigator program services. The 18    kinship navigator program services may provide 19    information, referral services, support, and assistance to 20    relative and certified relative caregivers of youth in 21    care to address their unique needs and challenges. Until 22    the Department is approved to receive federal funds for 23    these purposes, the Department shall publicly post on the 24    Department's website semi-annual updates regarding the 25    Department's progress in pursuing federal funding. 26    Whenever the Department publicly posts these updates on   SB1504 Enrolled- 63 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    its website, the Department shall notify the General 2    Assembly through the General Assembly's designee. 3    (u-7) To support finding permanency for children through 4subsidized guardianship and adoption and to prevent disruption 5in guardianship and adoptive placements, the Department shall 6establish and maintain accessible subsidized guardianship and 7adoption support services for all children under 18 years of 8age placed in guardianship or adoption who, immediately 9preceding the guardianship or adoption, were in the custody or 10guardianship of the Department under Article II of the 11Juvenile Court Act of 1987.12    The Department shall establish and maintain a toll-free 13number to respond to requests from the public about its 14subsidized guardianship and adoption support services under 15this subsection and shall staff the toll-free number so that 16calls are answered on a timely basis, but in no event more than 17one business day after the receipt of a request. These 18requests from the public may be made anonymously.

The 25court shall approve or disapprove the placement. If 26applicable, the requirements of Sections 2-27.1 and 2-27.2   SB1504 Enrolled- 78 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1must also be met. The Department's written report and the 2court's written determination shall be included in and made 3part of the case plan for the child. If the child remains 4placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the 5Department shall submit evidence at each status and permanency 6hearing: 7        (A) demonstrating that on-going assessment of the 8    strengths and needs of the child continues to support the 9    determination that the child's needs cannot be met through 10    placement in a foster family home, that the placement 11    provides the most effective and appropriate level of care 12    for the child in the least restrictive, appropriate 13    environment, and that the placement is consistent with the 14    short-term and long-term permanency goal for the child, as 15    specified in the permanency plan for the child; 16        (B) documenting the specific treatment or service 17    needs that should be met for the child in the placement and 18    the length of time the child is expected to need the 19    treatment or services; 20        (C) detailing the efforts made by the agency to 21    prepare the child to return home or to be placed with a fit 22    and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive 23    parent, or in a foster family home; and 24        (D) beginning July 1, 2025, documenting the 25    Department's efforts regarding ongoing family finding and 26    relative engagement required under Section 2-27.3; and .   SB1504 Enrolled- 79 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (E) detailing efforts to ensure the minor is engaged 2    in age and developmentally appropriate activities to 3    develop life skills, which may include extracurricular 4    activities, coaching by caregivers, or instruction in 5    individual or group settings.

Once the   SB1504 Enrolled- 80 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1plan and goal have been achieved, if the minor remains in 2substitute care, the case shall be reviewed at least every 6 3months thereafter, subject to the provisions of this Section, 4unless the minor is placed in the guardianship of a suitable 5relative or other person and the court determines that further 6monitoring by the court does not further the health, safety, 7or best interest of the child and that this is a stable 8permanent placement. The permanency hearings must occur within 9the time frames set forth in this subsection and may not be 10delayed in anticipation of a report from any source or due to 11the agency's failure to timely file its written report (this 12written report means the one required under the next paragraph 13and does not mean the service plan also referred to in that 14paragraph).15    The public agency that is the custodian or guardian of the 16minor, or another agency responsible for the minor's care, 17shall ensure that all parties to the permanency hearings are 18provided a copy of the most recent service plan prepared 19within the prior 6 months at least 14 days in advance of the 20hearing.

If a permanency goal under paragraph (A), 22    (B), or (B-1) of subsection (2.3) have been deemed 23    inappropriate and not in the minor's best interest, the 24    report must include the following information:25            (i) confirmation that the caseworker has discussed 26        the permanency options and subsidies available for   SB1504 Enrolled- 82 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        guardianship and adoption with the minor's caregivers, 2        the minor's parents, as appropriate, and has discussed 3        the available permanency options with the minor in an 4        age-appropriate manner;5            (ii) confirmation that the caseworker has 6        discussed with the minor's caregivers, the minor's 7        parents, as appropriate, and the minor as 8        age-appropriate, the distinctions between guardianship 9        and adoption, including, but not limited to, that 10        guardianship does not require termination of the 11        parent's rights or the consent of the parent;12            (iii) a description of the stated preferences and 13        concerns, if any, the minor, the parent as 14        appropriate, and the caregiver expressed relating to 15        the options of guardianship and adoption, and the 16        reasons for the preferences;17            (iv) if the minor is not currently in a placement 18        that will provide permanency, identification of all 19        persons presently willing and able to provide 20        permanency to the minor through either guardianship or 21        adoption, and beginning July 1, 2025, if none are 22        available, a description of the efforts made in 23        accordance with Section 2-27.3; and24            (v) state the recommended permanency goal, why 25        that goal is recommended, and why the other potential 26        goals were not recommended.   SB1504 Enrolled- 83 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    The caseworker must appear and testify at the permanency 2hearing. If a permanency hearing has not previously been 3scheduled by the court, the moving party shall move for the 4setting of a permanency hearing and the entry of an order 5within the time frames set forth in this subsection.6    (2.3) At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine 7the permanency goal of the child. The court shall set one of 8the following permanency goals:9        (A) The minor will be returned home by a specific date 10    within 5 months.11        (B) The minor will be in short-term care with a 12    continued goal to return home within a period not to 13    exceed one year, where the progress of the parent or 14    parents is substantial giving particular consideration to 15    the age and individual needs of the minor.16        (B-1) The minor will be in short-term care with a 17    continued goal to return home pending a status hearing. 18    When the court finds that a parent has not made reasonable 19    efforts or reasonable progress to date, the court shall 20    identify what actions the parent and the Department must 21    take in order to justify a finding of reasonable efforts 22    or reasonable progress and shall set a status hearing to 23    be held not earlier than 9 months from the date of 24    adjudication nor later than 11 months from the date of 25    adjudication during which the parent's progress will again 26    be reviewed.  SB1504 Enrolled- 84 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        If the court has determined that goals (A), (B), and 2    (B-1) are not appropriate and not in the minor's best 3    interest, the court may select one of the following goals: 4    (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) for the minor as appropriate and 5    based on the best interests of the minor. The court shall 6    determine the appropriate goal for the minor based on best 7    interest factors and any considerations outlined in that 8    goal. 9        (C) The guardianship of the minor shall be transferred 10    to an individual or couple on a permanent basis. Prior to 11    changing the goal to guardianship, the court shall 12    consider the following: 13            (i) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 14        guardianship with the caregiver and what preference, 15        if any, the caregiver has as to the permanency goal;16            (ii) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 17        guardianship with the minor, as age-appropriate, and 18        what preference, if any, the minor has as to the 19        permanency goal;20            (iii) whether the minor is of sufficient age to 21        remember the minor's parents and if the child values 22        this familial identity;23            (iv) whether the minor is placed with a relative, 24        and beginning July 1, 2025, whether the minor is 25        placed in a relative home as defined in Section 4d of 26        the Children and Family Services Act or in a certified   SB1504 Enrolled- 85 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        relative caregiver home as defined in Section 2.36 of 2        the Child Care Act of 1969; and3            (v) whether the parent or parents have been 4        informed about guardianship and adoption, and, if 5        appropriate, what preferences, if any, the parent or 6        parents have as to the permanency goal. 7        (D) The minor will be in substitute care pending court 8    determination on termination of parental rights. Prior to 9    changing the goal to substitute care pending court 10    determination on termination of parental rights, the court 11    shall consider the following: 12            (i) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 13        guardianship with the caregiver and what preference, 14        if any, the caregiver has as to the permanency goal;15            (ii) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 16        guardianship with the minor, as age-appropriate, and 17        what preference, if any, the minor has as to the 18        permanency goal;19            (iii) whether the minor is of sufficient age to 20        remember the minor's parents and if the child values 21        this familial identity;22            (iv) whether the minor is placed with a relative, 23        and beginning July 1, 2025, whether the minor is 24        placed in a relative home as defined in Section 4d of 25        the Children and Family Services Act, in a certified 26        relative caregiver home as defined in Section 2.36 of   SB1504 Enrolled- 86 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        the Child Care Act of 1969;2            (v) whether the minor is already placed in a 3        pre-adoptive home, and if not, whether such a home has 4        been identified; and5            (vi) whether the parent or parents have been 6        informed about guardianship and adoption, and, if 7        appropriate, what preferences, if any, the parent or 8        parents have as to the permanency goal.9        (E) Adoption, provided that parental rights have been 10    terminated or relinquished.11        (F) Provided that permanency goals (A) through (E) 12    have been deemed inappropriate and not in the minor's best 13    interests, the minor over age 15 will be in substitute 14    care pending independence. In selecting this permanency 15    goal, the Department of Children and Family Services may 16    provide services to enable reunification and to strengthen 17    the minor's connections with family, fictive kin, and 18    other responsible adults, provided the services are in the 19    minor's best interest. The services shall be documented in 20    the service plan. 21        (G) The minor will be in substitute care because the 22    minor cannot be provided for in a home environment due to 23    developmental disabilities or mental illness or because 24    the minor is a danger to self or others, provided that 25    goals (A) through (E) have been deemed inappropriate and 26    not in the child's best interests.  SB1504 Enrolled- 87 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    In selecting any permanency goal, the court shall indicate 2in writing the reasons the goal was selected and why the 3preceding goals were deemed inappropriate and not in the 4child's best interest. Where the court has selected a 5permanency goal other than (A), (B), or (B-1), the Department 6of Children and Family Services shall not provide further 7reunification services, except as provided in paragraph (F) of 8this subsection (2.3), but shall provide services consistent 9with the goal selected.10        (H) Notwithstanding any other provision in this 11    Section, the court may select the goal of continuing 12    foster care as a permanency goal if: 13            (1) The Department of Children and Family Services 14        has custody and guardianship of the minor; 15            (2) The court has deemed all other permanency 16        goals inappropriate based on the child's best 17        interest; 18            (3) The court has found compelling reasons, based 19        on written documentation reviewed by the court, to 20        place the minor in continuing foster care. Compelling 21        reasons include: 22                (a) the child does not wish to be adopted or to 23            be placed in the guardianship of the minor's 24            relative, certified relative caregiver, or foster 25            care placement; 26                (b) the child exhibits an extreme level of   SB1504 Enrolled- 88 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1            need such that the removal of the child from the 2            minor's placement would be detrimental to the 3            child; or 4                (c) the child who is the subject of the 5            permanency hearing has existing close and strong 6            bonds with a sibling, and achievement of another 7            permanency goal would substantially interfere with 8            the subject child's sibling relationship, taking 9            into consideration the nature and extent of the 10            relationship, and whether ongoing contact is in 11            the subject child's best interest, including 12            long-term emotional interest, as compared with the 13            legal and emotional benefit of permanence; 14            (4) The child has lived with the relative, 15        certified relative caregiver, or foster parent for at 16        least one year; and 17            (5) The relative, certified relative caregiver, or 18        foster parent currently caring for the child is 19        willing and capable of providing the child with a 20        stable and permanent environment. 21    (2.4) The court shall set a permanency goal that is in the 22best interest of the child. In determining that goal, the 23court shall consult with the minor in an age-appropriate 24manner regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan 25for the minor. The court's determination shall include the 26following factors:  SB1504 Enrolled- 89 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1        (A) Age of the child.2        (B) Options available for permanence, including both 3    out-of-state and in-state placement options.4        (C) Current placement of the child and the intent of 5    the family regarding subsidized guardianship and adoption.6        (D) Emotional, physical, and mental status or 7    condition of the child.8        (E) Types of services previously offered and whether 9    or not the services were successful and, if not 10    successful, the reasons the services failed.11        (F) Availability of services currently needed and 12    whether the services exist.13        (G) Status of siblings of the minor.14        (H) If the minor is not currently in a placement 15    likely to achieve permanency, whether there is an 16    identified and willing potential permanent caregiver for 17    the minor, and if so, that potential permanent caregiver's 18    intent regarding guardianship and adoption. 19    The court shall consider (i) the permanency goal contained 20in the service plan, (ii) the appropriateness of the services 21contained in the plan and whether those services have been 22provided, (iii) whether reasonable efforts have been made by 23all the parties to the service plan to achieve the goal, and 24(iv) whether the plan and goal have been achieved. All 25evidence relevant to determining these questions, including 26oral and written reports, may be admitted and may be relied on   SB1504 Enrolled- 90 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1to the extent of their probative value.2    The court shall make findings as to whether, in violation 3of Section 8.2 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting 4Act, any portion of the service plan compels a child or parent 5to engage in any activity or refrain from any activity that is 6not reasonably related to remedying a condition or conditions 7that gave rise or which could give rise to any finding of child 8abuse or neglect. The services contained in the service plan 9shall include services reasonably related to remedy the 10conditions that gave rise to removal of the child from the home 11of the child's parents, guardian, or legal custodian or that 12the court has found must be remedied prior to returning the 13child home. Any tasks the court requires of the parents, 14guardian, or legal custodian or child prior to returning the 15child home must be reasonably related to remedying a condition 16or conditions that gave rise to or which could give rise to any 17finding of child abuse or neglect. 18    If the permanency goal is to return home, the court shall 19make findings that identify any problems that are causing 20continued placement of the children away from the home and 21identify what outcomes would be considered a resolution to 22these problems. The court shall explain to the parents that 23these findings are based on the information that the court has 24at that time and may be revised, should additional evidence be 25presented to the court. 26    The court shall review the Sibling Contact Support Plan   SB1504 Enrolled- 91 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1developed or modified under subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of 2the Children and Family Services Act, if applicable. If the 3Department has not convened a meeting to develop or modify a 4Sibling Contact Support Plan, or if the court finds that the 5existing Plan is not in the child's best interest, the court 6may enter an order requiring the Department to develop, 7modify, or implement a Sibling Contact Support Plan, or order 8mediation. 9    The court shall review the Department's efforts to provide 10the minor with age and developmentally appropriate life 11skills. If the court finds the Department's efforts are not in 12the minor's best interest, the court may enter an order 13requiring the Department to develop, modify, or implement the 14service plan to develop the minor's life skills in an age and 15developmentally appropriate manner. 16    Beginning July 1, 2025, the court shall review the Ongoing 17Family Finding and Relative Engagement Plan required under 18Section 2-27.3. If the court finds that the plan is not in the 19minor's best interest, the court shall enter specific factual 20findings and order the Department to modify the plan 21consistent with the court's findings. 22    If the goal has been achieved, the court shall enter 23orders that are necessary to conform the minor's legal custody 24and status to those findings.25    If, after receiving evidence, the court determines that 26the services contained in the plan are not reasonably   SB1504 Enrolled- 92 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1calculated to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, 2the court shall put in writing the factual basis supporting 3the determination and enter specific findings based on the 4evidence. The court also shall enter an order for the 5Department to develop and implement a new service plan or to 6implement changes to the current service plan consistent with 7the court's findings. The new service plan shall be filed with 8the court and served on all parties within 45 days of the date 9of the order. The court shall continue the matter until the new 10service plan is filed. Except as authorized by subsection 11(2.5) of this Section and as otherwise specifically authorized 12by law, the court is not empowered under this Section to order 13specific placements, specific services, or specific service 14providers to be included in the service plan.15    A guardian or custodian appointed by the court pursuant to 16this Act shall file updated case plans with the court every 6 17months.18    Rights of wards of the court under this Act are 19enforceable against any public agency by complaints for relief 20by mandamus filed in any proceedings brought under this Act.21    (2.5) If, after reviewing the evidence, including evidence 22from the Department, the court determines that the minor's 23current or planned placement is not necessary or appropriate 24to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court 25shall put in writing the factual basis supporting its 26determination and enter specific findings based on the   SB1504 Enrolled- 93 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1evidence. If the court finds that the minor's current or 2planned placement is not necessary or appropriate, the court 3may enter an order directing the Department to implement a 4recommendation by the minor's treating clinician or a 5clinician contracted by the Department to evaluate the minor 6or a recommendation made by the Department. If the Department 7places a minor in a placement under an order entered under this 8subsection (2.5), the Department has the authority to remove 9the minor from that placement when a change in circumstances 10necessitates the removal to protect the minor's health, 11safety, and best interest. If the Department determines 12removal is necessary, the Department shall notify the parties 13of the planned placement change in writing no later than 10 14days prior to the implementation of its determination unless 15remaining in the placement poses an imminent risk of harm to 16the minor, in which case the Department shall notify the 17parties of the placement change in writing immediately 18following the implementation of its decision. The Department 19shall notify others of the decision to change the minor's 20placement as required by Department rule. 21    (3) Following the permanency hearing, the court shall 22enter a written order that includes the determinations 23required under subsections (2) and (2.3) of this Section and 24sets forth the following:25        (a) The future status of the minor, including the 26    permanency goal, and any order necessary to conform the   SB1504 Enrolled- 94 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    minor's legal custody and status to such determination; or2        (b) If the permanency goal of the minor cannot be 3    achieved immediately, the specific reasons for continuing 4    the minor in the care of the Department of Children and 5    Family Services or other agency for short-term placement, 6    and the following determinations:7            (i) (Blank).8            (ii) Whether the services required by the court 9        and by any service plan prepared within the prior 6 10        months have been provided and (A) if so, whether the 11        services were reasonably calculated to facilitate the 12        achievement of the permanency goal or (B) if not 13        provided, why the services were not provided.14            (iii) Whether the minor's current or planned 15        placement is necessary, and appropriate to the plan 16        and goal, recognizing the right of minors to the least 17        restrictive (most family-like) setting available and 18        in close proximity to the parents' home consistent 19        with the health, safety, best interest, and special 20        needs of the minor and, if the minor is placed 21        out-of-state, whether the out-of-state placement 22        continues to be appropriate and consistent with the 23        health, safety, and best interest of the minor.24            (iv) (Blank).25            (v) (Blank).26    If the court sets a permanency goal of independence or if   SB1504 Enrolled- 95 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1the minor is 17 years of age or older, the court shall schedule 2a Successful Transition to Adulthood Review hearing in 3accordance with Section 2-28.2. 4    (4) The minor or any person interested in the minor may 5apply to the court for a change in custody of the minor and the 6appointment of a new custodian or guardian of the person or for 7the restoration of the minor to the custody of the minor's 8parents or former guardian or custodian.9    When return home is not selected as the permanency goal:10        (a) The Department, the minor, or the current foster 11    parent or relative caregiver seeking private guardianship 12    may file a motion for private guardianship of the minor. 13    Appointment of a guardian under this Section requires 14    approval of the court.15        (b) The State's Attorney may file a motion to 16    terminate parental rights of any parent who has failed to 17    make reasonable efforts to correct the conditions which 18    led to the removal of the child or reasonable progress 19    toward the return of the child, as defined in subdivision 20    (D)(m) of Section 1 of the Adoption Act or for whom any 21    other unfitness ground for terminating parental rights as 22    defined in subdivision (D) of Section 1 of the Adoption 23    Act exists.24        When parental rights have been terminated for a 25    minimum of 3 years and the child who is the subject of the 26    permanency hearing is 13 years old or older and is not   SB1504 Enrolled- 96 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    currently placed in a placement likely to achieve 2    permanency, the Department of Children and Family Services 3    shall make reasonable efforts to locate parents whose 4    rights have been terminated, except when the Court 5    determines that those efforts would be futile or 6    inconsistent with the subject child's best interests. The 7    Department of Children and Family Services shall assess 8    the appropriateness of the parent whose rights have been 9    terminated, and shall, as appropriate, foster and support 10    connections between the parent whose rights have been 11    terminated and the youth. The Department of Children and 12    Family Services shall document its determinations and 13    efforts to foster connections in the child's case plan. 14    Custody of the minor shall not be restored to any parent, 15guardian, or legal custodian in any case in which the minor is 16found to be neglected or abused under Section 2-3 or dependent 17under Section 2-4 of this Act, unless the minor can be cared 18for at home without endangering the minor's health or safety 19and it is in the best interest of the minor, and if such 20neglect, abuse, or dependency is found by the court under 21paragraph (1) of Section 2-21 of this Act to have come about 22due to the acts or omissions or both of such parent, guardian, 23or legal custodian, until such time as an investigation is 24made as provided in paragraph (5) and a hearing is held on the 25issue of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor and 26the fitness of such parent, guardian, or legal custodian to   SB1504 Enrolled- 97 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1care for the minor and the court enters an order that such 2parent, guardian, or legal custodian is fit to care for the 3minor. If a motion is filed to modify or vacate a private 4guardianship order and return the child to a parent, guardian, 5or legal custodian, the court may order the Department of 6Children and Family Services to assess the minor's current and 7proposed living arrangements and to provide ongoing monitoring 8of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor during 9the pendency of the motion to assist the court in making that 10determination. In the event that the minor has attained 18 11years of age and the guardian or custodian petitions the court 12for an order terminating the minor's guardianship or custody, 13guardianship or custody shall terminate automatically 30 days 14after the receipt of the petition unless the court orders 15otherwise. No legal custodian or guardian of the person may be 16removed without the legal custodian's or guardian's consent 17until given notice and an opportunity to be heard by the court.18    When the court orders a child restored to the custody of 19the parent or parents, the court shall order the parent or 20parents to cooperate with the Department of Children and 21Family Services and comply with the terms of an after-care 22plan, or risk the loss of custody of the child and possible 23termination of their parental rights. The court may also enter 24an order of protective supervision in accordance with Section 252-24.26    If the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent,   SB1504 Enrolled- 98 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1legal custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, 2and an Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the 3court may order the Department of Children and Family Services 4to arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 5arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 6and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 7protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 82-24. 9    (5) Whenever a parent, guardian, or legal custodian files 10a motion for restoration of custody of the minor, and the minor 11was adjudicated neglected, abused, or dependent as a result of 12physical abuse, the court shall cause to be made an 13investigation as to whether the movant has ever been charged 14with or convicted of any criminal offense which would indicate 15the likelihood of any further physical abuse to the minor. 16Evidence of such criminal convictions shall be taken into 17account in determining whether the minor can be cared for at 18home without endangering the minor's health or safety and 19fitness of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian.20        (a) Any agency of this State or any subdivision 21    thereof shall cooperate with the agent of the court in 22    providing any information sought in the investigation.23        (b) The information derived from the investigation and 24    any conclusions or recommendations derived from the 25    information shall be provided to the parent, guardian, or 26    legal custodian seeking restoration of custody prior to   SB1504 Enrolled- 99 -LRB104 09130 KTG 19186 b1    the hearing on fitness and the movant shall have an 2    opportunity at the hearing to refute the information or 3    contest its significance.4        (c) All information obtained from any investigation 5    shall be confidential as provided in Section 5-150 of this 6    Act.7(Source: P.A. 102-193, eff. 7-30-21; 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 8102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-154, eff. 96-30-23; 103-171, eff. 1-1-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24; 103-1061, 10eff. 2-5-25.) 11    (705 ILCS 405/2-28.2 new)12    Sec. 2-28.2.
