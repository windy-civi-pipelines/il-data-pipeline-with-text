The Department may continue to provide financial 24assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was 25determined eligible for financial assistance under this 26subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the   10400SB1504sam001- 9 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization 2of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or 3parents.

Special purpose grants are 14allowed where the child requires special service but such 15costs may not exceed the amounts which similar services would 16cost the Department if it were to provide or secure them as 17guardian of the child.18    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 19inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, 20garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 21a judgment or debt.22    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 23of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 24either outside of the Department region handling the case, or 25outside of the State of Illinois.26    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any   10400SB1504sam001- 10 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 2dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 3or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.4    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 5services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and 6Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including 7adoptive and extended families. Family preservation services 8shall be offered (i) to prevent the placement of children in 9substitute care when the children can be cared for at home or 10in the custody of the person responsible for the children's 11welfare, (ii) to reunite children with their families, or 12(iii) to maintain an adoptive placement. Family preservation 13services shall only be offered when doing so will not endanger 14the children's health or safety.

The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 9services as soon as the report is determined to be 10"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 11family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 12or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 13investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 14Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 15willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 16investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 17child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 18child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 19services available from other agencies in the community, even 20if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 21in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 22subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 23child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 24voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 25child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 26alternative to an investigation, as provided under the   10400SB1504sam001- 12 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1"differential response program" provided for in subsection 2(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 3Reporting Act.4    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 5children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 6care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 7as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 8requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 9Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 10be committed to the Department by any court without the 11approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 12effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 132017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 14Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 15adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 16or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 17less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 18Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 19for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 20exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 21minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 22to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 232-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 242017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 25Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 26adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of   10400SB1504sam001- 13 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 2less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 3Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 4for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 5exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 6minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 7to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 82-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 9exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 10or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 11circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 12delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 13attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 14the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 15hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 16release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 17    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 18date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 19implement a special program of family preservation services to 20support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 21experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 22stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 23pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 24that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 25safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 26family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused   10400SB1504sam001- 14 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 2the child or family to services available from other agencies 3in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 4home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 5future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 6of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 7develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 8health and social service providers and the general public 9about these special family preservation services. The nature 10and scope of the services offered and the number of families 11served under the special program implemented under this 12paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 13Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 14"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 15a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 16Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 17edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 18Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.19    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 20interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 21most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 22possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 23the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 24concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 25earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 26include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of   10400SB1504sam001- 15 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1the family when the child can be cared for at home without 2endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 3the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 4is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 5permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.6    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 7respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 8making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 9shall be the paramount concern.10    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 11shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 12prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 13child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 14reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 15occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 16Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 17where the Department believes that further reunification 18services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 19the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 20The Department is not required to provide further 21reunification services after such a finding.22    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 23made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 24best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 25also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 26placement made is the best available placement to provide   10400SB1504sam001- 16 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1permanency for the child.2    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 3planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 4shall consider the following factors when determining 5appropriateness of concurrent planning:6        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;7        (2) the past history of the family;8        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 9    the family;10        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;11        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 12    family to reunite;13        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 14    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;15        (7) the age of the child;16        (8) placement of siblings.17    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 18child if:19        (1) it has received a written consent to such 20    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 21    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 22    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 23    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 24    or25        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 26    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be   10400SB1504sam001- 17 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    located.2If the child is found in the child's residence without a 3parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 4Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 5temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 6Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 7guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 8willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 9and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 10relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 11child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 12a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 13such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 14resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 15home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 16follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 175-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.18    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 19and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 20pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 21Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 22custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 23Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 24acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 25limited custody, the Department, during the period of 26temporary custody and before the child is brought before a   10400SB1504sam001- 18 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 25-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 3authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 4of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 5the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.6    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 7custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 8examination.9    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 10temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 11the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 12Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 13the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 14The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1510 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 16the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 17Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 18Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 19the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 20the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 21custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 22later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 23the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 24temporary custody of the child shall terminate.25    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 26age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department   10400SB1504sam001- 19 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1that cares for children who are in need of secure living 2arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 3determination is made by the facility director and the 4Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 5facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 6of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 7subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 8pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 9unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 10of the Department before being subject to placement in a 11correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 12has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.13    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 14age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 15the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 16preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 17child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 18placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 19clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 20in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 21Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 22those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 23guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 24Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 25facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 26of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of   10400SB1504sam001- 20 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 2dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 3However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 4where children require specialized care and treatment for 5problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 6social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 7facilities for the placement of such children are not 8available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 9this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 10be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 11garnishment or otherwise.12    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 13welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 14sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 15minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 16subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 171987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 18provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 19yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 20responsibility for the development and delivery of services 21under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 22under this Section through the Department of Children and 23Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 24Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 25shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 26an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how   10400SB1504sam001- 21 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 2homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 3youth receiving child welfare services under this Section.

The Department shall be responsible 17    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 18    account for any purpose.19        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 20    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 21    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 22    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 23    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 24    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 25    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 26    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of   10400SB1504sam001- 24 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.2        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 3    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 4    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 5    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 6    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.7    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 8encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 9the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 10who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 11hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 12of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 13of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 14Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 15confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 16of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 17adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 18such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 19agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 20Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 21confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 22of the child.23    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 24establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and 25private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the 26Department of Children and Family Services for damages   10400SB1504sam001- 25 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or 2negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third 3party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions 4of foster children to other individuals. Such coverage will be 5secondary to the foster parent liability insurance policy, if 6applicable. The program shall be funded through appropriations 7from the General Revenue Fund, specifically designated for 8such purposes.9    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 10investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 11as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 12Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:13        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 14    directs the Department to perform such services; and15        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 16    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 17    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 18    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 19    party is financially able to pay.20    The Department shall provide written notification to the 21court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 22and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 23The Department shall send to the court information related to 24the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 25determined the parties are financially unable to pay.

The Department may also provide categories of 11financial assistance and education assistance grants, and 12shall establish rules and regulations for the assistance and 13grants, to persons appointed guardian of the person under 14Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, 154-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 for children 16who were youth in care for 12 months immediately prior to the 17appointment of the guardian.18    The amount of assistance may vary, depending upon the 19needs of the child and the adoptive parents or subsidized 20guardians, as set forth in the annual assistance agreement. 21Special purpose grants are allowed where the child requires 22special service but such costs may not exceed the amounts 23which similar services would cost the Department if it were to 24provide or secure them as guardian of the child.25    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 26inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment,   10400SB1504sam001- 42 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 2a judgment or debt.3    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 4of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 5either outside of the Department region handling the case, or 6outside of the State of Illinois.7    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any 8child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 9dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 10or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.11    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 12services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and 13Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including 14adoptive and extended families. Family preservation services 15shall be offered (i) to prevent the placement of children in 16substitute care when the children can be cared for at home or 17in the custody of the person responsible for the children's 18welfare, (ii) to reunite children with their families, or 19(iii) to maintain an adoption or subsidized guardianship. 20Family preservation services shall only be offered when doing 21so will not endanger the children's health or safety. With 22respect to children who are in substitute care pursuant to the 23Juvenile Court Act of 1987, family preservation services shall 24not be offered if a goal other than those of subdivisions (A), 25(B), or (B-1) of subsection (2.3) of Section 2-28 of that Act 26has been set, except that reunification services may be   10400SB1504sam001- 43 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1offered as provided in paragraph (F) of subsection (2.3) of 2Section 2-28 of that Act. Nothing in this paragraph shall be 3construed to create a private right of action or claim on the 4part of any individual or child welfare agency, except that 5when a child is the subject of an action under Article II of 6the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 and the child's service plan 7calls for services to facilitate achievement of the permanency 8goal, the court hearing the action under Article II of the 9Juvenile Court Act of 1987 may order the Department to provide 10the services set out in the plan, if those services are not 11provided with reasonable promptness and if those services are 12available.13    The Department shall notify the child and the child's 14family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 15family preservation services as identified in the service 16plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 17services as soon as the report is determined to be 18"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 19family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 20or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 21investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 22Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 23willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 24investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 25child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 26child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to   10400SB1504sam001- 44 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1services available from other agencies in the community, even 2if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 3in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 4subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 5child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 6voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 7child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 8alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 9"differential response program" provided for in subsection 10(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 11Reporting Act.12    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 13children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 14care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 15as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 16requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 17Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 18be committed to the Department by any court without the 19approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 20effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 212017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 22Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 23adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 24or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 25less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 26Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor   10400SB1504sam001- 45 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 2exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 3minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 4to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 52-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 62017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 7Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 8adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 9or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 10less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 11Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 12for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 13exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 14minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 15to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 162-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 17exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 18or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 19circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 20delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 21attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 22the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 23hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 24release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 25    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 26implement a special program of family preservation services to   10400SB1504sam001- 46 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 2are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 3stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 4pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 5that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 6safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 7family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 8and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 9the child or family to services available from other agencies 10in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 11home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 12future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 13of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 14develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 15health and social service providers and the general public 16about these special family preservation services. The nature 17and scope of the services offered and the number of families 18served under the special program implemented under this 19paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 20Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 21"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 22a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 23Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 24edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 25Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.26    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best   10400SB1504sam001- 47 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 2most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 3option for the child, consistent with the child's best 4interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 5Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is 6practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General 7Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family 8Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 9occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 10arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 11outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 12at home without endangering the child's health or safety; 13reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if 14temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 15toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 16status.17    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 18respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 19making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 20shall be the paramount concern.21    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 22shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 23prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 24child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 25reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 26occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile   10400SB1504sam001- 48 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 2where the Department believes that further reunification 3services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 4the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 5The Department is not required to provide further 6reunification services after such a finding.7    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 8made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 9best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 10place the child with a relative, document those diligent 11efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 12secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue 13preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative 14is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 15concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 16Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 17in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 182025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 19diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 20relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 21should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 22delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 23permanent placement for the child.24    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 25planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 26shall consider the following factors when determining   10400SB1504sam001- 49 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1appropriateness of concurrent planning:2        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;3        (2) the past history of the family;4        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 5    the family;6        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;7        (4.5) the child's wishes; 8        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 9    family to reunite;10        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 11    provide a permanent placement;12        (7) the age of the child;13        (8) placement of siblings; and14        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 15    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 16    the child. 17    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 18child if:19        (1) it has received a written consent to such 20    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 21    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 22    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 23    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 24    or25        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 26    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be   10400SB1504sam001- 50 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    located.2If the child is found in the child's residence without a 3parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 4Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 5temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 6Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 7guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 8willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 9and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 10relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 11child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 12a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 13such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 14resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 15home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 16follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 175-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.18    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 19and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 20pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 21Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 22custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 23Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 24acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 25limited custody, the Department, during the period of 26temporary custody and before the child is brought before a   10400SB1504sam001- 51 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 25-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 3authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 4of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 5the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.6    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 7custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 8examination.9    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 10temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 11the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 12Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 13the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 14The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1510 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 16the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 17Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 18Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 19the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 20the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 21custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 22later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 23the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 24temporary custody of the child shall terminate.25    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 26age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department   10400SB1504sam001- 52 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1that cares for children who are in need of secure living 2arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 3determination is made by the facility director and the 4Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 5facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 6of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 7subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 8pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 9unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 10of the Department before being subject to placement in a 11correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 12has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.13    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 14age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 15the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 16preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 17child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 18placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 19clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 20in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 21Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 22those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 23guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 24Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 25facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 26of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of   10400SB1504sam001- 53 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 2dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 3However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 4where children require specialized care and treatment for 5problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 6social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 7facilities for the placement of such children are not 8available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 9this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 10be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 11garnishment or otherwise.12    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 13welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 14sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 15minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 16subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 171987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 18provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 19yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 20responsibility for the development and delivery of services 21under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 22under this Section through the Department of Children and 23Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 24Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 25shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 26an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how   10400SB1504sam001- 54 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 2homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 3youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 4Department shall continue child welfare services under this 5Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 6of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 7self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 8The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 9clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 10child welfare services under this Section and how such 11services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 12Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 13disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 14adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 15minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 16independent adults. 17    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 18review and appeal process for children and families who 19request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 20Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 21agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 22shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 23children and families in the case of placement by the 24Department, including the right to an initial review of a 25private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 26ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts   10400SB1504sam001- 55 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 2and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 3Department shall accept for administrative review and an 4appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 5with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following 6an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a 7prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of 8subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 9concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 10conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 11current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 122-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a 13judicial determination on the merits of an administrative 14appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 15placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 16shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 17review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 18placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 19identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 20criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 21interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 22of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 23multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 24rules regarding placement changes shall be followed. The rules 25shall outline the essential elements of each form used in the 26implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this   10400SB1504sam001- 56 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 2    (p) (Blank).3    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 4for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 5money or other property which is received on behalf of such 6children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 7or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 8the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 95.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 10under Section 5.46.11    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 12interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 13institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 14responsible and who have been determined eligible for 15Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 16allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 17parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 18Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 19miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 20be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 21with this subsection.22    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 23Department shall:24        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 25    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 26    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's   10400SB1504sam001- 57 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 2    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 3    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 4    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 5    account for any purpose.6        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 7    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 8    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 9    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 10    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 11    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 12    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 13    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 14    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.15        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 16    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 17    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 18    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 19    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.20    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 21encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 22the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 23who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 24hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 25of such children who have not been placed for adoption.

If the child remains 11placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the 12Department shall submit evidence at each status and permanency 13hearing: 14        (A) demonstrating that on-going assessment of the 15    strengths and needs of the child continues to support the 16    determination that the child's needs cannot be met through 17    placement in a foster family home, that the placement 18    provides the most effective and appropriate level of care 19    for the child in the least restrictive, appropriate 20    environment, and that the placement is consistent with the 21    short-term and long-term permanency goal for the child, as 22    specified in the permanency plan for the child; 23        (B) documenting the specific treatment or service 24    needs that should be met for the child in the placement and 25    the length of time the child is expected to need the 26    treatment or services;   10400SB1504sam001- 79 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        (C) detailing the efforts made by the agency to 2    prepare the child to return home or to be placed with a fit 3    and willing relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive 4    parent, or in a foster family home; and 5        (D) beginning July 1, 2025, documenting the 6    Department's efforts regarding ongoing family finding and 7    relative engagement required under Section 2-27.3; and . 8        (E) detailing efforts to ensure the minor is engaged 9    in age and developmentally appropriate activities to 10    develop life skills, which may include extracurricular 11    activities, coaching by caregivers, or instruction in 12    individual or group settings. For minors who have 13    participated in life skills assessments, the results of 14    such assessments and how the minor's identified needs are 15    being addressed. 16    (2) The first permanency hearing shall be conducted by the 17judge. Subsequent permanency hearings may be heard by a judge 18or by hearing officers appointed or approved by the court in 19the manner set forth in Section 2-28.1 of this Act. The initial 20hearing shall be held (a) within 12 months from the date 21temporary custody was taken, regardless of whether an 22adjudication or dispositional hearing has been completed 23within that time frame, (b) if the parental rights of both 24parents have been terminated in accordance with the procedure 25described in subsection (5) of Section 2-21, within 30 days of 26the order for termination of parental rights and appointment   10400SB1504sam001- 80 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1of a guardian with power to consent to adoption, or (c) in 2accordance with subsection (2) of Section 2-13.1. Subsequent 3permanency hearings shall be held every 6 months or more 4frequently if necessary in the court's determination following 5the initial permanency hearing, in accordance with the 6standards set forth in this Section, until the court 7determines that the plan and goal have been achieved. Once the 8plan and goal have been achieved, if the minor remains in 9substitute care, the case shall be reviewed at least every 6 10months thereafter, subject to the provisions of this Section, 11unless the minor is placed in the guardianship of a suitable 12relative or other person and the court determines that further 13monitoring by the court does not further the health, safety, 14or best interest of the child and that this is a stable 15permanent placement. The permanency hearings must occur within 16the time frames set forth in this subsection and may not be 17delayed in anticipation of a report from any source or due to 18the agency's failure to timely file its written report (this 19written report means the one required under the next paragraph 20and does not mean the service plan also referred to in that 21paragraph).22    The public agency that is the custodian or guardian of the 23minor, or another agency responsible for the minor's care, 24shall ensure that all parties to the permanency hearings are 25provided a copy of the most recent service plan prepared 26within the prior 6 months at least 14 days in advance of the   10400SB1504sam001- 81 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1hearing. If not contained in the agency's service plan, the 2agency shall also include a report setting forth the 3following:4        (A) any special physical, psychological, educational, 5    medical, emotional, or other needs of the minor or the 6    minor's family that are relevant to a permanency or 7    placement determination, and for any minor age 16 or over, 8    a written description of the programs and services that 9    will enable the minor to prepare for independent living; 10        (B) beginning July 1, 2025, a written description of 11    ongoing family finding and relative engagement efforts in 12    accordance with the requirements under Section 2-27.3 the 13    agency has undertaken since the most recent report to the 14    court to plan for the emotional and legal permanency of 15    the minor;16        (C) whether a minor is placed in a licensed child care 17    facility under a corrective plan by the Department due to 18    concerns impacting the minor's safety and well-being. The 19    report shall explain the steps the Department is taking to 20    ensure the safety and well-being of the minor and that the 21    minor's needs are met in the facility;22        (D) detail regarding what progress or lack of progress 23    the parent has made in correcting the conditions requiring 24    the child to be in care; whether the child can be returned 25    home without jeopardizing the child's health, safety, and 26    welfare, what permanency goal is recommended to be in the   10400SB1504sam001- 82 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    best interests of the child, and the reasons for the 2    recommendation. If a permanency goal under paragraph (A), 3    (B), or (B-1) of subsection (2.3) have been deemed 4    inappropriate and not in the minor's best interest, the 5    report must include the following information:6            (i) confirmation that the caseworker has discussed 7        the permanency options and subsidies available for 8        guardianship and adoption with the minor's caregivers, 9        the minor's parents, as appropriate, and has discussed 10        the available permanency options with the minor in an 11        age-appropriate manner;12            (ii) confirmation that the caseworker has 13        discussed with the minor's caregivers, the minor's 14        parents, as appropriate, and the minor as 15        age-appropriate, the distinctions between guardianship 16        and adoption, including, but not limited to, that 17        guardianship does not require termination of the 18        parent's rights or the consent of the parent;19            (iii) a description of the stated preferences and 20        concerns, if any, the minor, the parent as 21        appropriate, and the caregiver expressed relating to 22        the options of guardianship and adoption, and the 23        reasons for the preferences;24            (iv) if the minor is not currently in a placement 25        that will provide permanency, identification of all 26        persons presently willing and able to provide   10400SB1504sam001- 83 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        permanency to the minor through either guardianship or 2        adoption, and beginning July 1, 2025, if none are 3        available, a description of the efforts made in 4        accordance with Section 2-27.3; and5            (v) state the recommended permanency goal, why 6        that goal is recommended, and why the other potential 7        goals were not recommended. 8    The caseworker must appear and testify at the permanency 9hearing. If a permanency hearing has not previously been 10scheduled by the court, the moving party shall move for the 11setting of a permanency hearing and the entry of an order 12within the time frames set forth in this subsection.13    (2.3) At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine 14the permanency goal of the child. The court shall set one of 15the following permanency goals:16        (A) The minor will be returned home by a specific date 17    within 5 months.18        (B) The minor will be in short-term care with a 19    continued goal to return home within a period not to 20    exceed one year, where the progress of the parent or 21    parents is substantial giving particular consideration to 22    the age and individual needs of the minor.23        (B-1) The minor will be in short-term care with a 24    continued goal to return home pending a status hearing. 25    When the court finds that a parent has not made reasonable 26    efforts or reasonable progress to date, the court shall   10400SB1504sam001- 84 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    identify what actions the parent and the Department must 2    take in order to justify a finding of reasonable efforts 3    or reasonable progress and shall set a status hearing to 4    be held not earlier than 9 months from the date of 5    adjudication nor later than 11 months from the date of 6    adjudication during which the parent's progress will again 7    be reviewed.8        If the court has determined that goals (A), (B), and 9    (B-1) are not appropriate and not in the minor's best 10    interest, the court may select one of the following goals: 11    (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) for the minor as appropriate and 12    based on the best interests of the minor. The court shall 13    determine the appropriate goal for the minor based on best 14    interest factors and any considerations outlined in that 15    goal. 16        (C) The guardianship of the minor shall be transferred 17    to an individual or couple on a permanent basis. Prior to 18    changing the goal to guardianship, the court shall 19    consider the following: 20            (i) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 21        guardianship with the caregiver and what preference, 22        if any, the caregiver has as to the permanency goal;23            (ii) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 24        guardianship with the minor, as age-appropriate, and 25        what preference, if any, the minor has as to the 26        permanency goal;  10400SB1504sam001- 85 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1            (iii) whether the minor is of sufficient age to 2        remember the minor's parents and if the child values 3        this familial identity;4            (iv) whether the minor is placed with a relative, 5        and beginning July 1, 2025, whether the minor is 6        placed in a relative home as defined in Section 4d of 7        the Children and Family Services Act or in a certified 8        relative caregiver home as defined in Section 2.36 of 9        the Child Care Act of 1969; and10            (v) whether the parent or parents have been 11        informed about guardianship and adoption, and, if 12        appropriate, what preferences, if any, the parent or 13        parents have as to the permanency goal. 14        (D) The minor will be in substitute care pending court 15    determination on termination of parental rights. Prior to 16    changing the goal to substitute care pending court 17    determination on termination of parental rights, the court 18    shall consider the following: 19            (i) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 20        guardianship with the caregiver and what preference, 21        if any, the caregiver has as to the permanency goal;22            (ii) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 23        guardianship with the minor, as age-appropriate, and 24        what preference, if any, the minor has as to the 25        permanency goal;26            (iii) whether the minor is of sufficient age to   10400SB1504sam001- 86 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        remember the minor's parents and if the child values 2        this familial identity;3            (iv) whether the minor is placed with a relative, 4        and beginning July 1, 2025, whether the minor is 5        placed in a relative home as defined in Section 4d of 6        the Children and Family Services Act, in a certified 7        relative caregiver home as defined in Section 2.36 of 8        the Child Care Act of 1969;9            (v) whether the minor is already placed in a 10        pre-adoptive home, and if not, whether such a home has 11        been identified; and12            (vi) whether the parent or parents have been 13        informed about guardianship and adoption, and, if 14        appropriate, what preferences, if any, the parent or 15        parents have as to the permanency goal.16        (E) Adoption, provided that parental rights have been 17    terminated or relinquished.18        (F) Provided that permanency goals (A) through (E) 19    have been deemed inappropriate and not in the minor's best 20    interests, the minor over age 15 will be in substitute 21    care pending independence. In selecting this permanency 22    goal, the Department of Children and Family Services may 23    provide services to enable reunification and to strengthen 24    the minor's connections with family, fictive kin, and 25    other responsible adults, provided the services are in the 26    minor's best interest. The services shall be documented in   10400SB1504sam001- 87 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    the service plan. 2        (G) The minor will be in substitute care because the 3    minor cannot be provided for in a home environment due to 4    developmental disabilities or mental illness or because 5    the minor is a danger to self or others, provided that 6    goals (A) through (E) have been deemed inappropriate and 7    not in the child's best interests.8    In selecting any permanency goal, the court shall indicate 9in writing the reasons the goal was selected and why the 10preceding goals were deemed inappropriate and not in the 11child's best interest. Where the court has selected a 12permanency goal other than (A), (B), or (B-1), the Department 13of Children and Family Services shall not provide further 14reunification services, except as provided in paragraph (F) of 15this subsection (2.3), but shall provide services consistent 16with the goal selected.17        (H) Notwithstanding any other provision in this 18    Section, the court may select the goal of continuing 19    foster care as a permanency goal if: 20            (1) The Department of Children and Family Services 21        has custody and guardianship of the minor; 22            (2) The court has deemed all other permanency 23        goals inappropriate based on the child's best 24        interest; 25            (3) The court has found compelling reasons, based 26        on written documentation reviewed by the court, to   10400SB1504sam001- 88 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        place the minor in continuing foster care. Compelling 2        reasons include: 3                (a) the child does not wish to be adopted or to 4            be placed in the guardianship of the minor's 5            relative, certified relative caregiver, or foster 6            care placement; 7                (b) the child exhibits an extreme level of 8            need such that the removal of the child from the 9            minor's placement would be detrimental to the 10            child; or 11                (c) the child who is the subject of the 12            permanency hearing has existing close and strong 13            bonds with a sibling, and achievement of another 14            permanency goal would substantially interfere with 15            the subject child's sibling relationship, taking 16            into consideration the nature and extent of the 17            relationship, and whether ongoing contact is in 18            the subject child's best interest, including 19            long-term emotional interest, as compared with the 20            legal and emotional benefit of permanence; 21            (4) The child has lived with the relative, 22        certified relative caregiver, or foster parent for at 23        least one year; and 24            (5) The relative, certified relative caregiver, or 25        foster parent currently caring for the child is 26        willing and capable of providing the child with a   10400SB1504sam001- 89 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        stable and permanent environment. 2    (2.4) The court shall set a permanency goal that is in the 3best interest of the child. In determining that goal, the 4court shall consult with the minor in an age-appropriate 5manner regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan 6for the minor. The court's determination shall include the 7following factors:8        (A) Age of the child.9        (B) Options available for permanence, including both 10    out-of-state and in-state placement options.11        (C) Current placement of the child and the intent of 12    the family regarding subsidized guardianship and adoption.13        (D) Emotional, physical, and mental status or 14    condition of the child.15        (E) Types of services previously offered and whether 16    or not the services were successful and, if not 17    successful, the reasons the services failed.18        (F) Availability of services currently needed and 19    whether the services exist.20        (G) Status of siblings of the minor.21        (H) If the minor is not currently in a placement 22    likely to achieve permanency, whether there is an 23    identified and willing potential permanent caregiver for 24    the minor, and if so, that potential permanent caregiver's 25    intent regarding guardianship and adoption. 26    The court shall consider (i) the permanency goal contained   10400SB1504sam001- 90 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1in the service plan, (ii) the appropriateness of the services 2contained in the plan and whether those services have been 3provided, (iii) whether reasonable efforts have been made by 4all the parties to the service plan to achieve the goal, and 5(iv) whether the plan and goal have been achieved. All 6evidence relevant to determining these questions, including 7oral and written reports, may be admitted and may be relied on 8to the extent of their probative value.9    The court shall make findings as to whether, in violation 10of Section 8.2 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting 11Act, any portion of the service plan compels a child or parent 12to engage in any activity or refrain from any activity that is 13not reasonably related to remedying a condition or conditions 14that gave rise or which could give rise to any finding of child 15abuse or neglect. The services contained in the service plan 16shall include services reasonably related to remedy the 17conditions that gave rise to removal of the child from the home 18of the child's parents, guardian, or legal custodian or that 19the court has found must be remedied prior to returning the 20child home. Any tasks the court requires of the parents, 21guardian, or legal custodian or child prior to returning the 22child home must be reasonably related to remedying a condition 23or conditions that gave rise to or which could give rise to any 24finding of child abuse or neglect. 25    If the permanency goal is to return home, the court shall 26make findings that identify any problems that are causing   10400SB1504sam001- 91 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1continued placement of the children away from the home and 2identify what outcomes would be considered a resolution to 3these problems. The court shall explain to the parents that 4these findings are based on the information that the court has 5at that time and may be revised, should additional evidence be 6presented to the court. 7    The court shall review the Sibling Contact Support Plan 8developed or modified under subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of 9the Children and Family Services Act, if applicable. If the 10Department has not convened a meeting to develop or modify a 11Sibling Contact Support Plan, or if the court finds that the 12existing Plan is not in the child's best interest, the court 13may enter an order requiring the Department to develop, 14modify, or implement a Sibling Contact Support Plan, or order 15mediation. 16    The court shall review the Department's efforts to provide 17the minor with age and developmentally appropriate life 18skills. If the court finds the Department's efforts are not in 19the minor's best interest, the court may enter an order 20requiring the Department to develop, modify, or implement the 21service plan to develop the minor's life skills in an age and 22developmentally appropriate manner. 23    Beginning July 1, 2025, the court shall review the Ongoing 24Family Finding and Relative Engagement Plan required under 25Section 2-27.3. If the court finds that the plan is not in the 26minor's best interest, the court shall enter specific factual   10400SB1504sam001- 92 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1findings and order the Department to modify the plan 2consistent with the court's findings. 3    If the goal has been achieved, the court shall enter 4orders that are necessary to conform the minor's legal custody 5and status to those findings.6    If, after receiving evidence, the court determines that 7the services contained in the plan are not reasonably 8calculated to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, 9the court shall put in writing the factual basis supporting 10the determination and enter specific findings based on the 11evidence. The court also shall enter an order for the 12Department to develop and implement a new service plan or to 13implement changes to the current service plan consistent with 14the court's findings. The new service plan shall be filed with 15the court and served on all parties within 45 days of the date 16of the order. The court shall continue the matter until the new 17service plan is filed. Except as authorized by subsection 18(2.5) of this Section and as otherwise specifically authorized 19by law, the court is not empowered under this Section to order 20specific placements, specific services, or specific service 21providers to be included in the service plan.22    A guardian or custodian appointed by the court pursuant to 23this Act shall file updated case plans with the court every 6 24months.25    Rights of wards of the court under this Act are 26enforceable against any public agency by complaints for relief   10400SB1504sam001- 93 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1by mandamus filed in any proceedings brought under this Act.2    (2.5) If, after reviewing the evidence, including evidence 3from the Department, the court determines that the minor's 4current or planned placement is not necessary or appropriate 5to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court 6shall put in writing the factual basis supporting its 7determination and enter specific findings based on the 8evidence. If the court finds that the minor's current or 9planned placement is not necessary or appropriate, the court 10may enter an order directing the Department to implement a 11recommendation by the minor's treating clinician or a 12clinician contracted by the Department to evaluate the minor 13or a recommendation made by the Department. If the Department 14places a minor in a placement under an order entered under this 15subsection (2.5), the Department has the authority to remove 16the minor from that placement when a change in circumstances 17necessitates the removal to protect the minor's health, 18safety, and best interest. If the Department determines 19removal is necessary, the Department shall notify the parties 20of the planned placement change in writing no later than 10 21days prior to the implementation of its determination unless 22remaining in the placement poses an imminent risk of harm to 23the minor, in which case the Department shall notify the 24parties of the placement change in writing immediately 25following the implementation of its decision. The Department 26shall notify others of the decision to change the minor's   10400SB1504sam001- 94 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1placement as required by Department rule. 2    (3) Following the permanency hearing, the court shall 3enter a written order that includes the determinations 4required under subsections (2) and (2.3) of this Section and 5sets forth the following:6        (a) The future status of the minor, including the 7    permanency goal, and any order necessary to conform the 8    minor's legal custody and status to such determination; or9        (b) If the permanency goal of the minor cannot be 10    achieved immediately, the specific reasons for continuing 11    the minor in the care of the Department of Children and 12    Family Services or other agency for short-term placement, 13    and the following determinations:14            (i) (Blank).15            (ii) Whether the services required by the court 16        and by any service plan prepared within the prior 6 17        months have been provided and (A) if so, whether the 18        services were reasonably calculated to facilitate the 19        achievement of the permanency goal or (B) if not 20        provided, why the services were not provided.21            (iii) Whether the minor's current or planned 22        placement is necessary, and appropriate to the plan 23        and goal, recognizing the right of minors to the least 24        restrictive (most family-like) setting available and 25        in close proximity to the parents' home consistent 26        with the health, safety, best interest, and special   10400SB1504sam001- 95 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        needs of the minor and, if the minor is placed 2        out-of-state, whether the out-of-state placement 3        continues to be appropriate and consistent with the 4        health, safety, and best interest of the minor.5            (iv) (Blank).6            (v) (Blank).7    If the court sets a permanency goal of independence or if 8the minor is 17 years of age or older, the court shall schedule 9a Successful Transition to Adulthood Review hearing in 10accordance with Section 2-28.2. 11    (4) The minor or any person interested in the minor may 12apply to the court for a change in custody of the minor and the 13appointment of a new custodian or guardian of the person or for 14the restoration of the minor to the custody of the minor's 15parents or former guardian or custodian.16    When return home is not selected as the permanency goal:17        (a) The Department, the minor, or the current foster 18    parent or relative caregiver seeking private guardianship 19    may file a motion for private guardianship of the minor. 20    Appointment of a guardian under this Section requires 21    approval of the court.22        (b) The State's Attorney may file a motion to 23    terminate parental rights of any parent who has failed to 24    make reasonable efforts to correct the conditions which 25    led to the removal of the child or reasonable progress 26    toward the return of the child, as defined in subdivision   10400SB1504sam001- 96 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    (D)(m) of Section 1 of the Adoption Act or for whom any 2    other unfitness ground for terminating parental rights as 3    defined in subdivision (D) of Section 1 of the Adoption 4    Act exists.5        When parental rights have been terminated for a 6    minimum of 3 years and the child who is the subject of the 7    permanency hearing is 13 years old or older and is not 8    currently placed in a placement likely to achieve 9    permanency, the Department of Children and Family Services 10    shall make reasonable efforts to locate parents whose 11    rights have been terminated, except when the Court 12    determines that those efforts would be futile or 13    inconsistent with the subject child's best interests. The 14    Department of Children and Family Services shall assess 15    the appropriateness of the parent whose rights have been 16    terminated, and shall, as appropriate, foster and support 17    connections between the parent whose rights have been 18    terminated and the youth. The Department of Children and 19    Family Services shall document its determinations and 20    efforts to foster connections in the child's case plan. 21    Custody of the minor shall not be restored to any parent, 22guardian, or legal custodian in any case in which the minor is 23found to be neglected or abused under Section 2-3 or dependent 24under Section 2-4 of this Act, unless the minor can be cared 25for at home without endangering the minor's health or safety 26and it is in the best interest of the minor, and if such   10400SB1504sam001- 97 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1neglect, abuse, or dependency is found by the court under 2paragraph (1) of Section 2-21 of this Act to have come about 3due to the acts or omissions or both of such parent, guardian, 4or legal custodian, until such time as an investigation is 5made as provided in paragraph (5) and a hearing is held on the 6issue of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor and 7the fitness of such parent, guardian, or legal custodian to 8care for the minor and the court enters an order that such 9parent, guardian, or legal custodian is fit to care for the 10minor.

The requirements of this   10400SB1504sam001- 6 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1Section concerning advance disbursements shall not apply with 2respect to the following: payments to local public agencies 3for child day care services as authorized by Section 5a of this 4Act; and youth service programs receiving grant funds under 5Section 17a-4.6    (e) (Blank).7    (f) (Blank).8    (g) The Department shall establish rules and regulations 9concerning its operation of programs designed to meet the 10goals of child safety and protection, family preservation, 11family reunification, and adoption, including, but not limited 12to:13        (1) adoption;14        (2) foster care;15        (3) family counseling;16        (4) protective services;17        (5) (blank);18        (6) homemaker service;19        (7) return of runaway children;20        (8) (blank);21        (9) placement under Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court 22    Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, 4-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile 23    Court Act of 1987 in accordance with the federal Adoption 24    Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980; and25        (10) interstate services.26    Rules and regulations established by the Department shall   10400SB1504sam001- 7 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1include provisions for training Department staff and the staff 2of Department grantees, through contracts with other agencies 3or resources, in screening techniques to identify substance 4use disorders, as defined in the Substance Use Disorder Act, 5approved by the Department of Human Services, as a successor 6to the Department of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, for the 7purpose of identifying children and adults who should be 8referred for an assessment at an organization appropriately 9licensed by the Department of Human Services for substance use 10disorder treatment.11    (h) If the Department finds that there is no appropriate 12program or facility within or available to the Department for 13a youth in care and that no licensed private facility has an 14adequate and appropriate program or none agrees to accept the 15youth in care, the Department shall create an appropriate 16individualized, program-oriented plan for such youth in care. 17The plan may be developed within the Department or through 18purchase of services by the Department to the extent that it is 19within its statutory authority to do.20    (i) Service programs shall be available throughout the 21State and shall include but not be limited to the following 22services:23        (1) case management;24        (2) homemakers;25        (3) counseling;26        (4) parent education;  10400SB1504sam001- 8 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        (5) day care; and2        (6) emergency assistance and advocacy.3    In addition, the following services may be made available 4to assess and meet the needs of children and families:5        (1) comprehensive family-based services;6        (2) assessments;7        (3) respite care; and8        (4) in-home health services.9    The Department shall provide transportation for any of the 10services it makes available to children or families or for 11which it refers children or families.12    (j) The Department may provide categories of financial 13assistance and education assistance grants, and shall 14establish rules and regulations concerning the assistance and 15grants, to persons who adopt children with physical or mental 16disabilities, children who are older, or other hard-to-place 17children who (i) immediately prior to their adoption were 18youth in care or (ii) were determined eligible for financial 19assistance with respect to a prior adoption and who become 20available for adoption because the prior adoption has been 21dissolved and the parental rights of the adoptive parents have 22been terminated or because the child's adoptive parents have 23died. The Department may continue to provide financial 24assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was 25determined eligible for financial assistance under this 26subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the   10400SB1504sam001- 9 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization 2of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or 3parents. The Department may also provide categories of 4financial assistance and education assistance grants, and 5shall establish rules and regulations for the assistance and 6grants, to persons appointed guardian of the person under 7Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, 84-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 for children 9who were youth in care for 12 months immediately prior to the 10appointment of the guardian.11    The amount of assistance may vary, depending upon the 12needs of the child and the adoptive parents, as set forth in 13the annual assistance agreement. Special purpose grants are 14allowed where the child requires special service but such 15costs may not exceed the amounts which similar services would 16cost the Department if it were to provide or secure them as 17guardian of the child.18    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 19inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, 20garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 21a judgment or debt.22    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 23of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 24either outside of the Department region handling the case, or 25outside of the State of Illinois.26    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any   10400SB1504sam001- 10 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 2dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 3or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.4    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 5services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and 6Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including 7adoptive and extended families. Family preservation services 8shall be offered (i) to prevent the placement of children in 9substitute care when the children can be cared for at home or 10in the custody of the person responsible for the children's 11welfare, (ii) to reunite children with their families, or 12(iii) to maintain an adoptive placement. Family preservation 13services shall only be offered when doing so will not endanger 14the children's health or safety. With respect to children who 15are in substitute care pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of 161987, family preservation services shall not be offered if a 17goal other than those of subdivisions (A), (B), or (B-1) of 18subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act has been set, except 19that reunification services may be offered as provided in 20paragraph (F) of subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act. 21Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create a 22private right of action or claim on the part of any individual 23or child welfare agency, except that when a child is the 24subject of an action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act 25of 1987 and the child's service plan calls for services to 26facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court   10400SB1504sam001- 11 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1hearing the action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act 2of 1987 may order the Department to provide the services set 3out in the plan, if those services are not provided with 4reasonable promptness and if those services are available.5    The Department shall notify the child and the child's 6family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 7family preservation services as identified in the service 8plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 9services as soon as the report is determined to be 10"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 11family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 12or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 13investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 14Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 15willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 16investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 17child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 18child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 19services available from other agencies in the community, even 20if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 21in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 22subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 23child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 24voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 25child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 26alternative to an investigation, as provided under the   10400SB1504sam001- 12 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1"differential response program" provided for in subsection 2(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 3Reporting Act.4    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 5children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 6care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 7as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 8requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 9Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 10be committed to the Department by any court without the 11approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 12effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 132017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 14Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 15adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 16or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 17less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 18Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 19for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 20exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 21minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 22to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 232-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 242017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 25Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 26adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of   10400SB1504sam001- 13 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 2less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 3Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 4for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 5exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 6minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 7to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 82-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 9exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 10or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 11circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 12delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 13attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 14the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 15hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 16release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 17    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 18date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 19implement a special program of family preservation services to 20support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 21experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 22stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 23pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 24that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 25safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 26family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused   10400SB1504sam001- 14 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 2the child or family to services available from other agencies 3in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 4home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 5future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 6of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 7develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 8health and social service providers and the general public 9about these special family preservation services. The nature 10and scope of the services offered and the number of families 11served under the special program implemented under this 12paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 13Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 14"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 15a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 16Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 17edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 18Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.19    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 20interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 21most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 22possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 23the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 24concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 25earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 26include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of   10400SB1504sam001- 15 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1the family when the child can be cared for at home without 2endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 3the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 4is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 5permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.6    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 7respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 8making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 9shall be the paramount concern.10    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 11shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 12prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 13child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 14reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 15occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 16Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 17where the Department believes that further reunification 18services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 19the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 20The Department is not required to provide further 21reunification services after such a finding.22    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 23made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 24best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 25also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 26placement made is the best available placement to provide   10400SB1504sam001- 16 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1permanency for the child.2    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 3planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 4shall consider the following factors when determining 5appropriateness of concurrent planning:6        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;7        (2) the past history of the family;8        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 9    the family;10        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;11        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 12    family to reunite;13        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 14    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;15        (7) the age of the child;16        (8) placement of siblings.17    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 18child if:19        (1) it has received a written consent to such 20    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 21    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 22    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 23    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 24    or25        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 26    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be   10400SB1504sam001- 17 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    located.2If the child is found in the child's residence without a 3parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 4Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 5temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 6Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 7guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 8willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 9and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 10relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 11child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 12a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 13such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 14resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 15home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 16follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 175-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.18    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 19and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 20pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 21Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 22custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 23Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 24acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 25limited custody, the Department, during the period of 26temporary custody and before the child is brought before a   10400SB1504sam001- 18 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 25-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 3authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 4of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 5the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.6    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 7custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 8examination.9    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 10temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 11the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 12Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 13the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 14The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1510 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 16the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 17Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 18Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 19the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 20the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 21custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 22later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 23the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 24temporary custody of the child shall terminate.25    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 26age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department   10400SB1504sam001- 19 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1that cares for children who are in need of secure living 2arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 3determination is made by the facility director and the 4Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 5facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 6of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 7subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 8pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 9unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 10of the Department before being subject to placement in a 11correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 12has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.13    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 14age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 15the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 16preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 17child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 18placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 19clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 20in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 21Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 22those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 23guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 24Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 25facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 26of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of   10400SB1504sam001- 20 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 2dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 3However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 4where children require specialized care and treatment for 5problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 6social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 7facilities for the placement of such children are not 8available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 9this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 10be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 11garnishment or otherwise.12    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 13welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 14sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 15minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 16subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 171987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 18provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 19yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 20responsibility for the development and delivery of services 21under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 22under this Section through the Department of Children and 23Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 24Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 25shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 26an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how   10400SB1504sam001- 21 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 2homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 3youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 4Department shall continue child welfare services under this 5Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 6of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 7self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 8The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 9clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 10child welfare services under this Section and how such 11services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 12Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 13disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 14adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 15minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 16independent adults. 17    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 18review and appeal process for children and families who 19request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 20Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 21agencies, and foster families with whom those youth are 22placed, shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal 23rights as children and families in the case of placement by the 24Department, including the right to an initial review of a 25private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 26ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts   10400SB1504sam001- 22 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 2and foster families. The Department shall accept for 3administrative review and an appeal hearing a complaint made 4by (i) a child or foster family concerning a decision 5following an initial review by a private child welfare agency 6or (ii) a prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation 7of subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 8concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 9conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 10current foster home placement is necessary and appropriate 11under Section 2-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not 12constitute a judicial determination on the merits of an 13administrative appeal, filed by a former foster parent, 14involving a change of placement decision.15    (p) (Blank).16    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 17for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 18money or other property which is received on behalf of such 19children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 20or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 21the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 225.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 23under Section 5.46.24    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 25interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 26institutions for children for whom the Department is legally   10400SB1504sam001- 23 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1responsible and who have been determined eligible for 2Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 3allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 4parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 5Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 6miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 7be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 8with this subsection.9    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 10Department shall:11        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 12    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 13    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 14    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 15    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 16    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 17    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 18    account for any purpose.19        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 20    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 21    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 22    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 23    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 24    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 25    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 26    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of   10400SB1504sam001- 24 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.2        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 3    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 4    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 5    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 6    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.7    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 8encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 9the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 10who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 11hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 12of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 13of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 14Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 15confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 16of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 17adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 18such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 19agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 20Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 21confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 22of the child.23    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 24establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and 25private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the 26Department of Children and Family Services for damages   10400SB1504sam001- 25 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or 2negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third 3party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions 4of foster children to other individuals.

On and after January 1, 62017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 7Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 8adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 9or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 10less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 11Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 12for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 13exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 14minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 15to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 162-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 17exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 18or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 19circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 20delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 21attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 22the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 23hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 24release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 25    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 26implement a special program of family preservation services to   10400SB1504sam001- 46 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 2are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 3stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 4pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 5that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 6safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 7family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 8and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 9the child or family to services available from other agencies 10in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 11home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 12future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 13of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 14develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 15health and social service providers and the general public 16about these special family preservation services. The nature 17and scope of the services offered and the number of families 18served under the special program implemented under this 19paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 20Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 21"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 22a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 23Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 24edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 25Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.26    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best   10400SB1504sam001- 47 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 2most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 3option for the child, consistent with the child's best 4interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 5Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is 6practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General 7Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family 8Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 9occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 10arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 11outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 12at home without endangering the child's health or safety; 13reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if 14temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 15toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 16status.17    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 18respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 19making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 20shall be the paramount concern.21    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 22shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 23prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 24child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 25reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 26occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile   10400SB1504sam001- 48 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 2where the Department believes that further reunification 3services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 4the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 5The Department is not required to provide further 6reunification services after such a finding.7    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 8made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 9best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 10place the child with a relative, document those diligent 11efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 12secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue 13preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative 14is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 15concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 16Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 17in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 182025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 19diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 20relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 21should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 22delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 23permanent placement for the child.24    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 25planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 26shall consider the following factors when determining   10400SB1504sam001- 49 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1appropriateness of concurrent planning:2        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;3        (2) the past history of the family;4        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 5    the family;6        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;7        (4.5) the child's wishes; 8        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 9    family to reunite;10        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 11    provide a permanent placement;12        (7) the age of the child;13        (8) placement of siblings; and14        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 15    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 16    the child. 17    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 18child if:19        (1) it has received a written consent to such 20    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 21    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 22    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 23    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 24    or25        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 26    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be   10400SB1504sam001- 50 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    located.2If the child is found in the child's residence without a 3parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 4Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 5temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 6Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 7guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 8willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 9and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 10relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 11child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 12a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 13such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 14resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 15home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 16follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 175-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.18    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 19and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 20pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 21Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 22custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 23Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 24acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 25limited custody, the Department, during the period of 26temporary custody and before the child is brought before a   10400SB1504sam001- 51 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 25-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 3authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 4of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 5the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.6    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 7custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 8examination.9    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 10temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 11the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 12Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 13the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 14The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1510 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 16the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 17Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 18Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 19the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 20the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 21custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 22later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 23the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 24temporary custody of the child shall terminate.25    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 26age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department   10400SB1504sam001- 52 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1that cares for children who are in need of secure living 2arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 3determination is made by the facility director and the 4Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 5facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 6of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 7subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 8pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 9unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 10of the Department before being subject to placement in a 11correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 12has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.13    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 14age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 15the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 16preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 17child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 18placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 19clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 20in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 21Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 22those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 23guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 24Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 25facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 26of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of   10400SB1504sam001- 53 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 2dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 3However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 4where children require specialized care and treatment for 5problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 6social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 7facilities for the placement of such children are not 8available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 9this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 10be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 11garnishment or otherwise.12    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 13welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 14sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 15minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 16subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 171987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 18provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 19yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 20responsibility for the development and delivery of services 21under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 22under this Section through the Department of Children and 23Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 24Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 25shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 26an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how   10400SB1504sam001- 54 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 2homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 3youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 4Department shall continue child welfare services under this 5Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 6of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 7self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 8The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 9clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 10child welfare services under this Section and how such 11services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 12Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 13disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 14adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 15minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 16independent adults. 17    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 18review and appeal process for children and families who 19request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 20Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 21agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 22shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 23children and families in the case of placement by the 24Department, including the right to an initial review of a 25private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 26ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts   10400SB1504sam001- 55 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 2and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 3Department shall accept for administrative review and an 4appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 5with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following 6an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a 7prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of 8subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 9concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 10conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 11current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 122-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a 13judicial determination on the merits of an administrative 14appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 15placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 16shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 17review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 18placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 19identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 20criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 21interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 22of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 23multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 24rules regarding placement changes shall be followed. The rules 25shall outline the essential elements of each form used in the 26implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this   10400SB1504sam001- 56 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 2    (p) (Blank).3    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 4for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 5money or other property which is received on behalf of such 6children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 7or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 8the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 95.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 10under Section 5.46.11    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 12interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 13institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 14responsible and who have been determined eligible for 15Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 16allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 17parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 18Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 19miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 20be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 21with this subsection.22    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 23Department shall:24        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 25    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 26    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's   10400SB1504sam001- 57 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 2    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 3    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 4    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 5    account for any purpose.6        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 7    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 8    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 9    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 10    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 11    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 12    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 13    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 14    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.15        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 16    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 17    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 18    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 19    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.20    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 21encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 22the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 23who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 24hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 25of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 26of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the   10400SB1504sam001- 58 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 2confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 3of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 4adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 5such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 6agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 7Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 8confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 9of the child.10    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 11establish and implement a program to reimburse caregivers 12licensed, certified, or otherwise approved by the Department 13of Children and Family Services for damages sustained by the 14caregivers as a result of the malicious or negligent acts of 15children placed by the Department, as well as providing third 16party coverage for such caregivers with regard to actions of 17children placed by the Department to other individuals. Such 18coverage will be secondary to the caregiver's liability 19insurance policy, if applicable. The program shall be funded 20through appropriations from the General Revenue Fund, 21specifically designated for such purposes.22    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 23investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 24as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 25Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:26        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically   10400SB1504sam001- 59 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    directs the Department to perform such services; and2        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 3    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 4    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 5    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 6    party is financially able to pay.7    The Department shall provide written notification to the 8court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 9and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 10The Department shall send to the court information related to 11the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 12determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The 13court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.14    (u) In addition to other information that must be 15provided, whenever the Department places a child with a 16prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster 17home, group home, or child care institution, in a relative 18home, or in a certified relative caregiver home, the 19Department shall provide to the caregiver, appropriate 20facility staff, or prospective adoptive parent or parents:21        (1) available detailed information concerning the 22    child's educational and health history, copies of 23    immunization records (including insurance and medical card 24    information), a history of the child's previous 25    placements, if any, and reasons for placement changes 26    excluding any information that identifies or reveals the   10400SB1504sam001- 60 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    location of any previous caregiver or adoptive parents;2        (2) a copy of the child's portion of the client 3    service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and 4    all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; 5    and6        (3) information containing details of the child's 7    individualized educational plan when the child is 8    receiving special education services.9    The caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective 10adoptive parent or parents, shall be informed of any known 11social or behavioral information (including, but not limited 12to, criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual 13abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to 14care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently 15in the home or setting. The Department may prepare a written 16summary of the information required by this paragraph, which 17may be provided to the caregiver, appropriate facility staff, 18or prospective adoptive parent in advance of a placement. The 19caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive 20parent may review the supporting documents in the child's file 21in the presence of casework staff. In the case of an emergency 22placement, casework staff shall at least provide known 23information verbally, if necessary, and must subsequently 24provide the information in writing as required by this 25subsection. 26    The information described in this subsection shall be   10400SB1504sam001- 61 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1provided in writing.

The Department shall apply for and 21    administer all relevant federal aid in accordance with 22    law. Federal funds acquired for the kinship navigator 23    program shall be used for the development, implementation, 24    and operation of kinship navigator program services. The 25    kinship navigator program services may provide 26    information, referral services, support, and assistance to   10400SB1504sam001- 63 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    relative and certified relative caregivers of youth in 2    care to address their unique needs and challenges. Until 3    the Department is approved to receive federal funds for 4    these purposes, the Department shall publicly post on the 5    Department's website semi-annual updates regarding the 6    Department's progress in pursuing federal funding. 7    Whenever the Department publicly posts these updates on 8    its website, the Department shall notify the General 9    Assembly through the General Assembly's designee. 10    (u-7) To support finding permanency for children through 11subsidized guardianship and adoption and to prevent disruption 12in guardianship and adoptive placements, the Department shall 13establish and maintain accessible subsidized guardianship and 14adoption support services for all children under 18 years of 15age placed in guardianship or adoption who, immediately 16preceding the guardianship or adoption, were in the custody or 17guardianship of the Department under Article II of the 18Juvenile Court Act of 1987.19    The Department shall establish and maintain a toll-free 20number to respond to requests from the public about its 21subsidized guardianship and adoption support services under 22this subsection and shall staff the toll-free number so that 23calls are answered on a timely basis, but in no event more than 24one business day after the receipt of a request.

The court shall set one of 15the following permanency goals:16        (A) The minor will be returned home by a specific date 17    within 5 months.18        (B) The minor will be in short-term care with a 19    continued goal to return home within a period not to 20    exceed one year, where the progress of the parent or 21    parents is substantial giving particular consideration to 22    the age and individual needs of the minor.23        (B-1) The minor will be in short-term care with a 24    continued goal to return home pending a status hearing. 25    When the court finds that a parent has not made reasonable 26    efforts or reasonable progress to date, the court shall   10400SB1504sam001- 84 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    identify what actions the parent and the Department must 2    take in order to justify a finding of reasonable efforts 3    or reasonable progress and shall set a status hearing to 4    be held not earlier than 9 months from the date of 5    adjudication nor later than 11 months from the date of 6    adjudication during which the parent's progress will again 7    be reviewed.8        If the court has determined that goals (A), (B), and 9    (B-1) are not appropriate and not in the minor's best 10    interest, the court may select one of the following goals: 11    (C), (D), (E), (F), or (G) for the minor as appropriate and 12    based on the best interests of the minor. The court shall 13    determine the appropriate goal for the minor based on best 14    interest factors and any considerations outlined in that 15    goal. 16        (C) The guardianship of the minor shall be transferred 17    to an individual or couple on a permanent basis. Prior to 18    changing the goal to guardianship, the court shall 19    consider the following: 20            (i) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 21        guardianship with the caregiver and what preference, 22        if any, the caregiver has as to the permanency goal;23            (ii) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 24        guardianship with the minor, as age-appropriate, and 25        what preference, if any, the minor has as to the 26        permanency goal;  10400SB1504sam001- 85 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1            (iii) whether the minor is of sufficient age to 2        remember the minor's parents and if the child values 3        this familial identity;4            (iv) whether the minor is placed with a relative, 5        and beginning July 1, 2025, whether the minor is 6        placed in a relative home as defined in Section 4d of 7        the Children and Family Services Act or in a certified 8        relative caregiver home as defined in Section 2.36 of 9        the Child Care Act of 1969; and10            (v) whether the parent or parents have been 11        informed about guardianship and adoption, and, if 12        appropriate, what preferences, if any, the parent or 13        parents have as to the permanency goal. 14        (D) The minor will be in substitute care pending court 15    determination on termination of parental rights. Prior to 16    changing the goal to substitute care pending court 17    determination on termination of parental rights, the court 18    shall consider the following: 19            (i) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 20        guardianship with the caregiver and what preference, 21        if any, the caregiver has as to the permanency goal;22            (ii) whether the agency has discussed adoption and 23        guardianship with the minor, as age-appropriate, and 24        what preference, if any, the minor has as to the 25        permanency goal;26            (iii) whether the minor is of sufficient age to   10400SB1504sam001- 86 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        remember the minor's parents and if the child values 2        this familial identity;3            (iv) whether the minor is placed with a relative, 4        and beginning July 1, 2025, whether the minor is 5        placed in a relative home as defined in Section 4d of 6        the Children and Family Services Act, in a certified 7        relative caregiver home as defined in Section 2.36 of 8        the Child Care Act of 1969;9            (v) whether the minor is already placed in a 10        pre-adoptive home, and if not, whether such a home has 11        been identified; and12            (vi) whether the parent or parents have been 13        informed about guardianship and adoption, and, if 14        appropriate, what preferences, if any, the parent or 15        parents have as to the permanency goal.16        (E) Adoption, provided that parental rights have been 17    terminated or relinquished.18        (F) Provided that permanency goals (A) through (E) 19    have been deemed inappropriate and not in the minor's best 20    interests, the minor over age 15 will be in substitute 21    care pending independence. In selecting this permanency 22    goal, the Department of Children and Family Services may 23    provide services to enable reunification and to strengthen 24    the minor's connections with family, fictive kin, and 25    other responsible adults, provided the services are in the 26    minor's best interest. The services shall be documented in   10400SB1504sam001- 87 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    the service plan. 2        (G) The minor will be in substitute care because the 3    minor cannot be provided for in a home environment due to 4    developmental disabilities or mental illness or because 5    the minor is a danger to self or others, provided that 6    goals (A) through (E) have been deemed inappropriate and 7    not in the child's best interests.8    In selecting any permanency goal, the court shall indicate 9in writing the reasons the goal was selected and why the 10preceding goals were deemed inappropriate and not in the 11child's best interest. Where the court has selected a 12permanency goal other than (A), (B), or (B-1), the Department 13of Children and Family Services shall not provide further 14reunification services, except as provided in paragraph (F) of 15this subsection (2.3), but shall provide services consistent 16with the goal selected.17        (H) Notwithstanding any other provision in this 18    Section, the court may select the goal of continuing 19    foster care as a permanency goal if: 20            (1) The Department of Children and Family Services 21        has custody and guardianship of the minor; 22            (2) The court has deemed all other permanency 23        goals inappropriate based on the child's best 24        interest; 25            (3) The court has found compelling reasons, based 26        on written documentation reviewed by the court, to   10400SB1504sam001- 88 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        place the minor in continuing foster care. Compelling 2        reasons include: 3                (a) the child does not wish to be adopted or to 4            be placed in the guardianship of the minor's 5            relative, certified relative caregiver, or foster 6            care placement; 7                (b) the child exhibits an extreme level of 8            need such that the removal of the child from the 9            minor's placement would be detrimental to the 10            child; or 11                (c) the child who is the subject of the 12            permanency hearing has existing close and strong 13            bonds with a sibling, and achievement of another 14            permanency goal would substantially interfere with 15            the subject child's sibling relationship, taking 16            into consideration the nature and extent of the 17            relationship, and whether ongoing contact is in 18            the subject child's best interest, including 19            long-term emotional interest, as compared with the 20            legal and emotional benefit of permanence; 21            (4) The child has lived with the relative, 22        certified relative caregiver, or foster parent for at 23        least one year; and 24            (5) The relative, certified relative caregiver, or 25        foster parent currently caring for the child is 26        willing and capable of providing the child with a   10400SB1504sam001- 89 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        stable and permanent environment. 2    (2.4) The court shall set a permanency goal that is in the 3best interest of the child. In determining that goal, the 4court shall consult with the minor in an age-appropriate 5manner regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan 6for the minor. The court's determination shall include the 7following factors:8        (A) Age of the child.9        (B) Options available for permanence, including both 10    out-of-state and in-state placement options.11        (C) Current placement of the child and the intent of 12    the family regarding subsidized guardianship and adoption.13        (D) Emotional, physical, and mental status or 14    condition of the child.15        (E) Types of services previously offered and whether 16    or not the services were successful and, if not 17    successful, the reasons the services failed.18        (F) Availability of services currently needed and 19    whether the services exist.20        (G) Status of siblings of the minor.21        (H) If the minor is not currently in a placement 22    likely to achieve permanency, whether there is an 23    identified and willing potential permanent caregiver for 24    the minor, and if so, that potential permanent caregiver's 25    intent regarding guardianship and adoption. 26    The court shall consider (i) the permanency goal contained   10400SB1504sam001- 90 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1in the service plan, (ii) the appropriateness of the services 2contained in the plan and whether those services have been 3provided, (iii) whether reasonable efforts have been made by 4all the parties to the service plan to achieve the goal, and 5(iv) whether the plan and goal have been achieved. All 6evidence relevant to determining these questions, including 7oral and written reports, may be admitted and may be relied on 8to the extent of their probative value.9    The court shall make findings as to whether, in violation 10of Section 8.2 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting 11Act, any portion of the service plan compels a child or parent 12to engage in any activity or refrain from any activity that is 13not reasonably related to remedying a condition or conditions 14that gave rise or which could give rise to any finding of child 15abuse or neglect. The services contained in the service plan 16shall include services reasonably related to remedy the 17conditions that gave rise to removal of the child from the home 18of the child's parents, guardian, or legal custodian or that 19the court has found must be remedied prior to returning the 20child home. Any tasks the court requires of the parents, 21guardian, or legal custodian or child prior to returning the 22child home must be reasonably related to remedying a condition 23or conditions that gave rise to or which could give rise to any 24finding of child abuse or neglect. 25    If the permanency goal is to return home, the court shall 26make findings that identify any problems that are causing   10400SB1504sam001- 91 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1continued placement of the children away from the home and 2identify what outcomes would be considered a resolution to 3these problems. The court shall explain to the parents that 4these findings are based on the information that the court has 5at that time and may be revised, should additional evidence be 6presented to the court. 7    The court shall review the Sibling Contact Support Plan 8developed or modified under subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of 9the Children and Family Services Act, if applicable. If the 10Department has not convened a meeting to develop or modify a 11Sibling Contact Support Plan, or if the court finds that the 12existing Plan is not in the child's best interest, the court 13may enter an order requiring the Department to develop, 14modify, or implement a Sibling Contact Support Plan, or order 15mediation. 16    The court shall review the Department's efforts to provide 17the minor with age and developmentally appropriate life 18skills. If the court finds the Department's efforts are not in 19the minor's best interest, the court may enter an order 20requiring the Department to develop, modify, or implement the 21service plan to develop the minor's life skills in an age and 22developmentally appropriate manner. 23    Beginning July 1, 2025, the court shall review the Ongoing 24Family Finding and Relative Engagement Plan required under 25Section 2-27.3. If the court finds that the plan is not in the 26minor's best interest, the court shall enter specific factual   10400SB1504sam001- 92 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1findings and order the Department to modify the plan 2consistent with the court's findings. 3    If the goal has been achieved, the court shall enter 4orders that are necessary to conform the minor's legal custody 5and status to those findings.6    If, after receiving evidence, the court determines that 7the services contained in the plan are not reasonably 8calculated to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, 9the court shall put in writing the factual basis supporting 10the determination and enter specific findings based on the 11evidence. The court also shall enter an order for the 12Department to develop and implement a new service plan or to 13implement changes to the current service plan consistent with 14the court's findings. The new service plan shall be filed with 15the court and served on all parties within 45 days of the date 16of the order. The court shall continue the matter until the new 17service plan is filed. Except as authorized by subsection 18(2.5) of this Section and as otherwise specifically authorized 19by law, the court is not empowered under this Section to order 20specific placements, specific services, or specific service 21providers to be included in the service plan.22    A guardian or custodian appointed by the court pursuant to 23this Act shall file updated case plans with the court every 6 24months.25    Rights of wards of the court under this Act are 26enforceable against any public agency by complaints for relief   10400SB1504sam001- 93 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1by mandamus filed in any proceedings brought under this Act.2    (2.5) If, after reviewing the evidence, including evidence 3from the Department, the court determines that the minor's 4current or planned placement is not necessary or appropriate 5to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court 6shall put in writing the factual basis supporting its 7determination and enter specific findings based on the 8evidence. If the court finds that the minor's current or 9planned placement is not necessary or appropriate, the court 10may enter an order directing the Department to implement a 11recommendation by the minor's treating clinician or a 12clinician contracted by the Department to evaluate the minor 13or a recommendation made by the Department. If the Department 14places a minor in a placement under an order entered under this 15subsection (2.5), the Department has the authority to remove 16the minor from that placement when a change in circumstances 17necessitates the removal to protect the minor's health, 18safety, and best interest. If the Department determines 19removal is necessary, the Department shall notify the parties 20of the planned placement change in writing no later than 10 21days prior to the implementation of its determination unless 22remaining in the placement poses an imminent risk of harm to 23the minor, in which case the Department shall notify the 24parties of the placement change in writing immediately 25following the implementation of its decision. The Department 26shall notify others of the decision to change the minor's   10400SB1504sam001- 94 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1placement as required by Department rule. 2    (3) Following the permanency hearing, the court shall 3enter a written order that includes the determinations 4required under subsections (2) and (2.3) of this Section and 5sets forth the following:6        (a) The future status of the minor, including the 7    permanency goal, and any order necessary to conform the 8    minor's legal custody and status to such determination; or9        (b) If the permanency goal of the minor cannot be 10    achieved immediately, the specific reasons for continuing 11    the minor in the care of the Department of Children and 12    Family Services or other agency for short-term placement, 13    and the following determinations:14            (i) (Blank).15            (ii) Whether the services required by the court 16        and by any service plan prepared within the prior 6 17        months have been provided and (A) if so, whether the 18        services were reasonably calculated to facilitate the 19        achievement of the permanency goal or (B) if not 20        provided, why the services were not provided.21            (iii) Whether the minor's current or planned 22        placement is necessary, and appropriate to the plan 23        and goal, recognizing the right of minors to the least 24        restrictive (most family-like) setting available and 25        in close proximity to the parents' home consistent 26        with the health, safety, best interest, and special   10400SB1504sam001- 95 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        needs of the minor and, if the minor is placed 2        out-of-state, whether the out-of-state placement 3        continues to be appropriate and consistent with the 4        health, safety, and best interest of the minor.5            (iv) (Blank).6            (v) (Blank).7    If the court sets a permanency goal of independence or if 8the minor is 17 years of age or older, the court shall schedule 9a Successful Transition to Adulthood Review hearing in 10accordance with Section 2-28.2. 11    (4) The minor or any person interested in the minor may 12apply to the court for a change in custody of the minor and the 13appointment of a new custodian or guardian of the person or for 14the restoration of the minor to the custody of the minor's 15parents or former guardian or custodian.16    When return home is not selected as the permanency goal:17        (a) The Department, the minor, or the current foster 18    parent or relative caregiver seeking private guardianship 19    may file a motion for private guardianship of the minor. 20    Appointment of a guardian under this Section requires 21    approval of the court.22        (b) The State's Attorney may file a motion to 23    terminate parental rights of any parent who has failed to 24    make reasonable efforts to correct the conditions which 25    led to the removal of the child or reasonable progress 26    toward the return of the child, as defined in subdivision   10400SB1504sam001- 96 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1    (D)(m) of Section 1 of the Adoption Act or for whom any 2    other unfitness ground for terminating parental rights as 3    defined in subdivision (D) of Section 1 of the Adoption 4    Act exists.5        When parental rights have been terminated for a 6    minimum of 3 years and the child who is the subject of the 7    permanency hearing is 13 years old or older and is not 8    currently placed in a placement likely to achieve 9    permanency, the Department of Children and Family Services 10    shall make reasonable efforts to locate parents whose 11    rights have been terminated, except when the Court 12    determines that those efforts would be futile or 13    inconsistent with the subject child's best interests. The 14    Department of Children and Family Services shall assess 15    the appropriateness of the parent whose rights have been 16    terminated, and shall, as appropriate, foster and support 17    connections between the parent whose rights have been 18    terminated and the youth. The Department of Children and 19    Family Services shall document its determinations and 20    efforts to foster connections in the child's case plan. 21    Custody of the minor shall not be restored to any parent, 22guardian, or legal custodian in any case in which the minor is 23found to be neglected or abused under Section 2-3 or dependent 24under Section 2-4 of this Act, unless the minor can be cared 25for at home without endangering the minor's health or safety 26and it is in the best interest of the minor, and if such   10400SB1504sam001- 97 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1neglect, abuse, or dependency is found by the court under 2paragraph (1) of Section 2-21 of this Act to have come about 3due to the acts or omissions or both of such parent, guardian, 4or legal custodian, until such time as an investigation is 5made as provided in paragraph (5) and a hearing is held on the 6issue of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor and 7the fitness of such parent, guardian, or legal custodian to 8care for the minor and the court enters an order that such 9parent, guardian, or legal custodian is fit to care for the 10minor. If a motion is filed to modify or vacate a private 11guardianship order and return the child to a parent, guardian, 12or legal custodian, the court may order the Department of 13Children and Family Services to assess the minor's current and 14proposed living arrangements and to provide ongoing monitoring 15of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor during 16the pendency of the motion to assist the court in making that 17determination. In the event that the minor has attained 18 18years of age and the guardian or custodian petitions the court 19for an order terminating the minor's guardianship or custody, 20guardianship or custody shall terminate automatically 30 days 21after the receipt of the petition unless the court orders 22otherwise. No legal custodian or guardian of the person may be 23removed without the legal custodian's or guardian's consent 24until given notice and an opportunity to be heard by the court.25    When the court orders a child restored to the custody of 26the parent or parents, the court shall order the parent or   10400SB1504sam001- 98 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1parents to cooperate with the Department of Children and 2Family Services and comply with the terms of an after-care 3plan, or risk the loss of custody of the child and possible 4termination of their parental rights. The court may also enter 5an order of protective supervision in accordance with Section 62-24.7    If the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, 8legal custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, 9and an Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the 10court may order the Department of Children and Family Services 11to arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 12arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 13and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 14protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 152-24. 16    (5) Whenever a parent, guardian, or legal custodian files 17a motion for restoration of custody of the minor, and the minor 18was adjudicated neglected, abused, or dependent as a result of 19physical abuse, the court shall cause to be made an 20investigation as to whether the movant has ever been charged 21with or convicted of any criminal offense which would indicate 22the likelihood of any further physical abuse to the minor. 23Evidence of such criminal convictions shall be taken into 24account in determining whether the minor can be cared for at 25home without endangering the minor's health or safety and 26fitness of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian.  10400SB1504sam001- 99 -LRB104 09130 KTG 23265 a1        (a) Any agency of this State or any subdivision 2    thereof shall cooperate with the agent of the court in 3    providing any information sought in the investigation.4        (b) The information derived from the investigation and 5    any conclusions or recommendations derived from the 6    information shall be provided to the parent, guardian, or 7    legal custodian seeking restoration of custody prior to 8    the hearing on fitness and the movant shall have an 9    opportunity at the hearing to refute the information or 10    contest its significance.11        (c) All information obtained from any investigation 12    shall be confidential as provided in Section 5-150 of this 13    Act.14(Source: P.A. 102-193, eff. 7-30-21; 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 15102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-154, eff. 166-30-23; 103-171, eff. 1-1-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24; 103-1061, 17eff. 2-5-25.) 18    (705 ILCS 405/2-28.2 new)19    Sec. 2-28.2.
