Powers and duties of State Commission. 7    (a) The State Commission shall have the following powers, 8functions, and duties: 9        (1) To receive applications, to register third-party 10    providers, and to issue licenses to manufacturers, foreign 11    importers, importing distributors, distributors, 12    non-resident dealers, on premise consumption retailers, 13    off premise sale retailers, special event retailer 14    licensees, special use permit licenses, auction liquor 15    licenses, brew pubs, caterer retailers, non-beverage 16    users, railroads, including owners and lessees of 17    sleeping, dining and cafe cars, airplanes, boats, brokers, 18    and wine maker's premises licensees in accordance with the 19    provisions of this Act, and to suspend or revoke such 20    licenses and registrations upon the State Commission's 21    determination, upon notice after hearing, that a licensee 22    or registrant has violated any provision of this Act or 23    any rule or regulation issued pursuant thereto and in 24    effect for 30 days prior to such violation. Except in the 25    case of an action taken pursuant to a violation of Section   HB1078- 22 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    6-3, 6-5, or 6-9, any action by the State Commission to 2    suspend or revoke a licensee's license or a registrant's 3    registration may be limited to the license or registration 4    for the specific premises where the violation occurred. An 5    action for a violation of this Act shall be commenced by 6    the State Commission within 2 years after the date the 7    State Commission becomes aware of the violation. 8        In lieu of suspending or revoking a license or 9    registration, the commission may impose a fine, upon the 10    State Commission's determination and notice after hearing, 11    that a licensee or registrant has violated any provision 12    of this Act or any rule or regulation issued pursuant 13    thereto and in effect for 30 days prior to such violation.14        For the purpose of this paragraph (1), when 15    determining multiple violations for the sale of alcohol to 16    a person under the age of 21, a second or subsequent 17    violation for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age 18    of 21 shall only be considered if it was committed within 5 19    years after the date when a prior violation for the sale of 20    alcohol to a person under the age of 21 was committed. 21        The fine imposed under this paragraph may not exceed 22    $500 for each violation. Each day that the activity, which 23    gave rise to the original fine, continues is a separate 24    violation. The maximum fine that may be levied against any 25    licensee or registrant, for the period of the license or 26    registration, shall not exceed $20,000. The maximum   HB1078- 23 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    penalty that may be imposed on a licensee for selling a 2    bottle of alcoholic liquor with a foreign object in it or 3    serving from a bottle of alcoholic liquor with a foreign 4    object in it shall be the destruction of that bottle of 5    alcoholic liquor for the first 10 bottles so sold or 6    served from by the licensee. For the eleventh bottle of 7    alcoholic liquor and for each third bottle thereafter sold 8    or served from by the licensee with a foreign object in it, 9    the maximum penalty that may be imposed on the licensee is 10    the destruction of the bottle of alcoholic liquor and a 11    fine of up to $50. 12        Any notice issued by the State Commission to a 13    licensee or registrant for a violation of this Act or any 14    notice with respect to settlement or offer in compromise 15    shall include the field report, photographs, and any other 16    supporting documentation necessary to reasonably inform 17    the licensee of the nature and extent of the violation or 18    the conduct alleged to have occurred. The failure to 19    include such required documentation shall result in the 20    dismissal of the action.21        (2) To adopt such rules and regulations consistent 22    with the provisions of this Act which shall be necessary 23    to carry on its functions and duties to the end that the 24    health, safety and welfare of the People of the State of 25    Illinois shall be protected and temperance in the 26    consumption of alcoholic liquors shall be fostered and   HB1078- 24 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    promoted and to distribute copies of such rules and 2    regulations to all licensees affected thereby. 3        (3) To call upon other administrative departments of 4    the State, county and municipal governments, county and 5    city police departments and upon prosecuting officers for 6    such information and assistance as it deems necessary in 7    the performance of its duties. 8        (4) To recommend to local commissioners rules and 9    regulations, not inconsistent with the law, for the 10    distribution and sale of alcoholic liquors throughout the 11    State. 12        (5) To inspect, or cause to be inspected, any premises 13    in this State where alcoholic liquors are manufactured, 14    distributed, warehoused, or sold.

"Private 18    areas" include, but are not limited to, safes, personal 19    property, and closed desks. 20        (5.1) Upon receipt of a complaint or upon having 21    knowledge that any person is engaged in business as a 22    manufacturer, importing distributor, distributor, or 23    retailer without a license or valid license or as a 24    third-party provider without registering with the State 25    Commission, to conduct an investigation. If, after 26    conducting an investigation, the State Commission is   HB1078- 25 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    satisfied that the alleged conduct occurred or is 2    occurring, it may issue a cease and desist notice as 3    provided in this Act, impose civil penalties as provided 4    in this Act, notify the local liquor authority, or file a 5    complaint with the State's Attorney's Office of the county 6    where the incident occurred or the Attorney General. 7        (5.2) Upon receipt of a complaint or upon having 8    knowledge that any person is shipping alcoholic liquor 9    into this State from a point outside of this State if the 10    shipment is in violation of this Act, to conduct an 11    investigation.

Such complaints shall be in writing, signed and sworn 25    to by the person making the complaint, and shall state 26    with specificity the facts in relation to the alleged   HB1078- 26 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    violation. If the State Commission has reasonable grounds 2    to believe that the complaint substantially alleges a 3    violation of this Act or rules and regulations adopted 4    pursuant to this Act, it shall conduct an investigation. 5    If, after conducting an investigation, the State 6    Commission is satisfied that the alleged violation did 7    occur, it shall proceed with disciplinary action against 8    the licensee or registrant as provided in this Act. 9        (5.4) To make arrests and issue notices of civil 10    violations where necessary for the enforcement of this 11    Act. 12        (5.5) To investigate any and all unlicensed or 13    unregistered activity. 14        (5.6) To impose civil penalties or fines to any person 15    who, without holding a valid license or registration, 16    engages in conduct that requires a license or registration 17    pursuant to this Act, in an amount not to exceed $20,000 18    for each offense as determined by the State Commission. A 19    civil penalty shall be assessed by the State Commission 20    after a hearing is held in accordance with the provisions 21    set forth in this Act regarding the provision of a hearing 22    for the revocation or suspension of a license or 23    registration. 24        (6) To hear and determine appeals from orders of a 25    local commission in accordance with the provisions of this 26    Act, as hereinafter set forth. Hearings under this   HB1078- 27 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    subsection shall be held in Springfield or Chicago, at 2    whichever location is the more convenient for the majority 3    of persons who are parties to the hearing. 4        (7) The State Commission shall establish uniform 5    systems of accounts to be kept by all retail licensees 6    having more than 4 employees, and for this purpose the 7    State Commission may classify all retail licensees having 8    more than 4 employees and establish a uniform system of 9    accounts for each class and prescribe the manner in which 10    such accounts shall be kept. The State Commission may also 11    prescribe the forms of accounts to be kept by all retail 12    licensees having more than 4 employees, including, but not 13    limited to, accounts of earnings and expenses and any 14    distribution, payment, or other distribution of earnings 15    or assets, and any other forms, records, and memoranda 16    which in the judgment of the commission may be necessary 17    or appropriate to carry out any of the provisions of this 18    Act, including, but not limited to, such forms, records, 19    and memoranda as will readily and accurately disclose at 20    all times the beneficial ownership of such retail licensed 21    business. The accounts, forms, records, and memoranda 22    shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection 23    by authorized representatives of the State Commission or 24    by any local liquor control commissioner or his or her 25    authorized representative. The commission may, from time 26    to time, alter, amend, or repeal, in whole or in part, any   HB1078- 28 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    uniform system of accounts, or the form and manner of 2    keeping accounts. 3        (8) In the conduct of any hearing authorized to be 4    held by the State Commission, to appoint, at the 5    commission's discretion, hearing officers to conduct 6    hearings involving complex issues or issues that will 7    require a protracted period of time to resolve, to 8    examine, or cause to be examined, under oath, any licensee 9    or registrant, and to examine or cause to be examined the 10    books and records of such licensee or registrant; to hear 11    testimony and take proof material for its information in 12    the discharge of its duties hereunder; to administer or 13    cause to be administered oaths; for any such purpose to 14    issue subpoena or subpoenas to require the attendance of 15    witnesses and the production of books, which shall be 16    effective in any part of this State, and to adopt rules to 17    implement its powers under this paragraph (8). 18        Any circuit court may, by order duly entered, require 19    the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant 20    books subpoenaed by the State Commission and the court may 21    compel obedience to its order by proceedings for contempt. 22        (9) To investigate the administration of laws in 23    relation to alcoholic liquors in this and other states and 24    any foreign countries, and to recommend from time to time 25    to the Governor and through him or her to the legislature 26    of this State, such amendments to this Act, if any, as it   HB1078- 29 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    may think desirable and as will serve to further the 2    general broad purposes contained in Section 1-2 hereof. 3        (10) To adopt such rules and regulations consistent 4    with the provisions of this Act which shall be necessary 5    for the control, sale, or disposition of alcoholic liquor 6    damaged as a result of an accident, wreck, flood, fire, or 7    other similar occurrence. 8        (11) To develop industry educational programs related 9    to responsible serving and selling, particularly in the 10    areas of overserving consumers and illegal underage 11    purchasing and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 12        (11.1) To license persons providing education and 13    training to alcohol beverage sellers and servers for 14    mandatory and non-mandatory training under the Beverage 15    Alcohol Sellers and Servers Education and Training 16    (BASSET) programs and to develop and administer a public 17    awareness program in Illinois to reduce or eliminate the 18    illegal purchase and consumption of alcoholic beverage 19    products by persons under the age of 21.

As part of its report, the State 6    Commission shall provide all of the following information:7            (A) The amount of State excise and sales tax 8        revenues generated.9            (B) The amount of licensing fees received.10            (C) The number of cases of wine shipped from 11        inside and outside of this State directly to residents 12        of this State.13            (D) The number of alcohol compliance operations 14        conducted.15            (E) The number of winery shipper's licenses 16        issued.17            (F) The number of each of the following: reported 18        violations; cease and desist notices issued by the 19        Commission; notices of violations issued by the 20        Commission and to the Department of Revenue; and 21        notices and complaints of violations to law 22        enforcement officials, including, without limitation, 23        the Illinois Attorney General and the U.S. Department 24        of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade 25        Bureau.26        (15) As a means to reduce the underage consumption of   HB1078- 31 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    alcoholic liquors, the State Commission shall conduct 2    alcohol compliance operations to investigate whether 3    businesses that are soliciting, selling, and shipping wine 4    from inside or outside of this State directly to residents 5    of this State are licensed by this State or are selling or 6    attempting to sell wine to persons under 21 years of age in 7    violation of this Act.8        (16) The State Commission shall, in addition to 9    notifying any appropriate law enforcement agency, submit 10    notices of complaints or violations of Sections 6-29 and 11    6-29.1 by persons who do not hold a winery shipper's 12    license under this Act to the Illinois Attorney General 13    and to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Alcohol and 14    Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.15        (17)(A) A person licensed to make wine under the laws 16    of another state who has a winery shipper's license under 17    this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of 18    wine or a person who has a first-class or second-class 19    wine manufacturer's license, a first-class or second-class 20    wine-maker's license, or a limited wine manufacturer's 21    license under this Act and annually produces less than 22    25,000 gallons of wine may make application to the 23    Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the 24    sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the exemption 25    holder's wine to retail licensees per year and to sell 26    cider, mead, or both cider and mead to brewers, class 1   HB1078- 32 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    brewers, class 2 brewers, and class 3 brewers that, 2    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 3    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 4    non-licensees at their breweries.5        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 6    penalty of perjury, such person shall state (1) the date 7    it was established; (2) its volume of production and sales 8    for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to 9    establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 10    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 11    marketing of its wine; and (5) that it will comply with the 12    liquor and revenue laws of the United States, this State, 13    and any other state where it is licensed.14        (C) The State Commission shall approve the application 15    for a self-distribution exemption if such person: (1) is 16    in compliance with State revenue and liquor laws; (2) is 17    not a member of any affiliated group that produces 18    directly or indirectly more than 25,000 gallons of wine 19    per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 50,000 20    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) will not annually 21    produce for sale more than 25,000 gallons of wine, 930,000 22    gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; and (4) 23    will not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its wine 24    to retail licensees.25        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 26    annually certify to the State Commission its production of   HB1078- 33 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    wine in the previous 12 months and its anticipated 2    production and sales for the next 12 months. The State 3    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 4    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 5    that the exemption holder has made a material 6    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 7    or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000 8    gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 9    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 10    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 11    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 12    spirits.13        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 14    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 15    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 16    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 17    production and sales information of a self-distribution 18    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 19    such information to any person.20        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 21    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 22    this Section and this Act.23        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 24    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 25    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 26    licensed Illinois distributor.  HB1078- 34 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 2    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 3    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 4    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 5    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 6    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 7    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small 8    for distributor or importing distributor business 9    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 10    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 11    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 12    integrity of the 3-tier system. 13        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be 14    either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer 15    and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of 16    beer, may make application to the State Commission for a 17    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 18    than 232,500 gallons per year of the exemption holder's 19    beer to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, 20    and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of 21    Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or any 22    combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries.23        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 24    penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall 25    state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of 26    beer manufactured and sold for each year since its   HB1078- 35 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor 2    relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 3    necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) 4    that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and 5    revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any 6    other state where it is licensed.7        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 8    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 9    action by the State Commission.

Except in the 25    case of an action taken pursuant to a violation of Section   HB1078- 22 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    6-3, 6-5, or 6-9, any action by the State Commission to 2    suspend or revoke a licensee's license or a registrant's 3    registration may be limited to the license or registration 4    for the specific premises where the violation occurred. An 5    action for a violation of this Act shall be commenced by 6    the State Commission within 2 years after the date the 7    State Commission becomes aware of the violation. 8        In lieu of suspending or revoking a license or 9    registration, the commission may impose a fine, upon the 10    State Commission's determination and notice after hearing, 11    that a licensee or registrant has violated any provision 12    of this Act or any rule or regulation issued pursuant 13    thereto and in effect for 30 days prior to such violation.14        For the purpose of this paragraph (1), when 15    determining multiple violations for the sale of alcohol to 16    a person under the age of 21, a second or subsequent 17    violation for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age 18    of 21 shall only be considered if it was committed within 5 19    years after the date when a prior violation for the sale of 20    alcohol to a person under the age of 21 was committed. 21        The fine imposed under this paragraph may not exceed 22    $500 for each violation. Each day that the activity, which 23    gave rise to the original fine, continues is a separate 24    violation. The maximum fine that may be levied against any 25    licensee or registrant, for the period of the license or 26    registration, shall not exceed $20,000.

As part of its report, the State 6    Commission shall provide all of the following information:7            (A) The amount of State excise and sales tax 8        revenues generated.9            (B) The amount of licensing fees received.10            (C) The number of cases of wine shipped from 11        inside and outside of this State directly to residents 12        of this State.13            (D) The number of alcohol compliance operations 14        conducted.15            (E) The number of winery shipper's licenses 16        issued.17            (F) The number of each of the following: reported 18        violations; cease and desist notices issued by the 19        Commission; notices of violations issued by the 20        Commission and to the Department of Revenue; and 21        notices and complaints of violations to law 22        enforcement officials, including, without limitation, 23        the Illinois Attorney General and the U.S. Department 24        of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade 25        Bureau.26        (15) As a means to reduce the underage consumption of   HB1078- 31 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    alcoholic liquors, the State Commission shall conduct 2    alcohol compliance operations to investigate whether 3    businesses that are soliciting, selling, and shipping wine 4    from inside or outside of this State directly to residents 5    of this State are licensed by this State or are selling or 6    attempting to sell wine to persons under 21 years of age in 7    violation of this Act.8        (16) The State Commission shall, in addition to 9    notifying any appropriate law enforcement agency, submit 10    notices of complaints or violations of Sections 6-29 and 11    6-29.1 by persons who do not hold a winery shipper's 12    license under this Act to the Illinois Attorney General 13    and to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Alcohol and 14    Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.15        (17)(A) A person licensed to make wine under the laws 16    of another state who has a winery shipper's license under 17    this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of 18    wine or a person who has a first-class or second-class 19    wine manufacturer's license, a first-class or second-class 20    wine-maker's license, or a limited wine manufacturer's 21    license under this Act and annually produces less than 22    25,000 gallons of wine may make application to the 23    Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the 24    sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the exemption 25    holder's wine to retail licensees per year and to sell 26    cider, mead, or both cider and mead to brewers, class 1   HB1078- 32 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    brewers, class 2 brewers, and class 3 brewers that, 2    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 3    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 4    non-licensees at their breweries.5        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 6    penalty of perjury, such person shall state (1) the date 7    it was established; (2) its volume of production and sales 8    for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to 9    establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 10    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 11    marketing of its wine; and (5) that it will comply with the 12    liquor and revenue laws of the United States, this State, 13    and any other state where it is licensed.14        (C) The State Commission shall approve the application 15    for a self-distribution exemption if such person: (1) is 16    in compliance with State revenue and liquor laws; (2) is 17    not a member of any affiliated group that produces 18    directly or indirectly more than 25,000 gallons of wine 19    per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 50,000 20    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) will not annually 21    produce for sale more than 25,000 gallons of wine, 930,000 22    gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; and (4) 23    will not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its wine 24    to retail licensees.25        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 26    annually certify to the State Commission its production of   HB1078- 33 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    wine in the previous 12 months and its anticipated 2    production and sales for the next 12 months. The State 3    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 4    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 5    that the exemption holder has made a material 6    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 7    or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000 8    gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 9    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 10    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 11    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 12    spirits.13        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 14    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 15    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 16    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 17    production and sales information of a self-distribution 18    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 19    such information to any person.20        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 21    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 22    this Section and this Act.23        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 24    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 25    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 26    licensed Illinois distributor.  HB1078- 34 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 2    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 3    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 4    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 5    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 6    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 7    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small 8    for distributor or importing distributor business 9    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 10    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 11    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 12    integrity of the 3-tier system. 13        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be 14    either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer 15    and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of 16    beer, may make application to the State Commission for a 17    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 18    than 232,500 gallons per year of the exemption holder's 19    beer to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, 20    and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of 21    Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or any 22    combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries.23        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 24    penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall 25    state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of 26    beer manufactured and sold for each year since its   HB1078- 35 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor 2    relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 3    necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) 4    that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and 5    revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any 6    other state where it is licensed.7        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 8    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 9    action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 10    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 11    if the class 1 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with 12    the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is 13    not a member of any affiliated group that manufactures, 14    directly or indirectly, more than 930,000 gallons of beer 15    per annum, 25,000 gallons of wine per annum, or 50,000 16    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) shall not annually 17    manufacture for sale more than 930,000 gallons of beer, 18    25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; (4) 19    shall not annually sell more than 232,500 gallons of its 20    beer to retail licensees and class 3 brewers and to 21    brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, 22    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 23    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 24    non-licensees at their breweries; and (5) has relinquished 25    any brew pub license held by the licensee, including any 26    ownership interest it held in the licensed brew pub.  HB1078- 36 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 2    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 3    of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated 4    manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months. The 5    State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 6    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 7    that the exemption holder has made a material 8    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 9    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 10    manufacture of 930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of 11    wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits in any calendar year or 12    became part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than 13    930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 14    gallons of spirits.15        (E) The State Commission shall issue rules and 16    regulations governing self-distribution exemptions 17    consistent with this Act.18        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (18) shall prohibit a 19    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 20    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 21    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 22    If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a 23    distribution agreement and has assigned distribution 24    rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then 25    the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution 26    rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a   HB1078- 37 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.2        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (18) to promote 3    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 4    that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 5    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 6    exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and 7    allow such smaller manufacturers of beer access to the 8    marketplace in order to develop a customer base without 9    impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system. 10        (19)(A) A class 1 craft distiller licensee or a 11    non-resident dealer who manufactures less than 50,000 12    gallons of distilled spirits per year may make application 13    to the State Commission for a self-distribution exemption 14    to allow the sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the 15    exemption holder's spirits to retail licensees per year. 16        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 17    penalty of perjury, the class 1 craft distiller licensee 18    or non-resident dealer shall state (1) the date it was 19    established; (2) its volume of spirits manufactured and 20    sold for each year since its establishment; (3) its 21    efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 22    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 23    marketing of its spirits; and (5) that it will comply with 24    the alcoholic beverage and revenue laws of the United 25    States, this State, and any other state where it is 26    licensed.   HB1078- 38 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 2    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 3    action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 4    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 5    if the applicant: (1) is in compliance with State revenue 6    and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is not a member of any 7    affiliated group that produces more than 50,000 gallons of 8    spirits per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 9    25,000 gallons of wine per annum; (3) does not annually 10    manufacture for sale more than 50,000 gallons of spirits, 11    930,000 gallons of beer, or 25,000 gallons of wine; and 12    (4) does not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its 13    spirits to retail licensees. 14        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 15    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 16    of spirits during the previous 12 months and its 17    anticipated manufacture and sales of spirits for the next 18    12 months. The State Commission may fine, suspend, or 19    revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it 20    finds that the exemption holder has made a material 21    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 22    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 23    manufacture of 50,000 gallons of spirits, 930,000 gallons 24    of beer, or 25,000 gallons of wine in any calendar year, or 25    has become part of an affiliated group manufacturing more 26    than 50,000 gallons of spirits, 930,000 gallons of beer,   HB1078- 39 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    or 25,000 gallons of wine. 2        (E) The State Commission shall adopt rules governing 3    self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act. 4        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (19) shall prohibit a 5    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 6    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 7    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 8        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (19) to promote 9    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 10    that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 11    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 12    exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and 13    allow such smaller manufacturers of spirits access to the 14    marketplace in order to develop a customer base without 15    impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system. 16        (20)(A) A class 3 brewer licensee who must manufacture 17    less than 465,000 gallons of beer in the aggregate and not 18    more than 155,000 gallons at any single brewery premises 19    may make application to the State Commission for a 20    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 21    than 6,200 gallons of beer from each in-state or 22    out-of-state class 3 brewery premises, which shall not 23    exceed 18,600 gallons annually in the aggregate, that is 24    manufactured at a wholly owned class 3 brewer's in-state 25    or out-of-state licensed premises to retail licensees and 26    class 3 brewers and to brewers, class 1 brewers, class 2   HB1078- 40 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4, 2    sell beer, cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees 3    at their licensed breweries.4        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 5    penalty of perjury, the class 3 brewer licensee shall 6    state:7            (1) the date it was established;8            (2) its volume of beer manufactured and sold for 9        each year since its establishment;10            (3) its efforts to establish distributor 11        relationships;12            (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 13        necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and14            (5) that it will comply with the alcoholic 15        beverage and revenue laws of the United States, this 16        State, and any other state where it is licensed.17        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 18    State Commission's website at least 45 days before action 19    by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 20    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 21    if the class 3 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with 22    the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is 23    not a member of any affiliated group that manufacturers, 24    directly or indirectly, more than 465,000 gallons of beer 25    per annum; (3) shall not annually manufacture for sale 26    more than 465,000 gallons of beer or more than 155,000   HB1078- 41 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1    gallons at any single brewery premises; and (4) shall not 2    annually sell more than 6,200 gallons of beer from each 3    in-state or out-of-state class 3 brewery premises, and 4    shall not exceed 18,600 gallons annually in the aggregate, 5    to retail licensees and class 3 brewers and to brewers, 6    class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to 7    subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, 8    cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees at their 9    breweries.10        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 11    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 12    of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated 13    manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months. The 14    State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 15    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 16    that the exemption holder has made a material 17    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 18    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 19    manufacture of 465,000 gallons of beer in any calendar 20    year or became part of an affiliated group manufacturing 21    more than 465,000 gallons of beer, or exceeded the sale to 22    retail licensees, brewers, class 1 brewers, class 2 23    brewers, and class 3 brewers of 6,200 gallons per brewery 24    location or 18,600 gallons in the aggregate.25        (E) The State Commission may adopt rules governing 26    self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act.  HB1078- 42 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1        (F) Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit a 2    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 3    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 4    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 5    If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a 6    distribution agreement and has assigned distribution 7    rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then 8    the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution 9    rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a 10    reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.11        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph to promote and 12    continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds that 13    in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory distribution 14    system, it is necessary to create an exception for smaller 15    manufacturers in order to afford and allow such smaller 16    manufacturers of beer access to the marketplace in order 17    to develop a customer base without impairing the integrity 18    of the 3-tier system. 19    (b) On or before April 30, 1999, the Commission shall 20present a written report to the Governor and the General 21Assembly that shall be based on a study of the impact of Public 22Act 90-739 on the business of soliciting, selling, and 23shipping alcoholic liquor from outside of this State directly 24to residents of this State. 25    As part of its report, the Commission shall provide the 26following information:   HB1078- 43 -LRB104 03134 RPS 13155 b1        (i) the amount of State excise and sales tax revenues 2    generated as a result of Public Act 90-739; 3        (ii) the amount of licensing fees received as a result 4    of Public Act 90-739; 5        (iii) the number of reported violations, the number of 6    cease and desist notices issued by the Commission, the 7    number of notices of violations issued to the Department 8    of Revenue, and the number of notices and complaints of 9    violations to law enforcement officials. 10(Source: P.A. 101-37, eff. 7-3-19; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 11101-482, eff. 8-23-19; 102-442, eff. 8-20-21; 102-558, eff. 128-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.) 13    (235 ILCS 5/5-1)  (from Ch. 43, par. 115)14    Sec. 5-1.
