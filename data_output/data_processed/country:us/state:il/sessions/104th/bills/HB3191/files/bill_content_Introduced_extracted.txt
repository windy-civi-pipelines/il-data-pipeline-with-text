Short title. This Act may be cited as the Youth 5Protection and Nicotine Accountability Act. 6    Section 5. Findings and purpose.7    (a) The General Assembly finds that:8        (1) In 2024, Elf Bar was the most commonly reported 9    brand among youth e-cigarette users, with 36.1% of middle 10    and high school students using the brand.11        (2) More than 8 in 10 youth e-cigarette users report 12    using flavored products, with fruit, candy, and menthol 13    being the most popular.14        (3) Over half (54.6%) of students using e-cigarettes 15    prefer products labeled with "ice" or "iced" flavors.16        (4) Disposables represent the most-used device type, 17    accounting for 55.6% of youth usage.18        (5) 38.4% of youth e-cigarette users report frequent 19    use, with 26.3% using daily.20        (6) Poison control centers reported over 7,000 21    vaping-related exposures from April 2022 to March 2023, 22    with nearly 90% involving children under 5 years of age.23        (7) Numerous studies have shown that higher taxation   HB3191- 2 -LRB104 08849 BDA 18904 b1    on nicotine products, including e-cigarettes, reduces 2    consumption, especially among youth. By taxing 3    nicotine-containing products at an equivalent rate, 4    Illinois will close the tax disparity, making e-cigarettes 5    equally less affordable to both youth and adults, thus 6    decreasing nicotine exposure and discouraging youth 7    uptake.8        (8) The use of nicotine products, particularly among 9    youth, has led to significant public health concerns, 10    including increased hospitalizations, poison control 11    center reports, and adverse health events.12    (b) Therefore, the purposes of this Act are as follows:13        (1) This Act aims to mitigate the rising prevalence of 14    youth e-cigarette use by addressing flavored nicotine 15    products, increasing taxation parity, enforcing marketing 16    and access restrictions, and investing in public health 17    programs.18        (2) This Act aims to ensure equal taxation on all 19    nicotine-containing products in Illinois. By taxing 20    electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) at a rate equivalent 21    to that of traditional combustible cigarettes, this 22    legislation will eliminate existing discrepancies between 23    e-cigarette taxes and traditional cigarette taxes. The 24    goal is to increase the tax rate on e-cigarettes, 25    discouraging youth consumption and reducing affordability.26        (3) This Act aims to establish a centralized system   HB3191- 3 -LRB104 08849 BDA 18904 b1    that will collect, track, and analyze data on nicotine 2    exposure to enhance public health responses and inform 3    policy-making. 4    Section 10.
