The Code of Civil Procedure is amended by 21changing Section 2-702 as follows: 22    (735 ILCS 5/2-702)23    Sec. 2-702. Petition for a certificate of innocence that 24the petitioner was innocent of all offenses for which he or she   HB3818- 8 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1was incarcerated.2    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that innocent 3persons who have been wrongly convicted of crimes in Illinois 4and subsequently imprisoned have been frustrated in seeking 5legal redress due to a variety of substantive and technical 6obstacles in the law and that such persons should have an 7available avenue to obtain a finding of innocence so that they 8may obtain relief through a petition in the Court of Claims. 9The General Assembly further finds misleading the current 10legal nomenclature which compels an innocent person to seek a 11pardon for being wrongfully incarcerated. It is the intent of 12the General Assembly that the court, in exercising its 13discretion as permitted by law regarding the weight and 14admissibility of evidence submitted pursuant to this Section, 15shall, in the interest of justice, give due consideration to 16difficulties of proof caused by the passage of time, the death 17or unavailability of witnesses, the destruction of evidence or 18other factors not caused by such persons or those acting on 19their behalf.20    (b) Any person who is convicted or adjudicated a 21delinquent and subsequently serves any part of a sentence of 22incarceration in a State correctional institution or in a 23county jail, of parole, of intensive supervision probation, or 24of registration as a sex offender imprisoned for one or more 25felonies by the State of Illinois which he or she did not 26commit may, under the conditions hereinafter provided, file a   HB3818- 9 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1petition for certificate of innocence in the circuit court of 2the county in which the person was convicted or adjudicated a 3delinquent. The petition shall request a certificate of 4innocence finding that the petitioner was innocent of one or 5more all offenses for which he or she was convicted 6incarcerated.7    (c) In order to present the claim for certificate of 8innocence of an unjust conviction or juvenile delinquency 9adjudication and imprisonment, the petitioner must attach to 10his or her petition documentation demonstrating that:11        (1) he or she has been convicted or adjudicated a 12    delinquent of one or more felonies by the State of 13    Illinois and subsequently sentenced to a term of 14    imprisonment, and has served all or any part of the 15    sentence; and16        (2) his or her judgment of conviction or delinquency 17    adjudication was reversed or vacated, and the indictment, 18    or information, or petition dismissed or, if a new trial 19    was ordered, either he or she was found not guilty at the 20    new trial or he or she was not retried and the indictment, 21    or information, or petition dismissed; or the statute, or 22    application thereof, on which the indictment or 23    information was based violated the Constitution of the 24    United States or the State of Illinois; and25        (3) his or her claim is not time barred by the 26    provisions of subsection (i) of this Section.  HB3818- 10 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1    (d) The petition shall state facts in sufficient detail to 2permit the court to find that the petitioner is likely to 3succeed at trial in proving that the petitioner is innocent of 4the alleged offenses for which he or she was convicted or 5adjudicated a delinquent charged in the indictment or 6information or his or her acts or omissions charged in the 7indictment or information did not constitute a felony or 8misdemeanor against the State of Illinois, and the petitioner 9did not by his or her own conduct voluntarily cause or bring 10about his or her conviction or juvenile delinquency 11adjudication. Neither a guilty plea nor a confession 12constitutes conduct causing or bringing about one's conviction 13or delinquency adjudication. The petition shall be verified by 14the petitioner.15    (e) A copy of the petition shall be served on the Attorney 16General and the State's Attorney of the county where the 17conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication was had. The 18Attorney General and the State's Attorney of the county where 19the conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication was had 20shall have the right to intervene as parties.21    (f) In any hearing seeking a certificate of innocence, the 22court may take judicial notice of prior sworn testimony or 23evidence admitted in the criminal or juvenile delinquency 24proceedings related to the convictions or adjudications which 25resulted in the alleged wrongful incarceration, if the 26petitioner was either represented by counsel at such prior   HB3818- 11 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1proceedings or the right to counsel was knowingly waived.2    (g) In order to obtain a certificate of innocence the 3petitioner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:4        (1) the petitioner was convicted or adjudicated a 5    delinquent of one or more felonies by the State of 6    Illinois and subsequently sentenced to a term of 7    imprisonment, and has served all or any part of the 8    sentence;9        (2)(A) the judgment of conviction or adjudication was 10    reversed or vacated, and the indictment, or information, 11    or petition dismissed or, if a new trial was ordered, 12    either the petitioner was found not guilty at the new 13    trial or the petitioner was not retried and the 14    indictment, or information, or petition dismissed; or (B) 15    the statute, or application thereof, on which the 16    indictment, or information, or petition was based violated 17    the Constitution of the United States or the State of 18    Illinois;19        (3) the petitioner is innocent of one or more of the 20    offenses for which he or she was convicted or adjudicated 21    a delinquent charged in the indictment or information or 22    his or her acts or omissions charged in the indictment or 23    information did not constitute a felony or misdemeanor 24    against the State; and25        (4) the petitioner did not by his or her own conduct 26    voluntarily cause or bring about his or her conviction or   HB3818- 12 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1    juvenile delinquency adjudication. Neither a guilty plea 2    nor a confession constitutes conduct causing or bringing 3    about one's conviction or delinquency adjudication.4    (h) If the court finds that the petitioner is entitled to a 5judgment, it shall enter a certificate of innocence finding 6that the petitioner was innocent of one or more all offenses 7for which he or she was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent. 8The court shall also make a determination, subject to proof by 9the claimant, of the reasonable attorney's fees, costs, and 10expenses incurred by the claimant in connection with obtaining 11the certificate of innocence under this Section incarcerated. 12Upon entry of the certificate of innocence or pardon from the 13Governor stating that such pardon was issued on the ground of 14innocence of the crime for which he or she was convicted or 15adjudicated a delinquent imprisoned, (1) the clerk of the 16court shall transmit a copy of the certificate of innocence to 17the clerk of the Court of Claims, together with the claimant's 18current address; and (2) the court shall enter an order 19expunging the record of arrest from the official records of 20the arresting authority and order that the records of the 21clerk of the circuit court and the Illinois State Police be 22sealed until further order of the court upon good cause shown 23or as otherwise provided herein, and the name of the defendant 24or respondent in a juvenile delinquency proceeding obliterated 25from the official index requested to be kept by the circuit 26court clerk under Section 16 of the Clerks of Courts Act in   HB3818- 13 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1connection with the arrest and conviction or delinquency 2adjudication for the offense but the order shall not affect 3any index issued by the circuit court clerk before the entry of 4the order.

The Code of Civil Procedure is amended by 21changing Section 2-702 as follows: 22    (735 ILCS 5/2-702)23    Sec. 2-702. Petition for a certificate of innocence that 24the petitioner was innocent of all offenses for which he or she   HB3818- 8 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1was incarcerated.2    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that innocent 3persons who have been wrongly convicted of crimes in Illinois 4and subsequently imprisoned have been frustrated in seeking 5legal redress due to a variety of substantive and technical 6obstacles in the law and that such persons should have an 7available avenue to obtain a finding of innocence so that they 8may obtain relief through a petition in the Court of Claims. 9The General Assembly further finds misleading the current 10legal nomenclature which compels an innocent person to seek a 11pardon for being wrongfully incarcerated. It is the intent of 12the General Assembly that the court, in exercising its 13discretion as permitted by law regarding the weight and 14admissibility of evidence submitted pursuant to this Section, 15shall, in the interest of justice, give due consideration to 16difficulties of proof caused by the passage of time, the death 17or unavailability of witnesses, the destruction of evidence or 18other factors not caused by such persons or those acting on 19their behalf.20    (b) Any person who is convicted or adjudicated a 21delinquent and subsequently serves any part of a sentence of 22incarceration in a State correctional institution or in a 23county jail, of parole, of intensive supervision probation, or 24of registration as a sex offender imprisoned for one or more 25felonies by the State of Illinois which he or she did not 26commit may, under the conditions hereinafter provided, file a   HB3818- 9 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1petition for certificate of innocence in the circuit court of 2the county in which the person was convicted or adjudicated a 3delinquent. The petition shall request a certificate of 4innocence finding that the petitioner was innocent of one or 5more all offenses for which he or she was convicted 6incarcerated.7    (c) In order to present the claim for certificate of 8innocence of an unjust conviction or juvenile delinquency 9adjudication and imprisonment, the petitioner must attach to 10his or her petition documentation demonstrating that:11        (1) he or she has been convicted or adjudicated a 12    delinquent of one or more felonies by the State of 13    Illinois and subsequently sentenced to a term of 14    imprisonment, and has served all or any part of the 15    sentence; and16        (2) his or her judgment of conviction or delinquency 17    adjudication was reversed or vacated, and the indictment, 18    or information, or petition dismissed or, if a new trial 19    was ordered, either he or she was found not guilty at the 20    new trial or he or she was not retried and the indictment, 21    or information, or petition dismissed; or the statute, or 22    application thereof, on which the indictment or 23    information was based violated the Constitution of the 24    United States or the State of Illinois; and25        (3) his or her claim is not time barred by the 26    provisions of subsection (i) of this Section.  HB3818- 10 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1    (d) The petition shall state facts in sufficient detail to 2permit the court to find that the petitioner is likely to 3succeed at trial in proving that the petitioner is innocent of 4the alleged offenses for which he or she was convicted or 5adjudicated a delinquent charged in the indictment or 6information or his or her acts or omissions charged in the 7indictment or information did not constitute a felony or 8misdemeanor against the State of Illinois, and the petitioner 9did not by his or her own conduct voluntarily cause or bring 10about his or her conviction or juvenile delinquency 11adjudication. Neither a guilty plea nor a confession 12constitutes conduct causing or bringing about one's conviction 13or delinquency adjudication. The petition shall be verified by 14the petitioner.15    (e) A copy of the petition shall be served on the Attorney 16General and the State's Attorney of the county where the 17conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication was had. The 18Attorney General and the State's Attorney of the county where 19the conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication was had 20shall have the right to intervene as parties.21    (f) In any hearing seeking a certificate of innocence, the 22court may take judicial notice of prior sworn testimony or 23evidence admitted in the criminal or juvenile delinquency 24proceedings related to the convictions or adjudications which 25resulted in the alleged wrongful incarceration, if the 26petitioner was either represented by counsel at such prior   HB3818- 11 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1proceedings or the right to counsel was knowingly waived.2    (g) In order to obtain a certificate of innocence the 3petitioner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:4        (1) the petitioner was convicted or adjudicated a 5    delinquent of one or more felonies by the State of 6    Illinois and subsequently sentenced to a term of 7    imprisonment, and has served all or any part of the 8    sentence;9        (2)(A) the judgment of conviction or adjudication was 10    reversed or vacated, and the indictment, or information, 11    or petition dismissed or, if a new trial was ordered, 12    either the petitioner was found not guilty at the new 13    trial or the petitioner was not retried and the 14    indictment, or information, or petition dismissed; or (B) 15    the statute, or application thereof, on which the 16    indictment, or information, or petition was based violated 17    the Constitution of the United States or the State of 18    Illinois;19        (3) the petitioner is innocent of one or more of the 20    offenses for which he or she was convicted or adjudicated 21    a delinquent charged in the indictment or information or 22    his or her acts or omissions charged in the indictment or 23    information did not constitute a felony or misdemeanor 24    against the State; and25        (4) the petitioner did not by his or her own conduct 26    voluntarily cause or bring about his or her conviction or   HB3818- 12 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1    juvenile delinquency adjudication. Neither a guilty plea 2    nor a confession constitutes conduct causing or bringing 3    about one's conviction or delinquency adjudication.4    (h) If the court finds that the petitioner is entitled to a 5judgment, it shall enter a certificate of innocence finding 6that the petitioner was innocent of one or more all offenses 7for which he or she was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent. 8The court shall also make a determination, subject to proof by 9the claimant, of the reasonable attorney's fees, costs, and 10expenses incurred by the claimant in connection with obtaining 11the certificate of innocence under this Section incarcerated. 12Upon entry of the certificate of innocence or pardon from the 13Governor stating that such pardon was issued on the ground of 14innocence of the crime for which he or she was convicted or 15adjudicated a delinquent imprisoned, (1) the clerk of the 16court shall transmit a copy of the certificate of innocence to 17the clerk of the Court of Claims, together with the claimant's 18current address; and (2) the court shall enter an order 19expunging the record of arrest from the official records of 20the arresting authority and order that the records of the 21clerk of the circuit court and the Illinois State Police be 22sealed until further order of the court upon good cause shown 23or as otherwise provided herein, and the name of the defendant 24or respondent in a juvenile delinquency proceeding obliterated 25from the official index requested to be kept by the circuit 26court clerk under Section 16 of the Clerks of Courts Act in   HB3818- 13 -LRB104 08464 JRC 18516 b1connection with the arrest and conviction or delinquency 2adjudication for the offense but the order shall not affect 3any index issued by the circuit court clerk before the entry of 4the order. The court shall enter the expungement order 5regardless of whether the petitioner has prior criminal 6convictions or delinquency adjudications. 7    All records sealed by the Illinois State Police may be 8disseminated by the Department only as required by law or to 9the arresting authority, the State's Attorney, the court upon 10a later arrest for the same or similar offense, or for the 11purpose of sentencing for any subsequent felony. Upon 12conviction for any subsequent offense, the Department of 13Corrections shall have access to all sealed records of the 14Department pertaining to that individual. 15    Upon entry of the order of expungement, the clerk of the 16circuit court shall promptly mail a copy of the order to the 17person whose records were expunged and sealed. The clerk shall 18post in the common areas of the courthouse a notice containing 19information about grants for exonerated persons and their 20dependents under Section 62 of the Higher Education Student 21Assistance Act, including the Internet address of the Illinois 22Student Assistance Commission.
