Limitations on retainage from subcontractors. 11    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if a State 12agency has not withheld retainage from a payment to a 13contractor on a project, then that contractor may not withhold 14retainage from a payment to a subcontractor for the same 15project.16    (b) If a State agency has withheld retainage from a 17contractor in accordance with Section 10, then the contractor 18may withhold retainage from a payment to a subcontractor, but 19only to the extent that the amount retained from payment to the 20contractor by the State agency is attributable to a failure on 21the part of the subcontractor to make satisfactory progress 22with respect to the subcontractor's contractual obligations.23    (c) This Section applies only to subcontracts entered into 24on or after the effective date of this Act in connection with a 25State construction contract that is subject to the provisions   10400SB0074sam001- 4 -LRB104 05978 JRC 24619 a1of Section 10.". 2    Section 99.
