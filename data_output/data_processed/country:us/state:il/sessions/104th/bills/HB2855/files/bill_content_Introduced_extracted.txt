The new amount resulting from each 19annual adjustment shall be determined by the Public Pension 20Division of the Department of Insurance and made available to 21the boards of the retirement systems and pension funds by 22November 1 of each year. 23    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, 24for a person who first becomes a fireman under this Article on 25or after January 1, 2011, eligibility for and the amount of the 26annuity to which the qualified surviving spouse, children, and   HB2855- 22 -LRB104 10678 RPS 20757 b1parents of the fireman are entitled under this subsection (c) 2shall be determined as follows:3        (1) The surviving spouse of a deceased fireman to whom 4    this Section applies shall be deemed qualified to receive 5    a Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity under this paragraph 6    (1) if: (i) the deceased fireman meets the requirements 7    specified under subdivision (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this 8    paragraph (1); and (ii) the surviving spouse would not 9    otherwise be excluded from receiving a widow's annuity 10    under the eligibility requirements for a widow's annuity 11    set forth in Section 6-142.

The Tier 2 surviving 10        spouse's annuity calculated under this subdivision (D) 11        shall be in lieu of, but in the same amount and paid in 12        the same manner as, the widow's annuity provided under 13        Section 6-140; except that the salary used for 14        computing a Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity under 15        this subdivision (D) shall be subject to the Tier 2 16        salary cap provided under subsection (b) of this 17        Section.18            (E) Notwithstanding any other provision of this 19        Article, the monthly Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity 20        under subdivision (A) or (B) of this paragraph (1) 21        shall be increased on the January 1 next occurring 22        after (i) attainment of age 60 by the recipient of the 23        Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity or (ii) the first 24        anniversary of the Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity 25        start date, whichever is later, and on each January 1 26        thereafter, by 3% or one-half the annual unadjusted   HB2855- 25 -LRB104 10678 RPS 20757 b1        percentage increase in the consumer price index-u for 2        the 12 months ending with September preceding each 3        November 1, whichever is less, of the originally 4        granted Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity. If the 5        annual unadjusted percentage change in the consumer 6        price index-u for a 12-month period ending in 7        September is zero or, when compared with the preceding 8        period, decreases, then the annuity shall not be 9        increased.10            (F) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this 11        paragraph (1), for a qualified surviving spouse who is 12        entitled to a Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity under 13        subdivision (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this paragraph 14        (1), that Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity shall not 15        be less than the amount of the minimum widow's annuity 16        established from time to time under Section 6-128.4.17        (2) Surviving children of a deceased fireman subject 18    to this Section who would otherwise meet the eligibility 19    requirements for a child's annuity set forth in Sections 20    6-147 and 6-148 shall be deemed qualified to receive a 21    Tier 2 child's annuity under this subsection (c), which 22    shall be in lieu of, but in the same amount and paid in the 23    same manner as, the child's annuity provided under those 24    Sections; except that any salary used for computing a Tier 25    2 child's annuity shall be subject to the Tier 2 salary cap 26    provided under subsection (b) of this Section. For   HB2855- 26 -LRB104 10678 RPS 20757 b1    purposes of determining any pro rata reduction in child's 2    annuities under this subsection (c), references in Section 3    6-148 to the combined annuities of the family shall be 4    deemed to refer to the combined Tier 2 surviving spouse's 5    annuity, if any, and the Tier 2 child's annuities payable 6    under this subsection (c).7        (3) Surviving parents of a deceased fireman subject to 8    this Section who would otherwise meet the eligibility 9    requirements for a parent's annuity set forth in Section 10    6-149 shall be deemed qualified to receive a Tier 2 11    parent's annuity under this subsection (c), which shall be 12    in lieu of, but in the same amount and paid in the same 13    manner as, the parent's annuity provided under Section 14    6-149; except that any salary used for computing a Tier 2 15    parent's annuity shall be subject to the Tier 2 salary cap 16    provided under subsection (b) of this Section.
