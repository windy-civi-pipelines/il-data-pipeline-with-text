Purpose. 12    (a) Numerous American businesses across various 13industries, including insurance, banking, tobacco, cotton, 14sugar, railroads, and shipping, reaped substantial profits by 15exploiting the uncompensated labor of enslaved persons. 16Consequently, these businesses and the individuals managing 17them directly profited from the labor of enslaved persons and 18directly benefited from insurance policies that insured 19enslaved persons. This intertwining of economic interests 20highlights the extent to which the exploitation of enslaved 21persons permeated the foundation of various American 22industries. However, very few American industries and the 23underlying businesses and individuals have adequately 24acknowledged their connection to the Enslavement Era. 25    (b) The citizens of Illinois, including descendants of   SB2212- 6 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1enslaved persons, are entitled to complete transparency 2regarding any involvement or profits acquired through slavery 3by companies seeking to conduct business in the State. This 4disclosure is essential to ensure that the community is 5informed about the historical connections and practices of the 6companies operating within its jurisdiction, fostering a 7culture of accountability and responsible business practices.8    (c) This Act is a call to the companies that participated 9in slaveholding and the slave trade to acknowledge and address 10the enduring impacts of the Enslavement Era on our society, 11and to promote responsible corporate citizenship. It is 12essential for companies to recognize their historical 13connections to the Enslavement Era and take responsibility for 14any past actions that have contributed to the perpetuation of 15inequities. By actively engaging in redress efforts, 16corporations demonstrate their commitment to fostering a more 17just and equitable society. Remedying the harms resulting from 18the crimes and atrocities of the Enslavement Era is not only a 19moral imperative and an international standard but also a 20crucial step toward ensuring a cohesive and inclusive 21community. This Act serves to facilitate corporate 22transparency and accountability and to encourage the 23implementation of concrete measures aimed at alleviating the 24long-lasting adverse effects of the slave trade on descendants 25of enslaved persons.26    (d) The purpose of this Act is to:  SB2212- 7 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1        (1) promote the investigation of any participation in 2    slaveholding, the slave trade, or both by companies or 3    contractors that do business with the State; 4        (2) establish a system that (i) makes publicly 5    available full and accurate disclosure of company or 6    contractor records related to the participation in 7    slaveholding, the slave trade, or both, (ii) provides the 8    opportunity for public notice and comment before the State 9    contracts with companies or contractors that participated 10    in slaveholding or the slave trade, and (iii) requires 11    disclosure, to the extent applicable, of any records 12    indicating: 13            (A) whether the company or contractor was a party 14        to any insurance policy related to slaveholding; 15            (B) evidence of the purchase, sale, or lease of 16        enslaved persons by the company or contractor; 17            (C) evidence of the use by the company or 18        contractor of enslaved persons as collateral for 19        insurance policies, loans, or other transactions; 20            (D) evidence of the provision, or receipt, of 21        loans by the company or contractor to purchase 22        enslaved persons; 23            (E) evidence of insuring transactions for enslaved 24        persons; and 25            (F) any other company or contractor records 26        evidencing participation in slaveholding or   SB2212- 8 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1        participation in the slave trade;2        (3) encourage corporate transparency and 3    accountability through the establishment of a process 4    pursuant to which the Office shall develop and fund 5    eligible redress projects to assist in redress efforts; 6    and7        (4) establish a governance structure to monitor and 8    enforce the provisions of this Act. 9    Section 15. Findings. 10    (a) Insurance policies from the Enslavement Era, which 11have been discovered in the archives of several insurance 12companies, document insurance coverage to slaveholders for 13damage to or death of enslaved persons. In some cases, 14existing insurance firms or their predecessor firms issued 15these policies. 16    (b) Records may exist that show that various companies, 17either directly or through their parent entities, subsidiaries 18or predecessors in interest or otherwise, bought or sold 19enslaved persons, used enslaved persons as collateral for 20insurance policies or other transactions, provided loans to 21purchase enslaved persons, insured those transactions, and 22provided related or other services to aid and abet those 23transactions. 24    (c) These insurance policies, loan documents, and other 25documents and records provide evidence of ill-gotten profits   SB2212- 9 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1from slavery. Slaveholders and those involved in the slave 2trade, in turn, profited from the uncompensated labor of 3enslaved persons, even if those profits have long since been 4redistributed to shareholders. Industries that profited in 5this manner include, but are not limited to, capitalized 6insurers, financial service providers, textile companies, 7tobacco companies, railroad companies, shipping companies, the 8rice industry, the sugar industry, and entities in other 9industries whose successors in interest remain in existence 10today. 11    (d) The General Assembly finds and declares that the fact 12that slavery was legal in certain parts of the United States at 13the time that it occurred does not make the practice any less 14repugnant, abhorrent, or deplorable, nor does it in any way 15diminish the gravity of these wrongs or the importance of 16rectifying and remediating these tragedies. 17    (e) Many Illinois residents are descendants of enslaved 18persons and their ancestors were defined as property, 19dehumanized, separated from their families, coerced into 20performing labor without appropriate compensation or benefits, 21and were assaulted and abused. Enslaved persons were treated 22as chattel in every sense of the word, including being used as 23collateral for insurance policies, loans, and other 24transactions, and, in some instances, their ancestors' owners 25were compensated for damages by insurers. 26    (f) Appropriate compensation to enslaved persons for their   SB2212- 10 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1labor otherwise would have been bequeathed to their 2descendants. As a result, companies and individuals who 3profited from the labor of enslaved persons were unjustly 4enriched. 5    (g) Residents of Illinois are entitled to the full 6disclosure of any and all information regarding the 7above-described transactions, and respect and recognition of 8the dignity of the enslaved persons and their descendants 9requires it. 10    (h) The General Assembly formally acknowledges the loss of 11assets that rightfully should be the property of descendants 12in the United States and extends its apologies to descendants 13who continue to suffer the legacy of slavery. 14    (i) The General Assembly finds that full disclosure of the 15facts and acknowledgment of the depth and scope of the 16participation in slaveholding and the slave trade and public 17hearings with respect thereto furthers the public interest by 18recognizing the dignity of enslaved persons and descendants 19and promotes healing in the State for enslaved persons, 20descendants, and those who participated in slaveholding or the 21slave trade. 22    (j) The General Assembly finds that public disclosure and 23public hearings based on those disclosures will promote 24knowledge of the nature and scope of the slaveholding and 25slave trading activities in Illinois and thereby will promote 26healing.   SB2212- 11 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1    (k) The State of Illinois finds that the establishment of 2a fund, to which companies and contractors subject to this Act 3shall make monetary contributions, will promote healing and 4assist the State of Illinois in rectifying and remedying some 5of the shameful legacies of slaveholding and the slave trade, 6thereby protecting and promoting the dignity and welfare of 7Illinois residents and the Illinois community. 8    Section 17.

Purpose. 12    (a) Numerous American businesses across various 13industries, including insurance, banking, tobacco, cotton, 14sugar, railroads, and shipping, reaped substantial profits by 15exploiting the uncompensated labor of enslaved persons. 16Consequently, these businesses and the individuals managing 17them directly profited from the labor of enslaved persons and 18directly benefited from insurance policies that insured 19enslaved persons. This intertwining of economic interests 20highlights the extent to which the exploitation of enslaved 21persons permeated the foundation of various American 22industries. However, very few American industries and the 23underlying businesses and individuals have adequately 24acknowledged their connection to the Enslavement Era. 25    (b) The citizens of Illinois, including descendants of   SB2212- 6 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1enslaved persons, are entitled to complete transparency 2regarding any involvement or profits acquired through slavery 3by companies seeking to conduct business in the State. This 4disclosure is essential to ensure that the community is 5informed about the historical connections and practices of the 6companies operating within its jurisdiction, fostering a 7culture of accountability and responsible business practices.8    (c) This Act is a call to the companies that participated 9in slaveholding and the slave trade to acknowledge and address 10the enduring impacts of the Enslavement Era on our society, 11and to promote responsible corporate citizenship. It is 12essential for companies to recognize their historical 13connections to the Enslavement Era and take responsibility for 14any past actions that have contributed to the perpetuation of 15inequities. By actively engaging in redress efforts, 16corporations demonstrate their commitment to fostering a more 17just and equitable society. Remedying the harms resulting from 18the crimes and atrocities of the Enslavement Era is not only a 19moral imperative and an international standard but also a 20crucial step toward ensuring a cohesive and inclusive 21community. This Act serves to facilitate corporate 22transparency and accountability and to encourage the 23implementation of concrete measures aimed at alleviating the 24long-lasting adverse effects of the slave trade on descendants 25of enslaved persons.26    (d) The purpose of this Act is to:  SB2212- 7 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1        (1) promote the investigation of any participation in 2    slaveholding, the slave trade, or both by companies or 3    contractors that do business with the State; 4        (2) establish a system that (i) makes publicly 5    available full and accurate disclosure of company or 6    contractor records related to the participation in 7    slaveholding, the slave trade, or both, (ii) provides the 8    opportunity for public notice and comment before the State 9    contracts with companies or contractors that participated 10    in slaveholding or the slave trade, and (iii) requires 11    disclosure, to the extent applicable, of any records 12    indicating: 13            (A) whether the company or contractor was a party 14        to any insurance policy related to slaveholding; 15            (B) evidence of the purchase, sale, or lease of 16        enslaved persons by the company or contractor; 17            (C) evidence of the use by the company or 18        contractor of enslaved persons as collateral for 19        insurance policies, loans, or other transactions; 20            (D) evidence of the provision, or receipt, of 21        loans by the company or contractor to purchase 22        enslaved persons; 23            (E) evidence of insuring transactions for enslaved 24        persons; and 25            (F) any other company or contractor records 26        evidencing participation in slaveholding or   SB2212- 8 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1        participation in the slave trade;2        (3) encourage corporate transparency and 3    accountability through the establishment of a process 4    pursuant to which the Office shall develop and fund 5    eligible redress projects to assist in redress efforts; 6    and7        (4) establish a governance structure to monitor and 8    enforce the provisions of this Act. 9    Section 15. Findings. 10    (a) Insurance policies from the Enslavement Era, which 11have been discovered in the archives of several insurance 12companies, document insurance coverage to slaveholders for 13damage to or death of enslaved persons. In some cases, 14existing insurance firms or their predecessor firms issued 15these policies. 16    (b) Records may exist that show that various companies, 17either directly or through their parent entities, subsidiaries 18or predecessors in interest or otherwise, bought or sold 19enslaved persons, used enslaved persons as collateral for 20insurance policies or other transactions, provided loans to 21purchase enslaved persons, insured those transactions, and 22provided related or other services to aid and abet those 23transactions. 24    (c) These insurance policies, loan documents, and other 25documents and records provide evidence of ill-gotten profits   SB2212- 9 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1from slavery. Slaveholders and those involved in the slave 2trade, in turn, profited from the uncompensated labor of 3enslaved persons, even if those profits have long since been 4redistributed to shareholders. Industries that profited in 5this manner include, but are not limited to, capitalized 6insurers, financial service providers, textile companies, 7tobacco companies, railroad companies, shipping companies, the 8rice industry, the sugar industry, and entities in other 9industries whose successors in interest remain in existence 10today. 11    (d) The General Assembly finds and declares that the fact 12that slavery was legal in certain parts of the United States at 13the time that it occurred does not make the practice any less 14repugnant, abhorrent, or deplorable, nor does it in any way 15diminish the gravity of these wrongs or the importance of 16rectifying and remediating these tragedies. 17    (e) Many Illinois residents are descendants of enslaved 18persons and their ancestors were defined as property, 19dehumanized, separated from their families, coerced into 20performing labor without appropriate compensation or benefits, 21and were assaulted and abused. Enslaved persons were treated 22as chattel in every sense of the word, including being used as 23collateral for insurance policies, loans, and other 24transactions, and, in some instances, their ancestors' owners 25were compensated for damages by insurers. 26    (f) Appropriate compensation to enslaved persons for their   SB2212- 10 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1labor otherwise would have been bequeathed to their 2descendants. As a result, companies and individuals who 3profited from the labor of enslaved persons were unjustly 4enriched. 5    (g) Residents of Illinois are entitled to the full 6disclosure of any and all information regarding the 7above-described transactions, and respect and recognition of 8the dignity of the enslaved persons and their descendants 9requires it. 10    (h) The General Assembly formally acknowledges the loss of 11assets that rightfully should be the property of descendants 12in the United States and extends its apologies to descendants 13who continue to suffer the legacy of slavery. 14    (i) The General Assembly finds that full disclosure of the 15facts and acknowledgment of the depth and scope of the 16participation in slaveholding and the slave trade and public 17hearings with respect thereto furthers the public interest by 18recognizing the dignity of enslaved persons and descendants 19and promotes healing in the State for enslaved persons, 20descendants, and those who participated in slaveholding or the 21slave trade. 22    (j) The General Assembly finds that public disclosure and 23public hearings based on those disclosures will promote 24knowledge of the nature and scope of the slaveholding and 25slave trading activities in Illinois and thereby will promote 26healing.   SB2212- 11 -LRB104 12206 HLH 22311 b1    (k) The State of Illinois finds that the establishment of 2a fund, to which companies and contractors subject to this Act 3shall make monetary contributions, will promote healing and 4assist the State of Illinois in rectifying and remedying some 5of the shameful legacies of slaveholding and the slave trade, 6thereby protecting and promoting the dignity and welfare of 7Illinois residents and the Illinois community. 8    Section 17.
