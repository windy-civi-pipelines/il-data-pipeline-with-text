If the trustee of any trust for 8the benefit of the ward has discretionary power to apply 9income or principal for the ward's benefit, the trustee shall 10not be required to distribute any of the income or principal to 11the guardian of the ward's estate, but the guardian may bring 12an action on behalf of the ward to compel the trustee to 13exercise the trustee's discretion or to seek relief from an 14abuse of discretion. This paragraph shall not limit the right 15of a guardian of the estate to receive accountings from the 16trustee on behalf of the ward.17    (d-5) Upon a verified petition by the plenary or limited 18guardian of the estate or the request of the ward that is 19accompanied by a current physician's or a licensed clinical 20psychologist's report that states the ward possesses 21testamentary capacity, the court may enter an order 22authorizing the ward to execute a will or codicil. In so 23ordering, the court shall authorize the guardian to retain 24independent counsel for the ward with whom the ward may 25execute or modify a will or codicil. 26    (e) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of   HB3875- 10 -LRB104 08146 JRC 18194 b1Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 2principal under an agency that survives disability, the 3guardian will have no power, duty or liability with respect to 4any property subject to the agency. This subsection (e) 5applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever executed.6    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the 7standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 8interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 9court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 10disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 11a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 12orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 13interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 14termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 15short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 16petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 17with a disability.18(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22.)
