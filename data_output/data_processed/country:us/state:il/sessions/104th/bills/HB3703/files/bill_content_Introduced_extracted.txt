The district may make agreements with 2a county or municipality for holding such persons in a 3facility operated by them for the incarceration of violators 4of ordinances or resolutions. 5    Section 40. Powers of the board of trustees. The board of 6trustees of the district may provide for the efficient 7drainage of storm and sewer waters within the district and 8save and preserve the water supplied to the inhabitants of the 9district from contamination. For that purpose, the board may 10construct and maintain an enclosed conduit or conduits, main 11pipes, wholly or partially submerged, buried or otherwise, and 12by means of pumps or otherwise cause such sewage or stormwater 13to flow or to be forced through such conduit or conduits, pipe 14or pipes to and into any ditch or canal constructed and 15operated by any other district, after having first acquired 16the right so to do. Such board may provide for the drainage of 17the district by laying out, establishing, constructing, and 18maintaining one or more channels, drains, ditches, and outlets 19for carrying off and disposing of the drainage, including the 20sewage, of the district, together with such adjuncts and 21additions thereto as may be necessary or proper to cause such 22channels or outlets to accomplish the end for which they are 23designed, in a satisfactory manner, including pumps and 24pumping stations and the operation of the same. Such board may 25provide suitable and modernly equipped sewage treatment works   HB3703- 11 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1or plants for the separation and treatment of all solids and 2deleterious matter from the liquids, shall treat and purify 3the residue of such sewage so that when it flows into any lake, 4and may not injuriously contaminate the waters thereof. The 5board may adopt any feasible method to accomplish the object 6for which the district was created and may also provide means 7whereby the district may reach and procure supplies of water 8for diluting and flushing purposes. The board of trustees of 9the district may also enter into an agreement to sell, convey, 10or disburse treated wastewater to any public or private entity 11located within or outside the boundaries of the district. Any 12use of treated wastewater by a public or private entity is 13subject to the orders of the Pollution Control Board. The 14agreement may not exceed 20 years.15    Nothing in this Section may be construed to empower, 16authorize, or require such board of trustees to operate a 17system of water works for the purpose of furnishing or 18delivering water to any such municipality or to the 19inhabitants of the municipality without payment for the water 20at such rates as the board may determine. Nothing in this Act 21shall require a district to extend service to any individual 22residence or other building within the district, and it is the 23intent of the General Assembly that any construction or 24funding contemplated by this Section shall be restricted to 25construction or funding of works and main or interceptor 26sewers, conduits, channels, and similar facilities, but not   HB3703- 12 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1individual service lines. Nothing in this Act authorizes the 2trustees to flow the stormwater or sewage of the district into 3Lake Michigan. Any such plan for sewage disposal by the 4district is prohibited unless such sewage has been treated and 5purified as provided in this Section, all laws of the federal 6government relating to the pollution of navigable waters have 7been complied with, and the approval of plans and 8constructions of outlets and connection with any of the 9streams or navigable bodies of water within or bordering upon 10the State has been obtained from the Department of Natural 11Resources. The discharge of any sewage from the district into 12any of the streams or navigable bodies of water within or 13bordering upon the State is subject to the orders of the 14Pollution Control Board. Nothing in this Act may be construed 15as superseding or in any manner limiting the provisions of the 16Environmental Protection Act.17    After the construction of such a sewage disposal plant, if 18the board finds that it will promote the prevention of 19pollution of waters of the State, such board of trustees may 20adopt ordinances or rules and regulations prohibiting or 21regulating the discharge to sewers of inadmissible wastes or 22substances toxic to biological wastewater treatment processes. 23Inadmissible wastes include those that create a fire or 24explosion hazard in the sewer or treatment works; those that 25will impair the hydraulic capacity of sewer systems; and those 26that, in any quantity, create a hazard to people, sewer   HB3703- 13 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1systems, treatment processes, or receiving waters. Substances 2that may be toxic to wastewater treatment processes include 3copper, chromium, lead, zinc, arsenic, nickel, barium, 4cadmium, mercury, selenium, silver, and any poisonous 5compounds, such as cyanide or radioactive wastes that pass 6through wastewater treatment plants in hazardous 7concentrations and menace users of the receiving waters. Such 8ordinances or rules and regulations shall be effective 9throughout the district in both the incorporated areas as well 10as the unincorporated areas and all public sewers therein. 11    Section 45.

Municipal sewer systems. Where any sewer 19system under the jurisdiction of a municipality is tributary 20to the district's sewer system, and the board of trustees of 21the district finds that it will conduce to the public health, 22comfort, or convenience, the board may regulate, limit, 23extend, deny, or otherwise control any connection to such 24sewer tributary to the district's sewer system by any person 25or municipal corporation regardless of whether the sewer into   HB3703- 18 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1which the connection is made is directly under the 2jurisdiction of the district or not. 3    Section 60.

If the findings of 22    fact, conclusions of law, recommended civil penalty, or 23    order are rejected, the board of trustees shall remand the 24    matter to the hearing officer for further proceedings. If 25    the order is accepted by the board of trustees, it shall 26    constitute the final order of the board of trustees.  HB3703- 26 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1        (8) The civil penalty specified by the board of 2    trustees shall be paid within 35 days after the party on 3    whom it is imposed receives a written copy of the order of 4    the board of trustees unless the person or persons to whom 5    the order is issued seeks judicial review.6        (9) If a party seeks judicial review of the order 7    assessing civil penalties, the party shall, within 35 days 8    after the date of the final order, pay the amount of the 9    civil penalties into an escrow account maintained by the 10    district for that purpose or file a bond guaranteeing 11    payment of the civil penalties if the civil penalties are 12    upheld on review.13        (10) Civil penalties not paid by the times specified 14    above shall be delinquent and subject to late fees 15    assessed on a monthly basis which shall not exceed the 16    maximum interest rate allowed under State law. The late 17    fees levied by the district shall be in addition to any 18    other remedy or right of recovery that the district may 19    have with respect to the collection or recovery of 20    penalties and charges imposed by the district. 21    (e) The president may order a party to cease the discharge 22of surface water, groundwater, stormwater, effluent, gaseous 23wastes, sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes upon a 24finding by the president that the final order of the board of 25trustees entered after a hearing to show cause has been 26violated. The president shall serve the party with a copy of   HB3703- 27 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1the president's order either by certified mail or personally 2by serving the owner, officer, or registered agent of the 3municipality or other unit of local government. The order of 4the president shall also schedule an expedited hearing before 5a hearing officer designated by the board of trustees for the 6purpose of determining whether the party has violated the 7final order of the board of trustees. The board of trustees 8shall adopt rules of procedure governing expedited hearings. 9The hearing may not be conducted less than 7 days after service 10of the president's order.11    At the conclusion of the expedited hearing, the hearing 12officer shall prepare a report with the officer's findings and 13recommendations and transmit it to the board of trustees. If 14the board of trustees, after reviewing the findings and 15recommendations, and the record produced at the hearing, 16determines that the party has violated the board of trustees' 17final order, the board of trustees may authorize the plugging 18or disconnection of the sewer or other actions that disconnect 19the offending party's ability to discharge any waters or 20wastes into the district's sewer system. The president shall 21give not less than 10 days' written notice of the board of 22trustees' order to the municipality or other unit of local 23government as well as the owner of record of the real estate 24and other parties known to be affected that the sewer will be 25plugged or disconnected.26    Disconnection of a sewer under this subsection shall be in   HB3703- 28 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1addition to any other remedy that the district may have to 2prevent violation of its ordinances and orders of its board of 3trustees.4    (f) A violation of the final order of the board of trustees 5shall be considered a nuisance. If any person discharges 6groundwater, surface water, stormwater, effluent, gaseous 7wastes, sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into any 8sewers or stormwater management facilities contrary to the 9final order of the board of trustees, the district, acting 10through the president, may commence an action or proceeding in 11the Circuit Court of Cook County for the purpose of having the 12discharge stopped either by mandamus or injunction or to 13remedy the violation in any manner provided for in this 14Section.15    The court shall specify a time, not exceeding 20 days 16after the service of the copy of the complaint, in which the 17party complained of must plead to the complaint, and, in the 18meantime, the party may be restrained. In case of default or 19after pleading, the court shall immediately inquire into the 20facts and circumstances of the case and enter an appropriate 21judgment in respect to the matters complained of. Appeals may 22be taken as in other civil cases.23    (g) The district, acting through the president, may 24commence an action or proceeding for mandamus or injunction in 25the Circuit Court of Cook County ordering a party to cease its 26discharge, when, in the opinion of the president, the party's   HB3703- 29 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1discharge presents an imminent danger to the public health, 2welfare, or safety; presents or may present an endangerment to 3the environment; or threatens to interfere with the operation 4of the sewerage system under the jurisdiction of the district. 5The initiation of a show cause hearing is not a prerequisite to 6the commencement by the district of an action or proceeding 7for mandamus or injunction in the circuit court. The court 8shall specify a time, not exceeding 20 days after the service 9of a copy of the petition, in which the party complained of 10must answer the petition, and, in the meantime, the party may 11be restrained. In case of default in answer or after answer, 12the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and 13circumstances of the case and enter an appropriate judgment 14order in respect to the matters complained of. An appeal may be 15taken from the final judgment in the same manner and with the 16same effect as appeals are taken from judgment of the circuit 17court in other actions for mandamus or injunction.18    (h) Whenever the district commences an action under 19subsection (f), the court shall assess a civil penalty of not 20less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000 for each day the party 21violates the board of trustees' order. Whenever the district 22commences an action under subsection (g), the court shall 23assess a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 nor more than 24$10,000 for each day the party violates the ordinance. Each 25day's continuance of the violation is a separate offense. The 26penalties provided in this Section imposed by the board of   HB3703- 30 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1trustees under subsection (d) plus interest at the rate set 2forth in the Interest Act on unpaid penalties, costs, and 3fees; the reasonable costs to the district of removal or other 4remedial action caused by discharges in violation of this Act; 5reasonable attorney's fees; court costs; other expenses of 6litigation; and costs for inspection, sampling, analysis, and 7administration related to the enforcement action against the 8offending party are recoverable by the district in a civil 9action.10    (i) The board of trustees may establish fees for late 11filing of reports with the district required by an ordinance 12governing discharges. The district shall provide by certified 13mail a written notice of the fee assessment that states the 14party has 30 days after the receipt of the notice to request a 15conference with the president's designee to discuss or dispute 16the appropriateness of the assessed fee. Unless a party 17objects to paying the fee for filing a report late by timely 18requesting in writing a conference with a designee of the 19president, that party waives the party's right to a 20conference.21    If a party requests a conference and the matter is not 22resolved at the conference, the party subject to the fee may 23request an administrative hearing before an impartial hearing 24officer appointed under subsection (d) to determine the 25party's liability for and the amount of the fee. If the hearing 26officer finds that the late filing fees are owed to the   HB3703- 31 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1district, the district shall notify the responsible party of 2the hearing officer's decision. If payment is not made within 330 days after the notice, the district may impose penalties 4and interest.5    (j) To be effective service under this Section, a demand 6or order sent by certified or registered mail to the last known 7address need not be received by the offending party. Service 8of the demand or order by registered or certified mail shall be 9deemed effective upon deposit in the United States mail with 10proper postage prepaid and addressed as provided in this 11Section.12    (k) The Administrative Review Law applies to and governs 13all proceedings for the judicial review of final 14administrative decisions of the board of trustees in the 15enforcement of an ordinance, rule, or regulation adopted under 16this Act. The cost of preparing the record on appeal shall be 17paid by the person seeking a review of an order or action 18pursuant to the Administrative Review Law.19    (l) Solely in relation to the discharge of groundwater, 20surface water, stormwater, sewage, industrial wastes, or other 21wastes subject to one of the district's ordinances, the 22district may implement an electronic reporting system that 23will allow notices, orders, and other documents to be sent 24directly by email to persons or entities registered with the 25district, and, in the discretion of the district, to allow 26those persons or entities registered with the district to   HB3703- 32 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1view, modify, or submit documents using the electronic 2reporting system. Wherever this Section provides for service 3of documents by the district by U.S. first-class mail, U.S. 4certified mail, or personal service, the district may serve by 5email the documents upon the registered persons or entities in 6lieu of service by U.S. first-class mail, U.S. certified mail, 7or personal service. Enrollment in the electronic reporting 8system in this subsection is voluntary and limited to 9nonresidential facilities or uses. Service by email under this 10Section is only permitted on those persons or entities that 11voluntarily enroll in the system. The district shall adopt 12rules, as approved by ordinance, to ensure service of process 13by email is properly effectuated upon the registered persons 14and entities. 15    Section 85. Acquisition of real and personal property. The 16district may acquire by purchase, condemnation, or otherwise 17any and all real and personal property, right-of-way and 18privilege, either within or without its corporate limits that 19may be required for its corporate purposes; and, if the 20district is unable to agree with any other district or 21municipality upon the terms under which it shall be permitted 22to use the drains, channels or ditches of such other district, 23the right to use the same may be required by condemnation in 24the circuit court by proceedings in the manner, as near as may 25be, as is provided in Section 4-17 of the Illinois Drainage   HB3703- 33 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1Code. The compensation to be paid for such use may be a gross 2sum, or it may be in the form of an annual rental, to be paid 3in yearly installments as and in the manner provided by the 4judgment of the court wherein such proceedings may be had. All 5moneys for the purchase and condemnation of any property shall 6be paid before possession is taken or any work done on the 7premises damaged by the construction of such channel or 8outlet, and, if an appeal from the circuit court is taken by 9either party whereby the amount of damages is not finally 10determined, then possession may be taken. The amount of 11judgment in such court shall be deposited at some bank or 12savings and loan association to be designated by the judge 13thereof subject to the payment of such damages on orders 14signed by such judge, whenever the amount of damages is 15finally determined; and when no longer required for such 16purposes, to sell, convey, vacate and release the same. 17    Section 90. Eminent domain. Notwithstanding any other 18provision of this Act, any power granted under this Act to 19acquire property by condemnation or eminent domain is subject 20to, and shall be exercised in accordance with, the Eminent 21Domain Act. 22    Section 95. Lease of property. The district may lease to 23others for any period of time, not exceeding 50 years, upon 24such terms as its board of trustees may determine, real   HB3703- 34 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1estate, rights-of-way, privilege, or interest therein, or any 2part thereof, acquired by it that is, in the opinion of the 3board of trustees of the district, no longer required for its 4corporate purposes or that may not be immediately needed for 5such purposes, and such leases may contain such conditions and 6retain such interests therein as may be deemed for the best 7interest of the district by such board of trustees. The 8district may grant easements and permits for the use of any 9such real property, right-of-way, or privilege that will not, 10in the opinion of the board of trustees of the district, 11interfere with the use thereof by the district for its 12corporate purposes, and such easements and permits may contain 13such conditions and retain such interests therein as may be 14deemed for the best interests of the district by such board of 15trustees. 16    Section 100. Borrowing money; issuance of bonds. The 17district may borrow money for corporate purposes and may issue 18bonds therefor but may not become indebted, in any manner, or 19for any purpose, to an amount in the aggregate to exceed 5.75% 20on the valuation of taxable property therein, to be 21ascertained by the last assessment for State and county taxes 22previous to the incurring of such. 23    Whenever the board of trustees of the district desires to 24issue bonds hereunder they shall certify the question to the 25proper election officials who shall submit the question at an   HB3703- 35 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1election to be held in the district in accordance with the 2general election law. In addition to the requirements of the 3general election law, the notice of election shall state the 4amount of bonds to be issued.

All bonds issued hereunder shall mature in 10not exceeding 20 annual installments. The question shall be in 11substantially the following form:12---------------------------- 13    Proposition to issue bonds      YES 14of..... district to the       ------------------------------- 15amount of..... dollars.             NO 16-------------------------------------------------------------17    However, the district may borrow money for corporate 18purposes, and may issue bonds for corporate purposes, without 19holding an election or referendum upon the question if the 20district or the board of trustees thereof has been directed by 21an order issued by the circuit court or by an administrative 22agency of the State of Illinois having jurisdiction to issue 23such order to abate its discharge of untreated or inadequately 24treated sewage and such borrowing is deemed necessary by the 25board of trustees of the district to make possible compliance 26with such order. The amount of money that the district may   HB3703- 36 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1borrow to abate such sewage discharge shall be limited to that 2required for that purpose plus such reasonable future 3expansion as shall be approved by the court or the 4administrative agency of the State of Illinois having 5jurisdiction. The ordinance providing for such bonds shall set 6out the fact that such bonds are deemed necessary to make 7possible compliance with the order and shall be published or 8posted in the manner provided in this Act for publication or 9posting of ordinances making appropriations. The ordinance 10shall be in full force and effect after its adoption and 11publication or posting, as herein provided, notwithstanding 12any provision in this Act or any other law to the contrary. 13    Section 105. Assistance program.14    (a) The General Assembly finds that governmental units 15located within the boundaries of the district require 16assistance in financing the cost of repair, replacement, 17reconstruction, and rehabilitation of local sewer and 18stormwater collection systems to reduce certain excessive 19sanitary sewer groundwater inflows as well as stormwater 20inflows; that such inflows ultimately result in increased need 21for treatment and storage facilities of the district; and that 22the district, in the discretion of its board of trustees, 23advantageously may provide loan funds for such purposes.24    (b) As used in this Section:25     "Alternate bonds", "applicable law", "bonds", "general   HB3703- 37 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1obligation bonds", "governmental unit", "ordinance", and 2"revenue source" have the meanings given to those terms in the 3Local Government Debt Reform Act.4    "Assistance bonds" means the bonds to be issued by the 5district to provide funds for the program as authorized in 6subsection (f).7    "Assistance program" means the program authorized in this 8Section by which the district may make loans to local 9governmental units for any one or more of the following 10undertaken with respect to the repair, replacement, 11reconstruction, and rehabilitation of local sewer collection 12systems for preliminary planning, engineering, architectural, 13legal, fiscal or economic investigations or studies, surveys, 14designs, plans, working drawings, specifications, procedures 15or other necessary action, erection, building acquisition, 16alteration, remodeling, or improvement of such collection 17systems, or the inspection or supervision of the action, 18erection, building acquisition, alteration, remodeling, or 19improvement.20    "Loan" means a loan made by the district to a local 21governmental unit under the assistance program.22    "Local governmental unit" means a unit of local 23government, school district, or community college district 24within the boundaries of the district.25    "Reconstruction" includes the construction of totally new 26lines or systems if reasonably designed to replace obsolete   HB3703- 38 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1lines or systems.2    (c) The board of trustees may establish an assistance 3program.4    (d) The board of trustees may do any one or more of the 5following with respect to the assistance program:6        (1) Establish the assistance program as a use or 7    appropriation within the corporate fund of the district.8        (2) Accept grants, borrow funds, and appropriate 9    lawfully available funds for the purpose of funding the 10    assistance program.11        (3) Make the loans as provided in subsection (e).12        (4) Enforce loans with all available remedies as any 13    governmental unit or private person might have with 14    respect to such loans.15    (e) The district may make loans and local governmental 16units may obtain loans from the district, but only if 17authorized to borrow under such powers as may be granted to 18such local governmental units under other applicable law.

As used in this paragraph, 10"design-build" means a delivery system that provides 11responsibility within a single contract for the furnishing of 12architecture, engineering, land surveying and related services 13as required and the labor, materials, equipment, and other 14construction services for the project.15    If an emergency is affecting the public health or safety 16as declared by the board of trustees of the district at a 17meeting thereof duly convened, then the declaration shall 18require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the board of 19trustees and shall set forth the nature of the danger to the 20public health or safety, contracts totaling not more than the 21emergency contract cap may be let to the extent necessary to 22resolve such emergency without public advertisement or 23competitive bidding. Under this Section, an emergency contract 24may not be more than $500,000.

A full written account of 3any such emergency, together with a requisition for the 4materials, supplies, labor or equipment required therefor 5shall be submitted immediately upon completion and shall be 6open to public inspection for a period of at least one year 7after the date of such emergency purchase.8    To address operating emergencies not affecting the public 9health or safety, the board of trustees shall authorize, in 10writing, officials or employees of the district to purchase in 11the open market and without advertisement any supplies, 12materials, equipment, or services for immediate delivery to 13meet the bona fide operating emergency, without filing a 14requisition or estimate therefor, in an amount not in excess 15of $100,000. The board of trustees must be notified of the 16operating emergency. A full, written account of each operating 17emergency and a requisition for the materials, supplies, 18equipment, and services required to meet the operating 19emergency must be immediately submitted by the officials or 20employees authorized to make purchases to the board of 21trustees. The account must be available for public inspection 22for a period of at least one year after the date of the 23operating emergency purchase.

The authority to issue contracts without competitive 17bidding pursuant to this paragraph expires 6 months after the 18date of the writing determining that the awarding of contracts 19without competitive bidding is reasonably necessary.20    A trustee may not be interested, directly or indirectly, 21in any contract, work, or business of the district or in the 22sale of any article, whenever the expense, price or 23consideration of the contract work, business, or sale is paid 24either from the treasury or by an assessment levied by statute 25or ordinance. A trustee may not be interested, directly or 26indirectly, in the purchase of any property that belongs to   HB3703- 45 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1the district, is sold for taxes or assessments of the 2district, or is sold by virtue of legal process by suit of the 3district.4    A contract for any work or other public improvement, to be 5paid for in whole or in part by special assessment or special 6taxation, shall be entered into and the performance thereof 7controlled by the provisions of Division 2 of Article 9 of the 8Illinois Municipal Code as near as may be. However, contracts 9may be let for making proper and suitable connections between 10the mains and outlets of the respective sanitary sewers in the 11district with any conduit, conduits, main pipe or pipes that 12may be constructed by the district.13    As used in this Section, "mandatory competitive bid 14threshold" means a dollar amount equal to 0.1% of the total 15general fixed assets of the district as reported in the most 16recent required audit report. 17    Section 120.

The extent and location of the lands and 18waters so to be used and appropriated shall be approved by the 19Governor, upon application duly made to the Governor asking 20for such approval. The rights, permission, and authority 21hereby granted shall be subject to all public right of 22commerce and navigation, to the authority of the United States 23in behalf of such public rights, and to the right of the State 24of Illinois to regulate and control fishing in said public   HB3703- 47 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1waters. 2    Section 140. United States military installations. If 3there is located within the bounds of the district a United 4States military post, reservation, station, or naval station, 5the board of trustees of the district may enter into contracts 6or agreements with the proper authorities of the United States 7permitting them to connect with any such conduit or conduits, 8main pipe or pipes, and discharge the drainage, sewage, or 9other impure or contaminated liquids therein. 10    Section 145. District improvements causing private 11property damage or takings. Whenever the board of trustees of 12the district shall pass an ordinance for the making of any 13improvement that the district may make, the making of which 14will require that private property should be taken or damaged, 15the district may cause compensation therefor to be 16ascertained, and condemn and acquire possession thereof in the 17same manner as nearly as may be as is provided for the exercise 18of the right of eminent domain under the Eminent Domain Act. 19Proceedings to ascertain the compensation to be paid for 20taking or damaging private property shall, in all cases, be 21instituted in the county where the property sought to be taken 22or damaged is situated. All damages to property, whether 23determined by agreement or by final judgment of court, shall 24be paid prior to the payment of any other debt or obligation.   HB3703- 48 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1    Section 150.

If the rates are 16not thereafter agreed upon by the parties or are not otherwise 17provided for by contract, such rates shall be fixed and 18determined by the Circuit Court of Cook County after a 19petition has been filed with that court. 20    Section 170. Acquiring sanitary district or municipal 21treatment works. 22    (a) After incorporation, the West Cook Flood Prevention 23District may, in accordance with this Act and an 24intergovernmental agreement with a sanitary district or   HB3703- 50 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1municipality, acquire or lease the sewage and stormwater 2systems, as well as territory, treatment works, lines, 3appurtenances, and other property of (i) a sanitary district 4organized under the Sanitary District Act of 1907, the 5Sanitary District Act of 1917, the Sanitary District Act of 61936 or (ii) a municipality whose treatment works were 7established under the Illinois Municipal Code or the Municipal 8Wastewater Disposal Zones Act, regardless of whether that 9district or municipality is contiguous to the West Cook Flood 10Prevention District. The distance between the sanitary 11district being acquired or the municipality and the West Cook 12Flood Prevention District, as measured between the points on 13their corporate boundaries that are nearest to each other, may 14not exceed 20 miles. In the case of a municipality, only that 15property used by the municipality for transport, treatment, 16and discharge of stormwater or wastewater or for disposal of 17sewage sludge may be transferred to the West Cook Flood 18Prevention District.19    (b) The board of trustees of the sanitary district being 20acquired, or the corporate authorities of a municipality whose 21treatment works is being acquired, shall, jointly with the 22board of trustees of the West Cook Flood Prevention District, 23petition the Circuit Court of Cook County to permit the 24acquisition. The petition shall show the following:25        (1) The reason for the acquisition.26        (2) That there are no debts of the sanitary district   HB3703- 51 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1    being acquired or municipality outstanding or that there 2    are sufficient funds on hand or available to satisfy those 3    debts.4        (3) That no contract or federal or State permit or 5    grant will be impaired by the acquisition.6        (4) That all assets and responsibilities of the 7    sanitary district being acquired or municipality, as they 8    relate to wastewater treatment, have been properly 9    assigned to the acquiring district.10        (5) That the West Cook Flood Prevention District will 11    pay any court costs incurred in connection with the 12    petition.13        (6) The boundaries of the acquired sanitary district 14    or municipality as of the date of the petition.15    (c) Upon adequate notice, including appropriate notice to 16the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the circuit 17court shall hold a hearing to determine whether there is good 18cause for the acquisition by the acquiring district and 19whether the allegations of the petition are true. If the court 20finds that there is good cause and that the allegations are 21true, it shall order the acquisition to proceed. If the court 22finds that there is not good cause for the acquisition or that 23the allegations of the petition are not true, the court shall 24dismiss the petition. In either event, the costs shall be 25taxed against the acquiring district. The order shall be 26final. Separate or joint appeals may be taken by any party   HB3703- 52 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1affected by the order as in other civil cases.2    (d) If the court orders the acquisition contemplated in 3the petition, there shall be no further appointments of 4trustees if the acquired agency is a sanitary district. The 5trustees of the acquired sanitary district acting at the time 6of the order shall close up the business affairs of the 7sanitary district and make the necessary conveyances of title 8to the sanitary district property in accordance with the 9intergovernmental agreement between the acquiring and acquired 10sanitary districts. In the case of a municipality, the 11governing body of the municipality shall make the necessary 12conveyances of title to municipal property to the district in 13accordance with the intergovernmental agreement between the 14municipality and the district. The district's ordinances shall 15take effect in the acquired territory upon entry of the order.16    (e) The acquisition of any sanitary district by the West 17Cook Flood Prevention District or the acquisition of a 18treatment works from a municipality by the West Cook Flood 19Prevention District does not affect the obligation of any 20bonds issued or contracts entered into by the acquired 21sanitary district or the municipality, nor invalidate the 22levy, extension, or collection of any taxes or special 23assessments upon a property in the acquired sanitary district, 24but all those bonds and contracts shall be discharged. The 25general obligation indebtedness of the acquired sanitary 26district shall be paid from the proceeds of continuing taxes   HB3703- 53 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1and special assessments as provided in this Act.2    All money remaining after the business affairs of the 3acquired sanitary district or acquired treatment works of the 4municipality have been closed up and all debts and obligations 5of the entities paid shall be paid to the West Cook Flood 6Prevention District in accordance with the intergovernmental 7agreement between the parties.8    (f) An intergovernmental agreement entered into by the 9parties under this Section shall provide for the imposition or 10continuance of a user charge system in accordance with the 11acquiring West Cook Flood Prevention District's ordinance, the 12Illinois Environmental Protection Act, and the federal Clean 13Water Act.14    (g) All courts shall take judicial notice of the 15acquisition of the sanitary district being acquired or 16municipal treatment works by the West Cook Flood Prevention 17District. 18    Section 175.

The division shall be made 2so that all installments shall be equal in amount, except that 3all fractional amounts shall be added to the first installment 4to leave the remaining installments of the aggregate equal in 5amount and each a multiple of $100. The said several 6installments shall bear interest at a rate not to exceed that 7permitted for public corporation bonds under the Bond 8Authorization Act. Both principal and interest shall be 9payable, collected, and enforced as they shall become due in 10the manner provided for the levy, payment, collection and 11enforcement of such assessments and interest, as provided in 12Divisions 1 and 2 of Article 9 of the Illinois Municipal Code 13and Division 87 of Article 11 of the Illinois Municipal Code. 14    Section 185. Bonds for special assessments. If an 15ordinance regarding improvements that provides for the payment 16of the improvement by special assessment, either in whole or 17in part, then the board of trustees may issue bonds to 18anticipate the collection of the second and succeeding 19installments of said assessments payable only out of such 20assessment when collected and bearing interest at the same 21rate as provided upon the installments of such assessments. 22Said bonds shall be issued and subject to call and retirement 23in the same manner as provided in Divisions 1 and 2 of Article 249 of the Illinois Municipal Code and Division 87 of Article 11 25of the Illinois Municipal Code.   HB3703- 56 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1    Section 190.

Unless a party objects to paying the fee 11for filing a report late by timely requesting in writing a 12conference with a designee of the president, that party waives 13its right to a conference. 14    If a party requests a conference and the matter is not 15resolved at the conference, the party subject to the fee may 16request an administrative hearing before an impartial hearing 17officer appointed under subsection (d) to determine the 18party's liability for and the amount of the fee. 19    If the hearing officer finds that the late filing fees are 20owed to the district, the district shall notify the 21responsible party or parties of the hearing officer's 22decision. If payment is not made within 30 days after the 23notice, the fee shall be deemed delinquent and the district 24may impose additional penalties and interest. 25    (k) The provisions of the Administrative Review Law and 26all rules adopted pursuant to that Law apply to and govern all   HB3703- 76 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1proceedings for the judicial review of final administrative 2decisions of the board of trustees in the enforcement of any 3ordinance, rule, or regulation adopted under this Act. 4    (l) Solely in relation to the discharge of groundwater, 5surface water, sewage, stormwater, industrial wastes, or other 6wastes subject to one of the district's ordinances, the 7district may implement an electronic reporting system that 8will allow notices, orders, and other documents to be sent 9directly by email to persons or entities registered with the 10district, and, in the discretion of the district, to allow 11those persons or entities registered with the district to 12view, modify, or submit documents using the electronic 13reporting system.

Enrollment in the electronic reporting 19system in this subsection is voluntary and limited to 20nonresidential facilities or uses. Service by email under this 21Section is only permitted on those persons or entities that 22voluntarily enroll in the system. The district shall adopt 23rules, as approved by ordinance, to ensure service of process 24by email is properly effectuated upon the registered persons 25and entities.   HB3703- 77 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1    Section 240.

The district may make agreements with 2a county or municipality for holding such persons in a 3facility operated by them for the incarceration of violators 4of ordinances or resolutions. 5    Section 40. Powers of the board of trustees. The board of 6trustees of the district may provide for the efficient 7drainage of storm and sewer waters within the district and 8save and preserve the water supplied to the inhabitants of the 9district from contamination. For that purpose, the board may 10construct and maintain an enclosed conduit or conduits, main 11pipes, wholly or partially submerged, buried or otherwise, and 12by means of pumps or otherwise cause such sewage or stormwater 13to flow or to be forced through such conduit or conduits, pipe 14or pipes to and into any ditch or canal constructed and 15operated by any other district, after having first acquired 16the right so to do. Such board may provide for the drainage of 17the district by laying out, establishing, constructing, and 18maintaining one or more channels, drains, ditches, and outlets 19for carrying off and disposing of the drainage, including the 20sewage, of the district, together with such adjuncts and 21additions thereto as may be necessary or proper to cause such 22channels or outlets to accomplish the end for which they are 23designed, in a satisfactory manner, including pumps and 24pumping stations and the operation of the same. Such board may 25provide suitable and modernly equipped sewage treatment works   HB3703- 11 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1or plants for the separation and treatment of all solids and 2deleterious matter from the liquids, shall treat and purify 3the residue of such sewage so that when it flows into any lake, 4and may not injuriously contaminate the waters thereof. The 5board may adopt any feasible method to accomplish the object 6for which the district was created and may also provide means 7whereby the district may reach and procure supplies of water 8for diluting and flushing purposes. The board of trustees of 9the district may also enter into an agreement to sell, convey, 10or disburse treated wastewater to any public or private entity 11located within or outside the boundaries of the district. Any 12use of treated wastewater by a public or private entity is 13subject to the orders of the Pollution Control Board. The 14agreement may not exceed 20 years.15    Nothing in this Section may be construed to empower, 16authorize, or require such board of trustees to operate a 17system of water works for the purpose of furnishing or 18delivering water to any such municipality or to the 19inhabitants of the municipality without payment for the water 20at such rates as the board may determine. Nothing in this Act 21shall require a district to extend service to any individual 22residence or other building within the district, and it is the 23intent of the General Assembly that any construction or 24funding contemplated by this Section shall be restricted to 25construction or funding of works and main or interceptor 26sewers, conduits, channels, and similar facilities, but not   HB3703- 12 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1individual service lines. Nothing in this Act authorizes the 2trustees to flow the stormwater or sewage of the district into 3Lake Michigan. Any such plan for sewage disposal by the 4district is prohibited unless such sewage has been treated and 5purified as provided in this Section, all laws of the federal 6government relating to the pollution of navigable waters have 7been complied with, and the approval of plans and 8constructions of outlets and connection with any of the 9streams or navigable bodies of water within or bordering upon 10the State has been obtained from the Department of Natural 11Resources. The discharge of any sewage from the district into 12any of the streams or navigable bodies of water within or 13bordering upon the State is subject to the orders of the 14Pollution Control Board. Nothing in this Act may be construed 15as superseding or in any manner limiting the provisions of the 16Environmental Protection Act.17    After the construction of such a sewage disposal plant, if 18the board finds that it will promote the prevention of 19pollution of waters of the State, such board of trustees may 20adopt ordinances or rules and regulations prohibiting or 21regulating the discharge to sewers of inadmissible wastes or 22substances toxic to biological wastewater treatment processes. 23Inadmissible wastes include those that create a fire or 24explosion hazard in the sewer or treatment works; those that 25will impair the hydraulic capacity of sewer systems; and those 26that, in any quantity, create a hazard to people, sewer   HB3703- 13 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1systems, treatment processes, or receiving waters. Substances 2that may be toxic to wastewater treatment processes include 3copper, chromium, lead, zinc, arsenic, nickel, barium, 4cadmium, mercury, selenium, silver, and any poisonous 5compounds, such as cyanide or radioactive wastes that pass 6through wastewater treatment plants in hazardous 7concentrations and menace users of the receiving waters. Such 8ordinances or rules and regulations shall be effective 9throughout the district in both the incorporated areas as well 10as the unincorporated areas and all public sewers therein. 11    Section 45.

Connection to district sewage system. The 2board of trustees of the district may require that, before a 3person or municipal corporation connects to the sewage system 4of the district, the district be permitted to inspect the 5drainage lines of the person or municipal corporation to 6determine whether they are adequate and suitable for 7connection to its sewage system.

Funds collected 10as inspection charges shall be used by the district for its 11general corporate purposes after payment of the costs of 12making the inspection. 13    Section 70. Sewage and stormwater agreements. The 14district, in addition to other powers vested in it, may enter 15into agreements with a municipality located partly within and 16partly without the territorial limits of the district and that 17has a sewage system or stormwater drainage system to receive 18and dispose of all sewage or stormwater of such municipality 19collected by its system; and, for such purpose, the district 20may extend its drains, ditches, or sewers to connect with the 21sewage or stormwater drainage system of such municipality. 22    Section 75. Fees and charges for disposal of surface water 23or groundwater. The board of trustees may, by ordinance, 24establish, revise, and maintain fees or charges for the   HB3703- 20 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1disposal of surface water or groundwater. Such fees and 2charges shall be assessed to the municipality or other 3governmental unit which utilizes the Town of Cicero sewer 4system or any sewer or drainage systems owned or operated by 5the district. The district shall assess such fees and charges 6on a quarterly basis. 7    Such fees or charges may be based on the volume of 8groundwater, surface water, or stormwater originating from a 9municipality or other unit of local government that enters the 10Town of Cicero sewer system or any system for the disposal of 11such waters or sewage owned or operated by the district. The 12district shall set such fees or charges by ordinance. The 13failure of a municipality or other governmental unit to pay 14such fees or charges within 60 days may result in 15disconnection from the Town of Cicero sewer system or any 16sewer or drainage systems owned or operated by the district in 17accordance with Section 80. 18    Section 80.

The hearing officer shall issue findings of 8    fact, conclusions of law, recommendations for a civil 9    penalty, and issue an order based solely on the record. 10    The hearing officer may also recommend, as part of the 11    order, that the discharge of surface water, groundwater, 12    stormwater, effluent, gaseous wastes, sewage, industrial 13    wastes, or other wastes be discontinued within a specified 14    time.15        (6) The findings of fact, conclusions of law, 16    recommended civil penalty, and order shall be transmitted 17    to the board of trustees along with a complete record of 18    the hearing.19        (7) The board of trustees shall either approve or 20    disapprove the findings of fact, conclusions of law, 21    recommended civil penalty, and order. If the findings of 22    fact, conclusions of law, recommended civil penalty, or 23    order are rejected, the board of trustees shall remand the 24    matter to the hearing officer for further proceedings. If 25    the order is accepted by the board of trustees, it shall 26    constitute the final order of the board of trustees.  HB3703- 26 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1        (8) The civil penalty specified by the board of 2    trustees shall be paid within 35 days after the party on 3    whom it is imposed receives a written copy of the order of 4    the board of trustees unless the person or persons to whom 5    the order is issued seeks judicial review.6        (9) If a party seeks judicial review of the order 7    assessing civil penalties, the party shall, within 35 days 8    after the date of the final order, pay the amount of the 9    civil penalties into an escrow account maintained by the 10    district for that purpose or file a bond guaranteeing 11    payment of the civil penalties if the civil penalties are 12    upheld on review.13        (10) Civil penalties not paid by the times specified 14    above shall be delinquent and subject to late fees 15    assessed on a monthly basis which shall not exceed the 16    maximum interest rate allowed under State law. The late 17    fees levied by the district shall be in addition to any 18    other remedy or right of recovery that the district may 19    have with respect to the collection or recovery of 20    penalties and charges imposed by the district. 21    (e) The president may order a party to cease the discharge 22of surface water, groundwater, stormwater, effluent, gaseous 23wastes, sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes upon a 24finding by the president that the final order of the board of 25trustees entered after a hearing to show cause has been 26violated. The president shall serve the party with a copy of   HB3703- 27 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1the president's order either by certified mail or personally 2by serving the owner, officer, or registered agent of the 3municipality or other unit of local government. The order of 4the president shall also schedule an expedited hearing before 5a hearing officer designated by the board of trustees for the 6purpose of determining whether the party has violated the 7final order of the board of trustees. The board of trustees 8shall adopt rules of procedure governing expedited hearings. 9The hearing may not be conducted less than 7 days after service 10of the president's order.11    At the conclusion of the expedited hearing, the hearing 12officer shall prepare a report with the officer's findings and 13recommendations and transmit it to the board of trustees. If 14the board of trustees, after reviewing the findings and 15recommendations, and the record produced at the hearing, 16determines that the party has violated the board of trustees' 17final order, the board of trustees may authorize the plugging 18or disconnection of the sewer or other actions that disconnect 19the offending party's ability to discharge any waters or 20wastes into the district's sewer system. The president shall 21give not less than 10 days' written notice of the board of 22trustees' order to the municipality or other unit of local 23government as well as the owner of record of the real estate 24and other parties known to be affected that the sewer will be 25plugged or disconnected.26    Disconnection of a sewer under this subsection shall be in   HB3703- 28 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1addition to any other remedy that the district may have to 2prevent violation of its ordinances and orders of its board of 3trustees.4    (f) A violation of the final order of the board of trustees 5shall be considered a nuisance. If any person discharges 6groundwater, surface water, stormwater, effluent, gaseous 7wastes, sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes into any 8sewers or stormwater management facilities contrary to the 9final order of the board of trustees, the district, acting 10through the president, may commence an action or proceeding in 11the Circuit Court of Cook County for the purpose of having the 12discharge stopped either by mandamus or injunction or to 13remedy the violation in any manner provided for in this 14Section.15    The court shall specify a time, not exceeding 20 days 16after the service of the copy of the complaint, in which the 17party complained of must plead to the complaint, and, in the 18meantime, the party may be restrained. In case of default or 19after pleading, the court shall immediately inquire into the 20facts and circumstances of the case and enter an appropriate 21judgment in respect to the matters complained of. Appeals may 22be taken as in other civil cases.23    (g) The district, acting through the president, may 24commence an action or proceeding for mandamus or injunction in 25the Circuit Court of Cook County ordering a party to cease its 26discharge, when, in the opinion of the president, the party's   HB3703- 29 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1discharge presents an imminent danger to the public health, 2welfare, or safety; presents or may present an endangerment to 3the environment; or threatens to interfere with the operation 4of the sewerage system under the jurisdiction of the district. 5The initiation of a show cause hearing is not a prerequisite to 6the commencement by the district of an action or proceeding 7for mandamus or injunction in the circuit court. The court 8shall specify a time, not exceeding 20 days after the service 9of a copy of the petition, in which the party complained of 10must answer the petition, and, in the meantime, the party may 11be restrained. In case of default in answer or after answer, 12the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and 13circumstances of the case and enter an appropriate judgment 14order in respect to the matters complained of. An appeal may be 15taken from the final judgment in the same manner and with the 16same effect as appeals are taken from judgment of the circuit 17court in other actions for mandamus or injunction.18    (h) Whenever the district commences an action under 19subsection (f), the court shall assess a civil penalty of not 20less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000 for each day the party 21violates the board of trustees' order. Whenever the district 22commences an action under subsection (g), the court shall 23assess a civil penalty of not less than $1,000 nor more than 24$10,000 for each day the party violates the ordinance. Each 25day's continuance of the violation is a separate offense. The 26penalties provided in this Section imposed by the board of   HB3703- 30 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1trustees under subsection (d) plus interest at the rate set 2forth in the Interest Act on unpaid penalties, costs, and 3fees; the reasonable costs to the district of removal or other 4remedial action caused by discharges in violation of this Act; 5reasonable attorney's fees; court costs; other expenses of 6litigation; and costs for inspection, sampling, analysis, and 7administration related to the enforcement action against the 8offending party are recoverable by the district in a civil 9action.10    (i) The board of trustees may establish fees for late 11filing of reports with the district required by an ordinance 12governing discharges. The district shall provide by certified 13mail a written notice of the fee assessment that states the 14party has 30 days after the receipt of the notice to request a 15conference with the president's designee to discuss or dispute 16the appropriateness of the assessed fee. Unless a party 17objects to paying the fee for filing a report late by timely 18requesting in writing a conference with a designee of the 19president, that party waives the party's right to a 20conference.21    If a party requests a conference and the matter is not 22resolved at the conference, the party subject to the fee may 23request an administrative hearing before an impartial hearing 24officer appointed under subsection (d) to determine the 25party's liability for and the amount of the fee. If the hearing 26officer finds that the late filing fees are owed to the   HB3703- 31 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1district, the district shall notify the responsible party of 2the hearing officer's decision. If payment is not made within 330 days after the notice, the district may impose penalties 4and interest.5    (j) To be effective service under this Section, a demand 6or order sent by certified or registered mail to the last known 7address need not be received by the offending party. Service 8of the demand or order by registered or certified mail shall be 9deemed effective upon deposit in the United States mail with 10proper postage prepaid and addressed as provided in this 11Section.12    (k) The Administrative Review Law applies to and governs 13all proceedings for the judicial review of final 14administrative decisions of the board of trustees in the 15enforcement of an ordinance, rule, or regulation adopted under 16this Act. The cost of preparing the record on appeal shall be 17paid by the person seeking a review of an order or action 18pursuant to the Administrative Review Law.19    (l) Solely in relation to the discharge of groundwater, 20surface water, stormwater, sewage, industrial wastes, or other 21wastes subject to one of the district's ordinances, the 22district may implement an electronic reporting system that 23will allow notices, orders, and other documents to be sent 24directly by email to persons or entities registered with the 25district, and, in the discretion of the district, to allow 26those persons or entities registered with the district to   HB3703- 32 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1view, modify, or submit documents using the electronic 2reporting system. Wherever this Section provides for service 3of documents by the district by U.S. first-class mail, U.S. 4certified mail, or personal service, the district may serve by 5email the documents upon the registered persons or entities in 6lieu of service by U.S. first-class mail, U.S. certified mail, 7or personal service. Enrollment in the electronic reporting 8system in this subsection is voluntary and limited to 9nonresidential facilities or uses. Service by email under this 10Section is only permitted on those persons or entities that 11voluntarily enroll in the system. The district shall adopt 12rules, as approved by ordinance, to ensure service of process 13by email is properly effectuated upon the registered persons 14and entities. 15    Section 85. Acquisition of real and personal property. The 16district may acquire by purchase, condemnation, or otherwise 17any and all real and personal property, right-of-way and 18privilege, either within or without its corporate limits that 19may be required for its corporate purposes; and, if the 20district is unable to agree with any other district or 21municipality upon the terms under which it shall be permitted 22to use the drains, channels or ditches of such other district, 23the right to use the same may be required by condemnation in 24the circuit court by proceedings in the manner, as near as may 25be, as is provided in Section 4-17 of the Illinois Drainage   HB3703- 33 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1Code. The compensation to be paid for such use may be a gross 2sum, or it may be in the form of an annual rental, to be paid 3in yearly installments as and in the manner provided by the 4judgment of the court wherein such proceedings may be had. All 5moneys for the purchase and condemnation of any property shall 6be paid before possession is taken or any work done on the 7premises damaged by the construction of such channel or 8outlet, and, if an appeal from the circuit court is taken by 9either party whereby the amount of damages is not finally 10determined, then possession may be taken. The amount of 11judgment in such court shall be deposited at some bank or 12savings and loan association to be designated by the judge 13thereof subject to the payment of such damages on orders 14signed by such judge, whenever the amount of damages is 15finally determined; and when no longer required for such 16purposes, to sell, convey, vacate and release the same. 17    Section 90. Eminent domain. Notwithstanding any other 18provision of this Act, any power granted under this Act to 19acquire property by condemnation or eminent domain is subject 20to, and shall be exercised in accordance with, the Eminent 21Domain Act. 22    Section 95. Lease of property. The district may lease to 23others for any period of time, not exceeding 50 years, upon 24such terms as its board of trustees may determine, real   HB3703- 34 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1estate, rights-of-way, privilege, or interest therein, or any 2part thereof, acquired by it that is, in the opinion of the 3board of trustees of the district, no longer required for its 4corporate purposes or that may not be immediately needed for 5such purposes, and such leases may contain such conditions and 6retain such interests therein as may be deemed for the best 7interest of the district by such board of trustees. The 8district may grant easements and permits for the use of any 9such real property, right-of-way, or privilege that will not, 10in the opinion of the board of trustees of the district, 11interfere with the use thereof by the district for its 12corporate purposes, and such easements and permits may contain 13such conditions and retain such interests therein as may be 14deemed for the best interests of the district by such board of 15trustees. 16    Section 100. Borrowing money; issuance of bonds. The 17district may borrow money for corporate purposes and may issue 18bonds therefor but may not become indebted, in any manner, or 19for any purpose, to an amount in the aggregate to exceed 5.75% 20on the valuation of taxable property therein, to be 21ascertained by the last assessment for State and county taxes 22previous to the incurring of such. 23    Whenever the board of trustees of the district desires to 24issue bonds hereunder they shall certify the question to the 25proper election officials who shall submit the question at an   HB3703- 35 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1election to be held in the district in accordance with the 2general election law. In addition to the requirements of the 3general election law, the notice of election shall state the 4amount of bonds to be issued.

Except as otherwise provided in 19this Section, all contracts for purchases or sales by the 20district, the expense of which will exceed the mandatory 21competitive bid threshold, shall be let to the lowest 22responsible bidder therefor upon not less than 14 days' public 23notice of the terms and conditions upon which the contract is 24to be let, having been given by publication in a newspaper of   HB3703- 40 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1general circulation published in the district, and the board 2may reject any and all bids and readvertise. In determining 3the lowest responsible bidder, the board shall take into 4consideration the qualities and serviceability of the articles 5supplied, their conformity with specifications, their 6suitability to the requirements of the district, the 7availability of support services, the uniqueness of the 8service, materials, equipment, or supplies as it applies to 9network integrated computer systems, the compatibility of the 10service, materials, equipment or supplies with existing 11equipment, and the delivery terms. Contracts for services in 12excess of the mandatory competitive bid threshold may, subject 13to the provisions of this Section, be let by competitive 14bidding at the discretion of the district board of trustees.15    All contracts for purchases or sales that will not exceed 16the mandatory competitive bid threshold may be made in the 17open market without publication in a newspaper as provided in 18this Section, but, whenever practical, shall be based on at 19least 3 competitive bids. The mandatory competitive bid 20threshold dollar amount may not be less than $10,000 nor more 21than $40,000.22    Cash, a cashier's check, a certified check, or a bid bond 23with adequate surety approved by the board of trustees as a 24deposit of good faith, in a reasonable amount, but not in 25excess of 10% of the contract amount, may be required of each 26bidder by the district on all bids involving amounts in excess   HB3703- 41 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1of the mandatory competitive bid threshold and, if so 2required, the advertisement for bids shall so specify.3    Contracts that by their nature are not adapted to award by 4competitive bidding, including, without limitation, contracts 5for the services of individuals, groups, or firms possessing a 6high degree of professional skill where the ability or fitness 7of the individual or organization plays an important part, 8contracts for financial management services undertaken 9pursuant to the Public Funds Investment Act, contracts for the 10purchase or sale of utilities, contracts for commodities 11including supply contracts for natural gas and electricity, 12contracts for materials economically procurable only from a 13single source of supply, contracts for services, supplies, 14materials, parts, or equipment that are available only from a 15single source, contracts for maintenance, repairs, original 16equipment manufacturer supplies, or original equipment 17manufacturer parts from the manufacturer or from a source 18authorized by the manufacturer, contracts for the use, 19purchase, delivery, movement, or installation of data 20processing equipment, software, or services and 21telecommunications and interconnect equipment, software, or 22services, contracts for duplicating machines and supplies, 23contracts for goods or services procured from another 24governmental agency, purchases of equipment previously owned 25by an entity other than the district itself, purchases of used 26equipment, purchases at auction or similar transactions that   HB3703- 42 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1by their very nature are not suitable to competitive bids, and 2leases of real property where the district is the lessee may 3not be subject to the competitive bidding requirements of this 4Section.5    The district may use a design-build procurement method for 6a public project that is not subject to the competitive 7bidding requirements of this Section provided the board of 8trustees approves the contract for the public project by a 9vote of at least 5 trustees. As used in this paragraph, 10"design-build" means a delivery system that provides 11responsibility within a single contract for the furnishing of 12architecture, engineering, land surveying and related services 13as required and the labor, materials, equipment, and other 14construction services for the project.15    If an emergency is affecting the public health or safety 16as declared by the board of trustees of the district at a 17meeting thereof duly convened, then the declaration shall 18require the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the board of 19trustees and shall set forth the nature of the danger to the 20public health or safety, contracts totaling not more than the 21emergency contract cap may be let to the extent necessary to 22resolve such emergency without public advertisement or 23competitive bidding. Under this Section, an emergency contract 24may not be more than $500,000. The resolution or ordinance in 25which such declaration is embodied shall fix the date upon 26which such emergency shall terminate, and the date may be   HB3703- 43 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1extended or abridged by the board of trustees as in their 2judgment the circumstances require.

The board of trustees must be notified of the 16operating emergency. A full, written account of each operating 17emergency and a requisition for the materials, supplies, 18equipment, and services required to meet the operating 19emergency must be immediately submitted by the officials or 20employees authorized to make purchases to the board of 21trustees. The account must be available for public inspection 22for a period of at least one year after the date of the 23operating emergency purchase. The exercise of authority with 24respect to purchases for a bona fide operating emergency is 25not dependent on a declaration of an operating emergency by 26the board of trustees.  HB3703- 44 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1    The competitive bidding requirements of this Section do 2not apply to contracts, including contracts for both materials 3and services incidental thereto, for the repair or replacement 4of a district's treatment plant, sewers, equipment, or 5facilities damaged or destroyed as the result of a sudden or 6unexpected occurrence, including, but not limited to, a flood, 7fire, tornado, earthquake, storm, or other natural or man-made 8disaster, if the board of trustees determines in writing that 9the awarding of those contracts without competitive bidding is 10reasonably necessary for the district to maintain compliance 11with a permit issued under the National Pollution Discharge 12Elimination System or any successor system or with any 13outstanding order relating to that compliance issued by the 14United States Environmental Protection Agency, the Illinois 15Environmental Protection Agency, or the Pollution Control 16Board. The authority to issue contracts without competitive 17bidding pursuant to this paragraph expires 6 months after the 18date of the writing determining that the awarding of contracts 19without competitive bidding is reasonably necessary.20    A trustee may not be interested, directly or indirectly, 21in any contract, work, or business of the district or in the 22sale of any article, whenever the expense, price or 23consideration of the contract work, business, or sale is paid 24either from the treasury or by an assessment levied by statute 25or ordinance. A trustee may not be interested, directly or 26indirectly, in the purchase of any property that belongs to   HB3703- 45 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1the district, is sold for taxes or assessments of the 2district, or is sold by virtue of legal process by suit of the 3district.4    A contract for any work or other public improvement, to be 5paid for in whole or in part by special assessment or special 6taxation, shall be entered into and the performance thereof 7controlled by the provisions of Division 2 of Article 9 of the 8Illinois Municipal Code as near as may be. However, contracts 9may be let for making proper and suitable connections between 10the mains and outlets of the respective sanitary sewers in the 11district with any conduit, conduits, main pipe or pipes that 12may be constructed by the district.13    As used in this Section, "mandatory competitive bid 14threshold" means a dollar amount equal to 0.1% of the total 15general fixed assets of the district as reported in the most 16recent required audit report. 17    Section 120. Local Government Prompt Payment Act. 18Purchases made pursuant to this Act shall be made in 19compliance with the Local Government Prompt Payment Act. 20    Section 125. Effects on competition. All powers granted, 21either expressly or by necessary implication, by this Act or 22any other Illinois statute to the district may be exercised by 23the district notwithstanding effects on competition.

The extent and location of the lands and 18waters so to be used and appropriated shall be approved by the 19Governor, upon application duly made to the Governor asking 20for such approval. The rights, permission, and authority 21hereby granted shall be subject to all public right of 22commerce and navigation, to the authority of the United States 23in behalf of such public rights, and to the right of the State 24of Illinois to regulate and control fishing in said public   HB3703- 47 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1waters. 2    Section 140. United States military installations. If 3there is located within the bounds of the district a United 4States military post, reservation, station, or naval station, 5the board of trustees of the district may enter into contracts 6or agreements with the proper authorities of the United States 7permitting them to connect with any such conduit or conduits, 8main pipe or pipes, and discharge the drainage, sewage, or 9other impure or contaminated liquids therein. 10    Section 145. District improvements causing private 11property damage or takings. Whenever the board of trustees of 12the district shall pass an ordinance for the making of any 13improvement that the district may make, the making of which 14will require that private property should be taken or damaged, 15the district may cause compensation therefor to be 16ascertained, and condemn and acquire possession thereof in the 17same manner as nearly as may be as is provided for the exercise 18of the right of eminent domain under the Eminent Domain Act. 19Proceedings to ascertain the compensation to be paid for 20taking or damaging private property shall, in all cases, be 21instituted in the county where the property sought to be taken 22or damaged is situated. All damages to property, whether 23determined by agreement or by final judgment of court, shall 24be paid prior to the payment of any other debt or obligation.   HB3703- 48 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1    Section 150. Rights-of-way over other property for 2improvements. When, in making any improvements that the 3district is authorized by this Act to make, it shall be 4necessary to enter upon and take possession of any existing 5drains, sewers, sewer outlets, plants for the purification of 6sewage or water, or any other public property, or property 7held for public use, the board of trustees of the district may 8do so and may acquire the necessary right-of-way over any 9other property held for public use in the same manner as is 10herein provided for acquiring private property, and may enter 11upon, and use the same for the purposes aforesaid.

If the rates are 16not thereafter agreed upon by the parties or are not otherwise 17provided for by contract, such rates shall be fixed and 18determined by the Circuit Court of Cook County after a 19petition has been filed with that court. 20    Section 170. Acquiring sanitary district or municipal 21treatment works. 22    (a) After incorporation, the West Cook Flood Prevention 23District may, in accordance with this Act and an 24intergovernmental agreement with a sanitary district or   HB3703- 50 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1municipality, acquire or lease the sewage and stormwater 2systems, as well as territory, treatment works, lines, 3appurtenances, and other property of (i) a sanitary district 4organized under the Sanitary District Act of 1907, the 5Sanitary District Act of 1917, the Sanitary District Act of 61936 or (ii) a municipality whose treatment works were 7established under the Illinois Municipal Code or the Municipal 8Wastewater Disposal Zones Act, regardless of whether that 9district or municipality is contiguous to the West Cook Flood 10Prevention District. The distance between the sanitary 11district being acquired or the municipality and the West Cook 12Flood Prevention District, as measured between the points on 13their corporate boundaries that are nearest to each other, may 14not exceed 20 miles. In the case of a municipality, only that 15property used by the municipality for transport, treatment, 16and discharge of stormwater or wastewater or for disposal of 17sewage sludge may be transferred to the West Cook Flood 18Prevention District.19    (b) The board of trustees of the sanitary district being 20acquired, or the corporate authorities of a municipality whose 21treatment works is being acquired, shall, jointly with the 22board of trustees of the West Cook Flood Prevention District, 23petition the Circuit Court of Cook County to permit the 24acquisition. The petition shall show the following:25        (1) The reason for the acquisition.26        (2) That there are no debts of the sanitary district   HB3703- 51 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1    being acquired or municipality outstanding or that there 2    are sufficient funds on hand or available to satisfy those 3    debts.4        (3) That no contract or federal or State permit or 5    grant will be impaired by the acquisition.6        (4) That all assets and responsibilities of the 7    sanitary district being acquired or municipality, as they 8    relate to wastewater treatment, have been properly 9    assigned to the acquiring district.10        (5) That the West Cook Flood Prevention District will 11    pay any court costs incurred in connection with the 12    petition.13        (6) The boundaries of the acquired sanitary district 14    or municipality as of the date of the petition.15    (c) Upon adequate notice, including appropriate notice to 16the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, the circuit 17court shall hold a hearing to determine whether there is good 18cause for the acquisition by the acquiring district and 19whether the allegations of the petition are true. If the court 20finds that there is good cause and that the allegations are 21true, it shall order the acquisition to proceed. If the court 22finds that there is not good cause for the acquisition or that 23the allegations of the petition are not true, the court shall 24dismiss the petition. In either event, the costs shall be 25taxed against the acquiring district. The order shall be 26final. Separate or joint appeals may be taken by any party   HB3703- 52 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1affected by the order as in other civil cases.2    (d) If the court orders the acquisition contemplated in 3the petition, there shall be no further appointments of 4trustees if the acquired agency is a sanitary district. The 5trustees of the acquired sanitary district acting at the time 6of the order shall close up the business affairs of the 7sanitary district and make the necessary conveyances of title 8to the sanitary district property in accordance with the 9intergovernmental agreement between the acquiring and acquired 10sanitary districts.

The 25general obligation indebtedness of the acquired sanitary 26district shall be paid from the proceeds of continuing taxes   HB3703- 53 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1and special assessments as provided in this Act.2    All money remaining after the business affairs of the 3acquired sanitary district or acquired treatment works of the 4municipality have been closed up and all debts and obligations 5of the entities paid shall be paid to the West Cook Flood 6Prevention District in accordance with the intergovernmental 7agreement between the parties.8    (f) An intergovernmental agreement entered into by the 9parties under this Section shall provide for the imposition or 10continuance of a user charge system in accordance with the 11acquiring West Cook Flood Prevention District's ordinance, the 12Illinois Environmental Protection Act, and the federal Clean 13Water Act.14    (g) All courts shall take judicial notice of the 15acquisition of the sanitary district being acquired or 16municipal treatment works by the West Cook Flood Prevention 17District. 18    Section 175.

The functions and duties of the city council, 11the council, the board of trustees, or the board of local 12improvements under those provisions of the Illinois Municipal 13Code shall be assumed and discharged by the board of trustees 14of the district; and the duties of the officers designated in 15those divisions of the Illinois Municipal Code as mayor of a 16city, president of a village or incorporated town, or 17president of the board of local improvements shall be assumed 18and discharged by the president of the board of trustees of the 19district. The duties of other municipal officers designated in 20those provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code shall be 21performed by similar officers of the district. 22    Section 180. Special assessment procedures. When any 23special assessment is made under this Act, the ordinance 24authorizing such assessment may provide that the entire 25assessment and each individual assessment be divided into not   HB3703- 55 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1more than 20 annual installments. The division shall be made 2so that all installments shall be equal in amount, except that 3all fractional amounts shall be added to the first installment 4to leave the remaining installments of the aggregate equal in 5amount and each a multiple of $100. The said several 6installments shall bear interest at a rate not to exceed that 7permitted for public corporation bonds under the Bond 8Authorization Act. Both principal and interest shall be 9payable, collected, and enforced as they shall become due in 10the manner provided for the levy, payment, collection and 11enforcement of such assessments and interest, as provided in 12Divisions 1 and 2 of Article 9 of the Illinois Municipal Code 13and Division 87 of Article 11 of the Illinois Municipal Code. 14    Section 185. Bonds for special assessments. If an 15ordinance regarding improvements that provides for the payment 16of the improvement by special assessment, either in whole or 17in part, then the board of trustees may issue bonds to 18anticipate the collection of the second and succeeding 19installments of said assessments payable only out of such 20assessment when collected and bearing interest at the same 21rate as provided upon the installments of such assessments. 22Said bonds shall be issued and subject to call and retirement 23in the same manner as provided in Divisions 1 and 2 of Article 249 of the Illinois Municipal Code and Division 87 of Article 11 25of the Illinois Municipal Code.   HB3703- 56 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1    Section 190.

Addition of contiguous territory. Additional 11contiguous territory may be added to the district in the 12following manner:13    10% or more of the legal voters residing within the limits 14of such proposed addition to the district may petition the 15Circuit Court of Cook County to cause the question to be 16submitted to the legal voters of such proposed additional 17territory whether such proposed additional territory shall 18become a part of the district and whether such additional 19territory and the taxpayers thereof shall assume a 20proportionate share of the bonded indebtedness, if any, of the 21district. Such petition shall be addressed to the court and 22shall contain a definite description of the boundaries of the 23territory sought to be added.

In case of 3default in answer or after answer, the court shall immediately 4inquire into the facts and circumstances of the case and enter 5an appropriate judgment order in respect to the matters 6complained of. An appeal may be taken from the final judgment 7in the same manner and with the same effect as appeals are 8taken from judgment of the circuit court in other actions for 9mandamus or injunction. 10    (i) Whenever the district commences an action under 11subsection (f), the court shall assess a civil penalty of not 12less than $1,000 nor more than $10,000 for each day the party 13violates a board order.

Unless a party objects to paying the fee 11for filing a report late by timely requesting in writing a 12conference with a designee of the president, that party waives 13its right to a conference. 14    If a party requests a conference and the matter is not 15resolved at the conference, the party subject to the fee may 16request an administrative hearing before an impartial hearing 17officer appointed under subsection (d) to determine the 18party's liability for and the amount of the fee. 19    If the hearing officer finds that the late filing fees are 20owed to the district, the district shall notify the 21responsible party or parties of the hearing officer's 22decision. If payment is not made within 30 days after the 23notice, the fee shall be deemed delinquent and the district 24may impose additional penalties and interest. 25    (k) The provisions of the Administrative Review Law and 26all rules adopted pursuant to that Law apply to and govern all   HB3703- 76 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1proceedings for the judicial review of final administrative 2decisions of the board of trustees in the enforcement of any 3ordinance, rule, or regulation adopted under this Act. 4    (l) Solely in relation to the discharge of groundwater, 5surface water, sewage, stormwater, industrial wastes, or other 6wastes subject to one of the district's ordinances, the 7district may implement an electronic reporting system that 8will allow notices, orders, and other documents to be sent 9directly by email to persons or entities registered with the 10district, and, in the discretion of the district, to allow 11those persons or entities registered with the district to 12view, modify, or submit documents using the electronic 13reporting system.

Enrollment in the electronic reporting 19system in this subsection is voluntary and limited to 20nonresidential facilities or uses. Service by email under this 21Section is only permitted on those persons or entities that 22voluntarily enroll in the system. The district shall adopt 23rules, as approved by ordinance, to ensure service of process 24by email is properly effectuated upon the registered persons 25and entities.   HB3703- 77 -LRB104 11173 JRC 21255 b1    Section 240.
