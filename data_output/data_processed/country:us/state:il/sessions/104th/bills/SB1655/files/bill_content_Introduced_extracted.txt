The Juvenile Court Act of 1987 is amended by 5adding Part 5A to Article V as follows: 6    (705 ILCS 405/Art. V Pt. 5A heading new)7PART 5A. FITNESS TO STAND TRIAL 8    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-101 new)9    Sec. 5-5A-101. Purpose. 10    (a) This Part recognizes that minors are substantially 11different from adults and therefore creates procedures to 12establish fitness to stand trial that accommodate these 13differences. Currently in Illinois, children of any age can be 14arrested, charged, and prosecuted. This approach is 15inconsistent with developmental science, which overwhelmingly 16finds that children are limited in their ability to understand 17the consequences of their actions, manage impulses and peer 18influence to plan for the future. Modern neuroscience explains 19both limitations on culpability for minors, defined as an 20individual's blameworthiness or responsibility for a criminal 21action, as well as limitations on the ability to assist with 22and make critical decisions regarding one's own legal defense.   SB1655- 2 -LRB104 09387 RLC 19446 b1Accordingly, prosecutors, defense counsel, and courts must 2carefully consider chronological immaturity, relative 3immaturity, and the impact of trauma, as well as other 4relevant factors, in considering the fitness of a minor to be 5tried, adjudicated or convicted, and sentenced. These factors 6should be given significant weight when determining the 7fitness of a child under the age of 14.8    (b) This Part is intended to support minors through 9practices that are trauma-informed and that protect minor's 10rights and dignity; questions of interpretation shall be 11resolved in line with these practices. This Part recognizes 12that the ability to understand charges and to participate 13meaningfully in one's own defense evolve gradually throughout 14childhood and early adulthood and that each minor deserves 15developmentally appropriate responses that reflect the best 16understanding of the minor's current abilities. 17    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-105 new)18    Sec. 5-5A-105. Definitions. In this Part:19    "Child traumatic stress" means exposure to one or more 20traumatic events over the course of a minor's life that 21results in that minor developing reactions that persist and 22that interfere with the minor's functional, social, adaptive, 23or intellectual ability.24    "Chronological immaturity" means a lack of functional, 25social, adaptive, or intellectual ability due to chronological   SB1655- 3 -LRB104 09387 RLC 19446 b1age.2    "Developmental disability" means a disability that is 3attributable to an intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, 4epilepsy, autism, a learning disability, or any other 5condition that results in impaired functional, social, 6adaptive, or intellectual ability.7    "Mental illness" means a mental or emotional disorder that 8substantially impairs a person's thought, perception of 9reality, emotional process, judgment, behavior, or ability to 10cope with the ordinary demands of life.11    "Minor" has the meaning given to that term in Section 1-3 12of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.13    "Relative immaturity" means a lack of functional, social, 14adaptive, or intellectual ability when a minor is compared to 15other minors of the same chronological age.16    "Substance use disorder" has the meaning given to that 17term in Section 1-10 of the Substance Use Disorder Act. 18    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-110 new)19    Sec. 5-5A-110. Unfitness standard. Unfitness may result 20from the presence of any condition or confluence of 21conditions, including, but not limited to, physical condition, 22mental illness, substance use disorder, developmental 23disability, chronological immaturity, relative immaturity, or 24child traumatic stress. A diagnosis is not required for a 25finding of unfitness. A minor is unfit when the minor either:  SB1655- 4 -LRB104 09387 RLC 19446 b1        (1) lacks sufficient present ability to consult with 2    the minor's attorney with a reasonable degree of rational 3    understanding, as evidenced by lacking the ability to 4    disclose to the attorney facts pertinent to the 5    proceedings at issue and to assist in the minor's defense; 6    or7        (2) is unable to understand the proceedings against 8    the minor, as demonstrated by, but not limited to, one or 9    more of the following:10            (A) a lack of ability to identify who the 11        participants are and understand their roles, including 12        the judge, minor's attorney, State's Attorney, or 13        qualified expert;14            (B) a lack of understanding of the range of 15        possible dispositions that may be imposed in the 16        proceedings; or17            (C) a lack of ability to use the factual 18        understandings and factors in (A) and (B) of this 19        paragraph to make rational decisions. 20    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-115 new)21    Sec. 5-5A-115. Raising the issue of unfitness.22    (a) The issue of the minor's fitness to stand trial, to 23plead, or to be sentenced may be raised by the minor's 24attorney, the State, or the court at any time before a plea is 25entered or before, during, or after trial. If the issue of   SB1655- 5 -LRB104 09387 RLC 19446 b1fitness is raised by the State, the State has the burden of 2proving a bona fide doubt of the minor's fitness has been 3raised. If the issue of fitness is raised by the minor's 4attorney, that attorney has the burden of proving a bona fide 5doubt of the minor's fitness has been raised. When a bona fide 6doubt of the minor's fitness is raised, the court shall order a 7determination of the issue of fitness before proceeding 8further.9    (b) Upon request of the minor's attorney that a qualified 10expert be appointed to examine the minor to determine prior to 11trial or adjudicatory hearing if a bona fide doubt as to a 12minor's fitness to stand trial or plead may be raised, the 13court shall order an appropriate examination. However, no 14order entered pursuant to this subsection shall prevent 15further proceedings in the case. An expert so appointed shall 16examine the defendant and make a report as provided in Section 175-5A-125. Such report shall only be tendered to the minor's 18attorney. If the minor's attorney raises the issue of fitness 19based on the report, that report shall be provided to the court 20and the State. If the court finds a bona fide doubt of fitness 21has been raised pursuant to this subsection, the matter shall 22proceed to a hearing pursuant to Section 5-5A-165 before 23proceeding further. Upon the filing with the court of a 24verified statement of services rendered, the court shall order 25the county board to pay such expert a reasonable fee stated in 26the order.  SB1655- 6 -LRB104 09387 RLC 19446 b1    (c) Nothing in this Section operates to extinguish any 2rights of a minor established by attorney-client privilege.3    (d) In all proceedings under this Act, the juvenile court 4shall apply the fitness standards as set forth in this Part. 5When a minor is being prosecuted under the criminal laws of 6this State, the criminal court shall apply the fitness 7standards in this Part. 8    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-120 new)9    Sec. 5-5A-120.

Sentencing guidelines for a minor who 13attains fitness. The court shall not impose a commitment to 14the Department of Juvenile Justice or the Department of 15Corrections upon the minor if the court believes that, because 16of the minor's condition, such a sentence would not be in the 17interests of society and the minor or would subject the minor 18to excessive hardship. In addition to any other conditions of 19a sentence of conditional discharge or probation, the court 20may require that the minor receive additional services for the 21minor's condition. 22    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-215 new)23    Sec. 5-5A-215.

The Juvenile Court Act of 1987 is amended by 5adding Part 5A to Article V as follows: 6    (705 ILCS 405/Art. V Pt. 5A heading new)7PART 5A. FITNESS TO STAND TRIAL 8    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-101 new)9    Sec. 5-5A-101. Purpose. 10    (a) This Part recognizes that minors are substantially 11different from adults and therefore creates procedures to 12establish fitness to stand trial that accommodate these 13differences. Currently in Illinois, children of any age can be 14arrested, charged, and prosecuted. This approach is 15inconsistent with developmental science, which overwhelmingly 16finds that children are limited in their ability to understand 17the consequences of their actions, manage impulses and peer 18influence to plan for the future. Modern neuroscience explains 19both limitations on culpability for minors, defined as an 20individual's blameworthiness or responsibility for a criminal 21action, as well as limitations on the ability to assist with 22and make critical decisions regarding one's own legal defense.   SB1655- 2 -LRB104 09387 RLC 19446 b1Accordingly, prosecutors, defense counsel, and courts must 2carefully consider chronological immaturity, relative 3immaturity, and the impact of trauma, as well as other 4relevant factors, in considering the fitness of a minor to be 5tried, adjudicated or convicted, and sentenced. These factors 6should be given significant weight when determining the 7fitness of a child under the age of 14.8    (b) This Part is intended to support minors through 9practices that are trauma-informed and that protect minor's 10rights and dignity; questions of interpretation shall be 11resolved in line with these practices. This Part recognizes 12that the ability to understand charges and to participate 13meaningfully in one's own defense evolve gradually throughout 14childhood and early adulthood and that each minor deserves 15developmentally appropriate responses that reflect the best 16understanding of the minor's current abilities. 17    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-105 new)18    Sec. 5-5A-105. Definitions. In this Part:19    "Child traumatic stress" means exposure to one or more 20traumatic events over the course of a minor's life that 21results in that minor developing reactions that persist and 22that interfere with the minor's functional, social, adaptive, 23or intellectual ability.24    "Chronological immaturity" means a lack of functional, 25social, adaptive, or intellectual ability due to chronological   SB1655- 3 -LRB104 09387 RLC 19446 b1age.2    "Developmental disability" means a disability that is 3attributable to an intellectual disability, cerebral palsy, 4epilepsy, autism, a learning disability, or any other 5condition that results in impaired functional, social, 6adaptive, or intellectual ability.7    "Mental illness" means a mental or emotional disorder that 8substantially impairs a person's thought, perception of 9reality, emotional process, judgment, behavior, or ability to 10cope with the ordinary demands of life.11    "Minor" has the meaning given to that term in Section 1-3 12of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.13    "Relative immaturity" means a lack of functional, social, 14adaptive, or intellectual ability when a minor is compared to 15other minors of the same chronological age.16    "Substance use disorder" has the meaning given to that 17term in Section 1-10 of the Substance Use Disorder Act. 18    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-110 new)19    Sec. 5-5A-110. Unfitness standard. Unfitness may result 20from the presence of any condition or confluence of 21conditions, including, but not limited to, physical condition, 22mental illness, substance use disorder, developmental 23disability, chronological immaturity, relative immaturity, or 24child traumatic stress. A diagnosis is not required for a 25finding of unfitness. A minor is unfit when the minor either:  SB1655- 4 -LRB104 09387 RLC 19446 b1        (1) lacks sufficient present ability to consult with 2    the minor's attorney with a reasonable degree of rational 3    understanding, as evidenced by lacking the ability to 4    disclose to the attorney facts pertinent to the 5    proceedings at issue and to assist in the minor's defense; 6    or7        (2) is unable to understand the proceedings against 8    the minor, as demonstrated by, but not limited to, one or 9    more of the following:10            (A) a lack of ability to identify who the 11        participants are and understand their roles, including 12        the judge, minor's attorney, State's Attorney, or 13        qualified expert;14            (B) a lack of understanding of the range of 15        possible dispositions that may be imposed in the 16        proceedings; or17            (C) a lack of ability to use the factual 18        understandings and factors in (A) and (B) of this 19        paragraph to make rational decisions. 20    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-115 new)21    Sec. 5-5A-115. Raising the issue of unfitness.22    (a) The issue of the minor's fitness to stand trial, to 23plead, or to be sentenced may be raised by the minor's 24attorney, the State, or the court at any time before a plea is 25entered or before, during, or after trial. If the issue of   SB1655- 5 -LRB104 09387 RLC 19446 b1fitness is raised by the State, the State has the burden of 2proving a bona fide doubt of the minor's fitness has been 3raised. If the issue of fitness is raised by the minor's 4attorney, that attorney has the burden of proving a bona fide 5doubt of the minor's fitness has been raised. When a bona fide 6doubt of the minor's fitness is raised, the court shall order a 7determination of the issue of fitness before proceeding 8further.9    (b) Upon request of the minor's attorney that a qualified 10expert be appointed to examine the minor to determine prior to 11trial or adjudicatory hearing if a bona fide doubt as to a 12minor's fitness to stand trial or plead may be raised, the 13court shall order an appropriate examination. However, no 14order entered pursuant to this subsection shall prevent 15further proceedings in the case. An expert so appointed shall 16examine the defendant and make a report as provided in Section 175-5A-125. Such report shall only be tendered to the minor's 18attorney. If the minor's attorney raises the issue of fitness 19based on the report, that report shall be provided to the court 20and the State. If the court finds a bona fide doubt of fitness 21has been raised pursuant to this subsection, the matter shall 22proceed to a hearing pursuant to Section 5-5A-165 before 23proceeding further. Upon the filing with the court of a 24verified statement of services rendered, the court shall order 25the county board to pay such expert a reasonable fee stated in 26the order.  SB1655- 6 -LRB104 09387 RLC 19446 b1    (c) Nothing in this Section operates to extinguish any 2rights of a minor established by attorney-client privilege.3    (d) In all proceedings under this Act, the juvenile court 4shall apply the fitness standards as set forth in this Part. 5When a minor is being prosecuted under the criminal laws of 6this State, the criminal court shall apply the fitness 7standards in this Part. 8    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-120 new)9    Sec. 5-5A-120. Burdens and presumptions. In making 10determinations concerning a minor's fitness, the following 11burdens of proof and presumptions shall apply:12        (1) for the purposes of this Section, a minor is 13    presumed to be fit to stand trial or to plead and be 14    sentenced. A minor is unfit based on the unfitness 15    standard set forth in Section 5-5A-110;16        (2) except as set forth in subparagraph (3), when the 17    court finds a bona fide doubt as to the fitness of a minor 18    under Section 5-5A-115, the State bears the burden of 19    proving that the minor is fit by a preponderance of the 20    evidence;21        (3) when the court finds a bona fide doubt as to the 22    fitness of a minor under the age of 14 under Section 23    5-5A-115, the state bears the burden of proving that the 24    minor is fit by clear and convincing evidence; and25        (4) a minor who is receiving medication shall not be   SB1655- 7 -LRB104 09387 RLC 19446 b1    presumed to be fit or unfit to stand trial solely by virtue 2    of the receipt of that medication. 3    (705 ILCS 405/5-5A-125 new)4    Sec. 5-5A-125. Fitness evaluation. When the court orders a 5fitness evaluation under subsection (b) of Section 5-5A-115 or 6a bona fide doubt of fitness is raised, the court must appoint 7one or more qualified experts under Section 5-5A-135. Each 8expert must evaluate whether the minor is fit and must submit a 9report of the expert's findings to the court under Section 105-5A-160.
