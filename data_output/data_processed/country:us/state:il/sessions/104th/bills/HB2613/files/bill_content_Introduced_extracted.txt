The allotment shall be apportioned among the 14several counties in the State in the proportion which the 15total mileage of township or district roads in the respective 16counties bears to the total mileage of all township and 17district roads in the State. Funds allotted to the respective 18counties for the use of road districts therein shall be 19allocated to the several road districts in the county in the 20proportion which the total mileage of such township or 21district roads in the respective road districts bears to the 22total mileage of all such township or district roads in the 23county. After July 1 of any year prior to 2011, no allocation 24shall be made for any road district unless it levied a tax for 25road and bridge purposes in an amount which will require the 26extension of such tax against the taxable property in any such   HB2613- 15 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1road district at a rate of not less than either .08% of the 2value thereof, based upon the assessment for the year 3immediately prior to the year in which such tax was levied and 4as equalized by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage 5County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of 6road under the jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is 7less. Beginning July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, an 8allocation shall be made for any road district if it levied a 9tax for road and bridge purposes. In counties other than 10DuPage County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the 11extension of the tax against the taxable property in the road 12district at a rate that is less than 0.08% of the value 13thereof, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 14prior to the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 15by the Department of Revenue, then the amount of the 16allocation for that road district shall be a percentage of the 17maximum allocation equal to the percentage obtained by 18dividing the rate extended by the district by 0.08%. In DuPage 19County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the extension of 20the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 21rate that is less than the lesser of (i) 0.08% of the value of 22the taxable property in the road district, based upon the 23assessment for the year immediately prior to the year in which 24such tax was levied and as equalized by the Department of 25Revenue, or (ii) a rate that will yield an amount equal to 26$12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road   HB2613- 16 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1district, then the amount of the allocation for the road 2district shall be a percentage of the maximum allocation equal 3to the percentage obtained by dividing the rate extended by 4the district by the lesser of (i) 0.08% or (ii) the rate that 5will yield an amount equal to $12,000 per mile of road under 6the jurisdiction of the road district. 7    Prior to 2011, if any road district has levied a special 8tax for road purposes pursuant to Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 96-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and such tax was levied in 10an amount which would require extension at a rate of not less 11than .08% of the value of the taxable property thereof, as 12equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue, or, in 13DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 14mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 15whichever is less, such levy shall, however, be deemed a 16proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 17road district for an allotment under this Section. Beginning 18in 2011 and thereafter, if any road district has levied a 19special tax for road purposes under Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 206-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and the tax was levied in 21an amount that would require extension at a rate of not less 22than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property of that road 23district, as equalized or assessed by the Department of 24Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater 25than $12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the 26road district, whichever is less, that levy shall be deemed a   HB2613- 17 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 2road district for a full, rather than proportionate, allotment 3under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is less 4than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property, or, in DuPage 5County if the levy for the special tax is less than the lesser 6of (i) 0.08% or (ii) $12,000 per mile of road under the 7jurisdiction of the road district, and if the levy for the 8special tax is more than any other levy for road and bridge 9purposes, then the levy for the special tax qualifies the road 10district for a proportionate, rather than full, allotment 11under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is equal to 12or less than any other levy for road and bridge purposes, then 13any allotment under this Section shall be determined by the 14other levy for road and bridge purposes.15    Prior to 2011, if a township has transferred to the road 16and bridge fund money which, when added to the amount of any 17tax levy of the road district would be the equivalent of a tax 18levy requiring extension at a rate of at least .08%, or, in 19DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 20mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 21whichever is less, such transfer, together with any such tax 22levy, shall be deemed a proper compliance with this Section 23and shall qualify the road district for an allotment under 24this Section.25    In counties in which a property tax extension limitation 26is imposed under the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law,   HB2613- 18 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1road districts may retain their entitlement to a motor fuel 2tax allotment or, beginning in 2011, their entitlement to a 3full allotment if, at the time the property tax extension 4limitation was imposed, the road district was levying a road 5and bridge tax at a rate sufficient to entitle it to a motor 6fuel tax allotment and continues to levy the maximum allowable 7amount after the imposition of the property tax extension 8limitation. Any road district may in all circumstances retain 9its entitlement to a motor fuel tax allotment or, beginning in 102011, its entitlement to a full allotment if it levied a road 11and bridge tax in an amount that will require the extension of 12the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 13rate of not less than 0.08% of the assessed value of the 14property, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 15preceding the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 16by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount 17equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of road under the 18jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is less.19    As used in this Section, the term "road district" means 20any road district, including a county unit road district, 21provided for by the Illinois Highway Code; and the term 22"township or district road" means any road in the township and 23district road system as defined in the Illinois Highway Code. 24For the purposes of this Section, "township or district road" 25also includes such roads as are maintained by park districts, 26forest preserve districts and conservation districts. The   HB2613- 19 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1Department of Transportation shall determine the mileage of 2all township and district roads for the purposes of making 3allotments and allocations of motor fuel tax funds for use in 4road districts.5    Payment of motor fuel tax moneys to municipalities and 6counties shall be made as soon as possible after the allotment 7is made. The treasurer of the municipality or county may 8invest these funds until their use is required and the 9interest earned by these investments shall be limited to the 10same uses as the principal funds.11(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 12102-699, eff. 4-19-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23.) 13    Section 10.

The tax 4may not be imposed under this Section on aviation fuel, as 5defined in Section 3 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act.6    Persons subject to any tax imposed under the authority 7granted in this Section may reimburse themselves for their 8seller's tax liability hereunder by separately stating that 9tax as an additional charge, which charge may be stated in 10combination, in a single amount, with State tax which sellers 11are required to collect under the Use Tax Act, pursuant to such 12bracket schedules as the Department may prescribe. 13    A tax imposed pursuant to this Section, and all civil 14penalties that may be assessed as an incident thereof, shall 15be administered, collected, and enforced by the Department of 16Revenue in the same manner as the tax imposed under the 17Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, as now or hereafter amended, 18insofar as may be practicable; except that in the event of a 19conflict with the provisions of this Section, this Section 20shall control. The Department of Revenue shall have full power 21to: administer and enforce this Section; collect all taxes and 22penalties due hereunder; dispose of taxes and penalties so 23collected in the manner hereinafter provided; and determine 24all rights to credit memoranda arising on account of the 25erroneous payment of tax or penalty hereunder. 26    Whenever the Department determines that a refund shall be   HB2613- 21 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1made under this Section to a claimant instead of issuing a 2credit memorandum, the Department shall notify the State 3Comptroller, who shall cause the order to be drawn for the 4amount specified, and to the person named, in the notification 5from the Department. The refund shall be paid by the State 6Treasurer out of the Municipal Motor Fuel Tax Fund. 7    The Department shall immediately pay over to the State 8Treasurer, ex officio, as trustee, all taxes and penalties 9collected under this Section. Those taxes and penalties shall 10be deposited into the Municipal Motor Fuel Tax Fund, a trust 11fund created in the State treasury. Moneys in the Municipal 12Motor Fuel Tax Fund shall be used to make payments to 13municipalities and for the payment of refunds under this 14Section. 15    On or before the 25th day of each calendar month, the 16Department shall prepare and certify to the State Comptroller 17the disbursement of stated sums of money to named 18municipalities for which taxpayers have paid taxes or 19penalties hereunder to the Department during the second 20preceding calendar month.

If a township is reconstituted as 22    provided under Section 24-45 of the Township Code, McHenry 23    County or a municipality shall no longer be distributed 24    moneys under this subparagraph.25    As soon as may be after the first day of each month, the 26Department of Transportation shall allot to each municipality   HB2613- 13 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1its share of the amount apportioned to the several 2municipalities which shall be in proportion to the population 3of such municipalities as determined by the last preceding 4municipal census if conducted by the Federal Government or 5Federal census. If territory is annexed to any municipality 6subsequent to the time of the last preceding census the 7corporate authorities of such municipality may cause a census 8to be taken of such annexed territory and the population so 9ascertained for such territory shall be added to the 10population of the municipality as determined by the last 11preceding census for the purpose of determining the allotment 12for that municipality. If the population of any municipality 13was not determined by the last Federal census preceding any 14apportionment, the apportionment to such municipality shall be 15in accordance with any census taken by such municipality. Any 16municipal census used in accordance with this Section shall be 17certified to the Department of Transportation by the clerk of 18such municipality, and the accuracy thereof shall be subject 19to approval of the Department which may make such corrections 20as it ascertains to be necessary.21    As soon as may be after the first day of each month, the 22Department of Transportation shall allot to each county its 23share of the amount apportioned to the several counties of the 24State as herein provided. Each allotment to the several 25counties having less than 1,000,000 inhabitants shall be in 26proportion to the amount of motor vehicle license fees   HB2613- 14 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1received from the residents of such counties, respectively, 2during the preceding calendar year. The Secretary of State 3shall, on or before April 15 of each year, transmit to the 4Department of Transportation a full and complete report 5showing the amount of motor vehicle license fees received from 6the residents of each county, respectively, during the 7preceding calendar year. The Department of Transportation 8shall, each month, use for allotment purposes the last such 9report received from the Secretary of State.10    As soon as may be after the first day of each month, the 11Department of Transportation shall allot to the several 12counties their share of the amount apportioned for the use of 13road districts. The allotment shall be apportioned among the 14several counties in the State in the proportion which the 15total mileage of township or district roads in the respective 16counties bears to the total mileage of all township and 17district roads in the State. Funds allotted to the respective 18counties for the use of road districts therein shall be 19allocated to the several road districts in the county in the 20proportion which the total mileage of such township or 21district roads in the respective road districts bears to the 22total mileage of all such township or district roads in the 23county. After July 1 of any year prior to 2011, no allocation 24shall be made for any road district unless it levied a tax for 25road and bridge purposes in an amount which will require the 26extension of such tax against the taxable property in any such   HB2613- 15 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1road district at a rate of not less than either .08% of the 2value thereof, based upon the assessment for the year 3immediately prior to the year in which such tax was levied and 4as equalized by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage 5County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of 6road under the jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is 7less. Beginning July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, an 8allocation shall be made for any road district if it levied a 9tax for road and bridge purposes. In counties other than 10DuPage County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the 11extension of the tax against the taxable property in the road 12district at a rate that is less than 0.08% of the value 13thereof, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 14prior to the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 15by the Department of Revenue, then the amount of the 16allocation for that road district shall be a percentage of the 17maximum allocation equal to the percentage obtained by 18dividing the rate extended by the district by 0.08%. In DuPage 19County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the extension of 20the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 21rate that is less than the lesser of (i) 0.08% of the value of 22the taxable property in the road district, based upon the 23assessment for the year immediately prior to the year in which 24such tax was levied and as equalized by the Department of 25Revenue, or (ii) a rate that will yield an amount equal to 26$12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road   HB2613- 16 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1district, then the amount of the allocation for the road 2district shall be a percentage of the maximum allocation equal 3to the percentage obtained by dividing the rate extended by 4the district by the lesser of (i) 0.08% or (ii) the rate that 5will yield an amount equal to $12,000 per mile of road under 6the jurisdiction of the road district. 7    Prior to 2011, if any road district has levied a special 8tax for road purposes pursuant to Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 96-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and such tax was levied in 10an amount which would require extension at a rate of not less 11than .08% of the value of the taxable property thereof, as 12equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue, or, in 13DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 14mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 15whichever is less, such levy shall, however, be deemed a 16proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 17road district for an allotment under this Section. Beginning 18in 2011 and thereafter, if any road district has levied a 19special tax for road purposes under Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 206-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and the tax was levied in 21an amount that would require extension at a rate of not less 22than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property of that road 23district, as equalized or assessed by the Department of 24Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater 25than $12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the 26road district, whichever is less, that levy shall be deemed a   HB2613- 17 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 2road district for a full, rather than proportionate, allotment 3under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is less 4than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property, or, in DuPage 5County if the levy for the special tax is less than the lesser 6of (i) 0.08% or (ii) $12,000 per mile of road under the 7jurisdiction of the road district, and if the levy for the 8special tax is more than any other levy for road and bridge 9purposes, then the levy for the special tax qualifies the road 10district for a proportionate, rather than full, allotment 11under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is equal to 12or less than any other levy for road and bridge purposes, then 13any allotment under this Section shall be determined by the 14other levy for road and bridge purposes.15    Prior to 2011, if a township has transferred to the road 16and bridge fund money which, when added to the amount of any 17tax levy of the road district would be the equivalent of a tax 18levy requiring extension at a rate of at least .08%, or, in 19DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 20mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 21whichever is less, such transfer, together with any such tax 22levy, shall be deemed a proper compliance with this Section 23and shall qualify the road district for an allotment under 24this Section.25    In counties in which a property tax extension limitation 26is imposed under the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law,   HB2613- 18 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1road districts may retain their entitlement to a motor fuel 2tax allotment or, beginning in 2011, their entitlement to a 3full allotment if, at the time the property tax extension 4limitation was imposed, the road district was levying a road 5and bridge tax at a rate sufficient to entitle it to a motor 6fuel tax allotment and continues to levy the maximum allowable 7amount after the imposition of the property tax extension 8limitation. Any road district may in all circumstances retain 9its entitlement to a motor fuel tax allotment or, beginning in 102011, its entitlement to a full allotment if it levied a road 11and bridge tax in an amount that will require the extension of 12the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 13rate of not less than 0.08% of the assessed value of the 14property, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 15preceding the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 16by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount 17equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of road under the 18jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is less.19    As used in this Section, the term "road district" means 20any road district, including a county unit road district, 21provided for by the Illinois Highway Code; and the term 22"township or district road" means any road in the township and 23district road system as defined in the Illinois Highway Code. 24For the purposes of this Section, "township or district road" 25also includes such roads as are maintained by park districts, 26forest preserve districts and conservation districts. The   HB2613- 19 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1Department of Transportation shall determine the mileage of 2all township and district roads for the purposes of making 3allotments and allocations of motor fuel tax funds for use in 4road districts.5    Payment of motor fuel tax moneys to municipalities and 6counties shall be made as soon as possible after the allotment 7is made. The treasurer of the municipality or county may 8invest these funds until their use is required and the 9interest earned by these investments shall be limited to the 10same uses as the principal funds.11(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 12102-699, eff. 4-19-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23.) 13    Section 10. The Illinois Municipal Code is amended by 14changing Section 8-11-2.3 as follows: 15    (65 ILCS 5/8-11-2.3)16    Sec. 8-11-2.3. Municipal Motor Fuel Tax Law. 17Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in addition to any 18other tax that may be imposed, a municipality in a county with 19a population of over 3,000,000 inhabitants may also impose, by 20ordinance, a tax upon all persons engaged in the municipality 21in the business of selling motor fuel, as defined in the Motor 22Fuel Tax Law, at retail for the operation of motor vehicles 23upon public highways or for the operation of recreational 24watercraft upon waterways. The tax may be imposed, in one cent   HB2613- 20 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1increments, at a rate not to exceed $0.03 per gallon of motor 2fuel sold at retail within the municipality for the purpose of 3use or consumption and not for the purpose of resale. The tax 4may not be imposed under this Section on aviation fuel, as 5defined in Section 3 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act.6    Persons subject to any tax imposed under the authority 7granted in this Section may reimburse themselves for their 8seller's tax liability hereunder by separately stating that 9tax as an additional charge, which charge may be stated in 10combination, in a single amount, with State tax which sellers 11are required to collect under the Use Tax Act, pursuant to such 12bracket schedules as the Department may prescribe. 13    A tax imposed pursuant to this Section, and all civil 14penalties that may be assessed as an incident thereof, shall 15be administered, collected, and enforced by the Department of 16Revenue in the same manner as the tax imposed under the 17Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, as now or hereafter amended, 18insofar as may be practicable; except that in the event of a 19conflict with the provisions of this Section, this Section 20shall control. The Department of Revenue shall have full power 21to: administer and enforce this Section; collect all taxes and 22penalties due hereunder; dispose of taxes and penalties so 23collected in the manner hereinafter provided; and determine 24all rights to credit memoranda arising on account of the 25erroneous payment of tax or penalty hereunder. 26    Whenever the Department determines that a refund shall be   HB2613- 21 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1made under this Section to a claimant instead of issuing a 2credit memorandum, the Department shall notify the State 3Comptroller, who shall cause the order to be drawn for the 4amount specified, and to the person named, in the notification 5from the Department. The refund shall be paid by the State 6Treasurer out of the Municipal Motor Fuel Tax Fund. 7    The Department shall immediately pay over to the State 8Treasurer, ex officio, as trustee, all taxes and penalties 9collected under this Section. Those taxes and penalties shall 10be deposited into the Municipal Motor Fuel Tax Fund, a trust 11fund created in the State treasury. Moneys in the Municipal 12Motor Fuel Tax Fund shall be used to make payments to 13municipalities and for the payment of refunds under this 14Section. 15    On or before the 25th day of each calendar month, the 16Department shall prepare and certify to the State Comptroller 17the disbursement of stated sums of money to named 18municipalities for which taxpayers have paid taxes or 19penalties hereunder to the Department during the second 20preceding calendar month. The amount to be paid to each 21municipality shall be the amount (not including credit 22memoranda) collected under this Section from retailers within 23the municipality during the second preceding calendar month by 24the Department, plus an amount the Department determines is 25necessary to offset amounts that were erroneously paid to a 26different municipality, and not including an amount equal to   HB2613- 22 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1the amount of refunds made during the second preceding 2calendar month by the Department on behalf of the 3municipality, and not including any amount that the Department 4determines is necessary to offset any amounts that were 5payable to a different municipality but were erroneously paid 6to the municipality, less 1.5% of the remainder, which the 7Department shall transfer into the Tax Compliance and 8Administration Fund. The Department, at the time of each 9monthly disbursement, shall prepare and certify to the State 10Comptroller the amount to be transferred into the Tax 11Compliance and Administration Fund under this Section. Within 1210 days after receipt by the Comptroller of the disbursement 13certification to the municipalities and the Tax Compliance and 14Administration Fund provided for in this Section to be given 15to the Comptroller by the Department, the Comptroller shall 16cause the orders to be drawn for the respective amounts in 17accordance with the directions contained in the certification.18    Nothing in this Section shall be construed to authorize a 19municipality to impose a tax upon the privilege of engaging in 20any business which under the Constitution of the United States 21may not be made the subject of taxation by this State. 22    An ordinance or resolution imposing or discontinuing the 23tax under this Section or effecting a change in the rate 24thereof shall either: (i) be adopted and a certified copy 25thereof filed with the Department on or before the first day of 26April, whereupon the Department shall proceed to administer   HB2613- 23 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b1and enforce this Section as of the first day of July next 2following the adoption and filing; or (ii) be adopted and a 3certified copy thereof filed with the Department on or before 4the first day of October, whereupon the Department shall 5proceed to administer and enforce this Section as of the first 6day of January next following the adoption and filing. 7    An ordinance adopted in accordance with the provisions of 8this Section in effect before the effective date of this 9amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly shall be deemed 10to impose the tax in accordance with the provisions of this 11Section as amended by this amendatory Act of the 101st General 12Assembly and shall be administered by the Department of 13Revenue in accordance with the provisions of this Section as 14amended by this amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly; 15provided that, on or before October 1, 2020, the municipality 16adopts and files a certified copy of a superseding ordinance 17that imposes the tax in accordance with the provisions of this 18Section as amended by this amendatory Act of the 101st General 19Assembly. If a superseding ordinance is not so adopted and 20filed, then the tax imposed in accordance with the provisions 21of this Section in effect before the effective date of this 22amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly shall be 23discontinued on January 1, 2021. 24    This Section shall be known and may be cited as the 25Municipal Motor Fuel Tax Law. 26    No tax may be imposed under this Section on or after July   HB2613- 24 -LRB104 10796 HLH 20877 b11, 2025.
