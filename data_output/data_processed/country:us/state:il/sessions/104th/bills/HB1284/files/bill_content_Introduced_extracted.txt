Any letter of agency that does not 14        conform with this Section is invalid.15            (B) The letter of agency shall be a separate 16        document (or an easily separable document containing 17        only the authorization language described in item (E) 18        of this paragraph (1)) whose sole purpose is to 19        authorize a natural gas provider change. The letter of 20        agency must be signed and dated by the customer 21        requesting the natural gas provider change.22            (C) The letter of agency shall not be combined 23        with inducements of any kind on the same document.24            (D) Notwithstanding items (A) and (B) of this 25        paragraph (1), the letter of agency may be combined 26        with checks that contain only the required letter of   HB1284- 22 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1        agency language prescribed in item (E) of this 2        paragraph (1) and the necessary information to make 3        the check a negotiable instrument. The letter of 4        agency check shall not contain any promotional 5        language or material. The letter of agency check shall 6        contain in easily readable, bold face type on the face 7        of the check a notice that the consumer is authorizing 8        a natural gas provider change by signing the check. 9        The letter of agency language also shall be placed 10        near the signature line on the back of the check.11            (E) At a minimum, the letter of agency must be 12        printed with a print of sufficient size to be clearly 13        legible and must contain clear and unambiguous 14        language that confirms:15                (i) the customer's billing name and address;16                (ii) the decision to change the natural gas 17            provider from the current provider to the 18            prospective alternative gas supplier;19                (iii) the terms, conditions, and nature of the 20            service to be provided to the customer, including, 21            but not limited to, the rates for the service 22            contracted for by the customer; and23                (iv) that the customer understands that any 24            natural gas provider selection the customer 25            chooses may involve a charge to the customer for 26            changing the customer's natural gas provider.   HB1284- 23 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1            (F) Letters of agency shall not suggest or require 2        that a customer take some action in order to retain the 3        customer's current natural gas provider.4            (G) If any portion of a letter of agency is 5        translated into another language, then all portions of 6        the letter of agency must be translated into that 7        language. 8        (2) An appropriately qualified independent third party 9    has obtained, in accordance with the procedures set forth 10    in this paragraph (2), the customer's oral authorization 11    to change natural gas providers that confirms and includes 12    appropriate verification data. The independent third party 13    must (i) not be owned, managed, controlled, or directed by 14    the alternative gas supplier or the alternative gas 15    supplier's marketing agent; (ii) not have any financial 16    incentive to confirm provider change requests for the 17    alternative gas supplier or the alternative gas supplier's 18    marketing agent; and (iii) operate in a location 19    physically separate from the alternative gas supplier or 20    the alternative gas supplier's marketing agent. Automated 21    third-party verification systems and 3-way conference 22    calls may be used for verification purposes so long as the 23    other requirements of this paragraph (2) are satisfied. An 24    alternative gas supplier or alternative gas supplier's 25    sales representative initiating a 3-way conference call or 26    a call through an automated verification system must drop   HB1284- 24 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1    off the call once the 3-way connection has been 2    established. All third-party verification methods shall 3    elicit, at a minimum, the following information: 4            (A) the identity of the customer;5            (B) confirmation that the person on the call is 6        authorized to make the provider change;7            (C) confirmation that the person on the call wants 8        to make the provider change;9            (D) the names of the providers affected by the 10        change;11            (E) the service address of the service to be 12        switched; and13            (F) the price of the service to be provided and the 14        material terms and conditions of the service being 15        offered, including whether any early termination fees 16        apply.17        Third-party verifiers may not market the alternative 18    gas supplier's services by providing additional 19    information. All third-party verifications shall be 20    conducted in the same language that was used in the 21    underlying sales transaction and shall be recorded in 22    their entirety. Submitting alternative gas suppliers shall 23    maintain and preserve audio records of verification of 24    customer authorization for a minimum period of 2 years 25    after obtaining the verification. Automated systems must 26    provide customers with an option to speak with a live   HB1284- 25 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1    person at any time during the call. 2        (3) The alternative gas supplier has obtained the 3    customer's authorization via an automated verification 4    system to change natural gas service via telephone. An 5    automated verification system is an electronic system 6    that, through pre-recorded prompts, elicits voice 7    responses, touchtone responses, or both, from the customer 8    and records both the prompts and the customer's responses. 9    Such authorization must elicit the information in 10    paragraph (2)(A) through (F) of this subsection (c). 11    Alternative gas suppliers electing to confirm sales 12    electronically through an automated verification system 13    shall establish one or more toll-free telephone numbers 14    exclusively for that purpose. Calls to the number or 15    numbers shall connect a customer to a voice response unit, 16    or similar mechanism, that makes a date-stamped, 17    time-stamped recording of the required information 18    regarding the alternative gas supplier change.19        The alternative gas supplier shall not use such 20    electronic authorization systems to market its services.21        (4) When a consumer initiates the call to the 22    prospective alternative gas supplier, in order to enroll 23    the consumer as a customer, the prospective alternative 24    gas supplier must, with the consent of the customer, make 25    a date-stamped, time-stamped audio recording that elicits, 26    at a minimum, the following information:   HB1284- 26 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1            (A) the identity of the customer;2            (B) confirmation that the person on the call is 3        authorized to make the provider change;4            (C) confirmation that the person on the call wants 5        to make the provider change;6            (D) the names of the providers affected by the 7        change;8            (E) the service address of the service to be 9        switched; and10            (F) the price of the service to be supplied and the 11        material terms and conditions of the service being 12        offered, including whether any early termination fees 13        apply.14        Submitting alternative gas suppliers shall maintain 15    and preserve the audio records containing the information 16    set forth above for a minimum period of 2 years. 17        (5) In the event that a customer enrolls for service 18    from an alternative gas supplier via an Internet website, 19    the alternative gas supplier shall obtain an 20    electronically signed letter of agency in accordance with 21    paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) and any customer 22    information shall be protected in accordance with all 23    applicable statutes and regulations. In addition, an 24    alternative gas supplier shall provide the following when 25    marketing via an Internet website:26            (A) The Internet enrollment website shall, at a   HB1284- 27 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1        minimum, include:2                (i) a copy of the alternative gas supplier's 3            customer contract that clearly and conspicuously 4            discloses all terms and conditions; and5                (ii) a conspicuous prompt for the customer to 6            print or save a copy of the contract. 7            (B) Any electronic version of the contract shall 8        be identified by version number, in order to ensure 9        the ability to verify the particular contract to which 10        the customer assents.11            (C) Throughout the duration of the alternative gas 12        supplier's contract with a customer, the alternative 13        gas supplier shall retain and, within 3 business days 14        of the customer's request, provide to the customer an 15        e-mail, paper, or facsimile of the terms and 16        conditions of the numbered contract version to which 17        the customer assents.18            (D) The alternative gas supplier shall provide a 19        mechanism by which both the submission and receipt of 20        the electronic letter of agency are recorded by time 21        and date.22            (E) After the customer completes the electronic 23        letter of agency, the alternative gas supplier shall 24        disclose conspicuously through its website that the 25        customer has been enrolled, and the alternative gas 26        supplier shall provide the customer an enrollment   HB1284- 28 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1        confirmation number.2        (6) When a customer is solicited in person by the 3    alternative gas supplier's sales agent, the alternative 4    gas supplier may only obtain the customer's authorization 5    to change natural gas service through the method provided 6    for in paragraph (2) of this subsection (c).7    Alternative gas suppliers must be in compliance with this 8subsection (c) within 90 days after the effective date of this 9amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly. 10    (d) Complaints may be filed with the Commission under this 11Section by a customer whose natural gas service has been 12provided by an alternative gas supplier in a manner not in 13compliance with subsection (c) of this Section. If, after 14notice and hearing, the Commission finds that an alternative 15gas supplier has violated subsection (c), then the Commission 16may in its discretion do any one or more of the following:17        (1) Require the violating alternative gas supplier to 18    refund the customer charges collected in excess of those 19    that would have been charged by the customer's authorized 20    natural gas provider.21        (2) Require the violating alternative gas supplier to 22    pay to the customer's authorized natural gas provider the 23    amount the authorized natural gas provider would have 24    collected for natural gas service. The Commission is 25    authorized to reduce this payment by any amount already 26    paid by the violating alternative gas supplier to the   HB1284- 29 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1    customer's authorized natural gas provider.2        (3) Require the violating alternative gas supplier to 3    pay a fine of up to $1,000 into the Public Utility Fund for 4    each repeated and intentional violation of this Section.5        (4) Issue a cease and desist order.6        (5) For a pattern of violation of this Section or for 7    intentionally violating a cease and desist order, revoke 8    the violating alternative gas supplier's certificate of 9    service authority. 10    (e) No alternative gas supplier shall:11        (1) enter into or employ any arrangements which have 12    the effect of preventing any customer from having access 13    to the services of the gas utility in whose service area 14    the customer is located; 15        (2) charge customers for such access;16        (3) bill for goods or services not authorized by the 17    customer; or18        (4) bill for a disputed amount where the alternative 19    gas supplier has been provided notice of such dispute. The 20    supplier shall attempt to resolve a dispute with the 21    customer. When the dispute is not resolved to the 22    customer's satisfaction, the supplier shall inform the 23    customer of the right to file an informal complaint with 24    the Commission and provide contact information. While the 25    pending dispute is active at the Commission, an 26    alternative gas supplier may bill only for the undisputed   HB1284- 30 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1    amount until the Commission has taken final action on the 2    complaint. 3    (f) An alternative gas supplier that is certified to serve 4residential or small commercial customers shall not:5        (1) deny service to a customer or group of customers 6    nor establish any differences as to prices, terms, 7    conditions, services, products, facilities, or in any 8    other respect, whereby such denial or differences are 9    based upon race, gender, or income, except as provided in 10    Section 19-116;11        (2) deny service based on locality, nor establish any 12    unreasonable difference as to prices, terms, conditions, 13    services, products, or facilities as between localities;14        (3) include in any agreement a provision that 15    obligates a customer to the terms of the agreement if the 16    customer (i) moves outside the State of Illinois; (ii) 17    moves to a location without a transportation service 18    program; or (iii) moves to a location where the customer 19    will not require natural gas service, provided that 20    nothing in this subsection precludes an alternative gas 21    supplier from taking any action otherwise available to it 22    to collect a debt that arises out of service provided to 23    the customer before the customer moved; or24        (4) assign the agreement to any alternative natural 25    gas supplier, unless:26            (A) the supplier is an alternative gas supplier   HB1284- 31 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1        certified by the Commission;2            (B) the rates, terms, and conditions of the 3        agreement being assigned do not change during the 4        remainder of the time covered by the agreement;5            (C) the customer is given no less than 30 days 6        prior written notice of the assignment and contact 7        information for the new supplier; and8            (D) the supplier assigning the contract provides 9        contact information that a customer can use to resolve 10        a dispute; or . 11        (5) pay a commission or other incentive-based 12    compensation to individuals or agents engaged in in-person 13    solicitation or telemarketing. 14    (g) An alternative gas supplier shall comply with the 15following requirements with respect to the marketing, 16offering, and provision of products or services:17        (1) All marketing materials, including, but not 18    limited to, electronic marketing materials, in-person 19    solicitations, and telephone solicitations, concerning 20    prices, terms, and conditions of service shall contain 21    information that adequately discloses the prices, terms, 22    and conditions of the products or services and shall 23    disclose the utility gas supply cost rates per therm price 24    available from the Illinois Commerce Commission website 25    applicable at the time the alternative gas supplier is 26    offering or selling the products or services to the   HB1284- 32 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1    customer and shall disclose the date on which the utility 2    gas supply cost rates per therm became effective and the 3    date on which they will expire. All marketing materials, 4    including, but not limited to, electronic marketing 5    materials, in-person solicitations, and telephone 6    solicitations, shall include the following statement:7            "(Name of the alternative gas supplier) is not the 8        same entity as your gas delivery company.

The discount rate shall be based on 14the electric utility's historical bad debt for receivables 15that are outstanding for a similar length of time and any 16reasonable start-up costs and administrative costs associated 17with the electric utility's purchase of receivables. The 18discounted rate for purchase of uncollectible receivables 19shall be included in the tariff filed pursuant to this 20subsection (e).

The letter of agency check shall 6        contain in easily readable, bold face type on the face 7        of the check a notice that the consumer is authorizing 8        a natural gas provider change by signing the check. 9        The letter of agency language also shall be placed 10        near the signature line on the back of the check.11            (E) At a minimum, the letter of agency must be 12        printed with a print of sufficient size to be clearly 13        legible and must contain clear and unambiguous 14        language that confirms:15                (i) the customer's billing name and address;16                (ii) the decision to change the natural gas 17            provider from the current provider to the 18            prospective alternative gas supplier;19                (iii) the terms, conditions, and nature of the 20            service to be provided to the customer, including, 21            but not limited to, the rates for the service 22            contracted for by the customer; and23                (iv) that the customer understands that any 24            natural gas provider selection the customer 25            chooses may involve a charge to the customer for 26            changing the customer's natural gas provider.   HB1284- 23 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1            (F) Letters of agency shall not suggest or require 2        that a customer take some action in order to retain the 3        customer's current natural gas provider.4            (G) If any portion of a letter of agency is 5        translated into another language, then all portions of 6        the letter of agency must be translated into that 7        language. 8        (2) An appropriately qualified independent third party 9    has obtained, in accordance with the procedures set forth 10    in this paragraph (2), the customer's oral authorization 11    to change natural gas providers that confirms and includes 12    appropriate verification data. The independent third party 13    must (i) not be owned, managed, controlled, or directed by 14    the alternative gas supplier or the alternative gas 15    supplier's marketing agent; (ii) not have any financial 16    incentive to confirm provider change requests for the 17    alternative gas supplier or the alternative gas supplier's 18    marketing agent; and (iii) operate in a location 19    physically separate from the alternative gas supplier or 20    the alternative gas supplier's marketing agent. Automated 21    third-party verification systems and 3-way conference 22    calls may be used for verification purposes so long as the 23    other requirements of this paragraph (2) are satisfied. An 24    alternative gas supplier or alternative gas supplier's 25    sales representative initiating a 3-way conference call or 26    a call through an automated verification system must drop   HB1284- 24 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1    off the call once the 3-way connection has been 2    established. All third-party verification methods shall 3    elicit, at a minimum, the following information: 4            (A) the identity of the customer;5            (B) confirmation that the person on the call is 6        authorized to make the provider change;7            (C) confirmation that the person on the call wants 8        to make the provider change;9            (D) the names of the providers affected by the 10        change;11            (E) the service address of the service to be 12        switched; and13            (F) the price of the service to be provided and the 14        material terms and conditions of the service being 15        offered, including whether any early termination fees 16        apply.17        Third-party verifiers may not market the alternative 18    gas supplier's services by providing additional 19    information. All third-party verifications shall be 20    conducted in the same language that was used in the 21    underlying sales transaction and shall be recorded in 22    their entirety. Submitting alternative gas suppliers shall 23    maintain and preserve audio records of verification of 24    customer authorization for a minimum period of 2 years 25    after obtaining the verification. Automated systems must 26    provide customers with an option to speak with a live   HB1284- 25 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1    person at any time during the call. 2        (3) The alternative gas supplier has obtained the 3    customer's authorization via an automated verification 4    system to change natural gas service via telephone. An 5    automated verification system is an electronic system 6    that, through pre-recorded prompts, elicits voice 7    responses, touchtone responses, or both, from the customer 8    and records both the prompts and the customer's responses. 9    Such authorization must elicit the information in 10    paragraph (2)(A) through (F) of this subsection (c). 11    Alternative gas suppliers electing to confirm sales 12    electronically through an automated verification system 13    shall establish one or more toll-free telephone numbers 14    exclusively for that purpose. Calls to the number or 15    numbers shall connect a customer to a voice response unit, 16    or similar mechanism, that makes a date-stamped, 17    time-stamped recording of the required information 18    regarding the alternative gas supplier change.19        The alternative gas supplier shall not use such 20    electronic authorization systems to market its services.21        (4) When a consumer initiates the call to the 22    prospective alternative gas supplier, in order to enroll 23    the consumer as a customer, the prospective alternative 24    gas supplier must, with the consent of the customer, make 25    a date-stamped, time-stamped audio recording that elicits, 26    at a minimum, the following information:   HB1284- 26 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1            (A) the identity of the customer;2            (B) confirmation that the person on the call is 3        authorized to make the provider change;4            (C) confirmation that the person on the call wants 5        to make the provider change;6            (D) the names of the providers affected by the 7        change;8            (E) the service address of the service to be 9        switched; and10            (F) the price of the service to be supplied and the 11        material terms and conditions of the service being 12        offered, including whether any early termination fees 13        apply.14        Submitting alternative gas suppliers shall maintain 15    and preserve the audio records containing the information 16    set forth above for a minimum period of 2 years. 17        (5) In the event that a customer enrolls for service 18    from an alternative gas supplier via an Internet website, 19    the alternative gas supplier shall obtain an 20    electronically signed letter of agency in accordance with 21    paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) and any customer 22    information shall be protected in accordance with all 23    applicable statutes and regulations. In addition, an 24    alternative gas supplier shall provide the following when 25    marketing via an Internet website:26            (A) The Internet enrollment website shall, at a   HB1284- 27 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1        minimum, include:2                (i) a copy of the alternative gas supplier's 3            customer contract that clearly and conspicuously 4            discloses all terms and conditions; and5                (ii) a conspicuous prompt for the customer to 6            print or save a copy of the contract. 7            (B) Any electronic version of the contract shall 8        be identified by version number, in order to ensure 9        the ability to verify the particular contract to which 10        the customer assents.11            (C) Throughout the duration of the alternative gas 12        supplier's contract with a customer, the alternative 13        gas supplier shall retain and, within 3 business days 14        of the customer's request, provide to the customer an 15        e-mail, paper, or facsimile of the terms and 16        conditions of the numbered contract version to which 17        the customer assents.18            (D) The alternative gas supplier shall provide a 19        mechanism by which both the submission and receipt of 20        the electronic letter of agency are recorded by time 21        and date.22            (E) After the customer completes the electronic 23        letter of agency, the alternative gas supplier shall 24        disclose conspicuously through its website that the 25        customer has been enrolled, and the alternative gas 26        supplier shall provide the customer an enrollment   HB1284- 28 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1        confirmation number.2        (6) When a customer is solicited in person by the 3    alternative gas supplier's sales agent, the alternative 4    gas supplier may only obtain the customer's authorization 5    to change natural gas service through the method provided 6    for in paragraph (2) of this subsection (c).7    Alternative gas suppliers must be in compliance with this 8subsection (c) within 90 days after the effective date of this 9amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly. 10    (d) Complaints may be filed with the Commission under this 11Section by a customer whose natural gas service has been 12provided by an alternative gas supplier in a manner not in 13compliance with subsection (c) of this Section. If, after 14notice and hearing, the Commission finds that an alternative 15gas supplier has violated subsection (c), then the Commission 16may in its discretion do any one or more of the following:17        (1) Require the violating alternative gas supplier to 18    refund the customer charges collected in excess of those 19    that would have been charged by the customer's authorized 20    natural gas provider.21        (2) Require the violating alternative gas supplier to 22    pay to the customer's authorized natural gas provider the 23    amount the authorized natural gas provider would have 24    collected for natural gas service. The Commission is 25    authorized to reduce this payment by any amount already 26    paid by the violating alternative gas supplier to the   HB1284- 29 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1    customer's authorized natural gas provider.2        (3) Require the violating alternative gas supplier to 3    pay a fine of up to $1,000 into the Public Utility Fund for 4    each repeated and intentional violation of this Section.5        (4) Issue a cease and desist order.6        (5) For a pattern of violation of this Section or for 7    intentionally violating a cease and desist order, revoke 8    the violating alternative gas supplier's certificate of 9    service authority. 10    (e) No alternative gas supplier shall:11        (1) enter into or employ any arrangements which have 12    the effect of preventing any customer from having access 13    to the services of the gas utility in whose service area 14    the customer is located; 15        (2) charge customers for such access;16        (3) bill for goods or services not authorized by the 17    customer; or18        (4) bill for a disputed amount where the alternative 19    gas supplier has been provided notice of such dispute. The 20    supplier shall attempt to resolve a dispute with the 21    customer. When the dispute is not resolved to the 22    customer's satisfaction, the supplier shall inform the 23    customer of the right to file an informal complaint with 24    the Commission and provide contact information. While the 25    pending dispute is active at the Commission, an 26    alternative gas supplier may bill only for the undisputed   HB1284- 30 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1    amount until the Commission has taken final action on the 2    complaint. 3    (f) An alternative gas supplier that is certified to serve 4residential or small commercial customers shall not:5        (1) deny service to a customer or group of customers 6    nor establish any differences as to prices, terms, 7    conditions, services, products, facilities, or in any 8    other respect, whereby such denial or differences are 9    based upon race, gender, or income, except as provided in 10    Section 19-116;11        (2) deny service based on locality, nor establish any 12    unreasonable difference as to prices, terms, conditions, 13    services, products, or facilities as between localities;14        (3) include in any agreement a provision that 15    obligates a customer to the terms of the agreement if the 16    customer (i) moves outside the State of Illinois; (ii) 17    moves to a location without a transportation service 18    program; or (iii) moves to a location where the customer 19    will not require natural gas service, provided that 20    nothing in this subsection precludes an alternative gas 21    supplier from taking any action otherwise available to it 22    to collect a debt that arises out of service provided to 23    the customer before the customer moved; or24        (4) assign the agreement to any alternative natural 25    gas supplier, unless:26            (A) the supplier is an alternative gas supplier   HB1284- 31 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1        certified by the Commission;2            (B) the rates, terms, and conditions of the 3        agreement being assigned do not change during the 4        remainder of the time covered by the agreement;5            (C) the customer is given no less than 30 days 6        prior written notice of the assignment and contact 7        information for the new supplier; and8            (D) the supplier assigning the contract provides 9        contact information that a customer can use to resolve 10        a dispute; or . 11        (5) pay a commission or other incentive-based 12    compensation to individuals or agents engaged in in-person 13    solicitation or telemarketing. 14    (g) An alternative gas supplier shall comply with the 15following requirements with respect to the marketing, 16offering, and provision of products or services:17        (1) All marketing materials, including, but not 18    limited to, electronic marketing materials, in-person 19    solicitations, and telephone solicitations, concerning 20    prices, terms, and conditions of service shall contain 21    information that adequately discloses the prices, terms, 22    and conditions of the products or services and shall 23    disclose the utility gas supply cost rates per therm price 24    available from the Illinois Commerce Commission website 25    applicable at the time the alternative gas supplier is 26    offering or selling the products or services to the   HB1284- 32 -LRB104 03458 AAS 13481 b1    customer and shall disclose the date on which the utility 2    gas supply cost rates per therm became effective and the 3    date on which they will expire. All marketing materials, 4    including, but not limited to, electronic marketing 5    materials, in-person solicitations, and telephone 6    solicitations, shall include the following statement:7            "(Name of the alternative gas supplier) is not the 8        same entity as your gas delivery company.
