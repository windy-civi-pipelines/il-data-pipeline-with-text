Upon 12timely receipt of the notice for the current tax year, no 13exemption shall be applied to the property for the current tax 14year. If the exemption is not removed upon timely receipt of 15the notice by the chief assessment officer, then the error is 16considered granted as a result of a clerical error or omission 17on the part of the chief county assessment officer as 18described in subsection (h) of Section 9-275, and the property 19owner shall not be liable for the payment of interest and 20penalties due to the erroneous exemption for the current tax 21year for which the notice was filed after the date that notice 22was timely received pursuant to this subsection.

If however, the 1977 equalized assessed value upon 22which taxes were paid is subsequently determined by local 23assessing officials, the Property Tax Appeal Board, or a court 24to have been excessive, the equalized assessed value which 25should have been placed on the property for 1977 shall be used   HB1746- 18 -LRB104 03562 HLH 13586 b1to determine the amount of the exemption.2    (b) Except as provided in Section 15-176, the maximum 3reduction before taxable year 2004 shall be $4,500 in counties 4with 3,000,000 or more inhabitants and $3,500 in all other 5counties.

For taxable years 102012 through 2016, the maximum reduction is $7,000 in counties 11with 3,000,000 or more inhabitants and $6,000 in all other 12counties. For taxable years 2017 through 2022, the maximum 13reduction is $10,000 in counties with 3,000,000 or more 14inhabitants and $6,000 in all other counties. For taxable year 15years 2023 and thereafter, the maximum reduction is $10,000 in 16counties with 3,000,000 or more inhabitants, $8,000 in 17counties that are contiguous to a county of 3,000,000 or more 18inhabitants, and $6,000 in all other counties. For taxable 19years 2026 and thereafter, the maximum reduction is $10,000 in 20all counties. If a county has elected to subject itself to the 21provisions of Section 15-176 as provided in subsection (k) of 22that Section, then, for the first taxable year only after the 23provisions of Section 15-176 no longer apply, for owners who, 24for the taxable year, have not been granted a senior citizens 25assessment freeze homestead exemption under Section 15-172 or 26a long-time occupant homestead exemption under Section 15-177,   HB1746- 19 -LRB104 03562 HLH 13586 b1there shall be an additional exemption of $5,000 for owners 2with a household income of $30,000 or less. 3    (c) In counties with fewer than 3,000,000 inhabitants, if, 4based on the most recent assessment, the equalized assessed 5value of the homestead property for the current assessment 6year is greater than the equalized assessed value of the 7property for 1977, the owner of the property shall 8automatically receive the exemption granted under this Section 9in an amount equal to the increase over the 1977 assessment up 10to the maximum reduction set forth in this Section.11    (d) If in any assessment year beginning with the 2000 12assessment year, homestead property has a pro-rata valuation 13under Section 9-180 resulting in an increase in the assessed 14valuation, a reduction in equalized assessed valuation equal 15to the increase in equalized assessed value of the property 16for the year of the pro-rata valuation above the equalized 17assessed value of the property for 1977 shall be applied to the 18property on a proportionate basis for the period the property 19qualified as homestead property during the assessment year. 20The maximum proportionate homestead exemption shall not exceed 21the maximum homestead exemption allowed in the county under 22this Section divided by 365 and multiplied by the number of 23days the property qualified as homestead property.24    (d-1) In counties with 3,000,000 or more inhabitants, 25where the chief county assessment officer provides a notice of 26discovery, if a property is not occupied by its owner as a   HB1746- 20 -LRB104 03562 HLH 13586 b1principal residence as of January 1 of the current tax year, 2then the property owner shall notify the chief county 3assessment officer of that fact on a form prescribed by the 4chief county assessment officer.

Upon 12timely receipt of the notice for the current tax year, no 13exemption shall be applied to the property for the current tax 14year. If the exemption is not removed upon timely receipt of 15the notice by the chief assessment officer, then the error is 16considered granted as a result of a clerical error or omission 17on the part of the chief county assessment officer as 18described in subsection (h) of Section 9-275, and the property 19owner shall not be liable for the payment of interest and 20penalties due to the erroneous exemption for the current tax 21year for which the notice was filed after the date that notice 22was timely received pursuant to this subsection.

The parties agree that the 2        monthly rent set forth above shall be increased or 3        decreased pro rata (effective January 1 of each 4        calendar year) to reflect any increase or decrease in 5        real estate taxes. Lessee shall be deemed to be 6        satisfying Lessee's liability for the above mentioned 7        real estate taxes with the monthly rent payments as 8        set forth above (or increased or decreased as set 9        forth herein).". 10    In addition, if there is a change in lessee, or if the 11lessee vacates the property, then the chief county assessment 12officer may require the owner of the property to notify the 13chief county assessment officer of that change. 14    This subsection (e) does not apply to leasehold interests 15in property owned by a municipality. 16    (f) "Homestead property" under this Section includes 17residential property that is occupied by its owner or owners 18as his or their principal dwelling place, or that is a 19leasehold interest on which a single family residence is 20situated, which is occupied as a residence by a person who has 21an ownership interest therein, legal or equitable or as a 22lessee, and on which the person is liable for the payment of 23property taxes.
