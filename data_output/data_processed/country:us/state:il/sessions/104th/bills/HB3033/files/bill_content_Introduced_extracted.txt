Makes conforming changes.LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b  A BILL FOR HB3033LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1    AN ACT concerning education. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The School Code is amended by changing Sections 522-80 and 27-8.1 as follows: 6    (105 ILCS 5/22-80)7    Sec. 22-80. Student athletes; concussions and head 8injuries.9    (a) The General Assembly recognizes all of the following:10        (1) Concussions are one of the most commonly reported 11    injuries in children and adolescents who participate in 12    sports and recreational activities. The Centers for 13    Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as many as 14    3,900,000 sports-related and recreation-related 15    concussions occur in the United States each year. A 16    concussion is caused by a blow or motion to the head or 17    body that causes the brain to move rapidly inside the 18    skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or death is 19    significant when a concussion or head injury is not 20    properly evaluated and managed.21        (2) Concussions are a type of brain injury that can 22    range from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain 23    normally works. Concussions can occur in any organized or   HB3033- 2 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1    unorganized sport or recreational activity and can result 2    from a fall or from players colliding with each other, the 3    ground, or with obstacles. Concussions occur with or 4    without loss of consciousness, but the vast majority of 5    concussions occur without loss of consciousness.6        (3) Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms 7    of a head injury leaves a young athlete especially 8    vulnerable to greater injury and even death. The General 9    Assembly recognizes that, despite having generally 10    recognized return-to-play standards for concussions and 11    head injuries, some affected youth athletes are 12    prematurely returned to play, resulting in actual or 13    potential physical injury or death to youth athletes in 14    this State.15        (4) Student athletes who have sustained a concussion 16    may need informal or formal accommodations, modifications 17    of curriculum, and monitoring by medical or academic staff 18    until the student is fully recovered. To that end, all 19    schools are encouraged to establish a return-to-learn 20    protocol that is based on peer-reviewed scientific 21    evidence consistent with Centers for Disease Control and 22    Prevention guidelines and conduct baseline testing for 23    student athletes.24    (b) In this Section:25    "Athletic trainer" means an athletic trainer licensed 26under the Illinois Athletic Trainers Practice Act who is   HB3033- 3 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1working under the supervision of a physician.2    "Coach" means any volunteer or employee of a school who is 3responsible for organizing and supervising students to teach 4them or train them in the fundamental skills of an 5interscholastic athletic activity. "Coach" refers to both head 6coaches and assistant coaches. 7    "Concussion" means a complex pathophysiological process 8affecting the brain caused by a traumatic physical force or 9impact to the head or body, which may include temporary or 10prolonged altered brain function resulting in physical, 11cognitive, or emotional symptoms or altered sleep patterns and 12which may or may not involve a loss of consciousness.13    "Department" means the Department of Financial and 14Professional Regulation. 15    "Game official" means a person who officiates at an 16interscholastic athletic activity, such as a referee or 17umpire, including, but not limited to, persons enrolled as 18game officials by the Illinois High School Association or 19Illinois Elementary School Association.20    "Interscholastic athletic activity" means any organized 21school-sponsored or school-sanctioned activity for students, 22generally outside of school instructional hours, under the 23direction of a coach, athletic director, or band leader, 24including, but not limited to, baseball, basketball, 25cheerleading, cross country track, fencing, field hockey, 26football, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, marching   HB3033- 4 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1band, rugby, soccer, skating, softball, swimming and diving, 2tennis, track (indoor and outdoor), ultimate Frisbee, 3volleyball, water polo, and wrestling.

Nothing in this Section shall be 18construed to allow a school to exclude a child from attending 19because of a parent's or guardian's failure to obtain a 20developmental screening or a social and emotional screening 21for the child. Once a developmental screening or a social and 22emotional screening is completed and proof has been presented 23to the school, the school may, with a parent's or guardian's 24consent, make available appropriate school personnel to work 25with the parent or guardian, the child, and the provider who 26signed the screening form to obtain any appropriate   HB3033- 22 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1evaluations and services as indicated on the form and in other 2information and documentation provided by the parents, 3guardians, or provider.4    (3) Every child shall, at or about the same time as he or 5she receives a health examination required by subsection (1) 6of this Section, present to the local school proof of having 7received such immunizations against preventable communicable 8diseases as the Department of Public Health shall require by 9rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this Section and 10the Communicable Disease Prevention Act.11    (4) The individuals conducting the health examination, 12including an athletic physical examination, dental 13examination, or eye examination shall record the fact of 14having conducted the examination, and such additional 15information as required, including for a health examination 16data relating to asthma and obesity (including at a minimum, 17date of birth, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, and 18date of exam), on uniform forms which the Department of Public 19Health and the State Board of Education shall prescribe for 20statewide use. The examiner shall summarize on the report form 21any condition that he or she suspects indicates a need for 22special services, including for a health examination factors 23relating to asthma or obesity. The duty to summarize on the 24report form does not apply to social and emotional screenings. 25The confidentiality of the information and records relating to 26the developmental screening and the social and emotional   HB3033- 23 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1screening shall be determined by the statutes, rules, and 2professional ethics governing the type of provider conducting 3the screening. The individuals confirming the administration 4of required immunizations shall record as indicated on the 5form that the immunizations were administered.6    (5) If a child does not submit proof of having had either 7the health examination or the immunization as required, then 8the child shall be examined or receive the immunization, as 9the case may be, and present proof by October 15 of the current 10school year, or by an earlier date of the current school year 11established by a school district. To establish a date before 12October 15 of the current school year for the health 13examination or immunization as required, a school district 14must give notice of the requirements of this Section 60 days 15prior to the earlier established date. If for medical reasons 16one or more of the required immunizations must be given after 17October 15 of the current school year, or after an earlier 18established date of the current school year, then the child 19shall present, by October 15, or by the earlier established 20date, a schedule for the administration of the immunizations 21and a statement of the medical reasons causing the delay, both 22the schedule and the statement being issued by the physician, 23advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, 24registered nurse, or local health department that will be 25responsible for administration of the remaining required 26immunizations. If a child does not comply by October 15, or by   HB3033- 24 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1the earlier established date of the current school year, with 2the requirements of this subsection, then the local school 3authority shall exclude that child from school until such time 4as the child presents proof of having had the health 5examination as required and presents proof of having received 6those required immunizations which are medically possible to 7receive immediately. During a child's exclusion from school 8for noncompliance with this subsection, the child's parents or 9legal guardian shall be considered in violation of Section 1026-1 and subject to any penalty imposed by Section 26-10. This 11subsection (5) does not apply to dental examinations, eye 12examinations, and the developmental screening and the social 13and emotional screening portions of the health examination. If 14the student is an out-of-state transfer student and does not 15have the proof required under this subsection (5) before 16October 15 of the current year or whatever date is set by the 17school district, then he or she may only attend classes (i) if 18he or she has proof that an appointment for the required 19vaccinations has been scheduled with a party authorized to 20submit proof of the required vaccinations. If the proof of 21vaccination required under this subsection (5) is not 22submitted within 30 days after the student is permitted to 23attend classes, then the student is not to be permitted to 24attend classes until proof of the vaccinations has been 25properly submitted. No school district or employee of a school 26district shall be held liable for any injury or illness to   HB3033- 25 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1another person that results from admitting an out-of-state 2transfer student to class that has an appointment scheduled 3pursuant to this subsection (5). 4    (6) Every school shall report to the State Board of 5Education by November 15, in the manner which that agency 6shall require, the number of children who have received the 7necessary immunizations and the health examination (other than 8a dental examination or eye examination) as required, 9indicating, of those who have not received the immunizations 10and examination as required, the number of children who are 11exempt from health examination and immunization requirements 12on religious or medical grounds as provided in subsection (8). 13On or before December 1 of each year, every public school 14district and registered nonpublic school shall make publicly 15available the immunization data they are required to submit to 16the State Board of Education by November 15. The immunization 17data made publicly available must be identical to the data the 18school district or school has reported to the State Board of 19Education.20    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education 21by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the 22number of children who have received the required dental 23examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 24required dental examination, the number of children who are 25exempt from the dental examination on religious grounds as 26provided in subsection (8) of this Section and the number of   HB3033- 26 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1children who have received a waiver under subsection (1.5) of 2this Section.3    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education 4by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the 5number of children who have received the required eye 6examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 7required eye examination, the number of children who are 8exempt from the eye examination as provided in subsection (8) 9of this Section, the number of children who have received a 10waiver under subsection (1.10) of this Section, and the total 11number of children in noncompliance with the eye examination 12requirement.13    The reported information under this subsection (6) shall 14be provided to the Department of Public Health by the State 15Board of Education.16    (7) Upon determining that the number of pupils who are 17required to be in compliance with subsection (5) of this 18Section is below 90% of the number of pupils enrolled in the 19school district, 10% of each State aid payment made pursuant 20to Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 to the school district for such 21year may be withheld by the State Board of Education until the 22number of students in compliance with subsection (5) is the 23applicable specified percentage or higher.24    (8) Children of parents or legal guardians who object to 25health, dental, or eye examinations or any part thereof, to 26immunizations, or to vision and hearing screening tests on   HB3033- 27 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1religious grounds shall not be required to undergo the 2examinations, tests, or immunizations to which they so object 3if such parents or legal guardians present to the appropriate 4local school authority a signed Certificate of Religious 5Exemption detailing the grounds for objection and the specific 6immunizations, tests, or examinations to which they object. 7The grounds for objection must set forth the specific 8religious belief that conflicts with the examination, test, 9immunization, or other medical intervention. The signed 10certificate shall also reflect the parent's or legal 11guardian's understanding of the school's exclusion policies in 12the case of a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak or 13exposure. The certificate must also be signed by the 14authorized examining health care provider responsible for the 15performance of the child's health examination confirming that 16the provider provided education to the parent or legal 17guardian on the benefits of immunization and the health risks 18to the student and to the community of the communicable 19diseases for which immunization is required in this State. 20However, the health care provider's signature on the 21certificate reflects only that education was provided and does 22not allow a health care provider grounds to determine a 23religious exemption. Those receiving immunizations required 24under this Code shall be provided with the relevant vaccine 25information statements that are required to be disseminated by 26the federal National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986,   HB3033- 28 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1which may contain information on circumstances when a vaccine 2should not be administered, prior to administering a vaccine. 3A health care healthcare provider may consider, including, 4without limitation, the nationally accepted recommendations 5from federal agencies such as the Advisory Committee on 6Immunization Practices, the information outlined in the 7relevant vaccine information statement, and vaccine package 8inserts, along with the healthcare provider's clinical 9judgment, to determine whether any child may be more 10susceptible to experiencing an adverse vaccine reaction than 11the general population, and, if so, the health care healthcare 12provider may exempt the child from an immunization or adopt an 13individualized immunization schedule. The Certificate of 14Religious Exemption shall be created by the Department of 15Public Health and shall be made available and used by parents 16and legal guardians by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school 17year. Parents or legal guardians must submit the Certificate 18of Religious Exemption to their local school authority prior 19to entering kindergarten, sixth grade, and ninth grade for 20each child for which they are requesting an exemption. The 21religious objection stated need not be directed by the tenets 22of an established religious organization. However, general 23philosophical or moral reluctance to allow physical 24examinations, eye examinations, immunizations, vision and 25hearing screenings, or dental examinations does not provide a 26sufficient basis for an exception to statutory requirements.   HB3033- 29 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1The local school authority is responsible for determining if 2the content of the Certificate of Religious Exemption 3constitutes a valid religious objection. The local school 4authority shall inform the parent or legal guardian of 5exclusion procedures, in accordance with the Department's 6rules under Part 690 of Title 77 of the Illinois 7Administrative Code, at the time the objection is presented. 8    If the physical condition of the child is such that any one 9or more of the immunizing agents should not be administered, 10the examining physician, advanced practice registered nurse, 11or physician assistant responsible for the performance of the 12health examination shall endorse that fact upon the health 13examination form.14    Exempting a child from the health, dental, or eye 15examination does not exempt the child from participation in 16the program of physical education training provided in 17Sections 27-5 through 27-7 of this Code.18    (8.5) The school board of a school district shall include 19informational materials regarding influenza and influenza 20vaccinations developed, provided, or approved by the 21Department of Public Health under Section 2310-700 of the 22Department of Public Health Powers and Duties Law of the Civil 23Administrative Code of Illinois when the board provides 24information on immunizations, infectious diseases, 25medications, or other school health issues to the parents or 26guardians of students.  HB3033- 30 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1    (9) For the purposes of this Section, "nursery schools" 2means those nursery schools operated by elementary school 3systems or secondary level school units or institutions of 4higher learning.5(Source: P.A. 103-985, eff. 1-1-25.)

Janet Yang Rohr SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 105 ILCS 5/22-80105 ILCS 5/27-8.1  from Ch. 122, par. 27-8.1    Amends the School Code. In a provision regarding student athletes and concussions and head injuries, further defines "physician" to include a chiropractic physician as defined in the Medical Practice Act of 1987. In a provision regarding health examinations and immunizations, allows a chiropractic physician licensed under the Medical Practice Act of 1987 to be responsible for the performance of an athletic physical examination and requires the chiropractic physician to sign all report forms required for the athletic physical examination. Makes conforming changes.LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b  A BILL FOR HB3033LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1    AN ACT concerning education. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The School Code is amended by changing Sections 522-80 and 27-8.1 as follows: 6    (105 ILCS 5/22-80)7    Sec. 22-80. Student athletes; concussions and head 8injuries.9    (a) The General Assembly recognizes all of the following:10        (1) Concussions are one of the most commonly reported 11    injuries in children and adolescents who participate in 12    sports and recreational activities. The Centers for 13    Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as many as 14    3,900,000 sports-related and recreation-related 15    concussions occur in the United States each year. A 16    concussion is caused by a blow or motion to the head or 17    body that causes the brain to move rapidly inside the 18    skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or death is 19    significant when a concussion or head injury is not 20    properly evaluated and managed.21        (2) Concussions are a type of brain injury that can 22    range from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain 23    normally works. Concussions can occur in any organized or   HB3033- 2 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1    unorganized sport or recreational activity and can result 2    from a fall or from players colliding with each other, the 3    ground, or with obstacles. Concussions occur with or 4    without loss of consciousness, but the vast majority of 5    concussions occur without loss of consciousness.6        (3) Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms 7    of a head injury leaves a young athlete especially 8    vulnerable to greater injury and even death. The General 9    Assembly recognizes that, despite having generally 10    recognized return-to-play standards for concussions and 11    head injuries, some affected youth athletes are 12    prematurely returned to play, resulting in actual or 13    potential physical injury or death to youth athletes in 14    this State.15        (4) Student athletes who have sustained a concussion 16    may need informal or formal accommodations, modifications 17    of curriculum, and monitoring by medical or academic staff 18    until the student is fully recovered. To that end, all 19    schools are encouraged to establish a return-to-learn 20    protocol that is based on peer-reviewed scientific 21    evidence consistent with Centers for Disease Control and 22    Prevention guidelines and conduct baseline testing for 23    student athletes.24    (b) In this Section:25    "Athletic trainer" means an athletic trainer licensed 26under the Illinois Athletic Trainers Practice Act who is   HB3033- 3 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1working under the supervision of a physician.2    "Coach" means any volunteer or employee of a school who is 3responsible for organizing and supervising students to teach 4them or train them in the fundamental skills of an 5interscholastic athletic activity. "Coach" refers to both head 6coaches and assistant coaches. 7    "Concussion" means a complex pathophysiological process 8affecting the brain caused by a traumatic physical force or 9impact to the head or body, which may include temporary or 10prolonged altered brain function resulting in physical, 11cognitive, or emotional symptoms or altered sleep patterns and 12which may or may not involve a loss of consciousness.13    "Department" means the Department of Financial and 14Professional Regulation. 15    "Game official" means a person who officiates at an 16interscholastic athletic activity, such as a referee or 17umpire, including, but not limited to, persons enrolled as 18game officials by the Illinois High School Association or 19Illinois Elementary School Association.20    "Interscholastic athletic activity" means any organized 21school-sponsored or school-sanctioned activity for students, 22generally outside of school instructional hours, under the 23direction of a coach, athletic director, or band leader, 24including, but not limited to, baseball, basketball, 25cheerleading, cross country track, fencing, field hockey, 26football, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, marching   HB3033- 4 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1band, rugby, soccer, skating, softball, swimming and diving, 2tennis, track (indoor and outdoor), ultimate Frisbee, 3volleyball, water polo, and wrestling.

Each 16concussion oversight team shall also establish a 17return-to-learn protocol, based on peer-reviewed scientific 18evidence consistent with Centers for Disease Control and 19Prevention guidelines, for a student's return to the classroom 20after that student is believed to have experienced a 21concussion, whether or not the concussion took place while the 22student was participating in an interscholastic athletic 23activity. 24    Each concussion oversight team must include to the extent 25practicable at least one physician. If a school employs an 26athletic trainer, the athletic trainer must be a member of the   HB3033- 6 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1school concussion oversight team to the extent practicable. If 2a school employs a nurse, the nurse must be a member of the 3school concussion oversight team to the extent practicable. At 4a minimum, a school shall appoint a person who is responsible 5for implementing and complying with the return-to-play and 6return-to-learn protocols adopted by the concussion oversight 7team. At a minimum, a concussion oversight team may be 8composed of only one person and this person need not be a 9licensed health care healthcare professional, but it may not 10be a coach. A school may appoint other licensed health care 11healthcare professionals to serve on the concussion oversight 12team.13    (e) A student may not participate in an interscholastic 14athletic activity for a school year until the student and the 15student's parent or guardian or another person with legal 16authority to make medical decisions for the student have 17signed a form for that school year that acknowledges receiving 18and reading written information that explains concussion 19prevention, symptoms, treatment, and oversight and that 20includes guidelines for safely resuming participation in an 21athletic activity following a concussion.

Additional health examinations of pupils, 13including eye examinations, may be required when deemed 14necessary by school authorities. Parents are encouraged to 15have their children undergo eye examinations at the same 16points in time required for health examinations.17    (1.5) In compliance with rules adopted by the Department 18of Public Health and except as otherwise provided in this 19Section, all children in kindergarten and the second, sixth, 20and ninth grades of any public, private, or parochial school 21shall have a dental examination. Each of these children shall 22present proof of having been examined by a dentist in 23accordance with this Section and rules adopted under this 24Section before May 15th of the school year.

A school may not withhold a child's report card 5during a school year in which the Governor has declared a 6disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 77 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act. The 8Department of Public Health shall establish, by rule, a waiver 9for children who show an undue burden or a lack of access to a 10dentist. Each public, private, and parochial school must give 11notice of this dental examination requirement to the parents 12and guardians of students at least 60 days before May 15th of 13each school year. 14    (1.10) Except as otherwise provided in this Section, all 15children enrolling in kindergarten in a public, private, or 16parochial school on or after January 1, 2008 (the effective 17date of Public Act 95-671) and any student enrolling for the 18first time in a public, private, or parochial school on or 19after January 1, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 2095-671) shall have an eye examination.

A school may not withhold a child's 5report card during a school year in which the Governor has 6declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant 7to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act. 8The Department of Public Health shall establish, by rule, a 9waiver for children who show an undue burden or a lack of 10access to a physician licensed to practice medicine in all of 11its branches who provides eye examinations or to a licensed 12optometrist. Each public, private, and parochial school must 13give notice of this eye examination requirement to the parents 14and guardians of students in compliance with rules of the 15Department of Public Health. Nothing in this Section shall be 16construed to allow a school to exclude a child from attending 17because of a parent's or guardian's failure to obtain an eye 18examination for the child. 19    (2) The Department of Public Health shall promulgate rules 20and regulations specifying the examinations and procedures 21that constitute a health examination, which shall include an 22age-appropriate developmental screening, an age-appropriate 23social and emotional screening, and the collection of data 24relating to asthma and obesity (including at a minimum, date 25of birth, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, and date of 26exam), and a dental examination and may recommend by rule that   HB3033- 18 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1certain additional examinations be performed. The rules and 2regulations of the Department of Public Health shall specify 3that a tuberculosis skin test screening shall be included as a 4required part of each health examination included under this 5Section if the child resides in an area designated by the 6Department of Public Health as having a high incidence of 7tuberculosis. With respect to the developmental screening and 8the social and emotional screening, the Department of Public 9Health must, no later than January 1, 2019, develop rules and 10appropriate revisions to the Child Health Examination form in 11conjunction with a statewide organization representing school 12boards; a statewide organization representing pediatricians; 13statewide organizations representing individuals holding 14Illinois educator licenses with school support personnel 15endorsements, including school social workers, school 16psychologists, and school nurses; a statewide organization 17representing children's mental health experts; a statewide 18organization representing school principals; the Director of 19Healthcare and Family Services or his or her designee, the 20State Superintendent of Education or his or her designee; and 21representatives of other appropriate State agencies and, at a 22minimum, must recommend the use of validated screening tools 23appropriate to the child's age or grade, and, with regard to 24the social and emotional screening, require recording only 25whether or not the screening was completed. The rules shall 26take into consideration the screening recommendations of the   HB3033- 19 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1American Academy of Pediatrics and must be consistent with the 2State Board of Education's social and emotional learning 3standards. The Department of Public Health shall specify that 4a diabetes screening as defined by rule shall be included as a 5required part of each health examination. Diabetes testing is 6not required.7    Physicians licensed to practice medicine in all of its 8branches, licensed advanced practice registered nurses, or 9licensed physician assistants shall be responsible for the 10performance of the health examinations, other than dental 11examinations, eye examinations, and vision and hearing 12screening, and shall sign all report forms required by 13subsection (4) of this Section that pertain to those portions 14of the health examination for which the physician, advanced 15practice registered nurse, or physician assistant is 16responsible. However, if the health examination is an athletic 17physical examination, then a chiropractic physician licensed 18under the Medical Practice Act of 1987 may also be responsible 19for the performance of the athletic physical examination and 20must sign all report forms required for the athletic physical 21examination. If a registered nurse performs any part of a 22health examination, then a physician licensed to practice 23medicine in all of its branches must review and sign all 24required report forms. Licensed dentists shall perform all 25dental examinations and shall sign all report forms required 26by subsection (4) of this Section that pertain to the dental   HB3033- 20 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1examinations. Physicians licensed to practice medicine in all 2its branches or licensed optometrists shall perform all eye 3examinations required by this Section and shall sign all 4report forms required by subsection (4) of this Section that 5pertain to the eye examination. For purposes of this Section, 6an eye examination shall at a minimum include history, visual 7acuity, subjective refraction to best visual acuity near and 8far, internal and external examination, and a glaucoma 9evaluation, as well as any other tests or observations that in 10the professional judgment of the doctor are necessary. Vision 11and hearing screening tests, which shall not be considered 12examinations as that term is used in this Section, shall be 13conducted in accordance with rules and regulations of the 14Department of Public Health, and by individuals whom the 15Department of Public Health has certified. In these rules and 16regulations, the Department of Public Health shall require 17that individuals conducting vision screening tests give a 18child's parent or guardian written notification, before the 19vision screening is conducted, that states, "Vision screening 20is not a substitute for a complete eye and vision evaluation by 21an eye doctor. Your child is not required to undergo this 22vision screening if an optometrist or ophthalmologist has 23completed and signed a report form indicating that an 24examination has been administered within the previous 12 25months.".26    (2.5) With respect to the developmental screening and the   HB3033- 21 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1social and emotional screening portion of the health 2examination, each child may present proof of having been 3screened in accordance with this Section and the rules adopted 4under this Section before October 15th of the school year. 5With regard to the social and emotional screening only, the 6examining health care provider shall only record whether or 7not the screening was completed. If the child fails to present 8proof of the developmental screening or the social and 9emotional screening portions of the health examination by 10October 15th of the school year, qualified school support 11personnel may, with a parent's or guardian's consent, offer 12the developmental screening or the social and emotional 13screening to the child. Each public, private, and parochial 14school must give notice of the developmental screening and 15social and emotional screening requirements to the parents and 16guardians of students in compliance with the rules of the 17Department of Public Health. Nothing in this Section shall be 18construed to allow a school to exclude a child from attending 19because of a parent's or guardian's failure to obtain a 20developmental screening or a social and emotional screening 21for the child. Once a developmental screening or a social and 22emotional screening is completed and proof has been presented 23to the school, the school may, with a parent's or guardian's 24consent, make available appropriate school personnel to work 25with the parent or guardian, the child, and the provider who 26signed the screening form to obtain any appropriate   HB3033- 22 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1evaluations and services as indicated on the form and in other 2information and documentation provided by the parents, 3guardians, or provider.4    (3) Every child shall, at or about the same time as he or 5she receives a health examination required by subsection (1) 6of this Section, present to the local school proof of having 7received such immunizations against preventable communicable 8diseases as the Department of Public Health shall require by 9rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this Section and 10the Communicable Disease Prevention Act.11    (4) The individuals conducting the health examination, 12including an athletic physical examination, dental 13examination, or eye examination shall record the fact of 14having conducted the examination, and such additional 15information as required, including for a health examination 16data relating to asthma and obesity (including at a minimum, 17date of birth, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, and 18date of exam), on uniform forms which the Department of Public 19Health and the State Board of Education shall prescribe for 20statewide use. The examiner shall summarize on the report form 21any condition that he or she suspects indicates a need for 22special services, including for a health examination factors 23relating to asthma or obesity. The duty to summarize on the 24report form does not apply to social and emotional screenings. 25The confidentiality of the information and records relating to 26the developmental screening and the social and emotional   HB3033- 23 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1screening shall be determined by the statutes, rules, and 2professional ethics governing the type of provider conducting 3the screening. The individuals confirming the administration 4of required immunizations shall record as indicated on the 5form that the immunizations were administered.6    (5) If a child does not submit proof of having had either 7the health examination or the immunization as required, then 8the child shall be examined or receive the immunization, as 9the case may be, and present proof by October 15 of the current 10school year, or by an earlier date of the current school year 11established by a school district. To establish a date before 12October 15 of the current school year for the health 13examination or immunization as required, a school district 14must give notice of the requirements of this Section 60 days 15prior to the earlier established date. If for medical reasons 16one or more of the required immunizations must be given after 17October 15 of the current school year, or after an earlier 18established date of the current school year, then the child 19shall present, by October 15, or by the earlier established 20date, a schedule for the administration of the immunizations 21and a statement of the medical reasons causing the delay, both 22the schedule and the statement being issued by the physician, 23advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, 24registered nurse, or local health department that will be 25responsible for administration of the remaining required 26immunizations. If a child does not comply by October 15, or by   HB3033- 24 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1the earlier established date of the current school year, with 2the requirements of this subsection, then the local school 3authority shall exclude that child from school until such time 4as the child presents proof of having had the health 5examination as required and presents proof of having received 6those required immunizations which are medically possible to 7receive immediately. During a child's exclusion from school 8for noncompliance with this subsection, the child's parents or 9legal guardian shall be considered in violation of Section 1026-1 and subject to any penalty imposed by Section 26-10. This 11subsection (5) does not apply to dental examinations, eye 12examinations, and the developmental screening and the social 13and emotional screening portions of the health examination. If 14the student is an out-of-state transfer student and does not 15have the proof required under this subsection (5) before 16October 15 of the current year or whatever date is set by the 17school district, then he or she may only attend classes (i) if 18he or she has proof that an appointment for the required 19vaccinations has been scheduled with a party authorized to 20submit proof of the required vaccinations. If the proof of 21vaccination required under this subsection (5) is not 22submitted within 30 days after the student is permitted to 23attend classes, then the student is not to be permitted to 24attend classes until proof of the vaccinations has been 25properly submitted. No school district or employee of a school 26district shall be held liable for any injury or illness to   HB3033- 25 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1another person that results from admitting an out-of-state 2transfer student to class that has an appointment scheduled 3pursuant to this subsection (5). 4    (6) Every school shall report to the State Board of 5Education by November 15, in the manner which that agency 6shall require, the number of children who have received the 7necessary immunizations and the health examination (other than 8a dental examination or eye examination) as required, 9indicating, of those who have not received the immunizations 10and examination as required, the number of children who are 11exempt from health examination and immunization requirements 12on religious or medical grounds as provided in subsection (8). 13On or before December 1 of each year, every public school 14district and registered nonpublic school shall make publicly 15available the immunization data they are required to submit to 16the State Board of Education by November 15. The immunization 17data made publicly available must be identical to the data the 18school district or school has reported to the State Board of 19Education.20    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education 21by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the 22number of children who have received the required dental 23examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 24required dental examination, the number of children who are 25exempt from the dental examination on religious grounds as 26provided in subsection (8) of this Section and the number of   HB3033- 26 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1children who have received a waiver under subsection (1.5) of 2this Section.3    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education 4by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the 5number of children who have received the required eye 6examination, indicating, of those who have not received the 7required eye examination, the number of children who are 8exempt from the eye examination as provided in subsection (8) 9of this Section, the number of children who have received a 10waiver under subsection (1.10) of this Section, and the total 11number of children in noncompliance with the eye examination 12requirement.13    The reported information under this subsection (6) shall 14be provided to the Department of Public Health by the State 15Board of Education.16    (7) Upon determining that the number of pupils who are 17required to be in compliance with subsection (5) of this 18Section is below 90% of the number of pupils enrolled in the 19school district, 10% of each State aid payment made pursuant 20to Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 to the school district for such 21year may be withheld by the State Board of Education until the 22number of students in compliance with subsection (5) is the 23applicable specified percentage or higher.24    (8) Children of parents or legal guardians who object to 25health, dental, or eye examinations or any part thereof, to 26immunizations, or to vision and hearing screening tests on   HB3033- 27 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1religious grounds shall not be required to undergo the 2examinations, tests, or immunizations to which they so object 3if such parents or legal guardians present to the appropriate 4local school authority a signed Certificate of Religious 5Exemption detailing the grounds for objection and the specific 6immunizations, tests, or examinations to which they object. 7The grounds for objection must set forth the specific 8religious belief that conflicts with the examination, test, 9immunization, or other medical intervention. The signed 10certificate shall also reflect the parent's or legal 11guardian's understanding of the school's exclusion policies in 12the case of a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak or 13exposure. The certificate must also be signed by the 14authorized examining health care provider responsible for the 15performance of the child's health examination confirming that 16the provider provided education to the parent or legal 17guardian on the benefits of immunization and the health risks 18to the student and to the community of the communicable 19diseases for which immunization is required in this State. 20However, the health care provider's signature on the 21certificate reflects only that education was provided and does 22not allow a health care provider grounds to determine a 23religious exemption. Those receiving immunizations required 24under this Code shall be provided with the relevant vaccine 25information statements that are required to be disseminated by 26the federal National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986,   HB3033- 28 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1which may contain information on circumstances when a vaccine 2should not be administered, prior to administering a vaccine. 3A health care healthcare provider may consider, including, 4without limitation, the nationally accepted recommendations 5from federal agencies such as the Advisory Committee on 6Immunization Practices, the information outlined in the 7relevant vaccine information statement, and vaccine package 8inserts, along with the healthcare provider's clinical 9judgment, to determine whether any child may be more 10susceptible to experiencing an adverse vaccine reaction than 11the general population, and, if so, the health care healthcare 12provider may exempt the child from an immunization or adopt an 13individualized immunization schedule. The Certificate of 14Religious Exemption shall be created by the Department of 15Public Health and shall be made available and used by parents 16and legal guardians by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school 17year. Parents or legal guardians must submit the Certificate 18of Religious Exemption to their local school authority prior 19to entering kindergarten, sixth grade, and ninth grade for 20each child for which they are requesting an exemption. The 21religious objection stated need not be directed by the tenets 22of an established religious organization. However, general 23philosophical or moral reluctance to allow physical 24examinations, eye examinations, immunizations, vision and 25hearing screenings, or dental examinations does not provide a 26sufficient basis for an exception to statutory requirements.   HB3033- 29 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1The local school authority is responsible for determining if 2the content of the Certificate of Religious Exemption 3constitutes a valid religious objection. The local school 4authority shall inform the parent or legal guardian of 5exclusion procedures, in accordance with the Department's 6rules under Part 690 of Title 77 of the Illinois 7Administrative Code, at the time the objection is presented. 8    If the physical condition of the child is such that any one 9or more of the immunizing agents should not be administered, 10the examining physician, advanced practice registered nurse, 11or physician assistant responsible for the performance of the 12health examination shall endorse that fact upon the health 13examination form.14    Exempting a child from the health, dental, or eye 15examination does not exempt the child from participation in 16the program of physical education training provided in 17Sections 27-5 through 27-7 of this Code.18    (8.5) The school board of a school district shall include 19informational materials regarding influenza and influenza 20vaccinations developed, provided, or approved by the 21Department of Public Health under Section 2310-700 of the 22Department of Public Health Powers and Duties Law of the Civil 23Administrative Code of Illinois when the board provides 24information on immunizations, infectious diseases, 25medications, or other school health issues to the parents or 26guardians of students.  HB3033- 30 -LRB104 09562 LNS 19625 b1    (9) For the purposes of this Section, "nursery schools" 2means those nursery schools operated by elementary school 3systems or secondary level school units or institutions of 4higher learning.5(Source: P.A. 103-985, eff. 1-1-25.)
