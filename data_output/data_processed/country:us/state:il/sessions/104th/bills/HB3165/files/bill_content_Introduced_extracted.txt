The burden of proof in 23establishing that the local school council's decision was 24arbitrary and capricious shall be on the party requesting the 25arbitration, and this party shall sustain the burden by a 26preponderance of the evidence. The hearing officer shall set   HB3165- 18 -LRB104 08142 LNS 18188 b1the local school council decision aside if that decision, in 2light of the record developed at the hearing, is arbitrary and 3capricious. The decision of the hearing officer may not be 4appealed to the Board or the State Board of Education.

The burden of proof in 23establishing that the local school council's decision was 24arbitrary and capricious shall be on the party requesting the 25arbitration, and this party shall sustain the burden by a 26preponderance of the evidence. The hearing officer shall set   HB3165- 18 -LRB104 08142 LNS 18188 b1the local school council decision aside if that decision, in 2light of the record developed at the hearing, is arbitrary and 3capricious. The decision of the hearing officer may not be 4appealed to the Board or the State Board of Education. If the 5hearing officer decides that the principal shall be retained, 6the retention period shall not exceed 2 years.7    2.

A principal whose performance contract 20is not renewed as provided under subsection (c) of Section 2134-2.2 may nevertheless, if otherwise qualified and licensed 22as herein provided and if he or she has received a satisfactory 23rating as provided in subsection (h) of Section 34-8.3, be 24included by a local school council as one of the 3 candidates 25listed in order of preference on any candidate list from which 26one person is to be selected to serve as principal of the   HB3165- 20 -LRB104 08142 LNS 18188 b1attendance center under a new performance contract.

The board shall 9establish, in writing, criteria for determining whether or not 10a school shall remain on probation. If academic achievement 11tests are used as the factor for placing a school on probation, 12the general superintendent shall consider objective criteria, 13not just an increase in test scores, in deciding whether or not 14a school shall remain on probation. These criteria shall 15include attendance, test scores, student mobility rates, 16poverty rates, bilingual education eligibility, special 17education, and English language proficiency programs, with 18progress made in these areas being taken into consideration in 19deciding whether or not a school shall remain on probation. 20Such criteria shall be delivered to each local school council 21on or before August 1 October 31 of each year. 22    (e-5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 23to the contrary, a school that has been on probation for 5 24years or more shall have the following powers restored to its 25local school council: 26        (1) to grant approval of the school improvement plan;   HB3165- 35 -LRB104 08142 LNS 18188 b1    and2        (2) to approve the school budget. 3    With respect to the employment, dismissal, and evaluation 4of a school principal, the local school council of a school 5that has been on probation for 5 years or more shall conduct a 6non-binding poll that must be considered by the network chief. 7The network chief shall work collaboratively with the local 8school council throughout the process of employment, 9dismissal, and evaluation of a school principal. 10    (f) Where the board has reason to believe that violations 11of civil rights, or of civil or criminal law have occurred, or 12when the general superintendent deems that the school is in 13educational crisis it may take immediate corrective action, 14including the actions specified in this Section, without first 15placing the school on remediation or probation. Nothing 16described herein shall limit the authority of the board as 17provided by any law of this State. The board shall develop 18criteria governing the determination regarding when a school 19is in educational crisis. Such criteria shall be delivered to 20each local school council on or before August 1 October 31 of 21each year. 22    (g) All persons serving as subdistrict superintendent on 23May 1, 1995 shall be deemed by operation of law to be serving 24under a performance contract which expires on June 30, 1995, 25and the employment of each such person as subdistrict 26superintendent shall terminate on June 30, 1995.
