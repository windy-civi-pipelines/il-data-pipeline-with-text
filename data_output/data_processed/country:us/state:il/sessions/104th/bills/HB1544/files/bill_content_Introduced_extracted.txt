The 15Environmental Protection Agency, Illinois Power Agency, and 16Illinois Commerce Commission shall consult PJM 17Interconnection, LLC and Midcontinent Independent System 18Operator, Inc., or their respective successor organizations 19regarding forecasted resource adequacy and reliability needs, 20anticipated new generation interconnection, new transmission 21development or upgrades, and any announced large GHG-emitting 22unit closure dates and include this information in the report. 23The report shall be released publicly by no later than 24December 15 of the year it is prepared. If the Environmental 25Protection Agency, Illinois Power Agency, and Illinois 26Commerce Commission jointly conclude in the report that the   HB1544- 12 -LRB104 03409 BDA 13431 b1data from the regional grid operators, the pace of renewable 2energy development, the pace of development of energy storage 3and demand response utilization, transmission capacity, and 4the CO2e and copollutant emissions reductions required by 5subsection (i) or (k-5) reasonably demonstrate that a resource 6adequacy shortfall will occur, including whether there will be 7sufficient in-state capacity to meet the zonal requirements of 8MISO Zone 4 or the PJM ComEd Zone, per the requirements of the 9regional transmission organizations, or that the regional 10transmission operators determine that a reliability violation 11will occur during the time frame the study is evaluating, then 12the Illinois Power Agency, in conjunction with the 13Environmental Protection Agency shall develop a plan to reduce 14or delay CO2e and copollutant emissions reductions 15requirements only to the extent and for the duration necessary 16to meet the resource adequacy and reliability needs of the 17State, including allowing any plants whose emission reduction 18deadline has been identified in the plan as creating a 19reliability concern to continue operating, including operating 20with reduced emissions or as emergency backup where 21appropriate. The plan shall also consider the use of renewable 22energy, energy storage, demand response, transmission 23development, or other strategies to resolve the identified 24resource adequacy shortfall or reliability violation.25        (1) In developing the plan, the Environmental 26    Protection Agency and the Illinois Power Agency shall hold   HB1544- 13 -LRB104 03409 BDA 13431 b1    at least one workshop open to, and accessible at a time and 2    place convenient to, the public and shall consider any 3    comments made by stakeholders or the public. Upon 4    development of the plan, copies of the plan shall be 5    posted and made publicly available on the Environmental 6    Protection Agency's, the Illinois Power Agency's, and the 7    Illinois Commerce Commission's websites. All interested 8    parties shall have 60 days following the date of posting 9    to provide comment to the Environmental Protection Agency 10    and the Illinois Power Agency on the plan. All comments 11    submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency and the 12    Illinois Power Agency shall be encouraged to be specific, 13    supported by data or other detailed analyses, and, if 14    objecting to all or a portion of the plan, accompanied by 15    specific alternative wording or proposals. All comments 16    shall be posted on the Environmental Protection Agency's, 17    the Illinois Power Agency's, and the Illinois Commerce 18    Commission's websites. Within 30 days following the end of 19    the 60-day review period, the Environmental Protection 20    Agency and the Illinois Power Agency shall revise the plan 21    as necessary based on the comments received and file its 22    revised plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission for 23    approval.24        (2) Within 60 days after the filing of the revised 25    plan at the Illinois Commerce Commission, any person 26    objecting to the plan shall file an objection with the   HB1544- 14 -LRB104 03409 BDA 13431 b1    Illinois Commerce Commission. Within 30 days after the 2    expiration of the comment period, the Illinois Commerce 3    Commission shall determine whether an evidentiary hearing 4    is necessary. The Illinois Commerce Commission shall also 5    host 3 public hearings within 90 days after the plan is 6    filed. Following the evidentiary and public hearings, the 7    Illinois Commerce Commission shall enter its order 8    approving or approving with modifications the reliability 9    mitigation plan within 180 days.10        (3) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall only 11    approve the plan if the Illinois Commerce Commission 12    determines that it will resolve the resource adequacy or 13    reliability deficiency identified in the reliability 14    mitigation plan at the least amount of CO2e and copollutant 15    emissions, taking into consideration the emissions impacts 16    on environmental justice communities, and that it will 17    ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and 18    environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest 19    total cost over time, taking into account the impact of 20    increases in emissions.21        (4) If the resource adequacy or reliability deficiency 22    identified in the reliability mitigation plan is resolved 23    or reduced, the Environmental Protection Agency and the 24    Illinois Power Agency may file an amended plan adjusting 25    the reduction or delay in CO2e and copollutant emission 26    reduction requirements identified in the plan.   HB1544- 15 -LRB104 03409 BDA 13431 b1(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 102-1031, eff. 5-27-22.)
