Except as otherwise provided in this Section 11upon application to vote each registered elector shall sign 12his name or make his mark as the case may be, on a certificate 13substantially as follows:14CERTIFICATE OF REGISTERED VOTER15City of ....... Ward ....... Precinct .......16Election ....... (Date) ....... (Month) ....... (Year)17Registration Record .......18Checked by .......19Voter's number ....20INSTRUCTION TO VOTERS21    Sign this certificate and hand it to the election officer 22in charge. After the registration record has been checked, the 23officer will hand it back to you. Whereupon you shall present   SB2158- 2 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1it to the officer in charge of the ballots.2    I hereby certify that I am registered from the address 3below and am qualified to vote.4Signature of voter .......5residence address .......6    An individual shall not be required to provide his social 7security number when applying for a ballot. He shall not be 8denied a ballot, nor shall his ballot be challenged, solely 9because of his refusal to provide his social security number. 10Nothing in this Act prevents an individual from being 11requested to provide his social security number when the 12individual applies for a ballot. If, however, the certificate 13contains a space for the individual's social security number, 14the following notice shall appear on the certificate, 15immediately above such space, in bold-face capital letters, in 16type the size of which equals the largest type on the 17certificate:18    "THE INDIVIDUAL APPLYING FOR A BALLOT WITH THIS DOCUMENT 19IS NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE HIS OR HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. 20HE OR SHE MAY NOT BE DENIED A BALLOT, NOR SHALL HIS OR HER 21BALLOT BE CHALLENGED, SOLELY BECAUSE OF HIS OR HER REFUSAL TO 22PROVIDE HIS OR HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER."23    The certificates of each State-wide political party at a 24general primary election shall be separately printed upon 25paper of uniform quality, texture and size, but the 26certificates of no 2 State-wide political parties shall be of   SB2158- 3 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1the same color or tint. However, if the election authority 2provides computer generated applications with the precinct, 3ballot style and voter's name and address preprinted on the 4application, a single application may be used for State-wide 5political parties if it contains spaces or check-off boxes to 6indicate the political party. Such application shall not 7entitle the voter to vote in the primary of more than one 8political party at the same election.9    At the consolidated primary, such certificates may contain 10spaces or checkoff boxes permitting the voter to request a 11primary ballot of any other political party which is 12established only within a political subdivision and for which 13a primary is conducted on the same election day. Such 14application shall not entitle the voter to vote in both the 15primary of the State-wide political party and the primary of 16the local political party with respect to the offices of the 17same political subdivision. In no event may a voter vote in 18more than one State-wide primary on the same day.19    The judges in charge of the precinct registration files 20shall compare the signature upon such certificate with the 21signature on the registration record card as a means of 22identifying the voter. Unless satisfied by such comparison 23that the applicant to vote is the identical person who is 24registered under the same name, the judges shall ask such 25applicant the questions for identification which appear on the 26registration card, and if the applicant does not prove to the   SB2158- 4 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1satisfaction of a majority of the judges of the election 2precinct that he is the identical person registered under the 3name in question then the vote of such applicant shall be 4challenged by a judge of election, and the same procedure 5followed as provided by law for challenged voters.6    In case the elector is unable to sign his name, a judge of 7election shall check the data on the registration card and 8shall check the address given, with the registered address, in 9order to determine whether he is entitled to vote.10    One of the judges of election shall check the certificate 11of each applicant for a ballot after the registration record 12has been examined, and shall sign his initials on the 13certificate in the space provided therefor, and shall enter 14upon such certificate the number of the voter in the place 15provided therefor, and make an entry in the voting record 16space on the registration record, to indicate whether or not 17the applicant voted. Such judge shall then hand such 18certificate back to the applicant in case he is permitted to 19vote, and such applicant shall hand it to the judge of election 20in charge of the ballots. The certificates of the voters shall 21be filed in the order in which they are received and shall 22constitute an official poll record. The term "poll lists" and 23"poll books", where used in this Article, shall be construed 24to apply to such official poll record.25    After each general primary election the county clerk shall 26indicate by color code or other means next to the name of each   SB2158- 5 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1registrant on the list of registered voters in each precinct 2the primary ballot of a political party that the registrant 3requested at that general primary election. The county clerk, 4within 60 days after the general primary election, shall 5provide a copy of this coded list to the chair of the county 6central committee of each established political party or to 7the chair's duly authorized representative.8    Within 60 days after the effective date of this amendatory 9Act of 1983, the county clerk shall provide to the chair of the 10county central committee of each established political party 11or to the chair's duly authorized representative the list of 12registered voters in each precinct at the time of the general 13primary election of 1982 and shall indicate on such list by 14color code or other means next to the name of a registrant the 15primary ballot of a political party that the registrant 16requested at the general primary election of 1982.17    The county clerk may charge a fee to reimburse the actual 18cost of duplicating each copy of a list provided under either 19of the 2 preceding paragraphs.20    Where an elector makes application to vote by signing and 21presenting the certificate provided by this Section, and his 22registration record card is not found in the precinct registry 23of voters, but his name appears as that of a registered voter 24in such precinct upon the printed precinct register as 25corrected or revised by the supplemental list, or upon the 26consolidated list, if any, and whose name has not been erased   SB2158- 6 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1or withdrawn from such register, the printed precinct register 2as corrected or revised by the supplemental list, or 3consolidated list, if any, shall be prima facie evidence of 4the elector's right to vote upon compliance with the 5provisions hereinafter set forth in this Section. In such 6event one of the judges of election shall require an affidavit 7by such person and one voter residing in the precinct before 8the judges of election, substantially in the form prescribed 9in Section 17-10 of this Act, and upon the presentation of such 10affidavits, a certificate shall be issued to such elector, and 11upon the presentation of such certificate and affidavits, he 12shall be entitled to vote.13    Provided, however, that applications for ballots made by 14registered voters under the provisions of Article 19 of this 15Act shall be accepted by the Judges of Election in lieu of the 16"Certificate of Registered Voter" provided for in this 17Section.18    When the county clerk delivers to the judges of election 19for use at the polls a supplemental or consolidated list of the 20printed precinct register, he shall give a copy of the 21supplemental or consolidated list to the chair of a county 22central committee of an established political party or to the 23chair's duly authorized representative.24    Whenever 2 or more elections occur simultaneously, the 25election authority charged with the duty of providing 26application certificates may prescribe the form thereof so   SB2158- 7 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1that a voter is required to execute only one, indicating in 2which of the elections he desires to vote.3    After the signature has been verified, the judges shall 4determine in which political subdivisions the voter resides by 5use of the information contained on the voter registration 6cards or the separate registration lists or other means 7approved by the State Board of Elections and prepared and 8supplied by the election authority. The voter's certificate 9shall be so marked by the judges as to show the respective 10ballots which the voter is given.11(Source: P.A. 100-1027, eff. 1-1-19.) 12    (10 ILCS 5/5-29)  (from Ch. 46, par. 5-29)13    Sec. 5-29.

If, however, the certificate 17contains a space for the individual's social security number, 18the following notice shall appear on the certificate, 19immediately above such space, in bold-face capital letters, in 20type the size of which equals the largest type on the 21certificate:22    "THE INDIVIDUAL APPLYING FOR A BALLOT WITH THIS DOCUMENT 23IS NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE HIS OR HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. 24HE OR SHE MAY NOT BE DENIED A BALLOT, NOR SHALL HIS OR HER 25BALLOT BE CHALLENGED, SOLELY BECAUSE OF HIS OR HER REFUSAL TO 26PROVIDE HIS OR HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER."  SB2158- 9 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1    Certificates as above prescribed shall be furnished by the 2county clerk for all elections.3    The Judges in charge of the precinct registration files 4shall compare the signature upon such certificate with the 5signature on the registration record card as a means of 6identifying the voter.

The counter shall be incremented 16only by the casting of a ballot. The counter shall be designed 17to prevent disabling or resetting by other than authorized 18persons after the polls close. The counter shall be visible to 19all judges of election so long as the device is installed at 20the polling place.21    (h) Each system voting device shall be equipped with a 22protective counter that records all of the testing and 23election ballots cast since the unit was built. This counter 24shall be designed so that its reading cannot be changed by any 25cause other than the casting of a ballot. The protective 26counter shall be incapable of ever being reset and it shall be   SB2158- 98 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1visible at all times when the device is configured for 2testing, maintenance, or election use.3    (i) All system devices shall provide a means of preventing 4further voting once the polling place has closed and after all 5eligible voters have voted. Such means of control shall 6incorporate a visible indication of system status. Each device 7shall prevent any unauthorized use, prevent tampering with 8ballot labels and preclude its re-opening once the poll 9closing has been completed for that election.10    (j) The system shall produce a printed summary report of 11the votes cast upon each voting device. Until the proper 12sequence of events associated with closing the polling place 13has been completed, the system shall not allow the printing of 14a report or the extraction of data. The printed report shall 15also contain all system audit information to be required by 16the election authority. Data shall not be altered or otherwise 17destroyed by report generation and the system shall ensure the 18integrity and security of data for a period of at least 6 19months after the polls close.20    (k) If more than one voting device is used in a polling 21place, the system shall provide a means to manually or 22electronically consolidate the data from all such units into a 23single report even if different voting systems are used to 24record ballots. The system shall also be capable of merging 25the vote tabulation results produced by other vote tabulation 26systems, if necessary.  SB2158- 99 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1    (l) System functions shall be implemented such that 2unauthorized access to them is prevented and the execution of 3authorized functions in an improper sequence is precluded. 4System functions shall be executable only in the intended 5manner and order, and only under the intended conditions. If 6the preconditions to a system function have not been met, the 7function shall be precluded from executing by the system's 8control logic.9    (m) All system voting devices shall incorporate at least 3 10memories in the machine itself and in its programmable memory 11devices.12    (n) The system shall include capabilities of recording and 13reporting the date and time of normal and abnormal events and 14of maintaining a permanent record of audit information that 15cannot be turned off. Provisions shall be made to detect and 16record significant events (e.g., casting a ballot, error 17conditions that cannot be disposed of by the system itself, 18time-dependent or programmed events that occur without the 19intervention of the voter or a judge of election).20    (o) The system and each system voting device must be 21capable of creating, printing and maintaining a permanent 22paper record and an electronic image of each ballot that is 23cast such that records of individual ballots are maintained by 24a subsystem independent and distinct from the main vote 25detection, interpretation, processing and reporting path. The 26electronic images of each ballot must protect the integrity of   SB2158- 100 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1the data and the anonymity of each voter, for example, by means 2of storage location scrambling. The ballot image records may 3be either machine-readable or manually transcribed, or both, 4at the discretion of the election authority.5    (p) The system shall include built-in test, measurement 6and diagnostic software and hardware for detecting and 7reporting the system's status and degree of operability.8    (q) The system shall contain provisions for maintaining 9the integrity of memory voting and audit data during an 10election and for a period of at least 6 months thereafter and 11shall provide the means for creating an audit trail.12    (r) The system shall be fully accessible so as to permit 13blind or visually impaired voters as well as voters with 14physical disabilities to exercise their right to vote in 15private and without assistance.16    (s) The system shall provide alternative language 17accessibility if required pursuant to Section 203 of the 18Voting Rights Act of 1965.19    (t) Each voting device shall enable a voter to vote for a 20person whose name does not appear on the ballot.21    (u) The system shall record and count accurately each vote 22properly cast for or against any candidate and for or against 23any public question, including the names of all candidates 24whose names are written in by the voters.25    (v) The system shall allow for accepting provisional 26ballots and for separating such provisional ballots from   SB2158- 101 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1precinct totals until authorized by the election authority.2    (w) The system shall provide an effective audit trail as 3defined in Section 24C-2 in this Code.4    (x) The system shall be suitably designed for the purpose 5used, be durably constructed, and be designed for safety, 6accuracy and efficiency.7    (y) The system shall comply with all provisions of 8federal, State and local election laws and regulations and any 9future modifications to those laws and regulations.10(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15; 99-143, eff. 7-27-15.) 11    (10 ILCS 5/25-10)  (from Ch. 46, par. 25-10)12    Sec. 25-10. This Section applies only to counties of 133,000,000 or more population. When a vacancy occurs in the 14office of Clerk of the Circuit Court of any of the counties in 15this State, it shall be the duty of the Circuit Judges of the 16respective judicial circuit in which such vacancy may occur, 17to make an appointment to fill the vacancy for the remainder of 18the unexpired term. However, if more than 28 months remain in 19the term, the appointment shall be until the next general 20election, at which time a clerk of the circuit court shall be 21elected for the balance of the unexpired term. The appointee 22shall be a member of the same political party as the person he 23succeeds was at the time of his election and shall be otherwise 24eligible to serve as Clerk of the Circuit Court. The Circuit 25Judges may appoint a Clerk Pro Tempore for whatever period is   SB2158- 102 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1necessary while reviewing the qualifications of candidates for 2appointment to the office.3(Source: P.A. 90-672, eff. 7-31-98.) 4    (10 ILCS 5/Art. 10 rep.)5    Section 10.

Except as otherwise provided in this Section 11upon application to vote each registered elector shall sign 12his name or make his mark as the case may be, on a certificate 13substantially as follows:14CERTIFICATE OF REGISTERED VOTER15City of ....... Ward ....... Precinct .......16Election ....... (Date) ....... (Month) ....... (Year)17Registration Record .......18Checked by .......19Voter's number ....20INSTRUCTION TO VOTERS21    Sign this certificate and hand it to the election officer 22in charge. After the registration record has been checked, the 23officer will hand it back to you. Whereupon you shall present   SB2158- 2 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1it to the officer in charge of the ballots.2    I hereby certify that I am registered from the address 3below and am qualified to vote.4Signature of voter .......5residence address .......6    An individual shall not be required to provide his social 7security number when applying for a ballot. He shall not be 8denied a ballot, nor shall his ballot be challenged, solely 9because of his refusal to provide his social security number. 10Nothing in this Act prevents an individual from being 11requested to provide his social security number when the 12individual applies for a ballot. If, however, the certificate 13contains a space for the individual's social security number, 14the following notice shall appear on the certificate, 15immediately above such space, in bold-face capital letters, in 16type the size of which equals the largest type on the 17certificate:18    "THE INDIVIDUAL APPLYING FOR A BALLOT WITH THIS DOCUMENT 19IS NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE HIS OR HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. 20HE OR SHE MAY NOT BE DENIED A BALLOT, NOR SHALL HIS OR HER 21BALLOT BE CHALLENGED, SOLELY BECAUSE OF HIS OR HER REFUSAL TO 22PROVIDE HIS OR HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER."23    The certificates of each State-wide political party at a 24general primary election shall be separately printed upon 25paper of uniform quality, texture and size, but the 26certificates of no 2 State-wide political parties shall be of   SB2158- 3 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1the same color or tint. However, if the election authority 2provides computer generated applications with the precinct, 3ballot style and voter's name and address preprinted on the 4application, a single application may be used for State-wide 5political parties if it contains spaces or check-off boxes to 6indicate the political party. Such application shall not 7entitle the voter to vote in the primary of more than one 8political party at the same election.9    At the consolidated primary, such certificates may contain 10spaces or checkoff boxes permitting the voter to request a 11primary ballot of any other political party which is 12established only within a political subdivision and for which 13a primary is conducted on the same election day. Such 14application shall not entitle the voter to vote in both the 15primary of the State-wide political party and the primary of 16the local political party with respect to the offices of the 17same political subdivision. In no event may a voter vote in 18more than one State-wide primary on the same day.19    The judges in charge of the precinct registration files 20shall compare the signature upon such certificate with the 21signature on the registration record card as a means of 22identifying the voter. Unless satisfied by such comparison 23that the applicant to vote is the identical person who is 24registered under the same name, the judges shall ask such 25applicant the questions for identification which appear on the 26registration card, and if the applicant does not prove to the   SB2158- 4 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1satisfaction of a majority of the judges of the election 2precinct that he is the identical person registered under the 3name in question then the vote of such applicant shall be 4challenged by a judge of election, and the same procedure 5followed as provided by law for challenged voters.6    In case the elector is unable to sign his name, a judge of 7election shall check the data on the registration card and 8shall check the address given, with the registered address, in 9order to determine whether he is entitled to vote.10    One of the judges of election shall check the certificate 11of each applicant for a ballot after the registration record 12has been examined, and shall sign his initials on the 13certificate in the space provided therefor, and shall enter 14upon such certificate the number of the voter in the place 15provided therefor, and make an entry in the voting record 16space on the registration record, to indicate whether or not 17the applicant voted. Such judge shall then hand such 18certificate back to the applicant in case he is permitted to 19vote, and such applicant shall hand it to the judge of election 20in charge of the ballots. The certificates of the voters shall 21be filed in the order in which they are received and shall 22constitute an official poll record. The term "poll lists" and 23"poll books", where used in this Article, shall be construed 24to apply to such official poll record.25    After each general primary election the county clerk shall 26indicate by color code or other means next to the name of each   SB2158- 5 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1registrant on the list of registered voters in each precinct 2the primary ballot of a political party that the registrant 3requested at that general primary election. The county clerk, 4within 60 days after the general primary election, shall 5provide a copy of this coded list to the chair of the county 6central committee of each established political party or to 7the chair's duly authorized representative.8    Within 60 days after the effective date of this amendatory 9Act of 1983, the county clerk shall provide to the chair of the 10county central committee of each established political party 11or to the chair's duly authorized representative the list of 12registered voters in each precinct at the time of the general 13primary election of 1982 and shall indicate on such list by 14color code or other means next to the name of a registrant the 15primary ballot of a political party that the registrant 16requested at the general primary election of 1982.17    The county clerk may charge a fee to reimburse the actual 18cost of duplicating each copy of a list provided under either 19of the 2 preceding paragraphs.20    Where an elector makes application to vote by signing and 21presenting the certificate provided by this Section, and his 22registration record card is not found in the precinct registry 23of voters, but his name appears as that of a registered voter 24in such precinct upon the printed precinct register as 25corrected or revised by the supplemental list, or upon the 26consolidated list, if any, and whose name has not been erased   SB2158- 6 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1or withdrawn from such register, the printed precinct register 2as corrected or revised by the supplemental list, or 3consolidated list, if any, shall be prima facie evidence of 4the elector's right to vote upon compliance with the 5provisions hereinafter set forth in this Section. In such 6event one of the judges of election shall require an affidavit 7by such person and one voter residing in the precinct before 8the judges of election, substantially in the form prescribed 9in Section 17-10 of this Act, and upon the presentation of such 10affidavits, a certificate shall be issued to such elector, and 11upon the presentation of such certificate and affidavits, he 12shall be entitled to vote.13    Provided, however, that applications for ballots made by 14registered voters under the provisions of Article 19 of this 15Act shall be accepted by the Judges of Election in lieu of the 16"Certificate of Registered Voter" provided for in this 17Section.18    When the county clerk delivers to the judges of election 19for use at the polls a supplemental or consolidated list of the 20printed precinct register, he shall give a copy of the 21supplemental or consolidated list to the chair of a county 22central committee of an established political party or to the 23chair's duly authorized representative.24    Whenever 2 or more elections occur simultaneously, the 25election authority charged with the duty of providing 26application certificates may prescribe the form thereof so   SB2158- 7 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1that a voter is required to execute only one, indicating in 2which of the elections he desires to vote.3    After the signature has been verified, the judges shall 4determine in which political subdivisions the voter resides by 5use of the information contained on the voter registration 6cards or the separate registration lists or other means 7approved by the State Board of Elections and prepared and 8supplied by the election authority. The voter's certificate 9shall be so marked by the judges as to show the respective 10ballots which the voter is given.11(Source: P.A. 100-1027, eff. 1-1-19.) 12    (10 ILCS 5/5-29)  (from Ch. 46, par. 5-29)13    Sec. 5-29. Upon application to vote, except as hereinafter 14provided for absent electors, each registered elector shall 15sign his name or make his mark as the case may be, on a 16certificate substantially as follows:17"Certificate of Registered Voter18Town of................District or Precinct Number..........; 19City of................Ward...............Precinct..........; 20Village of................................Precinct..........; 21Election..................................................... 22                 (date)         (month)        (year) 23Registration record 24Checked by..................... 25Voter's number..................  SB2158- 8 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1Instruction to voters2    Sign this certificate and hand it to the election officer 3in charge.

Whereupon you shall present 5it to the officer in charge of the ballots.6    I hereby certify that I am registered from the address 7below and am qualified to vote.8Signature of voter ...............9Residence address ..............."10    An individual shall not be required to provide his social 11security number when applying for a ballot. He shall not be 12denied a ballot, nor shall his ballot be challenged, solely 13because of his refusal to provide his social security number. 14Nothing in this Act prevents an individual from being 15requested to provide his social security number when the 16individual applies for a ballot. If, however, the certificate 17contains a space for the individual's social security number, 18the following notice shall appear on the certificate, 19immediately above such space, in bold-face capital letters, in 20type the size of which equals the largest type on the 21certificate:22    "THE INDIVIDUAL APPLYING FOR A BALLOT WITH THIS DOCUMENT 23IS NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE HIS OR HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. 24HE OR SHE MAY NOT BE DENIED A BALLOT, NOR SHALL HIS OR HER 25BALLOT BE CHALLENGED, SOLELY BECAUSE OF HIS OR HER REFUSAL TO 26PROVIDE HIS OR HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER."  SB2158- 9 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1    Certificates as above prescribed shall be furnished by the 2county clerk for all elections.3    The Judges in charge of the precinct registration files 4shall compare the signature upon such certificate with the 5signature on the registration record card as a means of 6identifying the voter. Unless satisfied by such comparison 7that the applicant to vote is the identical person who is 8registered under the same name, the Judges shall ask such 9applicant the questions for identification which appear on the 10registration card and if the applicant does not prove to the 11satisfaction of a majority of the judges of the election 12precinct that he is the identical person registered under the 13name in question then the vote for such applicant shall be 14challenged by a Judge of Election, and the same procedure 15followed as provided by law for challenged voters.16    In case the elector is unable to sign his name, a Judge of 17Election shall check the data on the registration card and 18shall check the address given, with the registered address, in 19order to determine whether he is entitled to vote.20    One of the Judges of election shall check the certificate 21of each applicant for a ballot after the registration record 22has been examined and shall sign his initials on the 23certificate in the space provided therefor, and shall enter 24upon such certificate the number of the voter in the place 25provided therefor, and make an entry in the voting record 26space on the registration record, to indicate whether or not   SB2158- 10 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1the applicant voted. Such judge shall then hand such 2certificate back to the applicant in case he is permitted to 3vote, and such applicant shall hand it to the judge of election 4in charge of the ballots. The certificates of the voters shall 5be filed in the order in which they are received and shall 6constitute an official poll record. The term "Poll Lists" and 7"Poll Books" where used in this article 5 shall be construed to 8apply to such official poll records.9    After each general primary election the county clerk shall 10indicate by color code or other means next to the name of each 11registrant on the list of registered voters in each precinct 12the primary ballot of a political party that the registrant 13requested at that general primary election.

He shall not be 8denied a ballot, nor shall his ballot be challenged, solely 9because of his refusal to provide his social security number. 10Nothing in this Act prevents an individual from being 11requested to provide his social security number when the 12individual applies for a ballot. If, however, the certificate 13contains a space for the individual's social security number, 14the following notice shall appear on the certificate, 15immediately above such space, in bold-face capital letters, in 16type the size of which equals the largest type on the 17certificate:18    "THE INDIVIDUAL APPLYING FOR A BALLOT WITH THIS DOCUMENT 19IS NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE HIS OR HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. 20HE OR SHE MAY NOT BE DENIED A BALLOT, NOR SHALL HIS OR HER 21BALLOT BE CHALLENGED, SOLELY BECAUSE OF HIS OR HER REFUSAL TO 22PROVIDE HIS OR HER SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER."23    The applications of each State-wide political party at a 24primary election shall be separately printed upon paper of 25uniform quality, texture and size, but the applications of no 262 State-wide political parties shall be of the same color or   SB2158- 16 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1tint.

Such applications may contain spaces or check-off boxes 7permitting the voter to also request a primary ballot of any 8political party which is established only within a political 9subdivision and for which a primary is conducted on the same 10election day. Such applications shall not entitle the voter to 11vote in both the primary of a State-wide political party and 12the primary of a local political party with respect to the 13offices of the same political subdivision or to vote in the 14primary of more than one State-wide political party on the 15same day.16    The judges in charge of the precinct registration files 17shall compare the signature upon such certificate with the 18signature on the registration record card as a means of 19identifying the voter.

Such judge shall then hand such 16certificate back to the applicant in case he is permitted to 17vote, and such applicant shall hand it to the judge of election 18in charge of the ballots. The certificates of the voters shall 19be filed in the order in which they are received and shall 20constitute an official poll record. The terms "poll lists" and 21"poll books", where used in this Article and Act, shall be 22construed to apply to such official poll record.23    After each general primary election the board of election 24commissioners shall indicate by color code or other means next 25to the name of each registrant on the list of registered voters 26in each precinct the primary ballot of a political party that   SB2158- 18 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1the registrant requested at the general primary election.

In the case of nonpartisan elections for officers 6of political subdivisions, unless the statute or an ordinance 7adopted pursuant to Article VII of the Constitution requires 8otherwise, the listing of nonpartisan candidates shall not 9include any party or "independent" designation. If no 10candidate or candidates file for an office and if no person or 11persons file a declaration as a write-in candidate for that 12office, then below the title of that office the election 13authority shall print "No Candidate". In primary elections, a 14separate ballot shall be used for each political party holding 15a primary, with the ballot arranged to include names of the 16candidates of the party and public questions and other 17propositions to be voted upon on the day of the primary 18election.19    If the ballot includes both candidates for office and 20public questions or propositions to be voted on, the election 21official in charge of the election shall divide the ballot in 22sections for "Candidates" and "Public Questions", or separate 23ballots may be used.24    Any voter who spoils his or her ballot, makes an error, or 25has a ballot rejected by the automatic tabulating equipment 26shall be provided a means of correcting the ballot or   SB2158- 95 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1obtaining a new ballot prior to casting his or her ballot.2    Any election authority using a Direct Recording Electronic 3Voting System may use voting systems approved for use under 4Articles 24A or 24B of this Code in conducting vote by mail or 5early voting.6(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 7    (10 ILCS 5/24C-11)8    Sec. 24C-11. Functional requirements. A Direct Recording 9Electronic Voting System shall, in addition to satisfying the 10other requirements of this Article, fulfill the following 11functional requirements:12    (a) Provide a voter in a primary election with the means of 13casting a ballot containing votes for any and all candidates 14of the party or parties of his or her choice, and for any and 15all non-partisan candidates and public questions and preclude 16the voter from voting for any candidate of any other political 17party except when legally permitted. In a general election, 18the system shall provide the voter with means of selecting the 19appropriate number of candidates for any office, and of voting 20on any public question on the ballot to which he or she is 21entitled to vote.22    (b) If a voter is not entitled to vote for particular 23candidates or public questions appearing on the ballot, the 24system shall prevent the selection of the prohibited votes.25    (c) Once the proper ballot has been selected, the system   SB2158- 96 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1devices shall provide a means of enabling the recording of 2votes and the casting of said ballot.3    (d) System voting devices shall provide voting choices 4that are clear to the voter and labels indicating the names of 5every candidate and the text of every public question on the 6voter's ballot. Each label shall identify the selection button 7or switch, or the active area of the ballot associated with it. 8The system shall be able to incorporate minimal, 9easy-to-follow on-screen instruction for the voter on how to 10cast a ballot.11    (e) Voting devices shall (i) enable the voter to vote for 12any and all candidates and public questions appearing on the 13ballot for which the voter is lawfully entitled to vote, in any 14legal number and combination; (ii) detect and reject all votes 15for an office or upon a public question when the voter has cast 16more votes for the office or upon the public question than the 17voter is entitled to cast; (iii) notify the voter if the 18voter's choices as recorded on the ballot for an office or 19public question are fewer than or exceed the number that the 20voter is entitled to vote for on that office or public question 21and the effect of casting more or fewer votes than legally 22permitted; (iv) notify the voter if the voter has failed to 23completely cast a vote for an office or public question 24appearing on the ballot; and (v) permit the voter, in a private 25and independent manner, to verify the votes selected by the 26voter, to change the ballot or to correct any error on the   SB2158- 97 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1ballot before the ballot is completely cast and counted. A 2means shall be provided to indicate each selection after it 3has been made or canceled.4    (f) System voting devices shall provide a means for the 5voter to signify that the selection of candidates and public 6questions has been completed. Upon activation, the system 7shall record an image of the completed ballot, increment the 8proper ballot position registers, and shall signify to the 9voter that the ballot has been cast. The system shall then 10prevent any further attempt to vote until it has been reset or 11re-enabled by a judge of election.12    (g) Each system voting device shall be equipped with a 13public counter that can be set to zero prior to the opening of 14the polling place, and that records the number of ballots cast 15at a particular election. The counter shall be incremented 16only by the casting of a ballot. The counter shall be designed 17to prevent disabling or resetting by other than authorized 18persons after the polls close. The counter shall be visible to 19all judges of election so long as the device is installed at 20the polling place.21    (h) Each system voting device shall be equipped with a 22protective counter that records all of the testing and 23election ballots cast since the unit was built. This counter 24shall be designed so that its reading cannot be changed by any 25cause other than the casting of a ballot. The protective 26counter shall be incapable of ever being reset and it shall be   SB2158- 98 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1visible at all times when the device is configured for 2testing, maintenance, or election use.3    (i) All system devices shall provide a means of preventing 4further voting once the polling place has closed and after all 5eligible voters have voted. Such means of control shall 6incorporate a visible indication of system status. Each device 7shall prevent any unauthorized use, prevent tampering with 8ballot labels and preclude its re-opening once the poll 9closing has been completed for that election.10    (j) The system shall produce a printed summary report of 11the votes cast upon each voting device. Until the proper 12sequence of events associated with closing the polling place 13has been completed, the system shall not allow the printing of 14a report or the extraction of data. The printed report shall 15also contain all system audit information to be required by 16the election authority. Data shall not be altered or otherwise 17destroyed by report generation and the system shall ensure the 18integrity and security of data for a period of at least 6 19months after the polls close.20    (k) If more than one voting device is used in a polling 21place, the system shall provide a means to manually or 22electronically consolidate the data from all such units into a 23single report even if different voting systems are used to 24record ballots. The system shall also be capable of merging 25the vote tabulation results produced by other vote tabulation 26systems, if necessary.  SB2158- 99 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1    (l) System functions shall be implemented such that 2unauthorized access to them is prevented and the execution of 3authorized functions in an improper sequence is precluded. 4System functions shall be executable only in the intended 5manner and order, and only under the intended conditions. If 6the preconditions to a system function have not been met, the 7function shall be precluded from executing by the system's 8control logic.9    (m) All system voting devices shall incorporate at least 3 10memories in the machine itself and in its programmable memory 11devices.12    (n) The system shall include capabilities of recording and 13reporting the date and time of normal and abnormal events and 14of maintaining a permanent record of audit information that 15cannot be turned off. Provisions shall be made to detect and 16record significant events (e.g., casting a ballot, error 17conditions that cannot be disposed of by the system itself, 18time-dependent or programmed events that occur without the 19intervention of the voter or a judge of election).20    (o) The system and each system voting device must be 21capable of creating, printing and maintaining a permanent 22paper record and an electronic image of each ballot that is 23cast such that records of individual ballots are maintained by 24a subsystem independent and distinct from the main vote 25detection, interpretation, processing and reporting path. The 26electronic images of each ballot must protect the integrity of   SB2158- 100 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1the data and the anonymity of each voter, for example, by means 2of storage location scrambling. The ballot image records may 3be either machine-readable or manually transcribed, or both, 4at the discretion of the election authority.5    (p) The system shall include built-in test, measurement 6and diagnostic software and hardware for detecting and 7reporting the system's status and degree of operability.8    (q) The system shall contain provisions for maintaining 9the integrity of memory voting and audit data during an 10election and for a period of at least 6 months thereafter and 11shall provide the means for creating an audit trail.12    (r) The system shall be fully accessible so as to permit 13blind or visually impaired voters as well as voters with 14physical disabilities to exercise their right to vote in 15private and without assistance.16    (s) The system shall provide alternative language 17accessibility if required pursuant to Section 203 of the 18Voting Rights Act of 1965.19    (t) Each voting device shall enable a voter to vote for a 20person whose name does not appear on the ballot.21    (u) The system shall record and count accurately each vote 22properly cast for or against any candidate and for or against 23any public question, including the names of all candidates 24whose names are written in by the voters.25    (v) The system shall allow for accepting provisional 26ballots and for separating such provisional ballots from   SB2158- 101 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1precinct totals until authorized by the election authority.2    (w) The system shall provide an effective audit trail as 3defined in Section 24C-2 in this Code.4    (x) The system shall be suitably designed for the purpose 5used, be durably constructed, and be designed for safety, 6accuracy and efficiency.7    (y) The system shall comply with all provisions of 8federal, State and local election laws and regulations and any 9future modifications to those laws and regulations.10(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15; 99-143, eff. 7-27-15.) 11    (10 ILCS 5/25-10)  (from Ch. 46, par. 25-10)12    Sec. 25-10. This Section applies only to counties of 133,000,000 or more population. When a vacancy occurs in the 14office of Clerk of the Circuit Court of any of the counties in 15this State, it shall be the duty of the Circuit Judges of the 16respective judicial circuit in which such vacancy may occur, 17to make an appointment to fill the vacancy for the remainder of 18the unexpired term. However, if more than 28 months remain in 19the term, the appointment shall be until the next general 20election, at which time a clerk of the circuit court shall be 21elected for the balance of the unexpired term. The appointee 22shall be a member of the same political party as the person he 23succeeds was at the time of his election and shall be otherwise 24eligible to serve as Clerk of the Circuit Court. The Circuit 25Judges may appoint a Clerk Pro Tempore for whatever period is   SB2158- 102 -LRB104 10882 SPS 20964 b1necessary while reviewing the qualifications of candidates for 2appointment to the office.3(Source: P.A. 90-672, eff. 7-31-98.) 4    (10 ILCS 5/Art. 10 rep.)5    Section 10.
