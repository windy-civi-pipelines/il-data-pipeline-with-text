Legislative findings. For more than 4 decades, 5HIV/AIDS has ravaged communities across America and Illinois, 6doubling down on the racial health disparities also laid bare 7across the opioid epidemic, maternal and infant mortality 8rates, COVID-19 mortality and morbidity rates, and the rising 9rates of sexually transmitted infections (chlamydia, 10gonorrhea, and syphilis). 11    According to the Centers for Disease Control and 12Prevention (CDC), HIV transmission can be virtually eliminated 13when linkage to HIV medications and medical care are widely 14accessible. Treatment and prevention strategies such as 15Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and 16Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U) are time-tested, 17science-based interventions that prevent new HIV diagnoses. 18Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a prevention strategy that 19involves sexually active HIV-negative adults and adolescents 20taking prescription medications to prevent HIV acquisition. 21PrEP is 99% effective in preventing HIV when taken as 22prescribed. U=U acknowledges the proven science that people 23living with HIV who have an undetectable viral load pose no 24chance of transmitting the virus sexually.
