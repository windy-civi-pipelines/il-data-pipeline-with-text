However, such civil penalty 16may be off-set in whole or in part pursuant to a supplemental 17environmental project agreed to by the complainant and the 18respondent.19    (i) A person who voluntarily self-discloses non-compliance 20to the Agency, of which the Agency had been unaware, is 21entitled to a 100% reduction in the portion of the penalty that 22is not based on the economic benefit of non-compliance if the 23person can establish the following:24        (1) that either the regulated entity is a small entity 25    or the non-compliance was discovered through an 26    environmental audit or a compliance management system   HB3029- 21 -LRB104 09341 BDA 19399 b1    documented by the regulated entity as reflecting the 2    regulated entity's due diligence in preventing, detecting, 3    and correcting violations;4        (2) that the non-compliance was disclosed in writing 5    within 30 days of the date on which the person discovered 6    it;7        (3) that the non-compliance was discovered and 8    disclosed prior to:9            (i) the commencement of an Agency inspection, 10        investigation, or request for information;11            (ii) notice of a citizen suit;12            (iii) the filing of a complaint by a citizen, the 13        Illinois Attorney General, or the State's Attorney of 14        the county in which the violation occurred;15            (iv) the reporting of the non-compliance by an 16        employee of the person without that person's 17        knowledge; or18            (v) imminent discovery of the non-compliance by 19        the Agency;20        (4) that the non-compliance is being corrected and any 21    environmental harm is being remediated in a timely 22    fashion;23        (5) that the person agrees to prevent a recurrence of 24    the non-compliance;25        (6) that no related non-compliance events have 26    occurred in the past 3 years at the same facility or in the   HB3029- 22 -LRB104 09341 BDA 19399 b1    past 5 years as part of a pattern at multiple facilities 2    owned or operated by the person;3        (7) that the non-compliance did not result in serious 4    actual harm or present an imminent and substantial 5    endangerment to human health or the environment or violate 6    the specific terms of any judicial or administrative order 7    or consent agreement;8        (8) that the person cooperates as reasonably requested 9    by the Agency after the disclosure; and10        (9) that the non-compliance was identified voluntarily 11    and not through a monitoring, sampling, or auditing 12    procedure that is required by statute, rule, permit, 13    judicial or administrative order, or consent agreement.14    If a person can establish all of the elements under this 15subsection except the element set forth in paragraph (1) of 16this subsection, the person is entitled to a 75% reduction in 17the portion of the penalty that is not based upon the economic 18benefit of non-compliance.19    For the purposes of this subsection (i), "small entity" 20has the same meaning as in Section 221 of the federal Small 21Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (5 U.S.C. 22601). 23    (j) In addition to any other remedy or penalty that may 24apply, whether civil or criminal, any person who violates 25Section 22.52 of this Act shall be liable for an additional 26civil penalty of up to 3 times the gross amount of any   HB3029- 23 -LRB104 09341 BDA 19399 b1pecuniary gain resulting from the violation. 2    (k) In addition to any other remedy or penalty that may 3apply, whether civil or criminal, any person who violates 4subdivision (a)(7.6) of Section 31 of this Act shall be liable 5for an additional civil penalty of $2,000. 6(Source: P.A. 102-310, eff. 8-6-21.)
