The defendant's mere   HB3468- 12 -LRB104 10125 RLC 20197 b1refusal to attend a hearing shall not by itself constitute a 2disability, regardless of the person's mental state. 3    (d) On the basis of the evidence before it, the court or 4jury shall determine whether the defendant is fit to stand 5trial, or to plead, or to be sentenced.

If such probability is found or if the court 15or the jury is unable to determine whether a substantial 16probability exists, the court shall order the defendant to 17undergo treatment for the purpose of rendering the defendant 18him fit. In the event that a defendant is ordered to undergo 19treatment with when there has been no initial determination as 20to the probability of his attaining fitness within the 21statutory timeframe, the court shall conduct a hearing as soon 22as possible following the receipt of the treatment 23supervisor's report filed pursuant to subsection (g) paragraph 24(d) of Section 104-17, unless the hearing is waived by the 25defense, and shall make a determination as to whether a 26substantial probability of attaining fitness within the   HB3468- 13 -LRB104 10125 RLC 20197 b1statutory timeframe exists. If the court or the jury finds 2that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant 3may be rendered fit within the statutory limitations, the 4court shall proceed as provided in Section 104-23. 5    (e) An order finding the defendant unfit is a final order 6for purposes of appeal by the State or the defendant.7(Source: P.A. 81-1217.) 8    (725 ILCS 5/104-17)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-17)9    Sec. 104-17.

The placement may be ordered either on an inpatient 20or an outpatient basis.21    (c) If the defendant's disability is physical, the court 22may order placement at a medical hospital or other residential 23care facility or program that has agreed to provide treatment 24to the defendant. Only such physical conditions that may be 25overcome by special assistance or provisions as referenced in 26Section 104-22 qualify as physical disabilities under this   HB3468- 17 -LRB104 10125 RLC 20197 b1subsection. him placed under the supervision of the Department 2of Human Services which shall place and maintain the defendant 3in a suitable treatment facility or program, or the court may 4order him placed in an appropriate public or private facility 5or treatment program which has agreed to provide treatment to 6the defendant.
