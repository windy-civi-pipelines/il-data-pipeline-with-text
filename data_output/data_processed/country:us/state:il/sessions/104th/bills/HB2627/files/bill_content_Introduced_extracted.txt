Short title. This Act may be cited as the Mink 5Facility Disease Prevention Act. 6    Section 5. Findings; purpose. 7    (a) The General Assembly finds that: 8        (1) Minks' upper respiratory tracts are 9    physiologically similar to humans, which means minks can 10    become infected by, and potentially transmit to humans, 11    respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2, which is the 12    virus that causes COVID-19, and Influenza A virus subtype 13    H5N1, which is the virus that causes avian influenza. 14        (2) Minks' susceptibility to acquiring and spreading 15    both human and animal respiratory viruses renders them 16    potentially potent mixing vessels for generating novel 17    pandemic viruses. 18        (3) Animal management and slaughter practices at mink 19    facilities facilitate the spread of viruses. These 20    facilities confine large numbers of animals in close 21    proximity to each other, which promotes disease 22    transmission. The mink also experience extreme stress, 23    which increases the potential to shed and transmit viruses   HB2627- 2 -LRB104 08196 BDA 18246 b1    over extended periods. This risk is further exacerbated by 2    on-site slaughter practices that create additional points 3    of exposure. 4        (4) Tens of thousands of captive mink in the United 5    States, and millions worldwide, have been infected with 6    SARS-CoV-2, and there have been documented cases where 7    mink have transmitted a variant of the virus to humans. 8        (5) Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 has infected tens 9    of thousands of captive mink since 2022. In at least one 10    mink facility, the virus gained a mutation that favors 11    mammal-to-mammal spread, allowing it to spread from mink 12    to mink. 13        (6) Outbreaks of Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 among 14    captive mink across Finland led to the culling of mink to 15    prevent the disease spread amid fears of it mutating into 16    something transmissible between humans. 17    (b) It is the purpose of this Act to protect public health 18and human safety by requiring disease prevention and 19surveillance measures at mink facilities in this State. 20    Section 10. Definitions. As used in this Act: 21    "Department" means the Department of Public Health. 22    "Mink" means American mink (Neovison vison), European mink 23(Mustela lutreola), and any mink hybrid, whether alive or 24dead. 25    "Mink facility" means any operation in which mink, for the   HB2627- 3 -LRB104 08196 BDA 18246 b1value of their fur, are owned, controlled, raised, bred, 2propagated, kept, slaughtered, skinned, or sold. 3    "Person" includes any individual, firm, corporation, 4trust, association, copartnership, society, or other 5organization of individuals and any other business unit, 6device, or arrangement. 7    Section 15.
