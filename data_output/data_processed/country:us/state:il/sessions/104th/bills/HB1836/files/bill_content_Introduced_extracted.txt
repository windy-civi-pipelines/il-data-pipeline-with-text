Emergency Exception to Procedures. (a) 7Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article, any 8investigative or law enforcement officer, upon approval of the 9Attorney General or a State's Attorney, or without it if a 10reasonable effort has been made to contact the Attorney 11General or the appropriate State's Attorney, may use an 12eavesdropping device in an emergency situation as defined in 13this Section. Such use must be in accordance with the 14provisions of this Section and may be allowed only where the 15officer reasonably believes that an order permitting the use 16of the device would issue were there a prior hearing.17    An emergency situation exists when, without previous 18notice to the law enforcement officer sufficient to obtain 19prior judicial approval, the conversation to be overheard or 20recorded will occur within a short period of time, the use of 21the device is necessary for the protection of the law 22enforcement officer or it will occur in a situation involving 23a clear and present danger of imminent death or great bodily 24harm to persons resulting from: (1) a kidnapping or the 25holding of a hostage by force or the threat of the imminent use   HB1836- 29 -LRB104 08084 RLC 18130 b1of force; or (2) the occupation by force or the threat of the 2imminent use of force of any premises, place, vehicle, vessel 3or aircraft; or (3) any violation of Article 29D.4    (b) In all such cases, an application for an order 5approving the previous or continuing use of an eavesdropping 6device must be made within 48 hours of the commencement of such 7use.

The Statewide Grand Jury Act is amended by 4changing Sections 2, 3, and 4 as follows: 5    (725 ILCS 215/2)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1702)6    Sec. 2. (a) County grand juries and State's Attorneys have 7always had and shall continue to have primary responsibility 8for investigating, indicting, and prosecuting persons who 9violate the criminal laws of the State of Illinois. However, 10in recent years organized terrorist activity directed against 11innocent civilians and certain criminal enterprises have 12developed that require investigation, indictment, and 13prosecution on a statewide or multicounty level. The criminal 14enterprises exist as a result of the allure of profitability 15present in narcotic activity, the unlawful sale and transfer 16of firearms, and streetgang related felonies and organized 17terrorist activity is supported by the contribution of money 18and expert assistance from geographically diverse sources. In 19order to shut off the life blood of terrorism and weaken or 20eliminate the criminal enterprises, assets, and property used 21to further these offenses must be frozen, and any profit must 22be removed. State statutes exist that can accomplish that 23goal. Among them are the offense of money laundering, 24violations of Article 29D of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the   HB1836- 33 -LRB104 08084 RLC 18130 b1Criminal Code of 2012, the Narcotics Profit Forfeiture Act, 2and gunrunning. Local prosecutors need investigative personnel 3and specialized training to attack and eliminate these 4profits. In light of the transitory and complex nature of 5conduct that constitutes these criminal activities, the many 6diverse property interests that may be used, acquired directly 7or indirectly as a result of these criminal activities, and 8the many places that illegally obtained property may be 9located, it is the purpose of this Act to create a limited, 10multicounty Statewide Grand Jury with authority to 11investigate, indict, and prosecute: narcotic activity, 12including cannabis and controlled substance trafficking, 13narcotics racketeering, money laundering, violations of the 14Cannabis and Controlled Substances Tax Act, and violations of 15Article 29D of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code 16of 2012; the unlawful sale and transfer of firearms; 17gunrunning; and streetgang related felonies.18    (b) A Statewide Grand Jury may also investigate, indict, 19and prosecute violations facilitated by the use of a computer 20of any of the following offenses: indecent solicitation of a 21child, sexual exploitation of a child, soliciting for a 22juvenile prostitute, keeping a place of juvenile prostitution, 23juvenile pimping, child pornography, aggravated child 24pornography, obscene depiction of a purported child, 25non-consensual dissemination of sexually explicit digitized 26depictions, or promoting juvenile prostitution except as   HB1836- 34 -LRB104 08084 RLC 18130 b1described in subdivision (a)(4) of Section 11-14.4 of the 2Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012.3    (c) A Statewide Grand Jury may also investigate, indict, 4and prosecute violations of theft, retail theft, organized 5retail crime, Internet offenses, continuing financial crimes 6enterprise, vehicular hijacking, aggravated vehicular 7hijacking, vehicular invasion, burglary, residential burglary, 8and home invasion. 9(Source: P.A. 101-593, eff. 12-4-19; 102-757, eff. 5-13-22.) 10    (725 ILCS 215/3)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1703)11    Sec. 3. Written application for the appointment of a 12Circuit Judge to convene and preside over a Statewide Grand 13Jury, with jurisdiction extending throughout the State, shall 14be made to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Upon such 15written application, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court 16shall appoint a Circuit Judge from the circuit where the 17Statewide Grand Jury is being sought to be convened, who shall 18make a determination that the convening of a Statewide Grand 19Jury is necessary.20    In such application the Attorney General shall state that 21the convening of a Statewide Grand Jury is necessary because 22of an alleged offense or offenses set forth in this Section 23involving more than one county of the State and identifying 24any such offense alleged; and25        (a) that he or she believes that the grand jury   HB1836- 35 -LRB104 08084 RLC 18130 b1    function for the investigation and indictment of the 2    offense or offenses cannot effectively be performed by a 3    county grand jury together with the reasons for such 4    belief, and5        (b)(1) that each State's Attorney with jurisdiction 6    over an offense or offenses to be investigated has 7    consented to the impaneling of the Statewide Grand Jury, 8    or9        (2) if one or more of the State's Attorneys having 10    jurisdiction over an offense or offenses to be 11    investigated fails to consent to the impaneling of the 12    Statewide Grand Jury, the Attorney General shall set forth 13    good cause for impaneling the Statewide Grand Jury.14    If the Circuit Judge determines that the convening of a 15Statewide Grand Jury is necessary, he or she shall convene and 16impanel the Statewide Grand Jury with jurisdiction extending 17throughout the State to investigate and return indictments:18        (a) For violations of any of the following or for any 19    other criminal offense committed in the course of 20    violating any of the following: Article 29D of the 21    Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, the 22    Illinois Controlled Substances Act, the Cannabis Control 23    Act, the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection 24    Act, or the Narcotics Profit Forfeiture Act; a streetgang 25    related felony offense; Section 16-1, 16-25, 16-25.1, 26    16-40, 17-10.6(h), 18-3, 18-4, 18-6, 19-1, 19-3, 19-6,   HB1836- 36 -LRB104 08084 RLC 18130 b1    24-2.1, 24-2.2, 24-3, 24-3A, 24-3.1, 24-3.3, 24-3.4, 24-4, 2    or 24-5 or subsection 24-1(a)(4), 24-1(a)(6), 24-1(a)(7), 3    24-1(a)(9), 24-1(a)(10), or 24-1(c) of the Criminal Code 4    of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012; or a money laundering 5    offense; provided that the violation or offense involves 6    acts occurring in more than one county of this State; and7        (a-5) For violations facilitated by the use of a 8    computer, including the use of the Internet, the World 9    Wide Web, electronic mail, message board, newsgroup, or 10    any other commercial or noncommercial on-line service, of 11    any of the following offenses: indecent solicitation of a 12    child, sexual exploitation of a child, soliciting for a 13    juvenile prostitute, keeping a place of juvenile 14    prostitution, juvenile pimping, child pornography, 15    aggravated child pornography, obscene depiction of a 16    purported child, non-consensual dissemination of sexually 17    explicit digitized depictions, or promoting juvenile 18    prostitution except as described in subdivision (a)(4) of 19    Section 11-14.4 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 20    Criminal Code of 2012; and21        (b) For the offenses of perjury, subornation of 22    perjury, communicating with jurors and witnesses, and 23    harassment of jurors and witnesses, as they relate to 24    matters before the Statewide Grand Jury.25    "Streetgang related" has the meaning ascribed to it in 26Section 10 of the Illinois Streetgang Terrorism Omnibus   HB1836- 37 -LRB104 08084 RLC 18130 b1Prevention Act.2    Upon written application by the Attorney General for the 3convening of an additional Statewide Grand Jury, the Chief 4Justice of the Supreme Court shall appoint a Circuit Judge 5from the circuit for which the additional Statewide Grand Jury 6is sought.

The Statewide Grand Jury Act is amended by 4changing Sections 2, 3, and 4 as follows: 5    (725 ILCS 215/2)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1702)6    Sec. 2. (a) County grand juries and State's Attorneys have 7always had and shall continue to have primary responsibility 8for investigating, indicting, and prosecuting persons who 9violate the criminal laws of the State of Illinois. However, 10in recent years organized terrorist activity directed against 11innocent civilians and certain criminal enterprises have 12developed that require investigation, indictment, and 13prosecution on a statewide or multicounty level. The criminal 14enterprises exist as a result of the allure of profitability 15present in narcotic activity, the unlawful sale and transfer 16of firearms, and streetgang related felonies and organized 17terrorist activity is supported by the contribution of money 18and expert assistance from geographically diverse sources. In 19order to shut off the life blood of terrorism and weaken or 20eliminate the criminal enterprises, assets, and property used 21to further these offenses must be frozen, and any profit must 22be removed. State statutes exist that can accomplish that 23goal.
