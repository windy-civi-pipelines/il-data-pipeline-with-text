The Statewide Grand Jury Act is amended by 4changing Sections 2, 3, and 4 as follows: 5    (725 ILCS 215/2)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1702)6    Sec. 2. (a) County grand juries and State's Attorneys have 7always had and shall continue to have primary responsibility 8for investigating, indicting, and prosecuting persons who 9violate the criminal laws of the State of Illinois. However, 10in recent years organized terrorist activity directed against 11innocent civilians and certain criminal enterprises have 12developed that require investigation, indictment, and 13prosecution on a statewide or multicounty level. The criminal 14enterprises exist as a result of the allure of profitability 15present in narcotic activity, the unlawful sale and transfer 16of firearms, retail theft, crimes committed by use of the 17Internet, financial crimes, and streetgang related felonies 18and organized terrorist activity is supported by the 19contribution of money and expert assistance from 20geographically diverse sources. In order to shut off the life 21blood of terrorism and weaken or eliminate the criminal 22enterprises, assets, and property used to further these 23offenses must be frozen, and any profit must be removed. State 24statutes exist that can accomplish that goal. Among them are   HB1836 Engrossed- 33 -LRB104 08084 RLC 18130 b1the offense of money laundering, violations of Article 29D of 2the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, the 3Narcotics Profit Forfeiture Act, and gunrunning. Local 4prosecutors need investigative personnel and specialized 5training to attack and eliminate these profits. In light of 6the transitory and complex nature of conduct that constitutes 7these criminal activities, the many diverse property interests 8that may be used, acquired directly or indirectly as a result 9of these criminal activities, and the many places that 10illegally obtained property may be located, it is the purpose 11of this Act to create a limited, multicounty Statewide Grand 12Jury with authority to investigate, indict, and prosecute: 13narcotic activity, including cannabis and controlled substance 14trafficking, narcotics racketeering, money laundering, 15violations of the Cannabis and Controlled Substances Tax Act, 16and violations of Article 29D of the Criminal Code of 1961 or 17the Criminal Code of 2012; the unlawful sale and transfer of 18firearms; gunrunning; retail theft; crimes committed by use of 19the Internet; financial crimes; and streetgang related 20felonies.21    (b) A Statewide Grand Jury may also investigate, indict, 22and prosecute violations facilitated by the use of a computer 23of any of the following offenses: indecent solicitation of a 24child, sexual exploitation of a child, soliciting for a 25juvenile prostitute, keeping a place of juvenile prostitution, 26juvenile pimping, child pornography, aggravated child   HB1836 Engrossed- 34 -LRB104 08084 RLC 18130 b1pornography, obscene depiction of a purported child, 2non-consensual dissemination of sexually explicit digitized 3depictions, or promoting juvenile prostitution except as 4described in subdivision (a)(4) of Section 11-14.4 of the 5Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012.6    (c) A Statewide Grand Jury may also investigate, indict, 7and prosecute violations of organized retail crime, and its 8related acts; continuing financial enterprises and Internet 9offenses. 10(Source: P.A. 101-593, eff. 12-4-19; 102-757, eff. 5-13-22.) 11    (725 ILCS 215/3)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1703)12    Sec. 3.

The Statewide Grand Jury Act is amended by 4changing Sections 2, 3, and 4 as follows: 5    (725 ILCS 215/2)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1702)6    Sec. 2. (a) County grand juries and State's Attorneys have 7always had and shall continue to have primary responsibility 8for investigating, indicting, and prosecuting persons who 9violate the criminal laws of the State of Illinois. However, 10in recent years organized terrorist activity directed against 11innocent civilians and certain criminal enterprises have 12developed that require investigation, indictment, and 13prosecution on a statewide or multicounty level. The criminal 14enterprises exist as a result of the allure of profitability 15present in narcotic activity, the unlawful sale and transfer 16of firearms, retail theft, crimes committed by use of the 17Internet, financial crimes, and streetgang related felonies 18and organized terrorist activity is supported by the 19contribution of money and expert assistance from 20geographically diverse sources. In order to shut off the life 21blood of terrorism and weaken or eliminate the criminal 22enterprises, assets, and property used to further these 23offenses must be frozen, and any profit must be removed. State 24statutes exist that can accomplish that goal. Among them are   HB1836 Engrossed- 33 -LRB104 08084 RLC 18130 b1the offense of money laundering, violations of Article 29D of 2the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, the 3Narcotics Profit Forfeiture Act, and gunrunning. Local 4prosecutors need investigative personnel and specialized 5training to attack and eliminate these profits. In light of 6the transitory and complex nature of conduct that constitutes 7these criminal activities, the many diverse property interests 8that may be used, acquired directly or indirectly as a result 9of these criminal activities, and the many places that 10illegally obtained property may be located, it is the purpose 11of this Act to create a limited, multicounty Statewide Grand 12Jury with authority to investigate, indict, and prosecute: 13narcotic activity, including cannabis and controlled substance 14trafficking, narcotics racketeering, money laundering, 15violations of the Cannabis and Controlled Substances Tax Act, 16and violations of Article 29D of the Criminal Code of 1961 or 17the Criminal Code of 2012; the unlawful sale and transfer of 18firearms; gunrunning; retail theft; crimes committed by use of 19the Internet; financial crimes; and streetgang related 20felonies.21    (b) A Statewide Grand Jury may also investigate, indict, 22and prosecute violations facilitated by the use of a computer 23of any of the following offenses: indecent solicitation of a 24child, sexual exploitation of a child, soliciting for a 25juvenile prostitute, keeping a place of juvenile prostitution, 26juvenile pimping, child pornography, aggravated child   HB1836 Engrossed- 34 -LRB104 08084 RLC 18130 b1pornography, obscene depiction of a purported child, 2non-consensual dissemination of sexually explicit digitized 3depictions, or promoting juvenile prostitution except as 4described in subdivision (a)(4) of Section 11-14.4 of the 5Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012.6    (c) A Statewide Grand Jury may also investigate, indict, 7and prosecute violations of organized retail crime, and its 8related acts; continuing financial enterprises and Internet 9offenses. 10(Source: P.A. 101-593, eff. 12-4-19; 102-757, eff. 5-13-22.) 11    (725 ILCS 215/3)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1703)12    Sec. 3.
