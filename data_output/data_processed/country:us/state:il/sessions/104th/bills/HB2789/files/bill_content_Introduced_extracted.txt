Mega project property 8    (35 ILCS 200/10-900 new)9    Sec. 10-900. Findings. The State's economy is highly 10vulnerable to other states that have major financial incentive 11programs and competitive tax incentives. Certain businesses 12and commercial operations that generate significant economic 13activity bear a disproportionately high property tax burden 14compared to their impact on government services and compared 15to their positive economic benefits to the State and the local 16economy and their derivative benefits to taxing districts. To 17incentivize the significant capital investment and economic 18activity of certain large-scale businesses and industrial and 19commercial operations, the State finds that a valuation 20procedure for real property taxes on special properties, known 21as mega projects, will reduce barriers to investment and 22promote economic activity in Illinois. The General Assembly   HB2789- 2 -LRB104 06189 HLH 16224 b1finds that it is in the best interest of the State to establish 2a new category of valuation for mega projects that recognizes 3their complexity and encourages local development at 4underutilized properties. 5    (35 ILCS 200/10-905 new)6    Sec. 10-905.

The Property Tax Code is amended by adding 5Division 22 of Article 10 as follows: 6    (35 ILCS 200/Art. 10 Div. 22 heading new)7Division 22. Mega project property 8    (35 ILCS 200/10-900 new)9    Sec. 10-900. Findings. The State's economy is highly 10vulnerable to other states that have major financial incentive 11programs and competitive tax incentives. Certain businesses 12and commercial operations that generate significant economic 13activity bear a disproportionately high property tax burden 14compared to their impact on government services and compared 15to their positive economic benefits to the State and the local 16economy and their derivative benefits to taxing districts. To 17incentivize the significant capital investment and economic 18activity of certain large-scale businesses and industrial and 19commercial operations, the State finds that a valuation 20procedure for real property taxes on special properties, known 21as mega projects, will reduce barriers to investment and 22promote economic activity in Illinois. The General Assembly   HB2789- 2 -LRB104 06189 HLH 16224 b1finds that it is in the best interest of the State to establish 2a new category of valuation for mega projects that recognizes 3their complexity and encourages local development at 4underutilized properties. 5    (35 ILCS 200/10-905 new)6    Sec. 10-905.
