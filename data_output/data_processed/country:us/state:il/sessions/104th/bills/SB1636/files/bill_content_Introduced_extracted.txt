Requires, beginning with the 2026-2027 school year, school boards to report specified data to the State Board of Education regarding computer science courses in schools maintaining any of grades kindergarten through 8. Requires the State Board to make the data publicly available. In provisions concerning required high school courses, provides that a computer science course (rather than an Advanced Placement computer science course) qualifies under the mathematics requirement. Requires each pupil entering the 9th grade beginning with the 2027-2028 school year to successfully complete one year of high school computer science as a prerequisite to receiving a high school diploma, which may be taken in any of grades 7 through 12 and shall count toward the fulfillment of certain other high school graduation requirements. Requires the State Board to create guidelines for school districts. Provides that the computer science course requirement does not apply to a pupil transferring to a high school in this State from another state after the pupil's 11th grade year. Allows a school to enter into a cooperative resource sharing agreement to ensure that its students can enroll in a computer science course. Makes other and conforming changes.LRB104 10856 LNS 20938 bSTATE MANDATES ACT MAY REQUIRE REIMBURSEMENTMAY APPLY A BILL FOR SB1636LRB104 10856 LNS 20938 b1    AN ACT concerning education. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5.
