Funds allotted to the respective 6counties for the use of road districts therein shall be 7allocated to the several road districts in the county in the 8proportion which the total mileage of such township or 9district roads in the respective road districts bears to the 10total mileage of all such township or district roads in the 11county. After July 1 of any year prior to 2011, no allocation 12shall be made for any road district unless it levied a tax for 13road and bridge purposes in an amount which will require the 14extension of such tax against the taxable property in any such 15road district at a rate of not less than either .08% of the 16value thereof, based upon the assessment for the year 17immediately prior to the year in which such tax was levied and 18as equalized by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage 19County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of 20road under the jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is 21less. Beginning July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, an 22allocation shall be made for any road district if it levied a 23tax for road and bridge purposes. In counties other than 24DuPage County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the 25extension of the tax against the taxable property in the road 26district at a rate that is less than 0.08% of the value   SB1319- 11 -LRB104 08662 HLH 18716 b1thereof, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 2prior to the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 3by the Department of Revenue, then the amount of the 4allocation for that road district shall be a percentage of the 5maximum allocation equal to the percentage obtained by 6dividing the rate extended by the district by 0.08%. In DuPage 7County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the extension of 8the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 9rate that is less than the lesser of (i) 0.08% of the value of 10the taxable property in the road district, based upon the 11assessment for the year immediately prior to the year in which 12such tax was levied and as equalized by the Department of 13Revenue, or (ii) a rate that will yield an amount equal to 14$12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road 15district, then the amount of the allocation for the road 16district shall be a percentage of the maximum allocation equal 17to the percentage obtained by dividing the rate extended by 18the district by the lesser of (i) 0.08% or (ii) the rate that 19will yield an amount equal to $12,000 per mile of road under 20the jurisdiction of the road district. 21    Prior to 2011, if any road district has levied a special 22tax for road purposes pursuant to Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 236-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and such tax was levied in 24an amount which would require extension at a rate of not less 25than .08% of the value of the taxable property thereof, as 26equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue, or, in   SB1319- 12 -LRB104 08662 HLH 18716 b1DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 2mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 3whichever is less, such levy shall, however, be deemed a 4proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 5road district for an allotment under this Section. Beginning 6in 2011 and thereafter, if any road district has levied a 7special tax for road purposes under Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 86-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and the tax was levied in 9an amount that would require extension at a rate of not less 10than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property of that road 11district, as equalized or assessed by the Department of 12Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater 13than $12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the 14road district, whichever is less, that levy shall be deemed a 15proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 16road district for a full, rather than proportionate, allotment 17under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is less 18than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property, or, in DuPage 19County if the levy for the special tax is less than the lesser 20of (i) 0.08% or (ii) $12,000 per mile of road under the 21jurisdiction of the road district, and if the levy for the 22special tax is more than any other levy for road and bridge 23purposes, then the levy for the special tax qualifies the road 24district for a proportionate, rather than full, allotment 25under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is equal to 26or less than any other levy for road and bridge purposes, then   SB1319- 13 -LRB104 08662 HLH 18716 b1any allotment under this Section shall be determined by the 2other levy for road and bridge purposes.3    Prior to 2011, if a township has transferred to the road 4and bridge fund money which, when added to the amount of any 5tax levy of the road district would be the equivalent of a tax 6levy requiring extension at a rate of at least .08%, or, in 7DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 8mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 9whichever is less, such transfer, together with any such tax 10levy, shall be deemed a proper compliance with this Section 11and shall qualify the road district for an allotment under 12this Section.13    In counties in which a property tax extension limitation 14is imposed under the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, 15road districts may retain their entitlement to a motor fuel 16tax allotment or, beginning in 2011, their entitlement to a 17full allotment if, at the time the property tax extension 18limitation was imposed, the road district was levying a road 19and bridge tax at a rate sufficient to entitle it to a motor 20fuel tax allotment and continues to levy the maximum allowable 21amount after the imposition of the property tax extension 22limitation. Any road district may in all circumstances retain 23its entitlement to a motor fuel tax allotment or, beginning in 242011, its entitlement to a full allotment if it levied a road 25and bridge tax in an amount that will require the extension of 26the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a   SB1319- 14 -LRB104 08662 HLH 18716 b1rate of not less than 0.08% of the assessed value of the 2property, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 3preceding the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 4by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount 5equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of road under the 6jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is less.7    As used in this Section, the term "road district" means 8any road district, including a county unit road district, 9provided for by the Illinois Highway Code; and the term 10"township or district road" means any road in the township and 11district road system as defined in the Illinois Highway Code. 12For the purposes of this Section, "township or district road" 13also includes such roads as are maintained by park districts, 14forest preserve districts and conservation districts. The 15Department of Transportation shall determine the mileage of 16all township and district roads for the purposes of making 17allotments and allocations of motor fuel tax funds for use in 18road districts.19    Payment of motor fuel tax moneys to municipalities and 20counties shall be made as soon as possible after the allotment 21is made. The treasurer of the municipality or county may 22invest these funds until their use is required and the 23interest earned by these investments shall be limited to the 24same uses as the principal funds.25(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 26102-699, eff. 4-19-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23.)

If a township is reconstituted as 10    provided under Section 24-45 of the Township Code, McHenry 11    County or a municipality shall no longer be distributed 12    moneys under this subparagraph.13    As soon as may be after the first day of each month, the 14Department of Transportation shall allot to each municipality 15its share of the amount apportioned to the several 16municipalities which shall be in proportion to the population 17of such municipalities as determined by the last preceding 18municipal census if conducted by the Federal Government or 19Federal census. If territory is annexed to any municipality 20subsequent to the time of the last preceding census the 21corporate authorities of such municipality may cause a census 22to be taken of such annexed territory and the population so 23ascertained for such territory shall be added to the 24population of the municipality as determined by the last 25preceding census for the purpose of determining the allotment 26for that municipality. If the population of any municipality   SB1319- 9 -LRB104 08662 HLH 18716 b1was not determined by the last Federal census preceding any 2apportionment, the apportionment to such municipality shall be 3in accordance with any census taken by such municipality. Any 4municipal census used in accordance with this Section shall be 5certified to the Department of Transportation by the clerk of 6such municipality, and the accuracy thereof shall be subject 7to approval of the Department which may make such corrections 8as it ascertains to be necessary.9    As soon as may be after the first day of each month, the 10Department of Transportation shall allot to each county its 11share of the amount apportioned to the several counties of the 12State as herein provided. Each allotment to the several 13counties having less than 1,000,000 inhabitants shall be in 14proportion to the amount of motor vehicle license fees 15received from the residents of such counties, respectively, 16during the preceding calendar year. The Secretary of State 17shall, on or before April 15 of each year, transmit to the 18Department of Transportation a full and complete report 19showing the amount of motor vehicle license fees received from 20the residents of each county, respectively, during the 21preceding calendar year. The Department of Transportation 22shall, each month, use for allotment purposes the last such 23report received from the Secretary of State.24    As soon as may be after the first day of each month, the 25Department of Transportation shall allot to the several 26counties their share of the amount apportioned for the use of   SB1319- 10 -LRB104 08662 HLH 18716 b1road districts. The allotment shall be apportioned among the 2several counties in the State in the proportion which the 3total mileage of township or district roads in the respective 4counties bears to the total mileage of all township and 5district roads in the State. Funds allotted to the respective 6counties for the use of road districts therein shall be 7allocated to the several road districts in the county in the 8proportion which the total mileage of such township or 9district roads in the respective road districts bears to the 10total mileage of all such township or district roads in the 11county. After July 1 of any year prior to 2011, no allocation 12shall be made for any road district unless it levied a tax for 13road and bridge purposes in an amount which will require the 14extension of such tax against the taxable property in any such 15road district at a rate of not less than either .08% of the 16value thereof, based upon the assessment for the year 17immediately prior to the year in which such tax was levied and 18as equalized by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage 19County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of 20road under the jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is 21less. Beginning July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, an 22allocation shall be made for any road district if it levied a 23tax for road and bridge purposes. In counties other than 24DuPage County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the 25extension of the tax against the taxable property in the road 26district at a rate that is less than 0.08% of the value   SB1319- 11 -LRB104 08662 HLH 18716 b1thereof, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 2prior to the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 3by the Department of Revenue, then the amount of the 4allocation for that road district shall be a percentage of the 5maximum allocation equal to the percentage obtained by 6dividing the rate extended by the district by 0.08%. In DuPage 7County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the extension of 8the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 9rate that is less than the lesser of (i) 0.08% of the value of 10the taxable property in the road district, based upon the 11assessment for the year immediately prior to the year in which 12such tax was levied and as equalized by the Department of 13Revenue, or (ii) a rate that will yield an amount equal to 14$12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road 15district, then the amount of the allocation for the road 16district shall be a percentage of the maximum allocation equal 17to the percentage obtained by dividing the rate extended by 18the district by the lesser of (i) 0.08% or (ii) the rate that 19will yield an amount equal to $12,000 per mile of road under 20the jurisdiction of the road district. 21    Prior to 2011, if any road district has levied a special 22tax for road purposes pursuant to Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 236-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and such tax was levied in 24an amount which would require extension at a rate of not less 25than .08% of the value of the taxable property thereof, as 26equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue, or, in   SB1319- 12 -LRB104 08662 HLH 18716 b1DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 2mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 3whichever is less, such levy shall, however, be deemed a 4proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 5road district for an allotment under this Section. Beginning 6in 2011 and thereafter, if any road district has levied a 7special tax for road purposes under Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 86-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and the tax was levied in 9an amount that would require extension at a rate of not less 10than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property of that road 11district, as equalized or assessed by the Department of 12Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater 13than $12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the 14road district, whichever is less, that levy shall be deemed a 15proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 16road district for a full, rather than proportionate, allotment 17under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is less 18than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property, or, in DuPage 19County if the levy for the special tax is less than the lesser 20of (i) 0.08% or (ii) $12,000 per mile of road under the 21jurisdiction of the road district, and if the levy for the 22special tax is more than any other levy for road and bridge 23purposes, then the levy for the special tax qualifies the road 24district for a proportionate, rather than full, allotment 25under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is equal to 26or less than any other levy for road and bridge purposes, then   SB1319- 13 -LRB104 08662 HLH 18716 b1any allotment under this Section shall be determined by the 2other levy for road and bridge purposes.3    Prior to 2011, if a township has transferred to the road 4and bridge fund money which, when added to the amount of any 5tax levy of the road district would be the equivalent of a tax 6levy requiring extension at a rate of at least .08%, or, in 7DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 8mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 9whichever is less, such transfer, together with any such tax 10levy, shall be deemed a proper compliance with this Section 11and shall qualify the road district for an allotment under 12this Section.13    In counties in which a property tax extension limitation 14is imposed under the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, 15road districts may retain their entitlement to a motor fuel 16tax allotment or, beginning in 2011, their entitlement to a 17full allotment if, at the time the property tax extension 18limitation was imposed, the road district was levying a road 19and bridge tax at a rate sufficient to entitle it to a motor 20fuel tax allotment and continues to levy the maximum allowable 21amount after the imposition of the property tax extension 22limitation. Any road district may in all circumstances retain 23its entitlement to a motor fuel tax allotment or, beginning in 242011, its entitlement to a full allotment if it levied a road 25and bridge tax in an amount that will require the extension of 26the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a   SB1319- 14 -LRB104 08662 HLH 18716 b1rate of not less than 0.08% of the assessed value of the 2property, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 3preceding the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 4by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount 5equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of road under the 6jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is less.7    As used in this Section, the term "road district" means 8any road district, including a county unit road district, 9provided for by the Illinois Highway Code; and the term 10"township or district road" means any road in the township and 11district road system as defined in the Illinois Highway Code. 12For the purposes of this Section, "township or district road" 13also includes such roads as are maintained by park districts, 14forest preserve districts and conservation districts. The 15Department of Transportation shall determine the mileage of 16all township and district roads for the purposes of making 17allotments and allocations of motor fuel tax funds for use in 18road districts.19    Payment of motor fuel tax moneys to municipalities and 20counties shall be made as soon as possible after the allotment 21is made. The treasurer of the municipality or county may 22invest these funds until their use is required and the 23interest earned by these investments shall be limited to the 24same uses as the principal funds.25(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 26102-699, eff. 4-19-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23.)
