Short title. This Act may be cited as the One 5Health Commission Act. 6    Section 5. Findings and purpose. The General Assembly 7finds that:8        (1) The term "One Health" reflects the 9    interconnectedness of human health, animal health, and the 10    environment.11        (2) The strong connections and interdependency between 12    humans, companion animals, livestock, wildlife, and 13    ecosystem health are recognized in the One Health 14    Framework, which facilitates addressing zoonotic diseases, 15    vector-borne diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and other 16    complex, multidisciplinary issues. 17        (3) Existing One Health initiatives at the federal 18    level were included in both the 2021 Report of the 19    Appropriations Committee of the United States House of 20    Representatives and the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations 21    Act. Congress directed the Centers for Disease Control and 22    Prevention to collaborate with the U.S. Department of 23    Agriculture, U.S. Department of the Interior, and other   SB0291 Enrolled- 2 -LRB104 06089 BDA 16122 b1    federal agency partners: 2            (A) to create a National One Health framework to 3        address zoonotic diseases and advance public health 4        preparedness in the United States; and5            (B) to collaborate with interagency partners on 6        the development of a One Health coordination mechanism 7        at the federal level to strengthen One Health 8        collaboration related to the prevention of, detection 9        of, control of, and response to zoonotic diseases and 10        related One Health work across the federal government. 11        (4) Existing One Health initiatives in other states 12    include the passage of Senate Bill 347 and Assembly Bill 13    1992 in New Jersey in June 2021 for the purpose of 14    developing a New Jersey One Health Commission.15        (5) Awareness and collaboration among disciplines will 16    help protect the environment and the health of all 17    species, will save lives in present and future 18    generations, and will improve the quality of life, the 19    physical and mental health, and the productivity of 20    residents of the State. 21        (6) A One Health approach recognizes that the health 22    of people is connected to the health of animals and the 23    environment, and it has been described as a collaborative, 24    multisector, and transdisciplinary approach, working at 25    the local, regional, national, and global levels, with the 26    goal of achieving optimal health outcomes while   SB0291 Enrolled- 3 -LRB104 06089 BDA 16122 b1    recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, 2    plants, and their shared environment. 3        (7) A One Health approach is important because 4    approximately 60% of known infectious diseases in humans 5    and 75% of emerging infectious diseases originate from 6    animals; environmental factors, including climate change, 7    land-use changes, and biodiversity loss, significantly 8    influence the emergence and transmission of zoonotic 9    diseases. Animals can serve as early warning indicators of 10    potential public health threats, and robust agricultural 11    and environmental health systems are integral to public 12    health preparedness and response efforts.13        (8) It is, therefore, in the public interest for the 14    State to establish a One Health Commission to promote the 15    health and wellness of Illinois' natural resource, 16    residents, and animals, including pets, livestock, and 17    wildlife, by encouraging the collaborative efforts of 18    experts and leveraging knowledge and resources 19    effectively. 20    Section 10.
