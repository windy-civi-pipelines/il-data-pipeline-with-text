Unless the 13hearing officer has granted specific extensions of time at the 14request of a party, a final decision, including the 15clarification of a decision requested under this subsection, 16shall be reached and mailed to the parties named above not 17later than 45 days after the initiation of the timeline for 18conducting the hearing, as described in subsection (g-35) of 19this Section. The decision shall specify the educational and 20related services that shall be provided to the student in 21accordance with the student's needs and the timeline for which 22the school district shall submit evidence to the State Board 23of Education to demonstrate compliance with the hearing 24officer's decision in the event that the decision orders the 25school district to undertake corrective action. The hearing 26officer shall retain jurisdiction for the sole purpose of   HB2337 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1considering a request for clarification of the final decision 2submitted in writing by a party to the impartial hearing 3officer within 5 days after receipt of the decision. A copy of 4the request for clarification shall specify the portions of 5the decision for which clarification is sought and shall be 6mailed to all parties of record and to the State Board of 7Education. The request shall operate to stay implementation of 8those portions of the decision for which clarification is 9sought, pending action on the request by the hearing officer, 10unless the parties otherwise agree. The hearing officer shall 11issue a clarification of the specified portion of the decision 12or issue a partial or full denial of the request in writing 13within 10 days of receipt of the request and mail copies to all 14parties to whom the decision was mailed. This subsection does 15not permit a party to request, or authorize a hearing officer 16to entertain, reconsideration of the decision itself. The 17statute of limitations for seeking review of the decision 18shall be tolled from the date the request is submitted until 19the date the hearing officer acts upon the request. The 20hearing officer's decision shall be binding upon the school 21district and the parents unless a civil action is commenced.22    (i) Any party to an impartial due process hearing 23aggrieved by the final written decision of the impartial due 24process hearing officer shall have the right to commence a 25civil action with respect to the issues presented in the 26impartial due process hearing. That civil action shall be   HB2337 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1brought in any court of competent jurisdiction within 120 days 2after a copy of the decision of the impartial due process 3hearing officer is mailed to the party as provided in 4subsection (h). The civil action authorized by this subsection 5shall not be exclusive of any rights or causes of action 6otherwise available. The commencement of a civil action under 7this subsection shall operate as a supersedeas. In any action 8brought under this subsection the Court shall receive the 9records of the impartial due process hearing, shall hear 10additional evidence at the request of a party, and, basing its 11decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant 12such relief as the court determines is appropriate. In any 13instance where a school district willfully disregards 14applicable regulations or statutes regarding a child covered 15by this Article, and which disregard has been detrimental to 16the child, the school district shall be liable for any 17reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the parent in 18connection with proceedings under this Section.19    (j) During the pendency of any administrative or judicial 20proceeding conducted pursuant to this Section, including 21mediation (if the school district or other public entity 22voluntarily agrees to participate in mediation), unless the 23school district and the parents or student (if at least 18 24years of age or emancipated) otherwise agree, the student 25shall remain in his or her present educational placement and 26continue in his or her present eligibility status and special   HB2337 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1education and related services, if any. If mediation fails to 2resolve the dispute between the parties, or if the parties do 3not agree to use mediation, the parent (or student if 18 years 4of age or older or emancipated) shall have 10 days after the 5mediation concludes, or after a party declines to use 6mediation, to file a request for a due process hearing in order 7to continue to invoke the "stay-put" provisions of this 8subsection (j). If applying for initial admission to the 9school district, the student shall, with the consent of the 10parents (if the student is not at least 18 years of age or 11emancipated), be placed in the school district program until 12all such proceedings have been completed. The costs for any 13special education and related services or placement incurred 14following 60 school days after the initial request for 15evaluation shall be borne by the school district if the 16services or placement is in accordance with the final 17determination as to the special education and related services 18or placement that must be provided to the child, provided that 19during that 60-day period there have been no delays caused by 20the child's parent. The requirements and procedures of this 21subsection (j) shall be included in the uniform notices 22developed by the State Superintendent under subsection (g) of 23Section 14-8.02 of this Code. 24    (k) Whenever the parents of a child of the type described 25in Section 14-1.02 are not known or are unavailable or the 26child is a youth in care as defined in Section 4d of the   HB2337 Enrolled- 19 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1Children and Family Services Act, a person shall be assigned 2to serve as surrogate parent for the child in matters relating 3to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement 4of the child and the provision of a free appropriate public 5education to the child. Persons shall be assigned as surrogate 6parents by the State Superintendent of Education. The State 7Board of Education shall promulgate rules and regulations 8establishing qualifications of those persons and their 9responsibilities and the procedures to be followed in making 10assignments of persons as surrogate parents. Surrogate parents 11shall not be employees of the school district, an agency 12created by joint agreement under Section 10-22.31, an agency 13involved in the education or care of the student, or the State 14Board of Education. Services of any person assigned as 15surrogate parent shall terminate if the parent becomes 16available unless otherwise requested by the parents. The 17assignment of a person as surrogate parent at no time 18supersedes, terminates, or suspends the parents' legal 19authority relative to the child. Any person participating in 20good faith as surrogate parent on behalf of the child before 21school officials or a hearing officer shall have immunity from 22civil or criminal liability that otherwise might result by 23reason of that participation, except in cases of willful and 24wanton misconduct.25    (l) At all stages of the hearing or mediation, the hearing 26officer or mediator shall require that interpreters licensed   HB2337 Enrolled- 20 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1pursuant to the Interpreter for the Deaf Licensure Act of 2007 2be made available by the school district for persons who are 3deaf or qualified interpreters be made available by the school 4district for persons whose normally spoken language is other 5than English.6    (m) If any provision of this Section or its application to 7any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity of 8that provision or application does not affect other provisions 9or applications of the Section that can be given effect 10without the invalid application or provision, and to this end 11the provisions of this Section are severable, unless otherwise 12provided by this Section.13(Source: P.A. 102-1072, eff. 6-10-22.) 14    Section 99.

The parents involved in the hearing shall have the 5right to have the student who is the subject of the hearing 6present. The hearing shall be held at a time and place which 7are reasonably convenient to the parties involved. Upon the 8request of a party, the hearing officer shall hold the hearing 9at a location neutral to the parties if the hearing officer 10determines that there is no cost for securing the use of the 11neutral location. Once appointed, the impartial due process 12hearing officer shall not communicate with the State Board of 13Education or its employees concerning the hearing, except 14that, where circumstances require, communications for 15administrative purposes that do not deal with substantive or 16procedural matters or issues on the merits are authorized, 17provided that the hearing officer promptly notifies all 18parties of the substance of the communication as a matter of 19record.20    (g-5) Unless the school district has previously provided 21prior written notice to the parent or student (if at least 18 22years of age or emancipated) regarding the subject matter of 23the hearing request, the school district shall, within 10 days 24after receiving a hearing request initiated by a parent or 25student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated), provide a 26written response to the request that shall include all of the   HB2337 Enrolled- 6 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1following:2        (1) An explanation of why the school district proposed 3    or refused to take the action or actions described in the 4    hearing request.5        (2) A description of other options the IEP team 6    considered and the reasons why those options were 7    rejected.8        (3) A description of each evaluation procedure, 9    assessment, record, report, or other evidence the school 10    district used as the basis for the proposed or refused 11    action or actions.12        (4) A description of the factors that are or were 13    relevant to the school district's proposed or refused 14    action or actions.15    (g-10) When the hearing request has been initiated by a 16school district, within 10 days after receiving the request, 17the parent or student (if at least 18 years of age or 18emancipated) shall provide the school district with a response 19that specifically addresses the issues raised in the school 20district's hearing request. The parent's or student's response 21shall be provided in writing, unless he or she is illiterate or 22has a disability that prevents him or her from providing a 23written response. The parent's or student's response may be 24provided in his or her native language, if other than English. 25In the event that illiteracy or another disabling condition 26prevents the parent or student from providing a written   HB2337 Enrolled- 7 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1response, the school district shall assist the parent or 2student in providing the written response.3    (g-15) Within 15 days after receiving notice of the 4hearing request, the non-requesting party may challenge the 5sufficiency of the request by submitting its challenge in 6writing to the hearing officer. Within 5 days after receiving 7the challenge to the sufficiency of the request, the hearing 8officer shall issue a determination of the challenge in 9writing to the parties. In the event that the hearing officer 10upholds the challenge, the party who requested the hearing 11may, with the consent of the non-requesting party or hearing 12officer, file an amended request. Amendments are permissible 13for the purpose of raising issues beyond those in the initial 14hearing request. In addition, the party who requested the 15hearing may amend the request once as a matter of right by 16filing the amended request within 5 days after filing the 17initial request. An amended request, other than an amended 18request as a matter of right, shall be filed by the date 19determined by the hearing officer, but in no event any later 20than 5 days prior to the date of the hearing. If an amended 21request, other than an amended request as a matter of right, 22raises issues that were not part of the initial request, the 23applicable timeline for a hearing, including the timeline 24under subsection (g-20) of this Section, shall recommence.25    (g-20) Within 15 days after receiving a request for a 26hearing from a parent or student (if at least 18 years of age   HB2337 Enrolled- 8 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1or emancipated) or, in the event that the school district 2requests a hearing, within 15 days after initiating the 3request, the school district shall convene a resolution 4meeting with the parent and relevant members of the IEP team 5who have specific knowledge of the facts contained in the 6request for the purpose of resolving the problem that resulted 7in the request. The resolution meeting shall include a 8representative of the school district who has decision-making 9authority on behalf of the school district. Unless the parent 10is accompanied by an attorney at the resolution meeting, the 11school district may not include an attorney representing the 12school district.13    The resolution meeting may not be waived unless agreed to 14in writing by the school district and the parent or student (if 15at least 18 years of age or emancipated) or the parent or 16student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) and the 17school district agree in writing to utilize mediation in place 18of the resolution meeting. If either party fails to cooperate 19in the scheduling or convening of the resolution meeting, the 20hearing officer may order an extension of the timeline for 21completion of the resolution meeting or, upon the motion of a 22party and at least 7 days after ordering the non-cooperating 23party to cooperate, order the dismissal of the hearing request 24or the granting of all relief set forth in the request, as 25appropriate.26    In the event that the school district and the parent or   HB2337 Enrolled- 9 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) agree to a 2resolution of the problem that resulted in the hearing 3request, the terms of the resolution shall be committed to 4writing and signed by the parent or student (if at least 18 5years of age or emancipated) and the representative of the 6school district with decision-making authority. The agreement 7shall be legally binding and shall be enforceable in any State 8or federal court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that 9the parties utilize the resolution meeting process, the 10process shall continue until no later than the 30th day 11following the receipt of the hearing request by the 12non-requesting party (or as properly extended by order of the 13hearing officer) to resolve the issues underlying the request, 14at which time the timeline for completion of the impartial due 15process hearing shall commence. The State Board of Education 16may, by rule, establish additional procedures for the conduct 17of resolution meetings.18    (g-25) If mutually agreed to in writing, the parties to a 19hearing request may request State-sponsored mediation as a 20substitute for the resolution process described in subsection 21(g-20) of this Section or may utilize mediation at the close of 22the resolution process if all issues underlying the hearing 23request have not been resolved through the resolution process.24    (g-30) If mutually agreed to in writing, the parties to a 25hearing request may waive the resolution process described in 26subsection (g-20) of this Section.

If the prehearing conference is held by telephone, 2the parties shall transmit the information required in this 3paragraph in such a manner that it is available to all parties 4at the time of the prehearing conference. The State Board of 5Education may, by rule, establish additional procedures for 6the conduct of prehearing conferences. 7    (g-45) The impartial due process hearing officer shall not 8initiate or participate in any ex parte communications with 9the parties, except to arrange the date, time, and location of 10the prehearing conference, due process hearing, or other 11status conferences convened at the discretion of the hearing 12officer and to receive confirmation of whether a party intends 13to participate in the prehearing conference. 14    (g-50) The parties shall disclose and provide to each 15other any evidence which they intend to submit into the 16hearing record no later than 5 days before the hearing.

This subsection (g-55) 3shall not be applied in a manner that (i) denies any party to 4the hearing a fair and reasonable allocation of time and 5opportunity to present its case in its entirety or (ii) 6deprives any party to the hearing of the safeguards accorded 7under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education 8Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-446), regulations 9promulgated under the Individuals with Disabilities Education 10Improvement Act of 2004, or any other applicable law. The 11school district shall present evidence that the special 12education needs of the child have been appropriately 13identified and that the special education program and related 14services proposed to meet the needs of the child are adequate, 15appropriate, and available. Any party to the hearing shall 16have the right to (1) be represented by counsel and be 17accompanied and advised by individuals with special knowledge 18or training with respect to the problems of children with 19disabilities, at the party's own expense; (2) present evidence 20and confront and cross-examine witnesses; (3) move for the 21exclusion of witnesses from the hearing until they are called 22to testify, provided, however, that this provision may not be 23invoked to exclude the individual designated by a party to 24assist that party or its representative in the presentation of 25the case; (4) obtain a written or electronic verbatim record 26of the proceedings within 30 days of receipt of a written   HB2337 Enrolled- 14 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1request from the parents by the school district; and (5) 2obtain a written decision, including findings of fact and 3conclusions of law, within 10 calendar days, excluding 4Saturday, Sunday, and any State holiday, after the conclusion 5of the hearing. If at issue, the school district shall present 6evidence that it has properly identified and evaluated the 7nature and severity of the student's suspected or identified 8disability and that, if the student has been or should have 9been determined eligible for special education and related 10services, that it is providing or has offered a free 11appropriate public education to the student in the least 12restrictive environment, consistent with procedural safeguards 13and in accordance with an individualized educational program. 14At any time prior to the conclusion of the hearing, the 15impartial due process hearing officer shall have the authority 16to require additional information and order independent 17evaluations for the student at the expense of the school 18district. The State Board of Education and the school district 19shall share equally the costs of providing a written or 20electronic verbatim record of the proceedings. Any party may 21request that the due process hearing officer issue a subpoena 22to compel the testimony of witnesses or the production of 23documents relevant to the resolution of the hearing. Whenever 24a person refuses to comply with any subpoena issued under this 25Section, the circuit court of the county in which that hearing 26is pending, on application of the impartial hearing officer or   HB2337 Enrolled- 15 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1the party requesting the issuance of the subpoena, may compel 2compliance through the contempt powers of the court in the 3same manner as if the requirements of a subpoena issued by the 4court had been disobeyed.5    (h) The impartial hearing officer shall issue a written 6decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, 7within 10 calendar days, excluding Saturday, Sunday, and any 8State holiday, after the conclusion of the hearing and send by 9certified mail a copy of the decision to the parents or student 10(if the student requests the hearing), the school district, 11the director of special education, legal representatives of 12the parties, and the State Board of Education. Unless the 13hearing officer has granted specific extensions of time at the 14request of a party, a final decision, including the 15clarification of a decision requested under this subsection, 16shall be reached and mailed to the parties named above not 17later than 45 days after the initiation of the timeline for 18conducting the hearing, as described in subsection (g-35) of 19this Section. The decision shall specify the educational and 20related services that shall be provided to the student in 21accordance with the student's needs and the timeline for which 22the school district shall submit evidence to the State Board 23of Education to demonstrate compliance with the hearing 24officer's decision in the event that the decision orders the 25school district to undertake corrective action. The hearing 26officer shall retain jurisdiction for the sole purpose of   HB2337 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1considering a request for clarification of the final decision 2submitted in writing by a party to the impartial hearing 3officer within 5 days after receipt of the decision. A copy of 4the request for clarification shall specify the portions of 5the decision for which clarification is sought and shall be 6mailed to all parties of record and to the State Board of 7Education. The request shall operate to stay implementation of 8those portions of the decision for which clarification is 9sought, pending action on the request by the hearing officer, 10unless the parties otherwise agree. The hearing officer shall 11issue a clarification of the specified portion of the decision 12or issue a partial or full denial of the request in writing 13within 10 days of receipt of the request and mail copies to all 14parties to whom the decision was mailed. This subsection does 15not permit a party to request, or authorize a hearing officer 16to entertain, reconsideration of the decision itself. The 17statute of limitations for seeking review of the decision 18shall be tolled from the date the request is submitted until 19the date the hearing officer acts upon the request. The 20hearing officer's decision shall be binding upon the school 21district and the parents unless a civil action is commenced.22    (i) Any party to an impartial due process hearing 23aggrieved by the final written decision of the impartial due 24process hearing officer shall have the right to commence a 25civil action with respect to the issues presented in the 26impartial due process hearing. That civil action shall be   HB2337 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1brought in any court of competent jurisdiction within 120 days 2after a copy of the decision of the impartial due process 3hearing officer is mailed to the party as provided in 4subsection (h). The civil action authorized by this subsection 5shall not be exclusive of any rights or causes of action 6otherwise available. The commencement of a civil action under 7this subsection shall operate as a supersedeas. In any action 8brought under this subsection the Court shall receive the 9records of the impartial due process hearing, shall hear 10additional evidence at the request of a party, and, basing its 11decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant 12such relief as the court determines is appropriate. In any 13instance where a school district willfully disregards 14applicable regulations or statutes regarding a child covered 15by this Article, and which disregard has been detrimental to 16the child, the school district shall be liable for any 17reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the parent in 18connection with proceedings under this Section.19    (j) During the pendency of any administrative or judicial 20proceeding conducted pursuant to this Section, including 21mediation (if the school district or other public entity 22voluntarily agrees to participate in mediation), unless the 23school district and the parents or student (if at least 18 24years of age or emancipated) otherwise agree, the student 25shall remain in his or her present educational placement and 26continue in his or her present eligibility status and special   HB2337 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1education and related services, if any. If mediation fails to 2resolve the dispute between the parties, or if the parties do 3not agree to use mediation, the parent (or student if 18 years 4of age or older or emancipated) shall have 10 days after the 5mediation concludes, or after a party declines to use 6mediation, to file a request for a due process hearing in order 7to continue to invoke the "stay-put" provisions of this 8subsection (j). If applying for initial admission to the 9school district, the student shall, with the consent of the 10parents (if the student is not at least 18 years of age or 11emancipated), be placed in the school district program until 12all such proceedings have been completed. The costs for any 13special education and related services or placement incurred 14following 60 school days after the initial request for 15evaluation shall be borne by the school district if the 16services or placement is in accordance with the final 17determination as to the special education and related services 18or placement that must be provided to the child, provided that 19during that 60-day period there have been no delays caused by 20the child's parent. The requirements and procedures of this 21subsection (j) shall be included in the uniform notices 22developed by the State Superintendent under subsection (g) of 23Section 14-8.02 of this Code. 24    (k) Whenever the parents of a child of the type described 25in Section 14-1.02 are not known or are unavailable or the 26child is a youth in care as defined in Section 4d of the   HB2337 Enrolled- 19 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1Children and Family Services Act, a person shall be assigned 2to serve as surrogate parent for the child in matters relating 3to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement 4of the child and the provision of a free appropriate public 5education to the child. Persons shall be assigned as surrogate 6parents by the State Superintendent of Education. The State 7Board of Education shall promulgate rules and regulations 8establishing qualifications of those persons and their 9responsibilities and the procedures to be followed in making 10assignments of persons as surrogate parents. Surrogate parents 11shall not be employees of the school district, an agency 12created by joint agreement under Section 10-22.31, an agency 13involved in the education or care of the student, or the State 14Board of Education. Services of any person assigned as 15surrogate parent shall terminate if the parent becomes 16available unless otherwise requested by the parents. The 17assignment of a person as surrogate parent at no time 18supersedes, terminates, or suspends the parents' legal 19authority relative to the child. Any person participating in 20good faith as surrogate parent on behalf of the child before 21school officials or a hearing officer shall have immunity from 22civil or criminal liability that otherwise might result by 23reason of that participation, except in cases of willful and 24wanton misconduct.25    (l) At all stages of the hearing or mediation, the hearing 26officer or mediator shall require that interpreters licensed   HB2337 Enrolled- 20 -LRB104 07782 LNS 17827 b1pursuant to the Interpreter for the Deaf Licensure Act of 2007 2be made available by the school district for persons who are 3deaf or qualified interpreters be made available by the school 4district for persons whose normally spoken language is other 5than English.6    (m) If any provision of this Section or its application to 7any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity of 8that provision or application does not affect other provisions 9or applications of the Section that can be given effect 10without the invalid application or provision, and to this end 11the provisions of this Section are severable, unless otherwise 12provided by this Section.13(Source: P.A. 102-1072, eff. 6-10-22.) 14    Section 99.
