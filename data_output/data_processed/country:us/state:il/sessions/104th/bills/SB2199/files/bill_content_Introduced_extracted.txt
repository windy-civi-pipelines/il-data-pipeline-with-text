Agencies seeking a reciprocity 2waiver for training completed outside of Illinois must conduct 3a thorough background check and provide verification of the 4officer's prior training. After review and satisfaction of all 5requested conditions, the officer shall be awarded an 6equivalency certificate satisfying the requirements of this 7Section. Within 60 days after the effective date of this 8amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly, the Board shall 9adopt uniform rules providing for a waiver process for a 10person previously employed and qualified as a law enforcement 11or county corrections officer under federal law or the laws of 12any other state, or who has completed a basic law enforcement 13officer or correctional officer academy who would be qualified 14to be employed as a law enforcement officer or correctional 15officer by the federal government or any other state. These 16rules shall address the process for evaluating prior training 17credit, a description and list of the courses typically 18required for reciprocity candidates to complete prior to 19taking the exam, and a procedure for employers seeking a 20pre-activation determination for a reciprocity training 21waiver.

Any hiring agency that fails to train a 14law enforcement officer within this period shall be prohibited 15from employing this individual in a law enforcement capacity 16for one year from the date training was to be completed. If an 17agency again fails to train the individual a second time, the 18agency shall be permanently barred from employing this 19individual in a law enforcement capacity.20    An individual who is not certified by the Board or whose 21certified status is inactive shall not function as a law 22enforcement officer, be assigned the duties of a law 23enforcement officer by an employing agency, or be authorized 24to carry firearms under the authority of the employer, except 25as otherwise authorized to carry a firearm under State or 26federal law.
