If the records of the county clerk or board of election 22commissioners indicates that the provisional voter is 23registered to vote, but the statewide voter registration 24database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 25that the provisional voter is not registered to vote, then the 26information found in the records of the county clerk or board   SB2239- 21 -LRB104 09172 SPS 19228 b1of election commissioners shall control the matter and the 2provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to vote. If 3the provisional voter's signature on his or her provisional 4ballot request varies from the signature on an otherwise valid 5registration application solely because of the substitution of 6initials for the first or middle name, the election authority 7may not reject the provisional ballot.8    (d) In validating the registration status of a person 9casting a provisional ballot, the county clerk or board of 10election commissioners shall not require a provisional voter 11to complete any form other than the affidavit executed by the 12provisional voter under subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5. In 13addition, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 14shall not require all provisional voters or any particular 15class or group of provisional voters to appear personally 16before the county clerk or board of election commissioners or 17as a matter of policy require provisional voters to submit 18additional information to verify or otherwise support the 19information already submitted by the provisional voter. Within 202 calendar days after the election, the election authority 21shall transmit by electronic means pursuant to a process 22established by the State Board of Elections the name, street 23address, e-mail address, and precinct, ward, township, and 24district numbers, as the case may be, of each person casting a 25provisional ballot to the State Board of Elections, which 26shall maintain those names and that information in an   SB2239- 22 -LRB104 09172 SPS 19228 b1electronic format on its website, arranged by county and 2accessible to State and local political committees. The 3provisional voter may, within 7 calendar days after the 4election, submit additional information to the county clerk or 5board of election commissioners. This information must be 6received by the county clerk or board of election 7commissioners within the 7-calendar-day period.8    (e) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 9determines that subsection (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) does not 10apply, then the provisional ballot is not valid and may not be 11counted. The provisional ballot envelope containing the ballot 12cast by the provisional voter may not be opened. The county 13clerk or board of election commissioners shall write on the 14provisional ballot envelope the following: "Provisional ballot 15determined invalid.".16    (f) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 17determines that a provisional ballot is valid under this 18Section, then the provisional ballot envelope shall be opened. 19The outside of each provisional ballot envelope shall also be 20marked to identify the precinct and the date of the election.21    (g) Provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be 22counted at the election authority's central ballot counting 23location and shall not be counted in precincts. The 24provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be added to 25the vote totals for the precincts from which they were cast in 26the order in which the ballots were opened. The validation and   SB2239- 23 -LRB104 09172 SPS 19228 b1counting of provisional ballots shall be subject to the 2provisions of this Code that apply to pollwatchers. If the 3provisional ballots are a ballot of a punch card voting 4system, then the provisional ballot shall be counted in a 5manner consistent with Article 24A. If the provisional ballots 6are a ballot of optical scan or other type of approved 7electronic voting system, then the provisional ballots shall 8be counted in a manner consistent with Article 24B.9    (h) As soon as the ballots have been counted, the election 10judges or election officials shall, in the presence of the 11county clerk or board of election commissioners, place each of 12the following items in a separate envelope or bag: (1) all 13provisional ballots, voted or spoiled; (2) all provisional 14ballot envelopes of provisional ballots voted or spoiled; and 15(3) all executed affidavits of the provisional ballots voted 16or spoiled. All provisional ballot envelopes for provisional 17voters who have been determined not to be registered to vote 18shall remain sealed. The county clerk or board of election 19commissioners shall treat the provisional ballot envelope 20containing the written affidavit as a voter registration 21application for that person for the next election and process 22that application. The election judges or election officials 23shall then securely seal each envelope or bag, initial the 24envelope or bag, and plainly mark on the outside of the 25envelope or bag in ink the precinct in which the provisional 26ballots were cast. The election judges or election officials   SB2239- 24 -LRB104 09172 SPS 19228 b1shall then place each sealed envelope or bag into a box, secure 2and seal it in the same manner as described in item (6) of 3subsection (b) of Section 18A-5. Each election judge or 4election official shall take and subscribe an oath before the 5county clerk or board of election commissioners that the 6election judge or election official securely kept the ballots 7and papers in the box, did not permit any person to open the 8box or otherwise touch or tamper with the ballots and papers in 9the box, and has no knowledge of any other person opening the 10box. For purposes of this Section, the term "election 11official" means the county clerk, a member of the board of 12election commissioners, as the case may be, and their 13respective employees.14(Source: P.A. 97-766, eff. 7-6-12; 98-115, eff. 7-29-13; 1598-691, eff. 7-1-14; 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.)

If the information is available from one or more of 23the identified sources, then the county clerk or board of 24election commissioners shall seek to obtain the information 25from each of those sources until satisfied, with information 26from at least one of those sources, that the provisional voter   SB2239- 20 -LRB104 09172 SPS 19228 b1is registered and entitled to vote. The county clerk or board 2of election commissioners shall use any information it obtains 3as the basis for determining the voter registration status of 4the provisional voter.

The county 13clerk or board of election commissioners shall write on the 14provisional ballot envelope the following: "Provisional ballot 15determined invalid.".16    (f) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 17determines that a provisional ballot is valid under this 18Section, then the provisional ballot envelope shall be opened. 19The outside of each provisional ballot envelope shall also be 20marked to identify the precinct and the date of the election.21    (g) Provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be 22counted at the election authority's central ballot counting 23location and shall not be counted in precincts. The 24provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be added to 25the vote totals for the precincts from which they were cast in 26the order in which the ballots were opened. The validation and   SB2239- 23 -LRB104 09172 SPS 19228 b1counting of provisional ballots shall be subject to the 2provisions of this Code that apply to pollwatchers. If the 3provisional ballots are a ballot of a punch card voting 4system, then the provisional ballot shall be counted in a 5manner consistent with Article 24A.

The county clerk or board of election 19commissioners shall treat the provisional ballot envelope 20containing the written affidavit as a voter registration 21application for that person for the next election and process 22that application. The election judges or election officials 23shall then securely seal each envelope or bag, initial the 24envelope or bag, and plainly mark on the outside of the 25envelope or bag in ink the precinct in which the provisional 26ballots were cast. The election judges or election officials   SB2239- 24 -LRB104 09172 SPS 19228 b1shall then place each sealed envelope or bag into a box, secure 2and seal it in the same manner as described in item (6) of 3subsection (b) of Section 18A-5. Each election judge or 4election official shall take and subscribe an oath before the 5county clerk or board of election commissioners that the 6election judge or election official securely kept the ballots 7and papers in the box, did not permit any person to open the 8box or otherwise touch or tamper with the ballots and papers in 9the box, and has no knowledge of any other person opening the 10box.
