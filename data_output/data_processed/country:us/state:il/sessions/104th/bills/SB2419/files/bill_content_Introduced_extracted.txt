The employer is not required to discharge 24    any employee, transfer any employee with more seniority, 25    or promote any employee who is not qualified to perform 26    the job, unless the employer does so or would do so to   SB2419- 39 -LRB104 11063 JRC 21145 b1    accommodate other classes of employees who need it.2        (K) Notice.3            (1) For an employer to fail to post or keep posted 4        in a conspicuous location on the premises of the 5        employer where notices to employees are customarily 6        posted, or fail to include in any employee handbook 7        information concerning an employee's rights under this 8        Article, a notice, to be prepared or approved by the 9        Department, summarizing the requirements of this 10        Article and information pertaining to the filing of a 11        charge, including the right to be free from unlawful 12        discrimination, the right to be free from sexual 13        harassment, and the right to certain reasonable 14        accommodations. The Department shall make the 15        documents required under this paragraph available for 16        retrieval from the Department's website. 17            (2) Upon notification of a violation of paragraph 18        (1) of this subdivision (K), the Department may launch 19        a preliminary investigation. If the Department finds a 20        violation, the Department may issue a notice to show 21        cause giving the employer 30 days to correct the 22        violation. If the violation is not corrected, the 23        Department may initiate a charge of a civil rights 24        violation. 25        (L) Use of artificial intelligence.26            (1) With respect to recruitment, hiring,   SB2419- 40 -LRB104 11063 JRC 21145 b1        promotion, renewal of employment, selection for 2        training or apprenticeship, discharge, discipline, 3        tenure, or the terms, privileges, or conditions of 4        employment, for an employer to use artificial 5        intelligence that has the effect of subjecting 6        employees to discrimination on the basis of protected 7        classes under this Article or to use zip codes as a 8        proxy for protected classes under this Article.9            (2) For an employer to fail to provide notice to an 10        employee that the employer is using artificial 11        intelligence for the purposes described in paragraph 12        (1).13        The Department shall adopt any rules necessary for the 14    implementation and enforcement of this subdivision, 15    including, but not limited to, rules on the circumstances 16    and conditions that require notice, the time period for 17    providing notice, and the means for providing notice.18(Source: P.A. 102-233, eff. 8-2-21; 103-797, eff. 1-1-25; 19103-804, eff. 1-1-26; revised 11-26-24.) 20    Section 95.
