Full Text of SB0009 ILGA.GOV SB0009 - 104th General Assembly Sen. Linda HolmesFiled: 4/2/2025   10400SB0009sam001LRB104 06297 BDA 24617 a1AMENDMENT TO SENATE BILL 92    AMENDMENT NO. ______. Amend Senate Bill 9 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 1. Short title; references to Act. 5    (a) Short Title. This Act may be cited as the End-of-Life 6Options for Terminally Ill Patients Act.7    (b) References to Act. This Act may be referred to as Deb's 8Law. 9    Section 5. Findings and intent. 10    (a) The General Assembly finds that: 11        (1) Medical aid in dying is part of general medical 12    care and complements other end-of-life options, such as 13    comfort care, pain control, palliative care, and hospice 14    care, for individuals to have an end-of-life experience 15    aligned with their beliefs and values. 16        (2) The availability of medical aid in dying provides   10400SB0009sam001- 2 -LRB104 06297 BDA 24617 a1    an additional end-of-life care option for terminally ill 2    individuals who seek to retain their autonomy and some 3    level of control over the progression of the disease as 4    they near the end of life or to ease unnecessary pain and 5    suffering. 6        (3) Illinoisans facing a terminal diagnosis have been 7    at the forefront of statewide efforts to provide the full 8    range of end-of-life care options available in 10 states 9    and the District of Columbia, to qualified mentally 10    capable terminal adults residing in Illinois through the 11    addition of medical aid-in-dying care as an end-of-life 12    option in their home state. Advocates include: 13            (A) Deb Robertson, a lifelong Illinois resident 14        who has been living with a rare form of her terminal 15        illness, who wants to live but knows that she is going 16        to die, and who has been actively engaged in advocacy 17        to change Illinois law because she doesn't want to 18        move to another state in order to access the 19        end-of-life medical care that would bring her comfort 20        and reduce her fear related to the pain of dying. 21            (B) Andrew Flack, who could not move back to 22        Illinois to be with his family after his terminal 23        diagnosis and instead had to live hundreds of miles 24        away from his family, in a state that offered medical 25        aid-in-dying care, in order to have a painless death 26        surrounded by his loved ones.   10400SB0009sam001- 3 -LRB104 06297 BDA 24617 a1            (C) Miguel Carrasquillo, who despite enduring 2        excruciatingly painful treatments to cure his cancer, 3        which spread to his liver, stomach, testicles, and 4        other organs, continued to advocate for a change in 5        the law until his death, so other Illinoisans with a 6        terminal diagnosis would not be forced to suffer at 7        the end of their lives and die in pain as he did but 8        would instead have the option of medical aid-in-dying 9        care. 10        (4) Illinoisans throughout the State, across 11    demographics, including religion, political affiliation, 12    race, gender, disability, and age, also support the 13    inclusion of medical aid-in-dying care in the options 14    available for end-of-life care. Supporters and advocates 15    recognize that mentally capable adult individuals have a 16    fundamental right to determine their own medical treatment 17    options in accordance with their own values, beliefs, or 18    personal preferences, and having the option of medical aid 19    in dying is an expression of this fundamental right. This 20    includes advocates, like Lowell Sachnoff, who, alongside 21    his wife Fay Clayton, was a tireless advocate for the 22    expansion of end-of-life options for terminally ill adults 23    over the course of a decade, up to and including the day he 24    died. 25    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to uphold both 26the highest standard of medical care and the full range of   10400SB0009sam001- 4 -LRB104 06297 BDA 24617 a1options for each individual, particularly at the end of life. 2    Section 10.

Full Text of SB0009 ILGA.GOV SB0009 - 104th General Assembly Sen. Linda HolmesFiled: 4/2/2025   10400SB0009sam001LRB104 06297 BDA 24617 a1AMENDMENT TO SENATE BILL 92    AMENDMENT NO. ______. Amend Senate Bill 9 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 1. Short title; references to Act. 5    (a) Short Title. This Act may be cited as the End-of-Life 6Options for Terminally Ill Patients Act.7    (b) References to Act. This Act may be referred to as Deb's 8Law. 9    Section 5. Findings and intent. 10    (a) The General Assembly finds that: 11        (1) Medical aid in dying is part of general medical 12    care and complements other end-of-life options, such as 13    comfort care, pain control, palliative care, and hospice 14    care, for individuals to have an end-of-life experience 15    aligned with their beliefs and values. 16        (2) The availability of medical aid in dying provides   10400SB0009sam001- 2 -LRB104 06297 BDA 24617 a1    an additional end-of-life care option for terminally ill 2    individuals who seek to retain their autonomy and some 3    level of control over the progression of the disease as 4    they near the end of life or to ease unnecessary pain and 5    suffering. 6        (3) Illinoisans facing a terminal diagnosis have been 7    at the forefront of statewide efforts to provide the full 8    range of end-of-life care options available in 10 states 9    and the District of Columbia, to qualified mentally 10    capable terminal adults residing in Illinois through the 11    addition of medical aid-in-dying care as an end-of-life 12    option in their home state. Advocates include: 13            (A) Deb Robertson, a lifelong Illinois resident 14        who has been living with a rare form of her terminal 15        illness, who wants to live but knows that she is going 16        to die, and who has been actively engaged in advocacy 17        to change Illinois law because she doesn't want to 18        move to another state in order to access the 19        end-of-life medical care that would bring her comfort 20        and reduce her fear related to the pain of dying. 21            (B) Andrew Flack, who could not move back to 22        Illinois to be with his family after his terminal 23        diagnosis and instead had to live hundreds of miles 24        away from his family, in a state that offered medical 25        aid-in-dying care, in order to have a painless death 26        surrounded by his loved ones.   10400SB0009sam001- 3 -LRB104 06297 BDA 24617 a1            (C) Miguel Carrasquillo, who despite enduring 2        excruciatingly painful treatments to cure his cancer, 3        which spread to his liver, stomach, testicles, and 4        other organs, continued to advocate for a change in 5        the law until his death, so other Illinoisans with a 6        terminal diagnosis would not be forced to suffer at 7        the end of their lives and die in pain as he did but 8        would instead have the option of medical aid-in-dying 9        care. 10        (4) Illinoisans throughout the State, across 11    demographics, including religion, political affiliation, 12    race, gender, disability, and age, also support the 13    inclusion of medical aid-in-dying care in the options 14    available for end-of-life care. Supporters and advocates 15    recognize that mentally capable adult individuals have a 16    fundamental right to determine their own medical treatment 17    options in accordance with their own values, beliefs, or 18    personal preferences, and having the option of medical aid 19    in dying is an expression of this fundamental right. This 20    includes advocates, like Lowell Sachnoff, who, alongside 21    his wife Fay Clayton, was a tireless advocate for the 22    expansion of end-of-life options for terminally ill adults 23    over the course of a decade, up to and including the day he 24    died. 25    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to uphold both 26the highest standard of medical care and the full range of   10400SB0009sam001- 4 -LRB104 06297 BDA 24617 a1options for each individual, particularly at the end of life. 2    Section 10.
