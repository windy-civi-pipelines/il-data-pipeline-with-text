This 21-day period for 23        service on the chief legal counsel shall not be 24        construed to be jurisdictional. 25    (G) Time Limit.26        (1) When a charge of a civil rights violation has been   SB2487 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 10317 JRC 20391 b1    properly filed, the Department, within 365 days thereof or 2    within any extension of that period agreed to in writing 3    by all parties, shall issue its report as required by 4    subparagraph (D). Any such report shall be duly served 5    upon both the complainant and the respondent.6        (2) If the Department has not issued its report within 7    365 days after the charge is filed, or any such longer 8    period agreed to in writing by all the parties, the 9    complainant shall have 90 days to either file the 10    complainant's own complaint with the Human Rights 11    Commission or commence a civil action in the appropriate 12    circuit court. If the complainant files a complaint with 13    the Commission, the form of the complaint shall be in 14    accordance with the provisions of paragraph (F)(1). If the 15    complainant commences a civil action in a circuit court, 16    the form of the complaint shall be in accordance with the 17    Code of Civil Procedure. The aggrieved party shall notify 18    the Department that a complaint has been filed by serving 19    a copy of the complaint on the chief legal counsel of the 20    Department with 21 days from the date that the complaint 21    is filed with the Commission or in circuit court. This 22    21-day period for service on the chief legal counsel shall 23    not be construed to be jurisdictional. If the complainant 24    files a complaint with the Commission, the complainant may 25    not later commence a civil action in circuit court. 26        (3) If an aggrieved party files a complaint with the   SB2487 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 10317 JRC 20391 b1    Human Rights Commission or commences a civil action in 2    circuit court pursuant to paragraph (2) of this 3    subsection, or if the time period for filing a complaint 4    has expired, the Department shall immediately cease its 5    investigation and dismiss the charge of civil rights 6    violation.
