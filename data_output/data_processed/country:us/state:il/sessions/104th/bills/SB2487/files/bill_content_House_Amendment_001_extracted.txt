This 21-day period for 5    service on the chief legal counsel shall not be construed 6    to be jurisdictional. 7        (2) If the complainant chooses to commence a civil 8    action in a circuit court:9            (i) The complainant shall file the civil action in 10        the circuit court in the county wherein the civil 11        rights violation was allegedly committed. 12            (ii) The form of the complaint in any such civil 13        action shall be in accordance with the Code of Civil 14        Procedure.15            (iii) The complainant shall notify the Department 16        that a complaint has been filed by serving a copy of 17        the complaint on the chief legal counsel of the 18        Department within 21 days from date that the complaint 19        is filed in circuit court.

Any such report shall be duly served 2    upon both the complainant and the respondent.3        (2) If the Department has not issued its report within 4    365 days after the charge is filed, or any such longer 5    period agreed to in writing by all the parties, the 6    complainant shall have 90 days to either file the 7    complainant's own complaint with the Human Rights 8    Commission or commence a civil action in the appropriate 9    circuit court. If the complainant files a complaint with 10    the Commission, the form of the complaint shall be in 11    accordance with the provisions of paragraph (F)(1).

This 21-day period for 5    service on the chief legal counsel shall not be construed 6    to be jurisdictional. 7        (2) If the complainant chooses to commence a civil 8    action in a circuit court:9            (i) The complainant shall file the civil action in 10        the circuit court in the county wherein the civil 11        rights violation was allegedly committed. 12            (ii) The form of the complaint in any such civil 13        action shall be in accordance with the Code of Civil 14        Procedure.15            (iii) The complainant shall notify the Department 16        that a complaint has been filed by serving a copy of 17        the complaint on the chief legal counsel of the 18        Department within 21 days from date that the complaint 19        is filed in circuit court. This 21-day period for 20        service on the chief legal counsel shall not be 21        construed to be jurisdictional. 22    (G) Time Limit.23        (1) When a charge of a civil rights violation has been 24    properly filed, the Department, within 365 days thereof or 25    within any extension of that period agreed to in writing 26    by all parties, shall issue its report as required by   10400SB2487ham001- 17 -LRB104 10317 JRC 25524 a1    subparagraph (D). Any such report shall be duly served 2    upon both the complainant and the respondent.3        (2) If the Department has not issued its report within 4    365 days after the charge is filed, or any such longer 5    period agreed to in writing by all the parties, the 6    complainant shall have 90 days to either file the 7    complainant's own complaint with the Human Rights 8    Commission or commence a civil action in the appropriate 9    circuit court. If the complainant files a complaint with 10    the Commission, the form of the complaint shall be in 11    accordance with the provisions of paragraph (F)(1). If the 12    complainant commences a civil action in a circuit court, 13    the form of the complaint shall be in accordance with the 14    Code of Civil Procedure. The aggrieved party shall notify 15    the Department that a complaint has been filed by serving 16    a copy of the complaint on the chief legal counsel of the 17    Department with 21 days from the date that the complaint 18    is filed with the Commission or in circuit court. This 19    21-day period for service on the chief legal counsel shall 20    not be construed to be jurisdictional. If the complainant 21    files a complaint with the Commission, the complainant may 22    not later commence a civil action in circuit court. 23        (3) If an aggrieved party files a complaint with the 24    Human Rights Commission or commences a civil action in 25    circuit court pursuant to paragraph (2) of this 26    subsection, or if the time period for filing a complaint   10400SB2487ham001- 18 -LRB104 10317 JRC 25524 a1    has expired, the Department shall immediately cease its 2    investigation and dismiss the charge of civil rights 3    violation. Any final order entered by the Commission under 4    this Section is appealable in accordance with paragraph 5    (B)(1) of Section 8-111. Failure to immediately cease an 6    investigation and dismiss the charge of civil rights 7    violation as provided in this paragraph (3) constitutes 8    grounds for entry of an order by the circuit court 9    permanently enjoining the investigation.
