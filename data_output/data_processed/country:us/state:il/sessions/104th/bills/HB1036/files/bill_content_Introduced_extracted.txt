If the matter is set for hearing, the 18    Board shall send the law enforcement officer the notice of 19    the date, time and location of the hearing. If the law 20    enforcement officer or counsel for the officer does 21    appear, at the Board's discretion, the hearing may proceed 22    or may be continued to a date and time agreed upon by all 23    parties. If on the date of the hearing, neither the law 24    enforcement officer nor counsel for the officer appears, 25    the Board may proceed with the hearing for default in 26    their absence.   HB1036- 26 -LRB104 03251 RTM 13273 b1        (3) If the law enforcement officer fails to comply 2    with paragraph (2), all of the allegations contained in 3    the complaint shall be deemed admitted and the law 4    enforcement officer shall be decertified if, by a majority 5    vote of the panel, the conduct charged in the complaint is 6    found to constitute sufficient grounds for decertification 7    under this Act.

If the law 18    enforcement officer requests to have the hearing 19    suspended, the law enforcement officer's certification 20    shall be deemed inactive until the law enforcement 21    officer's Formal Complaint hearing concludes. The Board or 22    the law enforcement officer may request to have the 23    hearing suspended for up to 6 additional months for good 24    cause. This request may be renewed. For purposes of this 25    paragraph (4), "good cause" means an incident or 26    occurrence that is beyond the control of the requester and   HB1036- 27 -LRB104 03251 RTM 13273 b1    that prevents the hearing from occurring, or holding the 2    hearing would impose an undue hardship or prejudice on the 3    requester. 4        (5) Surrender of certification or waiver.

After the conclusion 24    of the hearing, the administrative law judge shall report 25    any findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended 26    disposition to the Panel. If the law enforcement officer   HB1036- 29 -LRB104 03251 RTM 13273 b1    objects to any procedural or substantive legal portion of 2    the report, the officer may do so by written brief filed 3    with the Panel within 14 days after receipt of the report. 4    The Panel may grant reasonable extensions for good cause 5    shown or when mutually agreed upon by the parties. 6        No later than 28 days before the hearing, a party 7    shall disclose the following:8            (i) The name and, if known, the address and 9        telephone number of each individual likely to have 10        information relevant to the hearing that the 11        disclosing party may use to support its claims or 12        defenses.

Upon receipt of the 20    administrative law judge's findings of fact, conclusions 21    of law, and recommended disposition, and any submitted 22    objections from the law enforcement officer, the Panel 23    shall call for a certification review meeting.24        In such a meeting, the Panel may adjourn into a closed 25    conference for the purposes of deliberating on the 26    evidence presented during the hearing.

No new 6    or additional evidence may be presented to the Panel. 7    After concluding its deliberations, the Panel shall 8    convene in open session for its consideration of the 9    matter. If a simple majority of the Panel finds that no 10    allegations in the complaint supporting one or more 11    charges of misconduct are proven by clear and convincing 12    evidence, then the Panel shall recommend to the Board that 13    the complaint be dismissed. If a simple majority of the 14    Panel finds that the allegations in the complaint 15    supporting one or more charges of misconduct are proven by 16    clear and convincing evidence, then the Panel shall 17    recommend to the Board to decertify the officer. The Panel 18    shall prepare a summary report as soon as practicable 19    after the completion of the meeting including the 20    following: the hearing officer's findings of fact, 21    conclusions of law, recommended disposition, and the 22    Panel's order.23        (9) Final action by the Board. After receiving the 24    Panel's recommendations and any objections by the law 25    enforcement officer, and after due consideration of the 26    Panel's recommendations, the Board, by majority vote,   HB1036- 31 -LRB104 03251 RTM 13273 b1    shall issue a final decision to decertify the law 2    enforcement officer or take no action in regard to the law 3    enforcement officer.
