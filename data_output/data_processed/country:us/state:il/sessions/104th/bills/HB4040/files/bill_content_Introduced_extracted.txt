Effective immediately.LRB104 13097 RLC 25120 b  A BILL FOR HB4040LRB104 13097 RLC 25120 b1    AN ACT concerning criminal law. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Emerging Adult Sentencing Act. 6    Section 5. Purpose. The purpose of this Act is to create a 7transformative post-conviction model that reduces reliance on 8traditional incarceration for emerging adults by fostering 9partnerships between adult probation departments and 10nonprofit, community-based residential workforce development 11centers to implement restorative justice practices, workforce 12training, and mental health support. This Act recognizes that 13young adults aged 18 through 25 are more likely to be justice 14involved due to poverty, instability, trauma, and a lack of 15social and emotional services and support. Young adults who 16receive holistic, developmentally appropriate supports and 17services in a community setting continue educational pursuits, 18successfully enter the workforce, and are less likely to 19reoffend, thus increasing the welfare of the young adult and 20the community, rather than those who are incarcerated. This 21Act recognizes that the qualities that distinguish juveniles 22from adults do not disappear when an individual turns 18. They 23remain vulnerable to negative influences and outside peer   HB4040- 2 -LRB104 13097 RLC 25120 b1pressures, including from their families and peers, and they 2have limited control over their own environment. Because the 3characters of emerging adults are still being formed, their 4traits are less fixed and their actions are less likely to be 5evidence of a lack of rehabilitative potential. Accordingly, 6emerging adults are worthy of special care, investment, and 7consideration so as to prevent long-term involvement in the 8criminal justice system and the psychological damage caused by 9carceral settings. This policy is grounded in balanced 10restorative justice values and practices, that seek to improve 11community safety by considering the welfare of the emerging 12adult with a focus on connecting emerging adults to supports 13that address underlying root causes of behavior instead of 14punitive measures. 15    Section 10.
