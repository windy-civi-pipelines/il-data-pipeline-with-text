Payment to the beneficiary making the election 24under this subsection discharges the bank's obligation to pay 25a beneficiary and does not constitute an accord and   HB0029- 9 -LRB104 03181 SPS 13202 b1satisfaction with respect to another person obligated to the 2beneficiary.3    (d) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the 4obligation of the bank obligated to pay a beneficiary is 5immediately due and payable.6    (e) The bank may discharge its obligation under this 7Section by:8        (1) crediting another transaction account of the 9    beneficiary; or10        (2) taking other action that:11            (i) is permitted under the account agreement for 12    the bank to obtain a discharge; or13            (ii) otherwise would constitute a discharge under 14        law.15    (f) If the bank obligated to pay a beneficiary has 16incurred an obligation to discharge the obligation of another 17person, the obligation of the other person is discharged if 18action by the bank under subsection (e) would constitute a 19discharge of the obligation of the other person under law that 20determines whether an obligation is satisfied. 21    Section 8. Property interest of depositor or beneficiary.22    (a) Neither a depositor nor a beneficiary has a property 23interest in a special deposit.24    (b) Any property interest with respect to a special 25deposit is only in the right to receive payment if the bank is   HB0029- 10 -LRB104 03181 SPS 13202 b1obligated to pay a beneficiary and not in the special deposit 2itself. Any property interest under this subsection is 3determined under other law. 4    Section 9.

Duties and liability of bank.4    (a) A bank does not have a fiduciary duty to any person 5with respect to a special deposit.6    (b) When the bank holding a special deposit becomes 7obligated to pay a beneficiary, a debtor-creditor relationship 8arises between the bank and beneficiary.9    (c) The bank holding a special deposit has a duty to a 10beneficiary to comply with the account agreement and this Act.11    (d) If the bank holding a special deposit does not comply 12with the account agreement or this Act, the bank is liable to a 13depositor or beneficiary only for damages proximately caused 14by the noncompliance. Except as provided by other law of this 15State, the bank is not liable for consequential, special, or 16punitive damages.17    (e) The bank holding a special deposit may rely on records 18presented in compliance with the account agreement to 19determine whether the bank is obligated to pay a beneficiary.20    (f) If the account agreement requires payment on 21presentation of a record, the bank shall determine within a 22reasonable time whether the record is sufficient to require 23payment. If the agreement requires action by the bank on 24presentation of a record, the bank is not liable for relying in 25good faith on the genuineness of the record if the record   HB0029- 13 -LRB104 03181 SPS 13202 b1appears on its face to be genuine.2    (g) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the 3bank is not required to determine whether a permissible 4purpose stated in the agreement continues to exist. 5    Section 13. Term and termination.6    (a) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, a 7special deposit terminates five years after the date the 8special deposit was first funded.9    (b) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, if 10the bank cannot identify or locate a beneficiary entitled to 11payment when the special deposit is terminated, and a balance 12remains in the special deposit, the bank shall pay the balance 13to the depositor or depositors as a beneficiary or 14beneficiaries.15    (c) A bank that pays the remaining balance as provided 16under subsection (b) has no further obligation with respect to 17the special deposit. 18    Section 14.

Permissible purpose.21    (a) A special deposit must serve at least one permissible 22purpose stated in the account agreement from the time the 23special deposit is created in the account agreement until 24termination of the special deposit.  HB0029- 8 -LRB104 03181 SPS 13202 b1    (b) If, before termination of the special deposit, the 2bank or a court determines the special deposit no longer 3satisfies subsection (a), Sections 8 through 11 cease to apply 4to any funds deposited in the special deposit after the 5special deposit ceases to satisfy subsection (a).6    (c) If, before termination of a special deposit, the bank 7determines the special deposit no longer satisfies subsection 8(a), the bank may take action it believes is necessary under 9the circumstances, including terminating the special deposit. 10    Section 7. Payment to beneficiary by bank.11    (a) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the 12bank is obligated to pay a beneficiary if there are sufficient 13actually and finally collected funds in the balance of the 14special deposit.15    (b) Except as provided in subsection (c), the obligation 16to pay the beneficiary is excused if the funds available in the 17special deposit are insufficient to cover such payment.18    (c) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, if 19the funds available in the special deposit are insufficient to 20cover an obligation to pay a beneficiary, a beneficiary may 21elect to be paid the funds that are available or, if there is 22more than one beneficiary, a pro rata share of the funds 23available. Payment to the beneficiary making the election 24under this subsection discharges the bank's obligation to pay 25a beneficiary and does not constitute an accord and   HB0029- 9 -LRB104 03181 SPS 13202 b1satisfaction with respect to another person obligated to the 2beneficiary.3    (d) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the 4obligation of the bank obligated to pay a beneficiary is 5immediately due and payable.6    (e) The bank may discharge its obligation under this 7Section by:8        (1) crediting another transaction account of the 9    beneficiary; or10        (2) taking other action that:11            (i) is permitted under the account agreement for 12    the bank to obtain a discharge; or13            (ii) otherwise would constitute a discharge under 14        law.15    (f) If the bank obligated to pay a beneficiary has 16incurred an obligation to discharge the obligation of another 17person, the obligation of the other person is discharged if 18action by the bank under subsection (e) would constitute a 19discharge of the obligation of the other person under law that 20determines whether an obligation is satisfied. 21    Section 8. Property interest of depositor or beneficiary.22    (a) Neither a depositor nor a beneficiary has a property 23interest in a special deposit.24    (b) Any property interest with respect to a special 25deposit is only in the right to receive payment if the bank is   HB0029- 10 -LRB104 03181 SPS 13202 b1obligated to pay a beneficiary and not in the special deposit 2itself. Any property interest under this subsection is 3determined under other law. 4    Section 9. When creditor process enforceable against bank.5    (a) Subject to subsection (b), creditor process with 6respect to a special deposit is not enforceable against the 7bank holding the special deposit.8    (b) Creditor process is enforceable against the bank 9holding a special deposit with respect to an amount the bank is 10obligated to pay a beneficiary or a depositor if the process:11        (1) is served on the bank;12        (2) provides sufficient information to permit the bank 13    to identify the depositor or the beneficiary from the 14    bank's books and records; and 15        (3) gives the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on 16    the process.17    (c) Creditor process served on a bank before it is 18enforceable against the bank under subsection (b) does not 19create a right of the creditor against the bank or a duty of 20the bank to the creditor. Other law determines whether 21creditor process creates a lien enforceable against the 22beneficiary on a contingent interest of a beneficiary, 23including a depositor as a beneficiary, even if not 24enforceable against the bank.   HB0029- 11 -LRB104 03181 SPS 13202 b1    Section 10.

Recoupment or set off.7    (a) Except as provided in subsection (b) or (c), a bank may 8not exercise a right of recoupment or set off against a special 9deposit.10    (b) An account agreement may authorize the bank to debit 11the special deposit:12        (1) when the bank becomes obligated to pay a 13    beneficiary, in an amount that does not exceed the amount 14    necessary to discharge the obligation;15        (2) for a fee assessed by the bank that relates to an 16    overdraft in the special deposit account;17        (3) for costs incurred by the bank that relate 18    directly to the special deposit; or19        (4) to reverse an earlier credit posted by the bank to 20    the balance of the special deposit account, if the 21    reversal occurs under an event or circumstance warranted 22    under other law of this State governing mistake and 23    restitution.24    (c) The bank holding a special deposit may exercise a 25right of recoupment or set off against an obligation to pay a   HB0029- 12 -LRB104 03181 SPS 13202 b1beneficiary, even if the bank funds payment from the special 2deposit. 3    Section 12. Duties and liability of bank.4    (a) A bank does not have a fiduciary duty to any person 5with respect to a special deposit.6    (b) When the bank holding a special deposit becomes 7obligated to pay a beneficiary, a debtor-creditor relationship 8arises between the bank and beneficiary.9    (c) The bank holding a special deposit has a duty to a 10beneficiary to comply with the account agreement and this Act.11    (d) If the bank holding a special deposit does not comply 12with the account agreement or this Act, the bank is liable to a 13depositor or beneficiary only for damages proximately caused 14by the noncompliance.

If the agreement requires action by the bank on 24presentation of a record, the bank is not liable for relying in 25good faith on the genuineness of the record if the record   HB0029- 13 -LRB104 03181 SPS 13202 b1appears on its face to be genuine.2    (g) Unless the account agreement provides otherwise, the 3bank is not required to determine whether a permissible 4purpose stated in the agreement continues to exist. 5    Section 13. Term and termination.6    (a) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, a 7special deposit terminates five years after the date the 8special deposit was first funded.9    (b) Unless otherwise provided in the account agreement, if 10the bank cannot identify or locate a beneficiary entitled to 11payment when the special deposit is terminated, and a balance 12remains in the special deposit, the bank shall pay the balance 13to the depositor or depositors as a beneficiary or 14beneficiaries.15    (c) A bank that pays the remaining balance as provided 16under subsection (b) has no further obligation with respect to 17the special deposit. 18    Section 14.
