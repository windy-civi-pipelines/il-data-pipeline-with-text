Unlicensed practice; injunctions. The practice of 11dentistry by any person not holding a valid and current 12license under this Act is declared to be inimical to the public 13welfare, to constitute a public nuisance, and to cause 14irreparable harm to the public welfare.15    A person is considered to practice dentistry who: 16        (1) employs a dentist, dental hygienist, dental 17    therapist, or other entity which can provide dental 18    services under this Act; 19        (2) directs or controls the use of any dental 20    equipment or material while such equipment or material is 21    being used for the provision of dental services, provided 22    that this provision shall not be construed to prohibit a 23    person from obtaining professional advice or assistance in 24    obtaining or from leasing the equipment or material, 25    provided the advice, assistance, or lease does not   HB3418- 65 -LRB104 08090 AAS 18136 b1    restrict or interfere with the custody, control, or use of 2    the equipment or material by the person; 3        (3) directs, controls or interferes with a dentist's, 4    or dental hygienist's , or dental therapist's clinical 5    judgment; or 6        (4) exercises direction or control, by written 7    contract, license, or otherwise, over a dentist, dental 8    hygienist, dental therapist, or other entity which can 9    provide dental services under this Act in the selection of 10    a course of treatment; limitation of patient referrals; 11    content of patient records; policies and decisions 12    relating to refunds (if the refund payment would be 13    reportable under federal law to the National Practitioner 14    Data Bank) and warranties and the clinical content of 15    advertising; and final decisions relating to employment of 16    dental assistants, dental therapists, and dental 17    hygienists. Nothing in this Act shall, however, be 18    construed as prohibiting the seeking or giving of advice 19    or assistance with respect to these matters.20    The purpose of this Section is to prevent a non-dentist 21from influencing or otherwise interfering with the exercise of 22independent professional judgment by a dentist, dental 23hygienist, dental therapist, or other entity which can provide 24dental services under this Act. Nothing in this Section shall 25be construed to prohibit insurers and managed care plans from 26operating pursuant to the applicable provisions of the   HB3418- 66 -LRB104 08090 AAS 18136 b1Illinois Insurance Code under which the entities are licensed.2    The Secretary, the Attorney General, the State's attorney 3of any county in the State, or any person may maintain an 4action in the name of the People of the State of Illinois, and 5may apply for injunctive relief in any circuit court to enjoin 6such person from engaging in such practice; and upon the 7filing of a verified petition in such court, the court if 8satisfied by affidavit, or otherwise, that such person has 9been engaged in such practice without a valid and current 10license so to do, may enter a temporary restraining order 11without notice or bond, enjoining the defendant from such 12further practice. Only the showing of non-licensure, by 13affidavit or otherwise, is necessary in order for a temporary 14injunction to issue. A copy of the verified complaint shall be 15served upon the defendant and the proceedings shall thereafter 16be conducted as in other civil cases except as modified by this 17Section. If it is established that the defendant has been, or 18is engaged in such unlawful practice, the court may enter an 19order or judgment perpetually enjoining the defendant from 20further such practice. In all proceedings hereunder the court, 21in its discretion, may apportion the costs among the parties 22interested in the action, including cost of filing the 23complaint, service of process, witness fees and expenses, 24court reporter charges and reasonable attorneys' fees. In case 25of violation of any injunctive order entered under the 26provisions of this Section, the court may summarily try and   HB3418- 67 -LRB104 08090 AAS 18136 b1punish the offender for contempt of court. Such injunction 2proceedings shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, all 3penalties and other remedies provided in this Act.4    This Section does not apply to an executor, administrator, 5guardian, or authorized representative contracting with 6another dentist or dentists to continue the operations of a 7deceased or incapacitated dentist's practice under Section 838.2 of this Act. 9(Source: P.A. 97-1013, eff. 8-17-12.) 10    (225 ILCS 25/38.1)11    (Section scheduled to be repealed on January 1, 2026)12    Sec. 38.1.

Unlicensed practice; injunctions. The practice of 11dentistry by any person not holding a valid and current 12license under this Act is declared to be inimical to the public 13welfare, to constitute a public nuisance, and to cause 14irreparable harm to the public welfare.15    A person is considered to practice dentistry who: 16        (1) employs a dentist, dental hygienist, dental 17    therapist, or other entity which can provide dental 18    services under this Act; 19        (2) directs or controls the use of any dental 20    equipment or material while such equipment or material is 21    being used for the provision of dental services, provided 22    that this provision shall not be construed to prohibit a 23    person from obtaining professional advice or assistance in 24    obtaining or from leasing the equipment or material, 25    provided the advice, assistance, or lease does not   HB3418- 65 -LRB104 08090 AAS 18136 b1    restrict or interfere with the custody, control, or use of 2    the equipment or material by the person; 3        (3) directs, controls or interferes with a dentist's, 4    or dental hygienist's , or dental therapist's clinical 5    judgment; or 6        (4) exercises direction or control, by written 7    contract, license, or otherwise, over a dentist, dental 8    hygienist, dental therapist, or other entity which can 9    provide dental services under this Act in the selection of 10    a course of treatment; limitation of patient referrals; 11    content of patient records; policies and decisions 12    relating to refunds (if the refund payment would be 13    reportable under federal law to the National Practitioner 14    Data Bank) and warranties and the clinical content of 15    advertising; and final decisions relating to employment of 16    dental assistants, dental therapists, and dental 17    hygienists. Nothing in this Act shall, however, be 18    construed as prohibiting the seeking or giving of advice 19    or assistance with respect to these matters.20    The purpose of this Section is to prevent a non-dentist 21from influencing or otherwise interfering with the exercise of 22independent professional judgment by a dentist, dental 23hygienist, dental therapist, or other entity which can provide 24dental services under this Act. Nothing in this Section shall 25be construed to prohibit insurers and managed care plans from 26operating pursuant to the applicable provisions of the   HB3418- 66 -LRB104 08090 AAS 18136 b1Illinois Insurance Code under which the entities are licensed.2    The Secretary, the Attorney General, the State's attorney 3of any county in the State, or any person may maintain an 4action in the name of the People of the State of Illinois, and 5may apply for injunctive relief in any circuit court to enjoin 6such person from engaging in such practice; and upon the 7filing of a verified petition in such court, the court if 8satisfied by affidavit, or otherwise, that such person has 9been engaged in such practice without a valid and current 10license so to do, may enter a temporary restraining order 11without notice or bond, enjoining the defendant from such 12further practice. Only the showing of non-licensure, by 13affidavit or otherwise, is necessary in order for a temporary 14injunction to issue. A copy of the verified complaint shall be 15served upon the defendant and the proceedings shall thereafter 16be conducted as in other civil cases except as modified by this 17Section. If it is established that the defendant has been, or 18is engaged in such unlawful practice, the court may enter an 19order or judgment perpetually enjoining the defendant from 20further such practice. In all proceedings hereunder the court, 21in its discretion, may apportion the costs among the parties 22interested in the action, including cost of filing the 23complaint, service of process, witness fees and expenses, 24court reporter charges and reasonable attorneys' fees.
