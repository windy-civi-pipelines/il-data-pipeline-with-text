Within 30 calendar days after the provider or 14facility transmits the bill to the health insurance issuer, 15the issuer shall send an initial payment or notice of denial of 16payment with the written explanation of benefits to the 17provider or facility. If attempts to negotiate reimbursement 18for services provided by a nonparticipating provider do not 19result in a resolution of the payment dispute within 30 days 20after receipt of written explanation of benefits by the health 21insurance issuer, then the health insurance issuer or 22nonparticipating provider or the facility may initiate binding 23arbitration to determine payment for services provided on a 24per-bill or batched-bill basis, in accordance with Section 25300gg-111 of the Public Health Service Act and the regulations 26promulgated thereunder.

From the list of 5 arbitrators, the 16health insurance issuer can veto 2 arbitrators and the 17provider or facility can veto 2 arbitrators. The remaining 18arbitrator shall be the chosen arbitrator. This arbitration 19shall consist of a review of the written submissions by both 20parties. The arbitrator shall not establish a rebuttable 21presumption that the qualifying payment amount should be the 22total amount owed to the provider or facility by the 23combination of the issuer and the insured, beneficiary, or 24enrollee. Binding arbitration shall provide for a written 25decision within 45 days after the request is filed with the 26Department of Insurance.
