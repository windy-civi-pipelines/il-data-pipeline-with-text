Any 14    cost-sharing requirements shall be applied as though the 15    services provided by the nonparticipating ground ambulance 16    service provider had been provided by a participating 17    ground ambulance service provider.18        (3) Health insurance issuers shall approve charges for 19    nonparticipating ground ambulance service providers at a 20    recognized amount that shall be calculated as the lesser 21    of: (i) the nonparticipating ground ambulance service 22    provider's billed charge; (ii) the negotiated rate between 23    the nonparticipating ground ambulance service provider and 24    the health insurance insurer; or (iii) the rate the ground 25    ambulance service provider has filed for the date of 26    service in question with the Department of Insurance as   10400SB2405sam002- 21 -LRB104 10637 BAB 25960 a1    specified in (b-15).2        (4) Payment for ground ambulance services shall be 3    made on a per occurrence basis and shall be paid directly 4    to the nonparticipating ground ambulance service provider.5        (5) Except as otherwise provided by State or federal 6    law, the cost-sharing amount for any occurrence of a 7    ground ambulance service provided to a beneficiary, 8    insured, or enrollee shall not exceed the lesser of the 9    plan's emergency room visit copay or 10% of the recognized 10    amount for the occurrence.11        (6) If a health insurance issuer has calculated the 12    allowable amount for services provided by a ground 13    ambulance service provider in compliance with this 14    subsection, by accepting payment from the health insurance 15    issuer, the nonparticipating ground ambulance service 16    provider shall not seek any payment from the beneficiary, 17    insured, or enrollee for any amount which exceeds the 18    deductible, coinsurance, or copay for services provided to 19    the beneficiary, insured, or enrollee.20    (b-15) Rates for services provided by nonparticipating 21ground ambulance service providers. By no later than October 221, 2025, each ground ambulance service provider in Illinois 23shall file with the Department of Insurance, in the form and 24manner prescribed by the Department of Insurance, its rates 25for the provision of ground ambulance services provided on 26January 1, 2025 and its rates for ground ambulance services to   10400SB2405sam002- 22 -LRB104 10637 BAB 25960 a1be provided during the calendar year beginning January 1, 22026. For calendar year 2026, the proposed rates may not 3exceed the rates in place on January 1, 2025 by more than the 4annual unadjusted percentage increase in the consumer price 5index-u for the 12 months ending with the immediately 6preceding June plus 10%. As used in this subsection (b-15), 7"consumer price index-u" means the index published by the 8Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of 9Labor that measures the average change in prices of goods and 10services purchased by all urban consumers, United States city 11average, all items, 1982-84 = 100. The filing required under 12this subsection (b-15) shall include rates for each of the 13following ground ambulance services, as applicable:14        (1) basic life support, emergency base;15        (2) basic life support, non-emergency base;16        (3) advanced life support, non-emergency, level 1 17    base;18        (4) advanced life support, emergency, level 1 base;19        (5) advanced life support, level 2 base;20        (6) specialty care transport base;21        (7) evaluation without transport;22        (8) treatment without transport;23        (9) paramedic intercept; and24        (10) ground mileage, per loaded mile.25    If a ground ambulance service provider does not have a 26rate in place for the provision of ground ambulance service   10400SB2405sam002- 23 -LRB104 10637 BAB 25960 a1provided on January 1, 2025, for evaluation without transport, 2treatment without transport, or paramedic intercept, the 3ground ambulance service provider may stipulate a rate as 4follows: (i) for evaluation without transport, 25% of the 5ground ambulance service provider's basic life support, 6emergency base; (ii) for treatment without transport, 50% of 7the ground ambulance service provider's advanced life support, 8emergency, level 1 base; (iii) for paramedic intercept, 75% of 9the ground ambulance service provider's advanced life support, 10level 1 base. If a ground ambulance service provider does not 11have a rate in place for any other base rate or for ground 12mileage, per loaded mile, the ground ambulance service 13provider may request that the Department of Insurance 14calculate such a rate. Upon receiving a request from a ground 15ambulance service provider to calculate a rate, the Department 16of Insurance shall calculate a rate using the unweighted 17average of the applicable rates provided by all of the ground 18ambulance service providers within the Medicare locality of 19the ground ambulance service provider's registered office. If 20a ground ambulance service provider begins providing ground 21ambulance services after January 1, 2025, the Department of 22Insurance shall calculate applicable rates for the ground 23ambulance service provider, when requested by a ground 24ambulance service provider, using the same methodology as for 25calculating any other rate for a ground ambulance service 26provider described in this subsection. Where a ground   10400SB2405sam002- 24 -LRB104 10637 BAB 25960 a1ambulance service provider participates in the Ground 2Emergency Transportation (GEMT) program administered by the 3Department of Healthcare and Family Services, it may 4substitute its basic life support, emergency base and advanced 5life support, level 1 base, as calculated by the Department of 6Healthcare and Family Services, for the calendar year in which 7the rates were calculated, for its respective reported rate, 8for January 1, 2026 or any subsequent year without regard to 9any provision of this subsection that restricts the percentage 10by which rates may increase on a year-over-year basis.11    By October 1, 2026, and by October 1 of each year 12thereafter, each ground ambulance service provider in Illinois 13shall file with the Department of Insurance, in the form and 14manner prescribed by the Department of Insurance, its rates 15for the provision of ground ambulance services for the 16following calendar year. For calendar year 2027 and each year 17thereafter, the proposed rates may not exceed the rates in 18place on January 1 of the immediately preceding year by more 19than the annual unadjusted percentage increase in the consumer 20price index-u for the 12 months ending with the immediately 21preceding June plus 10%. As used in this subsection (b-15), 22"consumer price index-u" means the index published by the 23Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of 24Labor that measures the average change in prices of goods and 25services purchased by all urban consumers, United States city 26average, all items, 1982-84 = 100.   10400SB2405sam002- 25 -LRB104 10637 BAB 25960 a1    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, 2except when the notice and consent criteria are satisfied for 3the situation in paragraph (2) of subsection (b-5), any 4benefits a beneficiary, insured, or enrollee receives for 5services under the situations in subsection (b), or (b-5), 6(b-10), or (b-15) are assigned to the nonparticipating 7providers, nonparticipating ground ambulance service provider, 8or the facility acting on their behalf. Upon receipt of the 9provider's bill or facility's bill, the health insurance 10issuer shall provide the nonparticipating provider, 11nonparticipating ground ambulance service provider, or the 12facility with a written explanation of benefits that specifies 13the proposed reimbursement and the applicable deductible, 14copayment, or coinsurance amounts owed by the insured, 15beneficiary, or enrollee. The health insurance issuer shall 16pay any reimbursement subject to this Section directly to the 17nonparticipating provider, nonparticipating ground ambulance 18service provider, or the facility.19    (d) For bills assigned under subsection (c), the 20nonparticipating provider or the facility may bill the health 21insurance issuer for the services rendered, and the health 22insurance issuer may pay the billed amount or attempt to 23negotiate reimbursement with the nonparticipating provider or 24the facility. Within 30 calendar days after the provider or 25facility transmits the bill to the health insurance issuer, 26the issuer shall send an initial payment or notice of denial of   10400SB2405sam002- 26 -LRB104 10637 BAB 25960 a1payment with the written explanation of benefits to the 2provider or facility. If attempts to negotiate reimbursement 3for services provided by a nonparticipating provider do not 4result in a resolution of the payment dispute within 30 days 5after receipt of written explanation of benefits by the health 6insurance issuer, then the health insurance issuer or 7nonparticipating provider or the facility may initiate binding 8arbitration to determine payment for services provided on a 9per-bill or batched-bill basis, in accordance with Section 10300gg-111 of the Public Health Service Act and the regulations 11promulgated thereunder. The party requesting arbitration shall 12notify the other party arbitration has been initiated and 13state its final offer before arbitration. In response to this 14notice, the nonrequesting party shall inform the requesting 15party of its final offer before the arbitration occurs. 16Arbitration shall be initiated by filing a request with the 17Department of Insurance.18    (e) The Department of Insurance shall publish a list of 19approved arbitrators or entities that shall provide binding 20arbitration. These arbitrators shall be American Arbitration 21Association or American Health Lawyers Association trained 22arbitrators. Both parties must agree on an arbitrator from the 23Department of Insurance's or its approved entity's list of 24arbitrators. If no agreement can be reached, then a list of 5 25arbitrators shall be provided by the Department of Insurance 26or the approved entity. From the list of 5 arbitrators, the   10400SB2405sam002- 27 -LRB104 10637 BAB 25960 a1health insurance issuer can veto 2 arbitrators and the 2provider or facility can veto 2 arbitrators. The remaining 3arbitrator shall be the chosen arbitrator. This arbitration 4shall consist of a review of the written submissions by both 5parties. The arbitrator shall not establish a rebuttable 6presumption that the qualifying payment amount should be the 7total amount owed to the provider or facility by the 8combination of the issuer and the insured, beneficiary, or 9enrollee. Binding arbitration shall provide for a written 10decision within 45 days after the request is filed with the 11Department of Insurance. Both parties shall be bound by the 12arbitrator's decision. The arbitrator's expenses and fees, 13together with other expenses, not including attorney's fees, 14incurred in the conduct of the arbitration, shall be paid as 15provided in the decision.16    (f) (Blank).17    (g) Section 368a of this Act shall not apply during the 18pendency of a decision under subsection (d). Upon the issuance 19of the arbitrator's decision, Section 368a applies with 20respect to the amount, if any, by which the arbitrator's 21determination exceeds the issuer's initial payment under 22subsection (c), or the entire amount of the arbitrator's 23determination if initial payment was denied. Any interest 24required to be paid to a provider under Section 368a shall not 25accrue until after 30 days of an arbitrator's decision as 26provided in subsection (d), but in no circumstances longer   10400SB2405sam002- 28 -LRB104 10637 BAB 25960 a1than 150 days from the date the nonparticipating 2facility-based provider billed for services rendered.3    (h) Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to change 4the prudent layperson provisions with respect to emergency 5services under the Managed Care Reform and Patient Rights Act. 6    (i) Nothing in this Section shall preclude a health care 7provider from billing a beneficiary, insured, or enrollee for 8reasonable administrative fees, such as service fees for 9checks returned for nonsufficient funds and missed 10appointments.11    (j) Nothing in this Section shall preclude a beneficiary, 12insured, or enrollee from assigning benefits to a 13nonparticipating provider when the notice and consent criteria 14are satisfied under paragraph (2) of subsection (b-5) or in 15any other situation not described in subsection (b) or (b-5).16    (k) Except when the notice and consent criteria are 17satisfied under paragraph (2) of subsection (b-5), if an 18individual receives health care services under the situations 19described in subsection (b) or (b-5), no referral requirement 20or any other provision contained in the policy or certificate 21of coverage shall deny coverage, reduce benefits, or otherwise 22defeat the requirements of this Section for services that 23would have been covered with a participating provider. 24However, this subsection shall not be construed to preclude a 25provider contract with a health insurance issuer, or with an 26administrator or similar entity acting on the issuer's behalf,   10400SB2405sam002- 29 -LRB104 10637 BAB 25960 a1from imposing requirements on the participating provider, 2participating emergency facility, or participating health care 3facility relating to the referral of covered individuals to 4nonparticipating providers.5    (l) Except if the notice and consent criteria are 6satisfied under paragraph (2) of subsection (b-5), 7cost-sharing amounts calculated in conformity with this 8Section shall count toward any deductible or out-of-pocket 9maximum applicable to in-network coverage.10    (m) The Department has the authority to enforce the 11requirements of this Section in the situations described in 12subsections (b) and (b-5), and in any other situation for 13which 42 U.S.C. Chapter 6A, Subchapter XXV, Parts D or E and 14regulations promulgated thereunder would prohibit an 15individual from being billed or liable for emergency services 16furnished by a nonparticipating provider or nonparticipating 17emergency facility or for non-emergency health care services 18furnished by a nonparticipating provider at a participating 19health care facility.20    (n) This Section does not apply with respect to air 21ambulance or ground ambulance services. This Section does not 22apply to any policy of excepted benefits or to short-term, 23limited-duration health insurance coverage. 24    (o) A home rule unit may not regulate payments for ground 25ambulance service in a manner inconsistent with this Section. 26This subsection is a limitation under subsection (i) of   10400SB2405sam002- 30 -LRB104 10637 BAB 25960 a1Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 2concurrent exercise by home rule units of powers and functions 3exercised by the State. 4(Source: P.A. 102-901, eff. 7-1-22; 102-1117, eff. 1-13-23; 5103-440, eff. 1-1-24.) 6    (215 ILCS 5/356z.80 new)7    Sec. 356z.80.
