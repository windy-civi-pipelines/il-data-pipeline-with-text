References to Act. This Act may be referred to 5as the Transportation Choices Act. 6    Section 5. The Department of Transportation Law of the 7Civil Administrative Code of Illinois is amended by adding 8Section 2705-204 as follows: 9    (20 ILCS 2705/2705-204 new)10    Sec. 2705-204. Transportation planning and greenhouse gas 11reduction. 12    (a) The General Assembly finds that:13        (1) Article XI of the Illinois Constitution provides 14    that the public policy of the State and the duty of each 15    person is to provide and maintain a healthful environment 16    for the benefit of this and future generations. 17        (2) The transportation sector is now the largest 18    source of greenhouse gas emissions in the State. 19        (3) The State has previously set a goal to have an 20    electric power sector that is free of greenhouse gas 21    emissions by 2045. 22        (4) Greenhouse gas pollution resulting from the   SB1680- 2 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    production, distribution, and use of motor vehicle fuels 2    produces many social costs, including, but not limited to, 3    adverse public health impacts, increased heat waves, 4    droughts, water supply shortages, flooding, biodiversity 5    loss, and forest health issues, such as forest fires. 6        (5) The Illinois State Climatologist is projecting 7    that, by the end of the 21st Century, average daily 8    temperatures in the State will increase between 4 and 9 9    degrees Fahrenheit under a lower emissions scenario and 10    between 8 and 14 degrees Fahrenheit under a higher 11    emissions scenario. 12        (6) Climate change of such speed and magnitude will 13    result in heat stress on animals, plants, and workers; 14    reduced crop yields from short-term and rapid-onset 15    drought; increased pestilence; and other challenges that 16    will adversely affect the State's agriculture sector.17        (7) Increases in flooding, heat, and other factors 18    associated with climate change will stress the State's 19    transportation infrastructure, such as bridges and 20    roadways in low-lying areas, and will require more 21    resources to maintain roadways and other transportation 22    infrastructure. 23        (8) State investment in a clean transportation economy 24    in the State can expand equitable access to public health, 25    safety, a cleaner environment, quality jobs, and economic 26    opportunity.   SB1680- 3 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        (9) It is the public policy of the State to ensure that 2    State residents from communities disproportionately 3    impacted by climate change, communities facing automotive 4    plant closures, economically disadvantaged communities, 5    and individuals experiencing barriers to employment have 6    access to State programs and good jobs and career 7    opportunities in growing sectors of the State economy. 8        (10) To minimize any adverse environmental and health 9    impacts of planned transportation projects and to address 10    inequitable distribution of the burdens of those projects, 11    it is necessary, appropriate, and in the best interests of 12    the State and its citizens to require the Department and 13    MPOs, which are the State's primary transportation 14    planning entities with responsibility for selecting and 15    funding transportation projects, to engage in an enhanced 16    level of planning, modeling, and other analysis, community 17    engagement, and monitoring with respect to those projects 18    as required by this Section. 19        (11) Subsection (a) of Section 15 of the Regional 20    Planning Act provides that the Chicago Metropolitan Agency 21    for Planning, whose Policy Committee is the MPO for 22    Northeastern Illinois, shall be responsible for developing 23    and adopting a funding and implementation strategy for an 24    integrated land use and transportation planning process. 25        (12) Section 48 of the Regional Planning Act provides 26    that the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning shall   SB1680- 4 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    establish an incentive program to enable local governments 2    and developers to create more affordable workforce housing 3    options near jobs and transit, create jobs near existing 4    affordable workforce housing, create transit-oriented 5    development, integrate transportation and land use 6    planning, provide a range of viable transportation choices 7    in addition to the car, encourage compact and mixed-use 8    development, and support neighborhood revitalization. 9        (13) Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section 5303 10    of Title 49 of the United States Code (49 U.S.C. 11    5303(a)(1)) provides, in relevant part, that it is in the 12    national interest to better connect housing and 13    employment, while minimizing transportation-related fuel 14    consumption and air pollution through metropolitan and 15    statewide transportation planning processes. 16        (14) Subparagraph (A) of paragraph (4) of subsection 17    (k) of Section 5303 of Title 49 of the United States Code 18    (49 U.S.C. 5303(k)(4)(A)) provides that MPOs serving 19    transportation management areas may address the 20    integration of housing, transportation, and economic 21    development strategies through a process that provides for 22    effective integration, based on a cooperatively developed 23    and implemented strategy, of new and existing 24    transportation facilities eligible for funding. 25        (15) Subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4) of subsection 26    (k) of Section 5303 of Title 49 of the United States Code   SB1680- 5 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    (49 U.S.C. 5303(k)(4)(C)) provides that MPOs serving 2    transportation management areas may develop a housing 3    coordination plan that includes projects and strategies 4    that may be considered in the metropolitan transportation 5    plan of the MPO to develop regional goals for the 6    integration of housing, transportation, and economic 7    development strategies. 8        (16) Land use policies and practices that result in 9    shorter distances between where people reside and jobs and 10    other destinations they seek to access and that facilitate 11    multimodal transportation options for the public are one 12    of the most effective tools to reduce greenhouse gas 13    emissions from the transportation sector and provide more 14    affordable transportation options. 15        (17) Transportation is the second-largest expense 16    category for most households and the cost of owning, 17    operating, and maintaining personal vehicles is a 18    significant burden for many households. 19        (18) Reducing vehicle miles traveled per person 20    through more efficient land use and transportation systems 21    will help the State achieve its greenhouse gas reduction 22    goals and reduce the transportation cost burden on State 23    households. 24        (19) To the maximum extent practicable, actions taken 25    to achieve these goals must avoid causing disproportionate 26    adverse impacts to residents of communities that are or   SB1680- 6 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    have been disproportionately exposed to pollution 2    affecting human health and environmental quality. 3    (b) As used in this

8        (4) update its Metropolitan Planning Organization 9    Cooperative Operations Manual, as necessary; 10        (5) review the GHG emissions analysis used by each MPO 11    to determine if the GHG emissions analysis is inclusive of 12    the complete, actual, and planned transportation network 13    in the applicable planning document and uses reasonable 14    GHG emissions forecasting data, assumptions, modeling, and 15    methodology: 16            (A) if the Department rejects the GHG emissions 17        analysis used by an MPO, the Department shall detail 18        the deficiencies and give the MPO an opportunity to 19        take corrective action; 20            (B) until the MPO takes appropriate corrective 21        action, the Department shall not approve the MPO's 22        applicable planning document, include the projects in 23        the MPO's applicable planning document in the 24        Department's STIP, or make a finding or otherwise 25        represent to the federal government or other 26        governmental agencies that the MPO is in compliance   SB1680- 15 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        with its legal obligations; 2            (C) if, after given an opportunity for corrective 3        action, an MPO does not submit an acceptable GHG 4        emissions analysis, the Department may substitute its 5        own GHG emissions analysis for planning and 6        programming purposes until the MPO produces an 7        acceptable GHG emissions analysis; and 8            (D) the Department shall establish an appropriate 9        process, including deadlines for timely completion of 10        its review of MPO GHG emissions analyses and for 11        corrective action by MPOs where such is necessary; 12        (6) upon request of an MPO, provide the MPO with a GHG 13    emissions analysis that the MPO can use for purposes of 14    this Section in lieu of the MPO conducting its own GHG 15    emissions analysis; and16        (7) adopt rules applicable to itself, MPOs, and 17    recipients of Department funding so the State can achieve 18    the transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions 19    reduction goals and targets set forth in subsections (c) 20    and (p) of Section 9.15 of the Environmental Protection 21    Act and administer the various processes and requirements 22    set forth in this Section. 23    (f) The Department and each MPO must use a GHG emissions 24analysis to determine if their applicable planning document 25will result in the Department or MPO meeting its GHG targets. 26If a GHG emissions analysis determines that the Department or   SB1680- 16 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1MPO is more likely than not to fail to meet one or more of its 2GHG targets, then the Department or MPO shall identify GHG 3mitigation measures that are needed for the Department or MPO 4to meet its GHG targets as follows:5        (1) The Department or MPO shall submit a mitigation 6    action plan that identifies GHG mitigation measures needed 7    to meet the GHG targets and that includes: 8            (A) the anticipated start and completion date of 9        each GHG mitigation measure; 10            (B) an estimate of the annual CO2e emissions 11        reductions achieved per year by the GHG mitigation 12        measure; 13            (C) an estimate of the impact of the GHG 14        mitigation measure on VMT; 15            (D) quantification of the specific co-benefits 16        from each GHG mitigation measure, including reduction 17        of copollutants, such as PM2.5 and NOx, as well as 18        travel impacts, such as changes to VMT, pedestrian or 19        bike use, and transit ridership; 20            (E) a description of any benefits to 21        disproportionately impacted communities from the GHG 22        mitigation measure, including an estimate of the total 23        amount spent on GHG mitigation measures in or designed 24        to serve disproportionately impacted communities; and 25            (F) a status report submitted annually and 26        published on its website for each GHG mitigation   SB1680- 17 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        measure that contains the following information 2        concerning each GHG mitigation measure: 3                (i) availability and timing of funding; 4                (ii) implementation timeline; 5                (iii) current status; 6                (iv) for GHG mitigation measures that are in 7            progress or completed, quantification of the 8            greenhouse gas impact of such GHG mitigation 9            measures and any co-benefits or detriments; and 10                (v) for GHG mitigation measures that are 11            delayed, canceled, or substituted, an explanation 12            of why that decision was made and how these GHG 13            mitigation measures or the equivalent will be 14            achieved. 15        (2) GHG mitigation measures are sufficient if the 16    total GHG emissions reduction from the GHG mitigation 17    measures, after accounting for the GHG emissions otherwise 18    resulting from existing and planned projects in the 19    applicable planning document, results in the Department or 20    MPO meeting its GHG targets. Each comparison of GHG 21    emissions reductions and GHG targets under this subsection 22    must be performed over equal comparison periods. 23        (3) In the annual GHG mitigation measures status 24    report under subparagraph (F) of paragraph (1), the 25    Department or MPO shall certify whether its GHG mitigation 26    measures will be sufficient for the Department or MPO to   SB1680- 18 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    meet its GHG targets. 2    (g) If an applicable planning document does not meet the 3GHG targets for each compliance year even after consideration 4of any GHG mitigation measures, the Department may deem the 5applicable planning document in compliance with this Section 6and approved only if the noncompliant Department or MPO 7allocates funding to advance the achievement of the applicable 8GHG targets as follows: 9        (1) in non-MPO areas, the Department (i) shall not 10    advance a roadway capacity expansion project from its 11    applicable planning document to a STIP or TIP, (ii) shall 12    not otherwise add a roadway capacity expansion project to 13    a STIP or TIP, (iii) shall reprogram funds allocated or 14    anticipated to be expended on roadway capacity expansion 15    projects awaiting inclusion in a STIP or TIP project to 16    GHG mitigation measures that reduce GHG emissions 17    sufficiently to achieve the GHG targets for each 18    compliance year, and (iv) shall amend its applicable 19    planning documents to reflect these changes; 20        (2) in MPO areas that are not in receipt of federal 21    suballocations under the Congestion Mitigation and Air 22    Quality Improvement Program or Surface Transportation 23    Board programs, the Department and MPO (i) shall not 24    advance a roadway capacity expansion project from its 25    applicable planning document to a STIP or TIP, (ii) shall 26    not otherwise add a roadway capacity expansion project to   SB1680- 19 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    a STIP or TIP, (iii) shall reprogram funds allocated or 2    anticipated to be expended on roadway capacity expansion 3    projects awaiting inclusion in a STIP or TIP project to 4    GHG mitigation measures that reduce GHG emissions 5    sufficiently to achieve the GHG targets for each 6    compliance year, and (iv) shall amend its applicable 7    planning documents to reflect these changes; 8        (3) in MPO areas that are in receipt of federal 9    suballocations under the Congestion Mitigation and Air 10    Quality Improve Program or Surface Transportation Board 11    programs, the Department and MPO (i) shall not advance a 12    roadway capacity expansion project from its applicable 13    planning document to a STIP or TIP, (ii) shall not 14    otherwise add a roadway capacity expansion project to a 15    STIP or TIP, (iii) shall reprogram funds allocated or 16    anticipated to be expended on roadway capacity expansion 17    projects awaiting inclusion in a STIP or TIP project to 18    GHG mitigation measures that reduce GHG emissions 19    sufficiently to achieve the GHG targets for each 20    compliance year, and (iv) shall amend its applicable 21    planning documents to reflect these changes; and 22        (4) the Department and MPOs shall administer 23    paragraphs (1) through (3) as a limitation on their 24    authority to advance roadway capacity expansion projects 25    or other projects that will materially increase GHG 26    emissions under paragraph (5) of subsection (k) of Section   SB1680- 20 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    5303 of Title 49 of the United States Code (49 U.S.C. 2    5303(k)(5)). 3    (h) Before including a roadway capacity expansion project 4in an applicable planning document, the Department or MPO must 5perform a GHG emissions analysis of the roadway capacity 6expansion project. Following the GHG emissions analysis, the 7Department or MPO must determine if, after consideration of 8all relevant factors, including VMT and social cost of carbon 9increases in the transportation network resulting from induced 10demand, the project conforms with (i) the applicable GHG 11targets and (ii) VMT targets established under subsection (c). 12        (1) If the Department or MPO determines that the 13    roadway capacity expansion project is not in conformance 14    with items (i) and (ii), the Department or MPO must: 15            (A) alter the scope or design of the roadway 16        capacity expansion project and perform a GHG emissions 17        analysis that shows that the roadway capacity 18        expansion project meets the requirements of items (i) 19        and (ii); 20            (B) incorporate sufficient GHG mitigation measures 21        to bring the Department or MPO into compliance with 22        its GHG targets, however, in order to be effective, 23        such GHG mitigation measures must be implemented no 24        later than contemporaneously with the implementation 25        of the roadway expansion project or, if not 26        implemented contemporaneously, a GHG mitigation   SB1680- 21 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        measure must provide a valid GHG emissions reduction 2        after the date it is implemented; or 3            (C) halt development of the roadway capacity 4        expansion project and remove the roadway capacity 5        expansion project from all applicable planning 6        documents. 7        (2) The Department and MPOs must establish a process 8    for performing roadway capacity expansion project GHG 9    emissions analysis. A GHG emissions analysis for a roadway 10    capacity expansion project must include, but shall not be 11    limited to, estimates resulting from the project for the 12    following: 13            (A) GHG emissions over a period of 20 years or the 14        last GHG target year, whichever is later; 15            (B) a net change in VMT and social cost of carbon 16        for the transportation network after factoring in the 17        effects of induced demand; and 18            (C) consideration of additional VMT in the 19        transportation network from additional capacity 20        resulting from roadway traffic capacity expansion, 21        intelligent transportation systems, or both. 22        (3) The Department or MPO must connect any GHG 23    mitigation measures associated with the roadway capacity 24    expansion project as follows: 25            (A) within or associated with at least one of the 26        communities impacted by the roadway capacity expansion   SB1680- 22 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        project; 2            (B) if there is not a reasonably feasible location 3        under subparagraph (A), in areas of persistent poverty 4        or historically disadvantaged communities, as measured 5        and defined by federal law, guidance and notices of 6        funding opportunity; 7            (C) if there is not a reasonably feasible location 8        under subparagraphs (A) and (B), in the region of the 9        roadway capacity expansion project; and 10            (D) if there is not a reasonably feasible location 11        under subparagraphs (A) through (C), on a statewide 12        basis. 13        (4) The Department or MPO must develop and use a 14    process for community consultation consistent with the 15    requirements of subsection (m) in the development of GHG 16    mitigation measures that the Department or MPO uses to 17    achieve compliance with its GHG targets. 18        (5) The Department or MPO must publish an explanation 19    regarding the feasibility and rationale for each GHG 20    mitigation measure under subparagraphs (B) through (D) of 21    paragraph (3). 22        (6) GHG mitigation measures connected to a roadway 23    expansion project are sufficient if the total greenhouse 24    gas reduction from the GHG mitigation measures is at least 25    equal to the total GHG emissions resulting from the 26    roadway capacity expansion project and consistent with the   SB1680- 23 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    Department or MPO meeting its GHG targets. 2            (A) Each comparison under this paragraph must be 3        performed over equal comparison periods. 4            (B) To avoid double counting, once a GHG 5        mitigation measure is connected to a roadway capacity 6        expansion project, that GHG mitigation measure shall 7        not be used to offset greenhouse gases associated with 8        other roadway capacity expansion projects or other 9        projects included in an applicable planning document. 10        (7) The Department and MPOs must publish information 11    regarding roadway capacity expansion project GHG emissions 12    analyses on their websites. The information must include: 13            (A) an identification of each roadway capacity 14        expansion project; and 15            (B) for each roadway capacity expansion project, a 16        summary that includes an overview of and link to the 17        roadway capacity expansion project GHG emissions 18        analysis, the greenhouse gas impact determination by 19        the Department or MPO, the social cost of carbon added 20        by the roadway capacity expansion project, and project 21        disposition, including a review of any GHG mitigation 22        measures. 23    (i) The Department and MPOs may use a GHG mitigation 24measure as an offset against GHG emissions only after the date 25the GHG mitigation measure has been implemented. 26    (j) By January 1, 2029, and every 3 years thereafter, the   SB1680- 24 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1Department shall prepare a comprehensive, publicly released 2report on statewide transportation greenhouse gas reduction 3accomplishments and challenges and make recommendations for 4any legislative action or State agency rulemaking that would 5assist the Department and MPOs in meeting their GHG targets. 6The report, at a minimum, shall include: 7        (1) a description of whether the Department and MPOs 8    are on track to meet their GHG targets and VMT targets; 9        (2) an assessment of State and local laws, 10    regulations, rules, and practices and recommendations for 11    modifications that would help ensure that the Department 12    and MPOs meet their GHG targets and VMT targets; 13        (3) a description of the benefits from reductions in 14    GHG emissions and copollutants in the transportation 15    sector, diversification of energy sources used for 16    transportation, and substitution of other motorized and 17    nonmotorized modes of travel for VMT currently being 18    handled by vehicles powered by internal combustion 19    engines, and other economic, environmental, and public 20    health benefits; 21        (4) a description of the compliance costs borne by the 22    Department and MPOs in meeting their GHG targets and VMT 23    targets; 24        (5) a description of the social cost of carbon 25    associated with the transportation systems for which the 26    Department and each MPO is responsible and the social cost   SB1680- 25 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    of carbon reductions that result from GHG mitigation 2    measures and other steps being taken by the Department and 3    each MPO to reduce GHG emissions; 4        (6) a description of whether measures taken by the 5    Department and MPOs to meet GHG targets are equitable, 6    minimize costs, and maximize the total benefits to the 7    State and its citizens; and 8        (7) a description of whether activities undertaken to 9    meet GHG targets by the Department and MPOs have unduly 10    burdened disproportionately impacted communities. 11    (k) Before including any project that has an anticipated 12cost of $30,000,000 or more (i) in an applicable planning 13document or (ii) as a GHG mitigation measure, the Department 14or MPO shall calculate a climate equity accessibility score 15for the project. The climate equity accessibility score shall 16be based on a GHG emissions analysis of the project and a 17measurement of (i) the current levels of access to jobs, 18hospitals, schools, and food by available modes of 19transportation and (ii) the current level of affordability of 20transportation in the project area. The Department and MPO 21shall then calculate a climate equity accessibility score 22based on the projected change in GHG emissions, accessibility, 23and affordability from the proposed project. Projects that 24result in relatively high reductions of GHG emissions while 25increasing access to jobs and other destinations and providing 26more affordable transportation options will receive a higher   SB1680- 26 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1climate equity accessibility score than projects that fail to 2deliver such benefits. To advance the goals of this Section 3and optimize the use of public funds, the Department and MPOs 4shall give priority to projects with high climate equity 5accessibility scores, considering which project delivers the 6most climate equity accessibility score benefit per dollar 7invested. The Department, with the assistance of the 8Environmental Protection Agency, shall provide technical 9assistance to MPOs in fulfilling their responsibilities under 10this subsection. 11    (l) To the full extent allowed by paragraph (4) of 12subsection (k) of Section 5303 of Title 49 of the United States 13Code and other applicable laws, and to extend the existing 14authority under State law vested in the Chicago Metropolitan 15Agency for Planning to MPOs throughout the State, MPOs, with 16the full support of the Department, shall conduct housing 17coordination planning to help the Department and MPOs meet 18their GHG targets. 19        (1) MPOs shall develop housing coordination plans 20    consistent with subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4) of 21    subsection (k) of Section 5303 of Title 49 of the United 22    States Code (49 U.S.C. 5303(k)(4)(C)) to better integrate 23    housing, transportation, and economic development 24    strategies and to, among other things: 25            (A) better connect housing and employment while 26        mitigating commuting times;   SB1680- 27 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1            (B) align transportation improvements with housing 2        needs, such as housing supply shortages, and proposed 3        housing development; 4            (C) align planning for housing and transportation 5        to address needs in relationship to household incomes 6        within the metropolitan planning area; 7            (D) expand housing and economic development within 8        the catchment areas of existing transportation 9        facilities and public transportation services when 10        appropriate, including higher-density development, as 11        locally determined; 12            (E) manage effects of VMT growth in the 13        metropolitan planning area related to housing 14        development and economic development; and 15            (F) increase the share of households with 16        sufficient and affordable access to the transportation 17        networks of the metropolitan planning area. 18        (2) MPOs shall identify the location of existing and 19    planned housing and employment and transportation options 20    that connect housing and employment. 21        (3) MPOs shall include a comparison of State, 22    regional, and local transportation plans in the region to 23    land use management plans, including zoning plans, that 24    may affect road use, public transportation ridership, and 25    housing development. 26        (4) In their housing coordination planning, MPOs shall   SB1680- 28 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    focus on the effect that land use policies and practices, 2    such as minimum parking requirements and exclusionary 3    zoning requirements, contribute to increases in VMT and 4    GHG emissions and consider how such policies affect 5    housing and transportation affordability. 6        (5) MPOs shall outline recommendations for land use 7    policies and best practices that have the effect of 8    increasing the affordability of housing and transportation 9    and reducing GHG emissions. 10        (6) The Department shall assist MPOs in their housing 11    coordination planning and make best efforts to align the 12    Department's planning and project programming with MPO 13    efforts to encourage land use policies and best practices 14    that have the effect of increasing the affordability of 15    housing and transportation, improving accessibility to 16    destinations, and reducing GHG emissions. 17        (7) The Department shall not advance to the STIP a 18    project in a metropolitan planning area that the MPO has 19    determined would conflict with its housing coordination 20    plan prepared under paragraph (1) or would have the effect 21    of decreasing the affordability of transportation or the 22    accessibility of destinations or of increasing GHG 23    emissions. 24        (8) In furtherance of Section 48 of the Regional 25    Planning Act, the Department and MPOs shall adopt 26    performance-based methods for allocating discretionary   SB1680- 29 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    funds that reward jurisdictions that have adopted land use 2    policies and practices associated with increasing the 3    affordability of housing and transportation, improving 4    accessibility to destinations, and reducing GHG emissions. 5            (A) The Department and MPOs may build on the 6        climate equity accessibility scoring tool developed 7        under subsection (k) or develop a separate tool for 8        identifying jurisdictions that have adopted land use 9        policies and practices associated with increasing the 10        affordability of housing and transportation, improving 11        accessibility to destinations, and reducing GHG 12        emissions. 13            (B) The Department and MPOs shall publicly 14        describe the methodology they use in allocating 15        discretionary funding under this paragraph. 16            (C) When allocating discretionary funding, the 17        Department and MPOs shall give at least equal weight 18        to land use policies and practices that facilitate 19        reductions in GHG emissions that they give to existing 20        factors, such as congestion relief, safety, and 21        traffic operations. 22            (D) The Department and MPOs shall consider land 23        use policies and practices as provided in this 24        subsection when allocating discretionary funding from 25        every source. 26        (9) When evaluating all projects for possible   SB1680- 30 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    inclusion in applicable planning documents or in a STIP or 2    TIP, the Department and MPOs shall adopt performance-based 3    project selection methods that give priority to projects 4    located in jurisdictions that have adopted land use 5    policies and practices associated with increasing the 6    affordability of housing and transportation, improving 7    accessibility to destinations, and reducing GHG emissions. 8        (10) This subsection shall not diminish or restrict 9    the existing authority of jurisdictions over their land 10    use policies and practices. 11    (m) The Department and MPOs shall provide early and 12continuous opportunities for public participation in the 13transportation planning process. The process shall be 14proactive and provide timely information, adequate public 15notice, reasonable public access, and opportunities for public 16review and comment at key decision points in the process. The 17objectives of public participation in the transportation 18planning process include providing a mechanism for public 19perspectives, needs, and ideas to be considered in the 20planning process; developing the public's understanding of the 21problems and opportunities facing the transportation system; 22demonstrating explicit consideration and response to public 23input through a variety of tools and techniques; and 24developing a consensus on plans. The Department shall develop 25a documented public participation process under 23 CFR 450. 26        (1) Under 23 CFR 450, Subpart B, the Department is   SB1680- 31 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    responsible, in cooperation with the MPOs, for carrying 2    out public participation for developing, amending, and 3    updating the Long-Range State Transportation Plan, the 4    STIP, and other statewide transportation planning 5    activities. 6        (2) Under 23 CFR 450, Subpart C, the MPOs, in 7    cooperation with the Department, are responsible for 8    carrying out public participation for the development of 9    Regional Transportation Plans, TIPs, and other regional 10    transportation planning activities for their respective 11    metropolitan planning areas. 12        (3) Public participation activities at both the MPO 13    and Department levels shall include, at a minimum: 14            (A) establishing and maintaining for the 15        geographic area of responsibility a list of all known 16        parties interested in transportation planning, 17        including, but not limited to: elected officials; 18        municipal and county planning staffs; affected public 19        agencies; local, State, and federal agencies eligible 20        for federal and State transportation funds; local 21        representatives of public transportation agency 22        employees and users; freight shippers and providers of 23        freight transportation services; public and private 24        transportation providers; representatives of users of 25        transit, bicycling, pedestrian, aviation, and train 26        facilities; private industry; environmental and other   SB1680- 32 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        interest groups; representatives of persons or groups 2        that may be underserved by existing transportation 3        systems, such as minority persons, low-income seniors, 4        persons with disabilities, and persons with limited 5        English proficiency; and members of the general public 6        expressing interest in the transportation planning 7        process; 8            (B) providing reasonable notice, which for notice 9        to a disproportionately impacted community requires 10        the notice to be translated into the primary language 11        spoken in the disproportionately impacted community, 12        and opportunity to comment through mailing lists and 13        other communication methods on upcoming transportation 14        planning-related activities and meetings; 15            (C) using reasonably available Internet or 16        traditional media opportunities, including minority 17        media and diverse media, to provide timely notices of 18        planning-related activities and meetings to members of 19        the public, including limited English proficiency 20        individuals and others who may require reasonable 21        accommodations. Methods that shall be used to the 22        maximum extent practicable for public participation 23        may include, but shall not be limited to, use of the 24        Internet, social media, news media, such as 25        newspapers, radio, or television, mailings to 26        disproportionately impacted communities by existing   SB1680- 33 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        transportation systems, including, but not limited to, 2        seniors and persons with disabilities, and notices, 3        including electronic mail and online newsletters; 4            (D) seeking out persons and groups, including 5        minority groups and those with disabilities, 6        low-income, and limited English proficiency, for the 7        purposes of exchanging information, increasing their 8        involvement, and considering their transportation 9        needs in the transportation planning process; 10            (E) consulting, as appropriate, with federal, 11        State, local, and tribal agencies responsible for land 12        use management, natural resources, environmental 13        protection, conservation, cultural resources, and 14        historic preservation concerning the development of 15        long-range transportation plans; 16            (F) providing reasonable public access to, and 17        appropriate opportunities for public review and 18        comment on, criteria, standards, and other 19        planning-related information. Reasonable public access 20        includes, but is not limited to, limited English 21        proficiency services and access to ADA-compliant 22        facilities, as well as to the Internet; 23            (G) where feasible, scheduling the development of 24        regional and statewide plans so that the release of 25        the draft plans may be coordinated to provide for the 26        opportunity for joint public outreach;   SB1680- 34 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1            (H) responses, in writing, from the Department and 2        MPOs to all significant issues raised during the 3        review and comment period on transportation plans, 4        making the responses available to the public; and 5            (I) collaborating periodically with all interested 6        parties and the Department and MPOs to review the 7        effectiveness of the Department's and MPOs' public 8        involvement practices to ensure that they provide full 9        and open access to all members of the public. When 10        necessary, the Department or MPO shall revise their 11        public participation practices in the transportation 12        planning process and allow time for public review and 13        comment per 23 CFR 450. 14    (n) Beginning on January 1, 2026, each applicable planning 15document from the Department or MPO must include a 16consolidated and comprehensive list of all project types to be 17funded using any federal, State, or local funding source, 18including bicycle, pedestrian, bus, rail, and roadway 19projects, and shall include a summary of planned expenditures 20by project type. 21    (o) Beginning September 30, 2026, the Department and MPOs 22shall establish a social cost of carbon and use the social cost 23of carbon in their applicable planning documents and other 24planning activities. 25        (1) The social cost of carbon shall serve as a 26    monetary estimate of the value of not emitting a ton of GHG   SB1680- 35 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    emissions. 2        (2) In developing the social cost of carbon applicable 3    to the projects and programs in their applicable planning 4    documents and for other planning and project programming 5    activities, the Department and MPOs shall consider the 6    social cost of carbon established by the Environmental 7    Protection Agency under subsection (q) of Section 9.15 of 8    the Environmental Protection Act and may consider prior or 9    existing estimates of the social cost of carbon issued or 10    adopted by the federal government, appropriate 11    international bodies, or other appropriate and reputable 12    scientific organizations. 13        (3) The Department may adopt the social cost of carbon 14    established by the Environmental Protection Agency under 15    subsection (q) of Section 9.15 of the Environmental 16    Protection Act or establish its own social cost of carbon 17    through the process set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2), 18    but the Department shall not adopt a social cost of carbon 19    that is lower than that established by the Environmental 20    Protection Agency. 21        (4) MPOs may adopt the social cost of carbon 22    established by the Environmental Protection Agency under 23    subsection (q) of Section 9.15 of the Environmental 24    Protection Act or by the Department under paragraph (3) or 25    establish their own social cost of carbon through the 26    process set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2), but an MPO   SB1680- 36 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    shall not adopt a social cost of carbon that is lower than 2    that established by the Environmental Protection Agency or 3    the Department. 4        (5) The Department shall incorporate the social cost 5    of carbon into its assessment of projects for possible 6    inclusion in its applicable planning document or for 7    inclusion in a STIP or TIP, giving priority to projects 8    that have a relatively low social cost of carbon:9            (A) The Department shall not include any project 10        over $30,000,000 in an applicable planning document or 11        a STIP or TIP unless it has calculated the social cost 12        of carbon resulting from the project over the useful 13        life of the project.14            (B) Such calculations shall result in an estimate 15        of the social cost of carbon under a no-build scenario 16        and an estimate of the social cost of carbon if the 17        project is built, factoring in the effects of induced 18        demand and other appropriate factors.19            (C) The estimate of the social cost of carbon must 20        include total additional GHG emissions attributable to 21        the proposed project and shall not be limited to GHG 22        emissions from within the physical boundaries of the 23        project.24            (D) The Department shall publish in applicable 25        planning documents and STIPs the no-build and build 26        estimates of the social cost of carbon for each   SB1680- 37 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        project for which an estimate of the social cost of 2        carbon has been prepared.3            (E) For purposes of its planning processes under 4        Sections 2705-200, 2705-203, and 2705-205, and after 5        factoring in the effects of induced demand on VMT 6        attributable to a proposed project, the Department 7        shall offset the social cost of carbon and the social 8        cost of crashes attributable to a project against its 9        projections of the value of the time savings from any 10        reduction in congestion attributable to the project 11        and shall publish its calculations and results. 12            (F) The Department may rely upon estimates of the 13        social cost of carbon prepared by MPOs for projects 14        included in a STIP that are located inside the MPO's 15        boundaries only if the Department finds that those 16        estimates of the social cost of carbon are based on 17        reasonable assumptions and methodology. 18        (6) Each MPO shall incorporate the social cost of 19    carbon into its assessment of projects for possible 20    inclusion in its applicable planning document or for 21    inclusion in a TIP, giving priority to projects that have 22    a relatively low social cost of carbon:23            (A) An MPO shall not include any project over 24        $30,000,000 in a TIP unless it has calculated the 25        social cost of carbon resulting from the project over 26        the useful life of the project.  SB1680- 38 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1            (B) Such calculations shall result in an estimate 2        of the social cost of carbon under a no-build scenario 3        and an estimate of the social cost of carbon if the 4        project is built, factoring in the effects of induced 5        demand and other appropriate

References to Act. This Act may be referred to 5as the Transportation Choices Act. 6    Section 5. The Department of Transportation Law of the 7Civil Administrative Code of Illinois is amended by adding 8Section 2705-204 as follows: 9    (20 ILCS 2705/2705-204 new)10    Sec. 2705-204. Transportation planning and greenhouse gas 11reduction. 12    (a) The General Assembly finds that:13        (1) Article XI of the Illinois Constitution provides 14    that the public policy of the State and the duty of each 15    person is to provide and maintain a healthful environment 16    for the benefit of this and future generations. 17        (2) The transportation sector is now the largest 18    source of greenhouse gas emissions in the State. 19        (3) The State has previously set a goal to have an 20    electric power sector that is free of greenhouse gas 21    emissions by 2045. 22        (4) Greenhouse gas pollution resulting from the   SB1680- 2 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    production, distribution, and use of motor vehicle fuels 2    produces many social costs, including, but not limited to, 3    adverse public health impacts, increased heat waves, 4    droughts, water supply shortages, flooding, biodiversity 5    loss, and forest health issues, such as forest fires. 6        (5) The Illinois State Climatologist is projecting 7    that, by the end of the 21st Century, average daily 8    temperatures in the State will increase between 4 and 9 9    degrees Fahrenheit under a lower emissions scenario and 10    between 8 and 14 degrees Fahrenheit under a higher 11    emissions scenario. 12        (6) Climate change of such speed and magnitude will 13    result in heat stress on animals, plants, and workers; 14    reduced crop yields from short-term and rapid-onset 15    drought; increased pestilence; and other challenges that 16    will adversely affect the State's agriculture sector.17        (7) Increases in flooding, heat, and other factors 18    associated with climate change will stress the State's 19    transportation infrastructure, such as bridges and 20    roadways in low-lying areas, and will require more 21    resources to maintain roadways and other transportation 22    infrastructure. 23        (8) State investment in a clean transportation economy 24    in the State can expand equitable access to public health, 25    safety, a cleaner environment, quality jobs, and economic 26    opportunity.   SB1680- 3 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        (9) It is the public policy of the State to ensure that 2    State residents from communities disproportionately 3    impacted by climate change, communities facing automotive 4    plant closures, economically disadvantaged communities, 5    and individuals experiencing barriers to employment have 6    access to State programs and good jobs and career 7    opportunities in growing sectors of the State economy. 8        (10) To minimize any adverse environmental and health 9    impacts of planned transportation projects and to address 10    inequitable distribution of the burdens of those projects, 11    it is necessary, appropriate, and in the best interests of 12    the State and its citizens to require the Department and 13    MPOs, which are the State's primary transportation 14    planning entities with responsibility for selecting and 15    funding transportation projects, to engage in an enhanced 16    level of planning, modeling, and other analysis, community 17    engagement, and monitoring with respect to those projects 18    as required by this Section. 19        (11) Subsection (a) of Section 15 of the Regional 20    Planning Act provides that the Chicago Metropolitan Agency 21    for Planning, whose Policy Committee is the MPO for 22    Northeastern Illinois, shall be responsible for developing 23    and adopting a funding and implementation strategy for an 24    integrated land use and transportation planning process. 25        (12) Section 48 of the Regional Planning Act provides 26    that the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning shall   SB1680- 4 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    establish an incentive program to enable local governments 2    and developers to create more affordable workforce housing 3    options near jobs and transit, create jobs near existing 4    affordable workforce housing, create transit-oriented 5    development, integrate transportation and land use 6    planning, provide a range of viable transportation choices 7    in addition to the car, encourage compact and mixed-use 8    development, and support neighborhood revitalization. 9        (13) Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section 5303 10    of Title 49 of the United States Code (49 U.S.C. 11    5303(a)(1)) provides, in relevant part, that it is in the 12    national interest to better connect housing and 13    employment, while minimizing transportation-related fuel 14    consumption and air pollution through metropolitan and 15    statewide transportation planning processes. 16        (14) Subparagraph (A) of paragraph (4) of subsection 17    (k) of Section 5303 of Title 49 of the United States Code 18    (49 U.S.C. 5303(k)(4)(A)) provides that MPOs serving 19    transportation management areas may address the 20    integration of housing, transportation, and economic 21    development strategies through a process that provides for 22    effective integration, based on a cooperatively developed 23    and implemented strategy, of new and existing 24    transportation facilities eligible for funding. 25        (15) Subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4) of subsection 26    (k) of Section 5303 of Title 49 of the United States Code   SB1680- 5 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    (49 U.S.C. 5303(k)(4)(C)) provides that MPOs serving 2    transportation management areas may develop a housing 3    coordination plan that includes projects and strategies 4    that may be considered in the metropolitan transportation 5    plan of the MPO to develop regional goals for the 6    integration of housing, transportation, and economic 7    development strategies. 8        (16) Land use policies and practices that result in 9    shorter distances between where people reside and jobs and 10    other destinations they seek to access and that facilitate 11    multimodal transportation options for the public are one 12    of the most effective tools to reduce greenhouse gas 13    emissions from the transportation sector and provide more 14    affordable transportation options. 15        (17) Transportation is the second-largest expense 16    category for most households and the cost of owning, 17    operating, and maintaining personal vehicles is a 18    significant burden for many households. 19        (18) Reducing vehicle miles traveled per person 20    through more efficient land use and transportation systems 21    will help the State achieve its greenhouse gas reduction 22    goals and reduce the transportation cost burden on State 23    households. 24        (19) To the maximum extent practicable, actions taken 25    to achieve these goals must avoid causing disproportionate 26    adverse impacts to residents of communities that are or   SB1680- 6 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    have been disproportionately exposed to pollution 2    affecting human health and environmental quality. 3    (b) As used in this

20            (E) a description of any benefits to 21        disproportionately impacted communities from the GHG 22        mitigation measure, including an estimate of the total 23        amount spent on GHG mitigation measures in or designed 24        to serve disproportionately impacted communities; and 25            (F) a status report submitted annually and 26        published on its website for each GHG mitigation   SB1680- 17 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        measure that contains the following information 2        concerning each GHG mitigation measure: 3                (i) availability and timing of funding; 4                (ii) implementation timeline; 5                (iii) current status; 6                (iv) for GHG mitigation measures that are in 7            progress or completed, quantification of the 8            greenhouse gas impact of such GHG mitigation 9            measures and any co-benefits or detriments; and 10                (v) for GHG mitigation measures that are 11            delayed, canceled, or substituted, an explanation 12            of why that decision was made and how these GHG 13            mitigation measures or the equivalent will be 14            achieved. 15        (2) GHG mitigation measures are sufficient if the 16    total GHG emissions reduction from the GHG mitigation 17    measures, after accounting for the GHG emissions otherwise 18    resulting from existing and planned projects in the 19    applicable planning document, results in the Department or 20    MPO meeting its GHG targets. Each comparison of GHG 21    emissions reductions and GHG targets under this subsection 22    must be performed over equal comparison periods. 23        (3) In the annual GHG mitigation measures status 24    report under subparagraph (F) of paragraph (1), the 25    Department or MPO shall certify whether its GHG mitigation 26    measures will be sufficient for the Department or MPO to   SB1680- 18 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    meet its GHG targets. 2    (g) If an applicable planning document does not meet the 3GHG targets for each compliance year even after consideration 4of any GHG mitigation measures, the Department may deem the 5applicable planning document in compliance with this Section 6and approved only if the noncompliant Department or MPO 7allocates funding to advance the achievement of the applicable 8GHG targets as follows: 9        (1) in non-MPO areas, the Department (i) shall not 10    advance a roadway capacity expansion project from its 11    applicable planning document to a STIP or TIP, (ii) shall 12    not otherwise add a roadway capacity expansion project to 13    a STIP or TIP, (iii) shall reprogram funds allocated or 14    anticipated to be expended on roadway capacity expansion 15    projects awaiting inclusion in a STIP or TIP project to 16    GHG mitigation measures that reduce GHG emissions 17    sufficiently to achieve the GHG targets for each 18    compliance year, and (iv) shall amend its applicable 19    planning documents to reflect these changes; 20        (2) in MPO areas that are not in receipt of federal 21    suballocations under the Congestion Mitigation and Air 22    Quality Improvement Program or Surface Transportation 23    Board programs, the Department and MPO (i) shall not 24    advance a roadway capacity expansion project from its 25    applicable planning document to a STIP or TIP, (ii) shall 26    not otherwise add a roadway capacity expansion project to   SB1680- 19 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    a STIP or TIP, (iii) shall reprogram funds allocated or 2    anticipated to be expended on roadway capacity expansion 3    projects awaiting inclusion in a STIP or TIP project to 4    GHG mitigation measures that reduce GHG emissions 5    sufficiently to achieve the GHG targets for each 6    compliance year, and (iv) shall amend its applicable 7    planning documents to reflect these changes; 8        (3) in MPO areas that are in receipt of federal 9    suballocations under the Congestion Mitigation and Air 10    Quality Improve Program or Surface Transportation Board 11    programs, the Department and MPO (i) shall not advance a 12    roadway capacity expansion project from its applicable 13    planning document to a STIP or TIP, (ii) shall not 14    otherwise add a roadway capacity expansion project to a 15    STIP or TIP, (iii) shall reprogram funds allocated or 16    anticipated to be expended on roadway capacity expansion 17    projects awaiting inclusion in a STIP or TIP project to 18    GHG mitigation measures that reduce GHG emissions 19    sufficiently to achieve the GHG targets for each 20    compliance year, and (iv) shall amend its applicable 21    planning documents to reflect these changes; and 22        (4) the Department and MPOs shall administer 23    paragraphs (1) through (3) as a limitation on their 24    authority to advance roadway capacity expansion projects 25    or other projects that will materially increase GHG 26    emissions under paragraph (5) of subsection (k) of Section   SB1680- 20 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    5303 of Title 49 of the United States Code (49 U.S.C. 2    5303(k)(5)). 3    (h) Before including a roadway capacity expansion project 4in an applicable planning document, the Department or MPO must 5perform a GHG emissions analysis of the roadway capacity 6expansion project. Following the GHG emissions analysis, the 7Department or MPO must determine if, after consideration of 8all relevant factors, including VMT and social cost of carbon 9increases in the transportation network resulting from induced 10demand, the project conforms with (i) the applicable GHG 11targets and (ii) VMT targets established under subsection (c). 12        (1) If the Department or MPO determines that the 13    roadway capacity expansion project is not in conformance 14    with items (i) and (ii), the Department or MPO must: 15            (A) alter the scope or design of the roadway 16        capacity expansion project and perform a GHG emissions 17        analysis that shows that the roadway capacity 18        expansion project meets the requirements of items (i) 19        and (ii); 20            (B) incorporate sufficient GHG mitigation measures 21        to bring the Department or MPO into compliance with 22        its GHG targets, however, in order to be effective, 23        such GHG mitigation measures must be implemented no 24        later than contemporaneously with the implementation 25        of the roadway expansion project or, if not 26        implemented contemporaneously, a GHG mitigation   SB1680- 21 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        measure must provide a valid GHG emissions reduction 2        after the date it is implemented; or 3            (C) halt development of the roadway capacity 4        expansion project and remove the roadway capacity 5        expansion project from all applicable planning 6        documents. 7        (2) The Department and MPOs must establish a process 8    for performing roadway capacity expansion project GHG 9    emissions analysis. A GHG emissions analysis for a roadway 10    capacity expansion project must include, but shall not be 11    limited to, estimates resulting from the project for the 12    following: 13            (A) GHG emissions over a period of 20 years or the 14        last GHG target year, whichever is later; 15            (B) a net change in VMT and social cost of carbon 16        for the transportation network after factoring in the 17        effects of induced demand; and 18            (C) consideration of additional VMT in the 19        transportation network from additional capacity 20        resulting from roadway traffic capacity expansion, 21        intelligent transportation systems, or both. 22        (3) The Department or MPO must connect any GHG 23    mitigation measures associated with the roadway capacity 24    expansion project as follows: 25            (A) within or associated with at least one of the 26        communities impacted by the roadway capacity expansion   SB1680- 22 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        project; 2            (B) if there is not a reasonably feasible location 3        under subparagraph (A), in areas of persistent poverty 4        or historically disadvantaged communities, as measured 5        and defined by federal law, guidance and notices of 6        funding opportunity; 7            (C) if there is not a reasonably feasible location 8        under subparagraphs (A) and (B), in the region of the 9        roadway capacity expansion project; and 10            (D) if there is not a reasonably feasible location 11        under subparagraphs (A) through (C), on a statewide 12        basis. 13        (4) The Department or MPO must develop and use a 14    process for community consultation consistent with the 15    requirements of subsection (m) in the development of GHG 16    mitigation measures that the Department or MPO uses to 17    achieve compliance with its GHG targets. 18        (5) The Department or MPO must publish an explanation 19    regarding the feasibility and rationale for each GHG 20    mitigation measure under subparagraphs (B) through (D) of 21    paragraph (3). 22        (6) GHG mitigation measures connected to a roadway 23    expansion project are sufficient if the total greenhouse 24    gas reduction from the GHG mitigation measures is at least 25    equal to the total GHG emissions resulting from the 26    roadway capacity expansion project and consistent with the   SB1680- 23 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    Department or MPO meeting its GHG targets. 2            (A) Each comparison under this paragraph must be 3        performed over equal comparison periods. 4            (B) To avoid double counting, once a GHG 5        mitigation measure is connected to a roadway capacity 6        expansion project, that GHG mitigation measure shall 7        not be used to offset greenhouse gases associated with 8        other roadway capacity expansion projects or other 9        projects included in an applicable planning document. 10        (7) The Department and MPOs must publish information 11    regarding roadway capacity expansion project GHG emissions 12    analyses on their websites. The information must include: 13            (A) an identification of each roadway capacity 14        expansion project; and 15            (B) for each roadway capacity expansion project, a 16        summary that includes an overview of and link to the 17        roadway capacity expansion project GHG emissions 18        analysis, the greenhouse gas impact determination by 19        the Department or MPO, the social cost of carbon added 20        by the roadway capacity expansion project, and project 21        disposition, including a review of any GHG mitigation 22        measures. 23    (i) The Department and MPOs may use a GHG mitigation 24measure as an offset against GHG emissions only after the date 25the GHG mitigation measure has been implemented. 26    (j) By January 1, 2029, and every 3 years thereafter, the   SB1680- 24 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1Department shall prepare a comprehensive, publicly released 2report on statewide transportation greenhouse gas reduction 3accomplishments and challenges and make recommendations for 4any legislative action or State agency rulemaking that would 5assist the Department and MPOs in meeting their GHG targets. 6The report, at a minimum, shall include: 7        (1) a description of whether the Department and MPOs 8    are on track to meet their GHG targets and VMT targets; 9        (2) an assessment of State and local laws, 10    regulations, rules, and practices and recommendations for 11    modifications that would help ensure that the Department 12    and MPOs meet their GHG targets and VMT targets; 13        (3) a description of the benefits from reductions in 14    GHG emissions and copollutants in the transportation 15    sector, diversification of energy sources used for 16    transportation, and substitution of other motorized and 17    nonmotorized modes of travel for VMT currently being 18    handled by vehicles powered by internal combustion 19    engines, and other economic, environmental, and public 20    health benefits; 21        (4) a description of the compliance costs borne by the 22    Department and MPOs in meeting their GHG targets and VMT 23    targets; 24        (5) a description of the social cost of carbon 25    associated with the transportation systems for which the 26    Department and each MPO is responsible and the social cost   SB1680- 25 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    of carbon reductions that result from GHG mitigation 2    measures and other steps being taken by the Department and 3    each MPO to reduce GHG emissions; 4        (6) a description of whether measures taken by the 5    Department and MPOs to meet GHG targets are equitable, 6    minimize costs, and maximize the total benefits to the 7    State and its citizens; and 8        (7) a description of whether activities undertaken to 9    meet GHG targets by the Department and MPOs have unduly 10    burdened disproportionately impacted communities. 11    (k) Before including any project that has an anticipated 12cost of $30,000,000 or more (i) in an applicable planning 13document or (ii) as a GHG mitigation measure, the Department 14or MPO shall calculate a climate equity accessibility score 15for the project. The climate equity accessibility score shall 16be based on a GHG emissions analysis of the project and a 17measurement of (i) the current levels of access to jobs, 18hospitals, schools, and food by available modes of 19transportation and (ii) the current level of affordability of 20transportation in the project area. The Department and MPO 21shall then calculate a climate equity accessibility score 22based on the projected change in GHG emissions, accessibility, 23and affordability from the proposed project. Projects that 24result in relatively high reductions of GHG emissions while 25increasing access to jobs and other destinations and providing 26more affordable transportation options will receive a higher   SB1680- 26 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1climate equity accessibility score than projects that fail to 2deliver such benefits. To advance the goals of this Section 3and optimize the use of public funds, the Department and MPOs 4shall give priority to projects with high climate equity 5accessibility scores, considering which project delivers the 6most climate equity accessibility score benefit per dollar 7invested. The Department, with the assistance of the 8Environmental Protection Agency, shall provide technical 9assistance to MPOs in fulfilling their responsibilities under 10this subsection. 11    (l) To the full extent allowed by paragraph (4) of 12subsection (k) of Section 5303 of Title 49 of the United States 13Code and other applicable laws, and to extend the existing 14authority under State law vested in the Chicago Metropolitan 15Agency for Planning to MPOs throughout the State, MPOs, with 16the full support of the Department, shall conduct housing 17coordination planning to help the Department and MPOs meet 18their GHG targets. 19        (1) MPOs shall develop housing coordination plans 20    consistent with subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4) of 21    subsection (k) of Section 5303 of Title 49 of the United 22    States Code (49 U.S.C. 5303(k)(4)(C)) to better integrate 23    housing, transportation, and economic development 24    strategies and to, among other things: 25            (A) better connect housing and employment while 26        mitigating commuting times;   SB1680- 27 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1            (B) align transportation improvements with housing 2        needs, such as housing supply shortages, and proposed 3        housing development; 4            (C) align planning for housing and transportation 5        to address needs in relationship to household incomes 6        within the metropolitan planning area; 7            (D) expand housing and economic development within 8        the catchment areas of existing transportation 9        facilities and public transportation services when 10        appropriate, including higher-density development, as 11        locally determined; 12            (E) manage effects of VMT growth in the 13        metropolitan planning area related to housing 14        development and economic development; and 15            (F) increase the share of households with 16        sufficient and affordable access to the transportation 17        networks of the metropolitan planning area. 18        (2) MPOs shall identify the location of existing and 19    planned housing and employment and transportation options 20    that connect housing and employment. 21        (3) MPOs shall include a comparison of State, 22    regional, and local transportation plans in the region to 23    land use management plans, including zoning plans, that 24    may affect road use, public transportation ridership, and 25    housing development. 26        (4) In their housing coordination planning, MPOs shall   SB1680- 28 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    focus on the effect that land use policies and practices, 2    such as minimum parking requirements and exclusionary 3    zoning requirements, contribute to increases in VMT and 4    GHG emissions and consider how such policies affect 5    housing and transportation affordability. 6        (5) MPOs shall outline recommendations for land use 7    policies and best practices that have the effect of 8    increasing the affordability of housing and transportation 9    and reducing GHG emissions. 10        (6) The Department shall assist MPOs in their housing 11    coordination planning and make best efforts to align the 12    Department's planning and project programming with MPO 13    efforts to encourage land use policies and best practices 14    that have the effect of increasing the affordability of 15    housing and transportation, improving accessibility to 16    destinations, and reducing GHG emissions. 17        (7) The Department shall not advance to the STIP a 18    project in a metropolitan planning area that the MPO has 19    determined would conflict with its housing coordination 20    plan prepared under paragraph (1) or would have the effect 21    of decreasing the affordability of transportation or the 22    accessibility of destinations or of increasing GHG 23    emissions. 24        (8) In furtherance of Section 48 of the Regional 25    Planning Act, the Department and MPOs shall adopt 26    performance-based methods for allocating discretionary   SB1680- 29 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    funds that reward jurisdictions that have adopted land use 2    policies and practices associated with increasing the 3    affordability of housing and transportation, improving 4    accessibility to destinations, and reducing GHG emissions. 5            (A) The Department and MPOs may build on the 6        climate equity accessibility scoring tool developed 7        under subsection (k) or develop a separate tool for 8        identifying jurisdictions that have adopted land use 9        policies and practices associated with increasing the 10        affordability of housing and transportation, improving 11        accessibility to destinations, and reducing GHG 12        emissions. 13            (B) The Department and MPOs shall publicly 14        describe the methodology they use in allocating 15        discretionary funding under this paragraph. 16            (C) When allocating discretionary funding, the 17        Department and MPOs shall give at least equal weight 18        to land use policies and practices that facilitate 19        reductions in GHG emissions that they give to existing 20        factors, such as congestion relief, safety, and 21        traffic operations. 22            (D) The Department and MPOs shall consider land 23        use policies and practices as provided in this 24        subsection when allocating discretionary funding from 25        every source. 26        (9) When evaluating all projects for possible   SB1680- 30 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    inclusion in applicable planning documents or in a STIP or 2    TIP, the Department and MPOs shall adopt performance-based 3    project selection methods that give priority to projects 4    located in jurisdictions that have adopted land use 5    policies and practices associated with increasing the 6    affordability of housing and transportation, improving 7    accessibility to destinations, and reducing GHG emissions. 8        (10) This subsection shall not diminish or restrict 9    the existing authority of jurisdictions over their land 10    use policies and practices. 11    (m) The Department and MPOs shall provide early and 12continuous opportunities for public participation in the 13transportation planning process. The process shall be 14proactive and provide timely information, adequate public 15notice, reasonable public access, and opportunities for public 16review and comment at key decision points in the process. The 17objectives of public participation in the transportation 18planning process include providing a mechanism for public 19perspectives, needs, and ideas to be considered in the 20planning process; developing the public's understanding of the 21problems and opportunities facing the transportation system; 22demonstrating explicit consideration and response to public 23input through a variety of tools and techniques; and 24developing a consensus on plans. The Department shall develop 25a documented public participation process under 23 CFR 450. 26        (1) Under 23 CFR 450, Subpart B, the Department is   SB1680- 31 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    responsible, in cooperation with the MPOs, for carrying 2    out public participation for developing, amending, and 3    updating the Long-Range State Transportation Plan, the 4    STIP, and other statewide transportation planning 5    activities. 6        (2) Under 23 CFR 450, Subpart C, the MPOs, in 7    cooperation with the Department, are responsible for 8    carrying out public participation for the development of 9    Regional Transportation Plans, TIPs, and other regional 10    transportation planning activities for their respective 11    metropolitan planning areas. 12        (3) Public participation activities at both the MPO 13    and Department levels shall include, at a minimum: 14            (A) establishing and maintaining for the 15        geographic area of responsibility a list of all known 16        parties interested in transportation planning, 17        including, but not limited to: elected officials; 18        municipal and county planning staffs; affected public 19        agencies; local, State, and federal agencies eligible 20        for federal and State transportation funds; local 21        representatives of public transportation agency 22        employees and users; freight shippers and providers of 23        freight transportation services; public and private 24        transportation providers; representatives of users of 25        transit, bicycling, pedestrian, aviation, and train 26        facilities; private industry; environmental and other   SB1680- 32 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        interest groups; representatives of persons or groups 2        that may be underserved by existing transportation 3        systems, such as minority persons, low-income seniors, 4        persons with disabilities, and persons with limited 5        English proficiency; and members of the general public 6        expressing interest in the transportation planning 7        process; 8            (B) providing reasonable notice, which for notice 9        to a disproportionately impacted community requires 10        the notice to be translated into the primary language 11        spoken in the disproportionately impacted community, 12        and opportunity to comment through mailing lists and 13        other communication methods on upcoming transportation 14        planning-related activities and meetings; 15            (C) using reasonably available Internet or 16        traditional media opportunities, including minority 17        media and diverse media, to provide timely notices of 18        planning-related activities and meetings to members of 19        the public, including limited English proficiency 20        individuals and others who may require reasonable 21        accommodations. Methods that shall be used to the 22        maximum extent practicable for public participation 23        may include, but shall not be limited to, use of the 24        Internet, social media, news media, such as 25        newspapers, radio, or television, mailings to 26        disproportionately impacted communities by existing   SB1680- 33 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        transportation systems, including, but not limited to, 2        seniors and persons with disabilities, and notices, 3        including electronic mail and online newsletters; 4            (D) seeking out persons and groups, including 5        minority groups and those with disabilities, 6        low-income, and limited English proficiency, for the 7        purposes of exchanging information, increasing their 8        involvement, and considering their transportation 9        needs in the transportation planning process; 10            (E) consulting, as appropriate, with federal, 11        State, local, and tribal agencies responsible for land 12        use management, natural resources, environmental 13        protection, conservation, cultural resources, and 14        historic preservation concerning the development of 15        long-range transportation plans; 16            (F) providing reasonable public access to, and 17        appropriate opportunities for public review and 18        comment on, criteria, standards, and other 19        planning-related information. Reasonable public access 20        includes, but is not limited to, limited English 21        proficiency services and access to ADA-compliant 22        facilities, as well as to the Internet; 23            (G) where feasible, scheduling the development of 24        regional and statewide plans so that the release of 25        the draft plans may be coordinated to provide for the 26        opportunity for joint public outreach;   SB1680- 34 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1            (H) responses, in writing, from the Department and 2        MPOs to all significant issues raised during the 3        review and comment period on transportation plans, 4        making the responses available to the public; and 5            (I) collaborating periodically with all interested 6        parties and the Department and MPOs to review the 7        effectiveness of the Department's and MPOs' public 8        involvement practices to ensure that they provide full 9        and open access to all members of the public. When 10        necessary, the Department or MPO shall revise their 11        public participation practices in the transportation 12        planning process and allow time for public review and 13        comment per 23 CFR 450. 14    (n) Beginning on January 1, 2026, each applicable planning 15document from the Department or MPO must include a 16consolidated and comprehensive list of all project types to be 17funded using any federal, State, or local funding source, 18including bicycle, pedestrian, bus, rail, and roadway 19projects, and shall include a summary of planned expenditures 20by project type. 21    (o) Beginning September 30, 2026, the Department and MPOs 22shall establish a social cost of carbon and use the social cost 23of carbon in their applicable planning documents and other 24planning activities. 25        (1) The social cost of carbon shall serve as a 26    monetary estimate of the value of not emitting a ton of GHG   SB1680- 35 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    emissions. 2        (2) In developing the social cost of carbon applicable 3    to the projects and programs in their applicable planning 4    documents and for other planning and project programming 5    activities, the Department and MPOs shall consider the 6    social cost of carbon established by the Environmental 7    Protection Agency under subsection (q) of Section 9.15 of 8    the Environmental Protection Act and may consider prior or 9    existing estimates of the social cost of carbon issued or 10    adopted by the federal government, appropriate 11    international bodies, or other appropriate and reputable 12    scientific organizations. 13        (3) The Department may adopt the social cost of carbon 14    established by the Environmental Protection Agency under 15    subsection (q) of Section 9.15 of the Environmental 16    Protection Act or establish its own social cost of carbon 17    through the process set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2), 18    but the Department shall not adopt a social cost of carbon 19    that is lower than that established by the Environmental 20    Protection Agency. 21        (4) MPOs may adopt the social cost of carbon 22    established by the Environmental Protection Agency under 23    subsection (q) of Section 9.15 of the Environmental 24    Protection Act or by the Department under paragraph (3) or 25    establish their own social cost of carbon through the 26    process set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2), but an MPO   SB1680- 36 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    shall not adopt a social cost of carbon that is lower than 2    that established by the Environmental Protection Agency or 3    the Department. 4        (5) The Department shall incorporate the social cost 5    of carbon into its assessment of projects for possible 6    inclusion in its applicable planning document or for 7    inclusion in a STIP or TIP, giving priority to projects 8    that have a relatively low social cost of carbon:9            (A) The Department shall not include any project 10        over $30,000,000 in an applicable planning document or 11        a STIP or TIP unless it has calculated the social cost 12        of carbon resulting from the project over the useful 13        life of the project.14            (B) Such calculations shall result in an estimate 15        of the social cost of carbon under a no-build scenario 16        and an estimate of the social cost of carbon if the 17        project is built, factoring in the effects of induced 18        demand and other appropriate factors.19            (C) The estimate of the social cost of carbon must 20        include total additional GHG emissions attributable to 21        the proposed project and shall not be limited to GHG 22        emissions from within the physical boundaries of the 23        project.24            (D) The Department shall publish in applicable 25        planning documents and STIPs the no-build and build 26        estimates of the social cost of carbon for each   SB1680- 37 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1        project for which an estimate of the social cost of 2        carbon has been prepared.3            (E) For purposes of its planning processes under 4        Sections 2705-200, 2705-203, and 2705-205, and after 5        factoring in the effects of induced demand on VMT 6        attributable to a proposed project, the Department 7        shall offset the social cost of carbon and the social 8        cost of crashes attributable to a project against its 9        projections of the value of the time savings from any 10        reduction in congestion attributable to the project 11        and shall publish its calculations and results. 12            (F) The Department may rely upon estimates of the 13        social cost of carbon prepared by MPOs for projects 14        included in a STIP that are located inside the MPO's 15        boundaries only if

Within 30 days after the 3    expiration of the comment period, the Illinois Commerce 4    Commission shall determine whether an evidentiary hearing 5    is necessary. The Illinois Commerce Commission shall also 6    host 3 public hearings within 90 days after the plan is 7    filed. Following the evidentiary and public hearings, the 8    Illinois Commerce Commission shall enter its order 9    approving or approving with modifications the reliability 10    mitigation plan within 180 days.11        (3) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall only 12    approve the plan if the Illinois Commerce Commission 13    determines that it will resolve the resource adequacy or 14    reliability deficiency identified in the reliability 15    mitigation plan at the least amount of CO2e and copollutant 16    emissions, taking into consideration the emissions impacts 17    on environmental justice communities, and that it will 18    ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and 19    environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest 20    total cost over time, taking into account the impact of 21    increases in emissions.22        (4) If the resource adequacy or reliability deficiency 23    identified in the reliability mitigation plan is resolved 24    or reduced, the Environmental Protection Agency and the 25    Illinois Power Agency may file an amended plan adjusting 26    the reduction or delay in CO2e and copollutant emission   SB1680- 58 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    reduction requirements identified in the plan. 2    (p) The goals of the State are to reduce greenhouse gas 3emissions from the transportation sector in the State by at 4least 80% from the 2005 level and achieve a net-zero emissions 5transportation sector, both by 2050.6        (1) An incremental goal of at least a 50% reduction in 7    greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector 8    below the year 2005 level by the year 2031 is hereby 9    established.10        (2) By no later than September 30, 2026, the Agency 11    shall establish greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets 12    for the State transportation sector on a 5-year or more 13    frequent basis that will achieve these goals.14        (3) The Agency shall set the first such emissions 15    reduction target for no later than 2031, shall use 2005 16    emissions as the baseline year, and shall provide that 17    each 5-year target is at least 15 percentage points lower 18    and no more than 25 percentage points lower than the 19    immediately preceding 5-year target.20        (4) The emissions reduction targets set by the Agency 21    must be by transportation mode, such as aerial transport 22    and highway transport, as the Agency deems appropriate 23    after consultation with the Department of Transportation.24        (5) The Agency, in coordination with the Department of 25    Transportation, shall adopt rules establishing policies 26    and programs necessary for the State to achieve the   SB1680- 59 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions reduction 2    goals and targets set forth in this subsection and in 3    subsection (c) of Section 2705-204 of the Department of 4    Transportation Law of the Civil Administrative Code of 5    Illinois. The rules may make changes to how the Department 6    of Transportation and MPOs plan, program, prioritize, and 7    fund transportation projects so that the State can achieve 8    the greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals and targets 9    set forth in this subsection and in subsection (c) of 10    Section 2705-204 of the Department of Transportation Law 11    of the Civil Administrative Code of Illinois.12        (6) The Department of Transportation and MPOs in the 13    State shall ensure that their greenhouse gas emissions 14    reporting under Title 23, Part 490, of the Code of Federal 15    Regulations conforms to the greenhouse gas emissions 16    reduction goals and targets set forth in this subsection 17    and in subsection (c) of Section 2705-204 of the 18    Department of Transportation Law of the Civil 19    Administrative Code of Illinois. 20    (q) No later than June 30, 2026, the Agency, by rule, shall 21establish a social cost of carbon, expressed in terms of 22dollars per ton of CO2e. 23        (1) The social cost of carbon shall serve as a 24    monetary estimate of the value of not emitting a ton of 25    greenhouse gas emissions.26        (2) In developing the social cost of carbon, the   SB1680- 60 -LRB104 09343 BDA 19401 b1    Agency shall consider estimates of the social cost of 2    carbon issued or adopted by the federal government, 3    appropriate international bodies, or other appropriate and 4    reputable scientific organizations, but the social cost of 5    carbon adopted by the Agency must not be less than the 6    social cost of carbon adopted by the United States 7    Environmental Protection Agency. 8        (3) The Agency shall periodically update its estimate 9    of the social cost of carbon to reflect changes in data, 10    assumptions, and estimates, and it shall do so at least 11    once every 5 years. 12        (4) Except as otherwise provided by law, State 13    agencies shall use the social cost of carbon figure 14    established by the Agency for purposes of estimating the 15    cost associated with carbon-related emissions. 16(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 102-1031, eff. 5-27-22.)
