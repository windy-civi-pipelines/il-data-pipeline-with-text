The commission members may themselves at any time 6act as examiners without appointing examiners. The examiners 7at any examination shall not all be members of the same 8political party.9    (h) In municipalities of 500,000 or more population, no 10person who has attained his or her 35th birthday shall be 11eligible to take an examination for a position as a fireman or 12a policeman unless the person has had previous employment 13status as a policeman or fireman in the regularly constituted 14police or fire department of the municipality, except as 15provided in this Section.16    (i) In municipalities of more than 5,000 but not more than 17200,000 inhabitants, no person who has attained his or her 1835th birthday shall be eligible to take an examination for a 19position as a fireman or a policeman unless the person has had 20previous employment status as a policeman or fireman in the 21regularly constituted police or fire department of the 22municipality, except as provided in this Section.23    (j) In all municipalities, applicants who are 20 years of 24age and who have successfully completed 2 years of law 25enforcement studies at an accredited college or university may 26be considered for appointment to active duty with the police   HB1033- 9 -LRB104 03479 RTM 13502 b1department.

The limitation on periods of probationary 13employment provided in Public Act 86-990 is an exclusive power 14and function of the State. Pursuant to subsection (h) of 15Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution, a home 16rule municipality having a population less than 1,000,000 must 17comply with this limitation on periods of probationary 18employment, which is a denial and limitation of home rule 19powers.

The examinations shall include tests of physical 6qualifications, health, and (when appropriate) manual skill. 7If an applicant is unable to pass the physical examination 8solely as the result of an injury received by the applicant as 9the result of the performance of an act of duty while working 10as a temporary employee in the position for which he or she is 11being examined, however, the physical examination shall be 12waived and the applicant shall be considered to have passed 13the examination. No questions in any examination shall relate 14to political or religious opinions or affiliations. Results of 15examinations and the eligible registers prepared from the 16results shall be published by the commission within 60 days 17after any examinations are held.18    (g) The commission shall control all examinations, and 19may, whenever an examination is to take place, designate a 20suitable number of persons, either in or not in the official 21service of the municipality, to be examiners. The examiners 22shall conduct the examinations as directed by the commission 23and shall make a return or report of the examinations to the 24commission. If the appointed examiners are in the official 25service of the municipality, the examiners shall not receive 26extra compensation for conducting the examinations unless the   HB1033- 8 -LRB104 03479 RTM 13502 b1examiners are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 2with the municipality. The commission may at any time 3substitute any other person, whether or not in the service of 4the municipality, in the place of any one selected as an 5examiner. The commission members may themselves at any time 6act as examiners without appointing examiners. The examiners 7at any examination shall not all be members of the same 8political party.9    (h) In municipalities of 500,000 or more population, no 10person who has attained his or her 35th birthday shall be 11eligible to take an examination for a position as a fireman or 12a policeman unless the person has had previous employment 13status as a policeman or fireman in the regularly constituted 14police or fire department of the municipality, except as 15provided in this Section.16    (i) In municipalities of more than 5,000 but not more than 17200,000 inhabitants, no person who has attained his or her 1835th birthday shall be eligible to take an examination for a 19position as a fireman or a policeman unless the person has had 20previous employment status as a policeman or fireman in the 21regularly constituted police or fire department of the 22municipality, except as provided in this Section.23    (j) In all municipalities, applicants who are 20 years of 24age and who have successfully completed 2 years of law 25enforcement studies at an accredited college or university may 26be considered for appointment to active duty with the police   HB1033- 9 -LRB104 03479 RTM 13502 b1department.

The limitation on periods of probationary 13employment provided in Public Act 86-990 is an exclusive power 14and function of the State. Pursuant to subsection (h) of 15Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution, a home 16rule municipality having a population less than 1,000,000 must 17comply with this limitation on periods of probationary 18employment, which is a denial and limitation of home rule 19powers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 20Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 21extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 22employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 23sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 24hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 25licensure.26    (m) To the extent that this Section or any other Section in   HB1033- 10 -LRB104 03479 RTM 13502 b1this Division conflicts with Section 10-1-7.1 or 10-1-7.2, 2then Section 10-1-7.1 or 10-1-7.2 shall control.3(Source: P.A. 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-357, eff. 1-1-24.) 4    (65 ILCS 5/10-2.1-6)  (from Ch. 24, par. 10-2.1-6)5    Sec. 10-2.1-6.
