If the technician determines that 3    the vehicle speed was not determined by a calibrated, 4    certified speed equipment device based upon the speed 5    equipment documentation, or if the vehicle was an 6    emergency vehicle, a citation may not be issued. The 7    automated speed enforcement ordinance shall require that 8    all determinations by a technician that a violation 9    occurred be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement 10    officer or retired law enforcement officer of the 11    municipality issuing the violation or by an additional 12    fully trained reviewing technician who is not employed by 13    the contractor who employs the technician who made the 14    initial determination. Routine and independent calibration 15    of the speeds produced by automated speed enforcement 16    systems and equipment shall be conducted annually by a 17    qualified technician. Speeds produced by an automated 18    speed enforcement system shall be compared with speeds 19    produced by lidar or other independent equipment. Radar or 20    lidar equipment shall undergo an internal validation test 21    no less frequently than once each week. Qualified 22    technicians shall test loop-based equipment no less 23    frequently than once a year. Radar equipment shall be 24    checked for accuracy by a qualified technician when the 25    unit is serviced, when unusual or suspect readings 26    persist, or when deemed necessary by a reviewing   HB3536- 21 -LRB104 07558 RTM 17602 b1    technician. Radar equipment shall be checked with the 2    internal frequency generator and the internal circuit test 3    whenever the radar is turned on. Technicians must be alert 4    for any unusual or suspect readings, and if unusual or 5    suspect readings of a radar unit persist, that unit shall 6    immediately be removed from service and not returned to 7    service until it has been checked by a qualified 8    technician and determined to be functioning properly. 9    Documentation of the annual calibration results, including 10    the equipment tested, test date, technician performing the 11    test, and test results, shall be maintained and available 12    for use in the determination of an automated speed 13    enforcement system violation and issuance of a citation. 14    The technician performing the calibration and testing of 15    the automated speed enforcement equipment shall be trained 16    and certified in the use of equipment for speed 17    enforcement purposes. Training on the speed enforcement 18    equipment may be conducted by law enforcement, civilian, 19    or manufacturer's personnel and if applicable may be 20    equivalent to the equipment use and operations training 21    included in the Speed Measuring Device Operator Program 22    developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety 23    Administration (NHTSA). The vendor or technician who 24    performs the work shall keep accurate records on each 25    piece of equipment the technician calibrates and tests. As 26    used in this paragraph, "fully trained reviewing   HB3536- 22 -LRB104 07558 RTM 17602 b1    technician" means a person who has received at least 40 2    hours of supervised training in subjects which shall 3    include image inspection and interpretation, the elements 4    necessary to prove a violation, license plate 5    identification, and traffic safety and management. In all 6    municipalities and counties, the automated speed 7    enforcement system or automated traffic law ordinance 8    shall require that no additional fee shall be charged to 9    the alleged violator for exercising his or her right to an 10    administrative hearing, and persons shall be given at 11    least 25 days following an administrative hearing to pay 12    any civil penalty imposed by a finding that Section 13    11-208.6, 11-208.8, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a similar 14    local ordinance has been violated. The original or a 15    facsimile of the violation notice or, in the case of a 16    notice produced by a computerized device, a printed record 17    generated by the device showing the facts entered on the 18    notice, shall be retained by the traffic compliance 19    administrator, and shall be a record kept in the ordinary 20    course of business. A parking, standing, compliance, 21    automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic 22    law violation notice issued, signed, and served in 23    accordance with this Section, a copy of the notice, or the 24    computer-generated record shall be prima facie correct and 25    shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the 26    facts shown on the notice. The notice, copy, or   HB3536- 23 -LRB104 07558 RTM 17602 b1    computer-generated record shall be admissible in any 2    subsequent administrative or legal proceedings.3        (4) An opportunity for a hearing for the registered 4    owner of the vehicle cited in the parking, standing, 5    compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or 6    automated traffic law violation notice in which the owner 7    may contest the merits of the alleged violation, and 8    during which formal or technical rules of evidence shall 9    not apply; provided, however, that under Section 11-1306 10    of this Code the lessee of a vehicle cited in the violation 11    notice likewise shall be provided an opportunity for a 12    hearing of the same kind afforded the registered owner. 13    All oral testimony given at the hearing shall be under 14    oath. The hearings shall be recorded, and the person 15    conducting the hearing on behalf of the traffic compliance 16    administrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and 17    to secure by subpoena both the attendance and testimony of 18    witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers. 19    During the hearing, a citation or notice of violation 20    sworn to under oath or affirmation taken under 21    certification under Section 1-109 of the Code of Civil 22    Procedure is prima facie evidence of the correctness of 23    the facts specified therein and the standard for rebutting 24    this presumption is a preponderance of the evidence. 25    Persons appearing at a hearing under this Section may be 26    represented by counsel at their expense. The ordinance may   HB3536- 24 -LRB104 07558 RTM 17602 b1    also provide for internal administrative review following 2    the decision of the hearing officer.3        (5) Service of additional notices, sent by first class 4    United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the 5    registered owner of the cited vehicle as recorded with the 6    Secretary of State or, if any notice to that address is 7    returned as undeliverable, to the last known address 8    recorded in a United States Post Office approved database, 9    or, under Section 11-1306 or subsection (p) of Section 10    11-208.6 or 11-208.9, or subsection (p) of Section 11    11-208.8 of this Code, to the lessee of the cited vehicle 12    at the last address known to the lessor of the cited 13    vehicle at the time of lease or, if any notice to that 14    address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known 15    address recorded in a United States Post Office approved 16    database.

The notices 18    shall be in the following sequence and shall include, but 19    not be limited to, the information specified herein:20            (i) A second notice of parking, standing, or 21        compliance violation if the first notice of the 22        violation was issued by affixing the original or a 23        facsimile of the notice to the unlawfully parked 24        vehicle or by handing the notice to the operator. This 25        notice shall specify or include the date and location 26        of the violation cited in the parking, standing, or   HB3536- 25 -LRB104 07558 RTM 17602 b1        compliance violation notice, the particular regulation 2        violated, the vehicle make or a photograph of the 3        vehicle, the state registration number of the vehicle, 4        any requirement to complete a traffic education 5        program, the fine and any penalty that may be assessed 6        for late payment or failure to complete a traffic 7        education program, or both, when so provided by 8        ordinance, the availability of a hearing in which the 9        violation may be contested on its merits, and the time 10        and manner in which the hearing may be had.

The notice shall contain warnings that failure 11        to complete any required traffic education program or 12        to pay any fine or penalty due and owing the 13        municipality or county, or both, within the time 14        specified may result in the municipality's or county's 15        filing of a petition in the Circuit Court to have the 16        incomplete traffic education program or unpaid fine or 17        penalty, or both, rendered a judgment as provided by 18        this Section, or, where applicable, may result in 19        suspension of the person's driver's license for 20        failure to complete a traffic education program. 21        (6) A notice of impending driver's license suspension. 22    This notice shall be sent to the person liable for failure 23    to complete a required traffic education program. The 24    notice shall state that failure to complete a required 25    traffic education program within 45 days of the notice's 26    date will result in the municipality or county notifying   HB3536- 27 -LRB104 07558 RTM 17602 b1    the Secretary of State that the person is eligible for 2    initiation of suspension proceedings under Section 6-306.5 3    of this Code. The notice shall also state that the person 4    may obtain a photostatic copy of an original ticket 5    imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self-addressed, 6    stamped envelope to the municipality or county along with 7    a request for the photostatic copy.
