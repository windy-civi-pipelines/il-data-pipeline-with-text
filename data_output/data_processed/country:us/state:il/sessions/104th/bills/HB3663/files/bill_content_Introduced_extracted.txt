Petition for a certificate of innocence that 5the petitioner was innocent of all offenses for which he or she 6was incarcerated.7    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that innocent 8persons who have been wrongly convicted or adjudicated 9delinquent of crimes in Illinois and subsequently imprisoned 10have been frustrated in seeking legal redress due to a variety 11of substantive and technical obstacles in the law and that 12such persons should have an available avenue to obtain a 13finding of innocence so that they may obtain relief through a 14petition in the Court of Claims. The General Assembly further 15finds misleading the current legal nomenclature which compels 16an innocent person to seek a pardon for being wrongfully 17incarcerated. It is the intent of the General Assembly that 18the court, in exercising its discretion as permitted by law 19regarding the weight and admissibility of evidence submitted 20pursuant to this Section, shall, in the interest of justice, 21give due consideration to difficulties of proof caused by the 22passage of time, the death or unavailability of witnesses, the 23destruction of evidence or other factors not caused by such 24persons or those acting on their behalf.25    (b) Any person who was convicted or adjudicated a   HB3663- 9 -LRB104 09546 JRC 19609 b1delinquent and subsequently served any part of a sentence of 2incarceration in a State prison, in a county jail, in a county 3juvenile detention facility, or in an Illinois Youth Center, 4on parole or probation, or registered as a sex offender 5imprisoned for one or more felonies by the State of Illinois 6which he or she did not commit may, under the conditions 7hereinafter provided, file a petition for certificate of 8innocence in the circuit court of the county in which the 9person was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent. The petition 10shall request a certificate of innocence finding that the 11petitioner was innocent of one or more all offenses for which 12he or she was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent 13incarcerated.14    (c) In order to present the claim for certificate of 15innocence of an unjust conviction or juvenile delinquency 16adjudication and imprisonment, the petitioner must attach to 17his or her petition documentation demonstrating that:18        (1) he or she has been convicted or adjudicated a 19    delinquent of one or more felonies by the State of 20    Illinois and subsequently sentenced to a term of 21    imprisonment, and has served all or any part of the 22    sentence; and23        (2) his or her judgment of conviction or delinquency 24    adjudication was reversed or vacated, and the charge 25    indictment or information dismissed or, if a new trial was 26    ordered, either he or she was found not guilty at the new   HB3663- 10 -LRB104 09546 JRC 19609 b1    trial or he or she was not retried and the charge 2    indictment or information dismissed; or the statute, or 3    application thereof, on which the charge indictment or 4    information was based violated the Constitution of the 5    United States or the State of Illinois; and6        (3) his or her claim is not time barred by the 7    provisions of subsection (i) of this Section.8    (d) The petition shall state facts in sufficient detail to 9permit the court to find that the petitioner is likely to 10succeed at trial in proving that the petitioner is innocent of 11the alleged offenses for which he or she was convicted or 12adjudicated a delinquent charged in the indictment or 13information or his or her acts or omissions charged in the 14indictment or information did not constitute a felony or 15misdemeanor against the State of Illinois, and the petitioner 16did not by his or her own conduct voluntarily cause or bring 17about his or her conviction or juvenile delinquency 18adjudication. The petition shall be verified by the 19petitioner.20    (e) A copy of the petition shall be served on the Attorney 21General and the State's Attorney of the county where the 22conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication was had. The 23Attorney General and the State's Attorney of the county where 24the conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication was had 25shall have the right to intervene as parties.26    (f) In any hearing seeking a certificate of innocence, the   HB3663- 11 -LRB104 09546 JRC 19609 b1court may take judicial notice of prior sworn testimony or 2evidence admitted in the criminal or juvenile delinquency 3proceedings related to the convictions or adjudications which 4resulted in the alleged wrongful incarceration, if the 5petitioner was either represented by counsel at such prior 6proceedings or the right to counsel was knowingly waived.7    (g) In order to obtain a certificate of innocence the 8petitioner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:9        (1) the petitioner was convicted or adjudicated a 10    delinquent of one or more felonies by the State of 11    Illinois and subsequently sentenced to a term of 12    imprisonment, and has served all or any part of the 13    sentence;14        (2)(A) the judgment of conviction or adjudication was 15    reversed or vacated, and the charge indictment or 16    information dismissed or, if a new trial was ordered, 17    either the petitioner was found not guilty at the new 18    trial or the petitioner was not retried and the charge 19    indictment or information dismissed; or (B) the statute, 20    or application thereof, on which the charge indictment or 21    information was based violated the Constitution of the 22    United States or the State of Illinois;23        (3) the petitioner is innocent of one or more of the 24    offenses for which he or she was convicted or adjudicated 25    a delinquent or his or her acts or omissions for which he 26    or she was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent charged   HB3663- 12 -LRB104 09546 JRC 19609 b1    in the indictment or information or his or her acts or 2    omissions charged in the indictment or information did not 3    constitute a felony or misdemeanor against the State; and4        (4) the petitioner did not by his or her own conduct 5    voluntarily cause or bring about his or her conviction or 6    juvenile delinquency adjudication.7    (h) If the court finds that the petitioner is entitled to a 8judgment, it shall enter a certificate of innocence finding 9that the petitioner was innocent of one or more all offenses 10for which he or she was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent. 11The court shall also make a determination, subject to proof by 12the claimant, of the reasonable attorney's fees, costs, and 13expenses incurred by the claimant in connection with obtaining 14the certificate of innocence under this Section incarcerated. 15Upon entry of the certificate of innocence or pardon from the 16Governor stating that such pardon was issued on the ground of 17innocence of the crime for which he or she was convicted or 18adjudicated a delinquent imprisoned, (1) the clerk of the 19court shall transmit a copy of the certificate of innocence to 20the clerk of the Court of Claims, together with the claimant's 21current address; and (2) the court shall enter an order 22expunging the record of arrest from the official records of 23the arresting authority and order that the records of the 24clerk of the circuit court and the Illinois State Police be 25sealed until further order of the court upon good cause shown 26or as otherwise provided herein, and the name of the defendant   HB3663- 13 -LRB104 09546 JRC 19609 b1or respondent in a juvenile delinquency proceeding obliterated 2from the official index requested to be kept by the circuit 3court clerk under Section 16 of the Clerks of Courts Act in 4connection with the arrest and conviction or delinquency 5adjudication for the offense but the order shall not affect 6any index issued by the circuit court clerk before the entry of 7the order.

The Code of Civil Procedure is amended by 2changing Section 2-702 as follows: 3    (735 ILCS 5/2-702)4    Sec. 2-702. Petition for a certificate of innocence that 5the petitioner was innocent of all offenses for which he or she 6was incarcerated.7    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that innocent 8persons who have been wrongly convicted or adjudicated 9delinquent of crimes in Illinois and subsequently imprisoned 10have been frustrated in seeking legal redress due to a variety 11of substantive and technical obstacles in the law and that 12such persons should have an available avenue to obtain a 13finding of innocence so that they may obtain relief through a 14petition in the Court of Claims. The General Assembly further 15finds misleading the current legal nomenclature which compels 16an innocent person to seek a pardon for being wrongfully 17incarcerated. It is the intent of the General Assembly that 18the court, in exercising its discretion as permitted by law 19regarding the weight and admissibility of evidence submitted 20pursuant to this Section, shall, in the interest of justice, 21give due consideration to difficulties of proof caused by the 22passage of time, the death or unavailability of witnesses, the 23destruction of evidence or other factors not caused by such 24persons or those acting on their behalf.25    (b) Any person who was convicted or adjudicated a   HB3663- 9 -LRB104 09546 JRC 19609 b1delinquent and subsequently served any part of a sentence of 2incarceration in a State prison, in a county jail, in a county 3juvenile detention facility, or in an Illinois Youth Center, 4on parole or probation, or registered as a sex offender 5imprisoned for one or more felonies by the State of Illinois 6which he or she did not commit may, under the conditions 7hereinafter provided, file a petition for certificate of 8innocence in the circuit court of the county in which the 9person was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent. The petition 10shall request a certificate of innocence finding that the 11petitioner was innocent of one or more all offenses for which 12he or she was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent 13incarcerated.14    (c) In order to present the claim for certificate of 15innocence of an unjust conviction or juvenile delinquency 16adjudication and imprisonment, the petitioner must attach to 17his or her petition documentation demonstrating that:18        (1) he or she has been convicted or adjudicated a 19    delinquent of one or more felonies by the State of 20    Illinois and subsequently sentenced to a term of 21    imprisonment, and has served all or any part of the 22    sentence; and23        (2) his or her judgment of conviction or delinquency 24    adjudication was reversed or vacated, and the charge 25    indictment or information dismissed or, if a new trial was 26    ordered, either he or she was found not guilty at the new   HB3663- 10 -LRB104 09546 JRC 19609 b1    trial or he or she was not retried and the charge 2    indictment or information dismissed; or the statute, or 3    application thereof, on which the charge indictment or 4    information was based violated the Constitution of the 5    United States or the State of Illinois; and6        (3) his or her claim is not time barred by the 7    provisions of subsection (i) of this Section.8    (d) The petition shall state facts in sufficient detail to 9permit the court to find that the petitioner is likely to 10succeed at trial in proving that the petitioner is innocent of 11the alleged offenses for which he or she was convicted or 12adjudicated a delinquent charged in the indictment or 13information or his or her acts or omissions charged in the 14indictment or information did not constitute a felony or 15misdemeanor against the State of Illinois, and the petitioner 16did not by his or her own conduct voluntarily cause or bring 17about his or her conviction or juvenile delinquency 18adjudication. The petition shall be verified by the 19petitioner.20    (e) A copy of the petition shall be served on the Attorney 21General and the State's Attorney of the county where the 22conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication was had. The 23Attorney General and the State's Attorney of the county where 24the conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication was had 25shall have the right to intervene as parties.26    (f) In any hearing seeking a certificate of innocence, the   HB3663- 11 -LRB104 09546 JRC 19609 b1court may take judicial notice of prior sworn testimony or 2evidence admitted in the criminal or juvenile delinquency 3proceedings related to the convictions or adjudications which 4resulted in the alleged wrongful incarceration, if the 5petitioner was either represented by counsel at such prior 6proceedings or the right to counsel was knowingly waived.7    (g) In order to obtain a certificate of innocence the 8petitioner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:9        (1) the petitioner was convicted or adjudicated a 10    delinquent of one or more felonies by the State of 11    Illinois and subsequently sentenced to a term of 12    imprisonment, and has served all or any part of the 13    sentence;14        (2)(A) the judgment of conviction or adjudication was 15    reversed or vacated, and the charge indictment or 16    information dismissed or, if a new trial was ordered, 17    either the petitioner was found not guilty at the new 18    trial or the petitioner was not retried and the charge 19    indictment or information dismissed; or (B) the statute, 20    or application thereof, on which the charge indictment or 21    information was based violated the Constitution of the 22    United States or the State of Illinois;23        (3) the petitioner is innocent of one or more of the 24    offenses for which he or she was convicted or adjudicated 25    a delinquent or his or her acts or omissions for which he 26    or she was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent charged   HB3663- 12 -LRB104 09546 JRC 19609 b1    in the indictment or information or his or her acts or 2    omissions charged in the indictment or information did not 3    constitute a felony or misdemeanor against the State; and4        (4) the petitioner did not by his or her own conduct 5    voluntarily cause or bring about his or her conviction or 6    juvenile delinquency adjudication.7    (h) If the court finds that the petitioner is entitled to a 8judgment, it shall enter a certificate of innocence finding 9that the petitioner was innocent of one or more all offenses 10for which he or she was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent. 11The court shall also make a determination, subject to proof by 12the claimant, of the reasonable attorney's fees, costs, and 13expenses incurred by the claimant in connection with obtaining 14the certificate of innocence under this Section incarcerated. 15Upon entry of the certificate of innocence or pardon from the 16Governor stating that such pardon was issued on the ground of 17innocence of the crime for which he or she was convicted or 18adjudicated a delinquent imprisoned, (1) the clerk of the 19court shall transmit a copy of the certificate of innocence to 20the clerk of the Court of Claims, together with the claimant's 21current address; and (2) the court shall enter an order 22expunging the record of arrest from the official records of 23the arresting authority and order that the records of the 24clerk of the circuit court and the Illinois State Police be 25sealed until further order of the court upon good cause shown 26or as otherwise provided herein, and the name of the defendant   HB3663- 13 -LRB104 09546 JRC 19609 b1or respondent in a juvenile delinquency proceeding obliterated 2from the official index requested to be kept by the circuit 3court clerk under Section 16 of the Clerks of Courts Act in 4connection with the arrest and conviction or delinquency 5adjudication for the offense but the order shall not affect 6any index issued by the circuit court clerk before the entry of 7the order.

Upon 15conviction for any subsequent offense, the Department of 16Corrections shall have access to all sealed records of the 17Department pertaining to that individual. 18    Upon entry of the order of expungement, the clerk of the 19circuit court shall promptly mail a copy of the order to the 20person whose records were expunged and sealed. The clerk shall 21post in the common areas of the courthouse a notice containing 22information about grants for exonerated persons and their 23dependents under Section 62 of the Higher Education Student 24Assistance Act, including the Internet address of the Illinois 25Student Assistance Commission.
