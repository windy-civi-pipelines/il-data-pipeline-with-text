It is the intent of the General Assembly that 16the court, in exercising its discretion as permitted by law 17regarding the weight and admissibility of evidence submitted 18pursuant to this Section, shall, in the interest of justice, 19give due consideration to difficulties of proof caused by the 20passage of time, the death or unavailability of witnesses, the 21destruction of evidence or other factors not caused by such 22persons or those acting on their behalf.23    (b) Any person who was convicted or adjudicated a 24delinquent and subsequently served any part of a sentence of 25incarceration in a State prison, in a county jail, in a county   10400HB3663sam001- 10 -LRB104 09546 JRC 26046 a1juvenile detention facility, or in an Illinois Youth Center, 2on parole or probation, or registered as a sex offender 3imprisoned for one or more felonies by the State of Illinois 4which he or she did not commit may, under the conditions 5hereinafter provided, file a petition for certificate of 6innocence in the circuit court of the county in which the 7person was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent.

Petition for a certificate of innocence that 3the petitioner was innocent of all offenses for which he or she 4was incarcerated.5    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that innocent 6persons who have been wrongly convicted or adjudicated 7delinquent of crimes in Illinois and subsequently imprisoned 8have been frustrated in seeking legal redress due to a variety 9of substantive and technical obstacles in the law and that 10such persons should have an available avenue to obtain a 11finding of innocence so that they may obtain relief through a 12petition in the Court of Claims. The General Assembly further 13finds misleading the current legal nomenclature which compels 14an innocent person to seek a pardon for being wrongfully 15incarcerated. It is the intent of the General Assembly that 16the court, in exercising its discretion as permitted by law 17regarding the weight and admissibility of evidence submitted 18pursuant to this Section, shall, in the interest of justice, 19give due consideration to difficulties of proof caused by the 20passage of time, the death or unavailability of witnesses, the 21destruction of evidence or other factors not caused by such 22persons or those acting on their behalf.23    (b) Any person who was convicted or adjudicated a 24delinquent and subsequently served any part of a sentence of 25incarceration in a State prison, in a county jail, in a county   10400HB3663sam001- 10 -LRB104 09546 JRC 26046 a1juvenile detention facility, or in an Illinois Youth Center, 2on parole or probation, or registered as a sex offender 3imprisoned for one or more felonies by the State of Illinois 4which he or she did not commit may, under the conditions 5hereinafter provided, file a petition for certificate of 6innocence in the circuit court of the county in which the 7person was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent. The petition 8shall request a certificate of innocence finding that the 9petitioner was innocent of one or more all offenses for which 10he or she was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent 11incarcerated.12    (c) In order to present the claim for certificate of 13innocence of an unjust conviction or juvenile delinquency 14adjudication and imprisonment, the petitioner must attach to 15his or her petition documentation demonstrating that:16        (1) he or she has been convicted or adjudicated a 17    delinquent of one or more felonies by the State of 18    Illinois and subsequently sentenced to a term of 19    imprisonment, and has served all or any part of the 20    sentence; and21        (2) his or her judgment of conviction or delinquency 22    adjudication was reversed or vacated, and the charge 23    indictment or information dismissed or, if a new trial was 24    ordered, either he or she was found not guilty at the new 25    trial or he or she was not retried and the charge 26    indictment or information dismissed; or the statute, or   10400HB3663sam001- 11 -LRB104 09546 JRC 26046 a1    application thereof, on which the charge indictment or 2    information was based violated the Constitution of the 3    United States or the State of Illinois; and4        (3) his or her claim is not time barred by the 5    provisions of subsection (i) of this Section.6    (d) The petition shall state facts in sufficient detail to 7permit the court to find that the petitioner is likely to 8succeed at trial in proving that the petitioner is innocent of 9the alleged offenses for which he or she was convicted or 10adjudicated a delinquent charged in the indictment or 11information or his or her acts or omissions charged in the 12indictment or information did not constitute a felony or 13misdemeanor against the State of Illinois, and the petitioner 14did not by his or her own conduct voluntarily cause or bring 15about his or her conviction or juvenile delinquency 16adjudication. The petition shall be verified by the 17petitioner.18    (e) A copy of the petition shall be served on the Attorney 19General and the State's Attorney of the county where the 20conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication was had. The 21Attorney General and the State's Attorney of the county where 22the conviction or juvenile delinquency adjudication was had 23shall have the right to intervene as parties.24    (f) In any hearing seeking a certificate of innocence, the 25court may take judicial notice of prior sworn testimony or 26evidence admitted in the criminal or juvenile delinquency   10400HB3663sam001- 12 -LRB104 09546 JRC 26046 a1proceedings related to the convictions or adjudications which 2resulted in the alleged wrongful incarceration, if the 3petitioner was either represented by counsel at such prior 4proceedings or the right to counsel was knowingly waived.5    (g) In order to obtain a certificate of innocence the 6petitioner must prove by a preponderance of evidence that:7        (1) the petitioner was convicted or adjudicated a 8    delinquent of one or more felonies by the State of 9    Illinois and subsequently sentenced to a term of 10    imprisonment, and has served all or any part of the 11    sentence;12        (2)(A) the judgment of conviction or adjudication was 13    reversed or vacated, and the charge indictment or 14    information dismissed or, if a new trial was ordered, 15    either the petitioner was found not guilty at the new 16    trial or the petitioner was not retried and the charge 17    indictment or information dismissed; or (B) the statute, 18    or application thereof, on which the charge indictment or 19    information was based violated the Constitution of the 20    United States or the State of Illinois;21        (3) the petitioner is innocent of one or more of the 22    offenses for which he or she was convicted or adjudicated 23    a delinquent or his or her acts or omissions for which he 24    or she was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent charged 25    in the indictment or information or his or her acts or 26    omissions charged in the indictment or information did not   10400HB3663sam001- 13 -LRB104 09546 JRC 26046 a1    constitute a felony or misdemeanor against the State; and2        (4) the petitioner did not by his or her own conduct 3    voluntarily cause or bring about his or her conviction or 4    juvenile delinquency adjudication.5    (h) If the court finds that the petitioner is entitled to a 6judgment, it shall enter a certificate of innocence finding 7that the petitioner was innocent of one or more all offenses 8for which he or she was convicted or adjudicated a delinquent 9incarcerated. Upon entry of the certificate of innocence or 10pardon from the Governor stating that such pardon was issued 11on the ground of innocence of the crime for which he or she was 12convicted or adjudicated a delinquent imprisoned, (1) the 13clerk of the court shall transmit a copy of the certificate of 14innocence to the clerk of the Court of Claims, together with 15the claimant's current address; and (2) the court shall enter 16an order expunging the record of arrest from the official 17records of the arresting authority and order that the records 18of the clerk of the circuit court and the Illinois State Police 19be sealed until further order of the court upon good cause 20shown or as otherwise provided herein, and the name of the 21defendant or respondent in a juvenile delinquency proceeding 22obliterated from the official index requested to be kept by 23the circuit court clerk under Section 16 of the Clerks of 24Courts Act in connection with the arrest and conviction or 25delinquency adjudication for the offense but the order shall 26not affect any index issued by the circuit court clerk before   10400HB3663sam001- 14 -LRB104 09546 JRC 26046 a1the entry of the order.
