A 4community college district may combine its negotiations with 5multiple school districts to establish one multi-district 6partnership agreement or may negotiate individual partnership 7agreements at its discretion.8(Source: P.A. 102-516, eff. 8-20-21; 102-1077, eff. 1-1-23.) 9    (110 ILCS 27/16.10 new)10    Sec. 16.10. Partnership agreement negotiations with 11liaison. Prior to offering dual credit coursework with any 12postsecondary institution other than a community college, a 13school district shall first negotiate with the designated 14liaison of the school district's local community college 15district to seek a partnership agreement with the community 16college district as provided in Section 16. After mutually 17agreeing that a partnership with the community college 18district is not feasible, the school district may enter into a 19partnership agreement with an alternative postsecondary 20institution that addresses each item listed in subsection (b) 21of Section 16. 22    (110 ILCS 27/17)23    Sec. 17. Out-of-state dual credit contracts.
