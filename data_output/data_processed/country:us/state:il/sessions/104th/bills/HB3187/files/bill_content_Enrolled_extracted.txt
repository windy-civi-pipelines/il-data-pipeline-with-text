The aid shall be sufficient, when added to all other 17income, money contributions and support to provide the family 18with a grant in the amount established by Department 19regulation. 20    (a-5) For the purposes of this subsection, TANF grant 21amounts shall consist of the following portions: 22        (1) 75% shall be designated for the child or children 23    of the assistance unit; and 24        (2) 25% shall be designated for the adult member or   HB3187 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 11399 HLH 21487 b1    members of the assistance unit. 2    (b) The Illinois Department may conduct special projects, 3which may be known as Grant Diversion Projects, under which 4recipients of financial aid under this Article are placed in 5jobs and their grants are diverted to the employer who in turn 6makes payments to the recipients in the form of salary or other 7employment benefits. The Illinois Department shall by rule 8specify the terms and conditions of such Grant Diversion 9Projects. Such projects shall take into consideration and be 10coordinated with the programs administered under the Illinois 11Emergency Employment Development Act.12    (c) The amount and nature of the financial aid for a child 13requiring care outside his own home shall be determined in 14accordance with the rules and regulations of the Illinois 15Department, with due regard to the needs and requirements of 16the child in the foster home or institution in which he has 17been placed.18    (d) If the Department establishes grants for family units 19consisting exclusively of a pregnant woman with no dependent 20child or including her husband if living with her, the grant 21amount for such a unit shall be equal to the grant amount for 22an assistance unit consisting of one adult, or 2 persons if the 23husband is included. Other than as herein described, an unborn 24child shall not be counted in determining the size of an 25assistance unit or for calculating grants.26    Payments for basic maintenance requirements of a child or   HB3187 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 11399 HLH 21487 b1children and the relative with whom the child or children are 2living shall be prescribed, by rule, by the Illinois 3Department.4    Grants under this Article shall not be supplemented by 5General Assistance provided under Article VI.6    (e) Grants shall be paid to the parent or other person with 7whom the child or children are living, except for such amount 8as is paid in behalf of the child or his parent or other 9relative to other persons or agencies pursuant to this Code or 10the rules and regulations of the Illinois Department.11    (f) Subject to subsection (f-5), an assistance unit, 12receiving financial aid under this Article or temporarily 13ineligible to receive aid under this Article under a penalty 14imposed by the Illinois Department for failure to comply with 15the eligibility requirements or that voluntarily requests 16termination of financial assistance under this Article and 17becomes subsequently eligible for assistance within 9 months, 18shall not receive any increase in the amount of aid solely on 19account of the birth of a child; except that an increase is not 20prohibited when the birth is (i) of a child of a pregnant woman 21who became eligible for aid under this Article during the 22pregnancy, or (ii) of a child born within 10 months after the 23date of implementation of this subsection, or (iii) of a child 24conceived after a family became ineligible for assistance due 25to income or marriage and at least 3 months of ineligibility 26expired before any reapplication for assistance. This   HB3187 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 11399 HLH 21487 b1subsection does not, however, prevent a unit from receiving a 2general increase in the amount of aid that is provided to all 3recipients of aid under this Article.4    The Illinois Department is authorized to transfer funds, 5and shall use any budgetary savings attributable to not 6increasing the grants due to the births of additional 7children, to supplement existing funding for employment and 8training services for recipients of aid under this Article IV. 9The Illinois Department shall target, to the extent the 10supplemental funding allows, employment and training services 11to the families who do not receive a grant increase after the 12birth of a child. In addition, the Illinois Department shall 13provide, to the extent the supplemental funding allows, such 14families with up to 24 months of transitional child care 15pursuant to Illinois Department rules. All remaining 16supplemental funds shall be used for employment and training 17services or transitional child care support.18    In making the transfers authorized by this subsection, the 19Illinois Department shall first determine, pursuant to 20regulations adopted by the Illinois Department for this 21purpose, the amount of savings attributable to not increasing 22the grants due to the births of additional children. Transfers 23may be made from General Revenue Fund appropriations for 24distributive purposes authorized by Article IV of this Code 25only to General Revenue Fund appropriations for employability 26development services including operating and administrative   HB3187 Enrolled- 19 -LRB104 11399 HLH 21487 b1costs and related distributive purposes under Article IXA of 2this Code. The Director, with the approval of the Governor, 3shall certify the amount and affected line item appropriations 4to the State Comptroller.5    Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit 6the Illinois Department from using funds under this Article IV 7to provide assistance in the form of vouchers that may be used 8to pay for goods and services deemed by the Illinois 9Department, by rule, as suitable for the care of the child such 10as diapers, clothing, school supplies, and cribs.11    (f-5) Subsection (f) shall not apply to affect the monthly 12assistance amount of any family as a result of the birth of a 13child on or after January 1, 2004. As resources permit after 14January 1, 2004, the Department may cease applying subsection 15(f) to limit assistance to families receiving assistance under 16this Article on January 1, 2004, with respect to children born 17prior to that date. In any event, subsection (f) shall be 18completely inoperative on and after July 1, 2007.19    (g) (Blank).20    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the 21Illinois Department is authorized to reduce payment levels 22used to determine cash grants under this Article after 23December 31 of any fiscal year if the Illinois Department 24determines that the caseload upon which the appropriations for 25the current fiscal year are based have increased by more than 265% and the appropriation is not sufficient to ensure that cash   HB3187 Enrolled- 20 -LRB104 11399 HLH 21487 b1benefits under this Article do not exceed the amounts 2appropriated for those cash benefits. Reductions in payment 3levels may be accomplished by emergency rule under Section 45-45 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, except that 5the limitation on the number of emergency rules that may be 6adopted in a 24-month period shall not apply and the 7provisions of Sections 5-115 and 5-125 of the Illinois 8Administrative Procedure Act shall not apply. Increases in 9payment levels shall be accomplished only in accordance with 10Section 5-40 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act. 11Before any rule to increase payment levels promulgated under 12this Section shall become effective, a joint resolution 13approving the rule must be adopted by a roll call vote by a 14majority of the members elected to each chamber of the General 15Assembly.16(Source: P.A. 101-103, eff. 7-19-19.) 17    (305 ILCS 5/6-2)  (from Ch. 23, par. 6-2)18    Sec. 6-2. Amount of aid. The amount and nature of General 19Assistance for basic maintenance requirements shall be 20determined in accordance with local budget standards for local 21governmental units which do not receive State funds. For local 22governmental units which do receive State funds, the amount 23and nature of General Assistance for basic maintenance 24requirements shall be determined in accordance with the 25standards, rules and regulations of the Illinois Department.   HB3187 Enrolled- 21 -LRB104 11399 HLH 21487 b1However, the amount and nature of any financial aid is not 2affected by the payment of any grant under the Senior Citizens 3and Persons with Disabilities Property Tax Relief Act, any 4rebate authorized under Section 2201(a) of the Coronavirus 5Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (Public Law 116-136) or 6under any other federal economic stimulus program created in 7response to the COVID-19 emergency, or any distributions or 8items of income described under subparagraph (X) of paragraph 9(2) of subsection (a) of Section 203 of the Illinois Income Tax 10Act. Due regard shall be given to the requirements and the 11conditions existing in each case, and to the income, money 12contributions and other support and resources available, from 13whatever source. In local governmental units which do not 14receive State funds, the grant shall be sufficient when added 15to all other income, money contributions and support in excess 16of any excluded income or resources, to provide the person 17with a grant in the amount established for such a person by the 18local governmental unit based upon standards meeting basic 19maintenance requirements. In local governmental units which do 20receive State funds, the grant shall be sufficient when added 21to all other income, money contributions and support in excess 22of any excluded income or resources, to provide the person 23with a grant in the amount established for such a person by 24Department regulation based upon standards providing a 25livelihood compatible with health and well-being, as directed 26by Section 12-4.11 of this Code.  HB3187 Enrolled- 22 -LRB104 11399 HLH 21487 b1    The Illinois Department may conduct special projects, 2which may be known as Grant Diversion Projects, under which 3recipients of financial aid under this Article are placed in 4jobs and their grants are diverted to the employer who in turn 5makes payments to the recipients in the form of salary or other 6employment benefits. The Illinois Department shall by rule 7specify the terms and conditions of such Grant Diversion 8Projects. Such projects shall take into consideration and be 9coordinated with the programs administered under the Illinois 10Emergency Employment Development Act.11    The allowances provided under Article IX for recipients 12participating in the training and rehabilitation programs 13shall be in addition to such maximum payment.14    Payments may also be made to provide persons receiving 15basic maintenance support with necessary treatment, care and 16supplies required because of illness or disability or with 17acute medical treatment, care, and supplies. Payments for 18necessary or acute medical care under this paragraph may be 19made to or in behalf of the person. Obligations incurred for 20such services but not paid for at the time of a recipient's 21death may be paid, subject to the rules and regulations of the 22Illinois Department, after the death of the recipient.23(Source: P.A. 101-632, eff. 6-5-20.) 24    Section 30. The Good Samaritan Energy Plan Act is amended 25by changing Section 30 and by adding Section 95 as follows:   HB3187 Enrolled- 23 -LRB104 11399 HLH 21487 b1    (305 ILCS 22/30)2    Sec. 30.
