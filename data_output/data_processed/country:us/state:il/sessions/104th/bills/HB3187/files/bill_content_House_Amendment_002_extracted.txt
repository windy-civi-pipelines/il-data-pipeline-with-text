Amount of aid. 13    (a) The amount and nature of financial aid shall be 14determined in accordance with the grant amounts, rules and 15regulations of the Illinois Department. Due regard shall be 16given to the self-sufficiency requirements of the family and 17to the income, money contributions and other support and 18resources available, from whatever source. However, the amount 19and nature of any financial aid is not affected by the payment 20of any grant under the "Senior Citizens and Persons with 21Disabilities Property Tax Relief Act" or any distributions or 22items of income described under subparagraph (X) of paragraph 23(2) of subsection (a) of Section 203 of the Illinois Income Tax 24Act. The aid shall be sufficient, when added to all other   10400HB3187ham002- 16 -LRB104 11399 HLH 24524 a1income, money contributions and support to provide the family 2with a grant in the amount established by Department 3regulation. 4    (a-5) For the purposes of this subsection, TANF grant 5amounts shall consist of the following portions: 6        (1) 75% shall be designated for the child or children 7    of the assistance unit; and 8        (2) 25% shall be designated for the adult member or 9    members of the assistance unit. 10    (b) The Illinois Department may conduct special projects, 11which may be known as Grant Diversion Projects, under which 12recipients of financial aid under this Article are placed in 13jobs and their grants are diverted to the employer who in turn 14makes payments to the recipients in the form of salary or other 15employment benefits. The Illinois Department shall by rule 16specify the terms and conditions of such Grant Diversion 17Projects. Such projects shall take into consideration and be 18coordinated with the programs administered under the Illinois 19Emergency Employment Development Act.20    (c) The amount and nature of the financial aid for a child 21requiring care outside his own home shall be determined in 22accordance with the rules and regulations of the Illinois 23Department, with due regard to the needs and requirements of 24the child in the foster home or institution in which he has 25been placed.26    (d) If the Department establishes grants for family units   10400HB3187ham002- 17 -LRB104 11399 HLH 24524 a1consisting exclusively of a pregnant woman with no dependent 2child or including her husband if living with her, the grant 3amount for such a unit shall be equal to the grant amount for 4an assistance unit consisting of one adult, or 2 persons if the 5husband is included. Other than as herein described, an unborn 6child shall not be counted in determining the size of an 7assistance unit or for calculating grants.8    Payments for basic maintenance requirements of a child or 9children and the relative with whom the child or children are 10living shall be prescribed, by rule, by the Illinois 11Department.12    Grants under this Article shall not be supplemented by 13General Assistance provided under Article VI.14    (e) Grants shall be paid to the parent or other person with 15whom the child or children are living, except for such amount 16as is paid in behalf of the child or his parent or other 17relative to other persons or agencies pursuant to this Code or 18the rules and regulations of the Illinois Department.19    (f) Subject to subsection (f-5), an assistance unit, 20receiving financial aid under this Article or temporarily 21ineligible to receive aid under this Article under a penalty 22imposed by the Illinois Department for failure to comply with 23the eligibility requirements or that voluntarily requests 24termination of financial assistance under this Article and 25becomes subsequently eligible for assistance within 9 months, 26shall not receive any increase in the amount of aid solely on   10400HB3187ham002- 18 -LRB104 11399 HLH 24524 a1account of the birth of a child; except that an increase is not 2prohibited when the birth is (i) of a child of a pregnant woman 3who became eligible for aid under this Article during the 4pregnancy, or (ii) of a child born within 10 months after the 5date of implementation of this subsection, or (iii) of a child 6conceived after a family became ineligible for assistance due 7to income or marriage and at least 3 months of ineligibility 8expired before any reapplication for assistance. This 9subsection does not, however, prevent a unit from receiving a 10general increase in the amount of aid that is provided to all 11recipients of aid under this Article.12    The Illinois Department is authorized to transfer funds, 13and shall use any budgetary savings attributable to not 14increasing the grants due to the births of additional 15children, to supplement existing funding for employment and 16training services for recipients of aid under this Article IV. 17The Illinois Department shall target, to the extent the 18supplemental funding allows, employment and training services 19to the families who do not receive a grant increase after the 20birth of a child. In addition, the Illinois Department shall 21provide, to the extent the supplemental funding allows, such 22families with up to 24 months of transitional child care 23pursuant to Illinois Department rules. All remaining 24supplemental funds shall be used for employment and training 25services or transitional child care support.26    In making the transfers authorized by this subsection, the   10400HB3187ham002- 19 -LRB104 11399 HLH 24524 a1Illinois Department shall first determine, pursuant to 2regulations adopted by the Illinois Department for this 3purpose, the amount of savings attributable to not increasing 4the grants due to the births of additional children. Transfers 5may be made from General Revenue Fund appropriations for 6distributive purposes authorized by Article IV of this Code 7only to General Revenue Fund appropriations for employability 8development services including operating and administrative 9costs and related distributive purposes under Article IXA of 10this Code. The Director, with the approval of the Governor, 11shall certify the amount and affected line item appropriations 12to the State Comptroller.13    Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit 14the Illinois Department from using funds under this Article IV 15to provide assistance in the form of vouchers that may be used 16to pay for goods and services deemed by the Illinois 17Department, by rule, as suitable for the care of the child such 18as diapers, clothing, school supplies, and cribs.19    (f-5) Subsection (f) shall not apply to affect the monthly 20assistance amount of any family as a result of the birth of a 21child on or after January 1, 2004. As resources permit after 22January 1, 2004, the Department may cease applying subsection 23(f) to limit assistance to families receiving assistance under 24this Article on January 1, 2004, with respect to children born 25prior to that date. In any event, subsection (f) shall be 26completely inoperative on and after July 1, 2007.  10400HB3187ham002- 20 -LRB104 11399 HLH 24524 a1    (g) (Blank).2    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the 3Illinois Department is authorized to reduce payment levels 4used to determine cash grants under this Article after 5December 31 of any fiscal year if the Illinois Department 6determines that the caseload upon which the appropriations for 7the current fiscal year are based have increased by more than 85% and the appropriation is not sufficient to ensure that cash 9benefits under this Article do not exceed the amounts 10appropriated for those cash benefits. Reductions in payment 11levels may be accomplished by emergency rule under Section 125-45 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, except that 13the limitation on the number of emergency rules that may be 14adopted in a 24-month period shall not apply and the 15provisions of Sections 5-115 and 5-125 of the Illinois 16Administrative Procedure Act shall not apply. Increases in 17payment levels shall be accomplished only in accordance with 18Section 5-40 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act. 19Before any rule to increase payment levels promulgated under 20this Section shall become effective, a joint resolution 21approving the rule must be adopted by a roll call vote by a 22majority of the members elected to each chamber of the General 23Assembly.24(Source: P.A. 101-103, eff. 7-19-19.) 25    (305 ILCS 5/6-2)  (from Ch. 23, par. 6-2)  10400HB3187ham002- 21 -LRB104 11399 HLH 24524 a1    Sec. 6-2.

Due regard shall be given to the requirements and the 19conditions existing in each case, and to the income, money 20contributions and other support and resources available, from 21whatever source.
