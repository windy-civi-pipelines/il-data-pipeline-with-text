The injunction order shall remain 24in effect until vacated by the court or until the proceeding is 25terminated, whichever first occurs.26    (g) If it appears that any property, chose in action,   SB1738- 36 -LRB104 08986 JRC 19042 b1credit or effect discovered, or any interest therein, is 2claimed by any person, the court shall, as in garnishment 3proceedings, permit or require the claimant to appear and 4maintain his or her right. The rights of the person cited and 5the rights of any adverse claimant shall be asserted and 6determined pursuant to the law relating to garnishment 7proceedings.8    (h) Costs in proceedings authorized by this Section shall 9be allowed, assessed and paid in accordance with rules, 10provided that if the court determines, in its discretion, that 11costs incurred by the judgment creditor were improperly 12incurred, those costs shall be paid by the judgment creditor.13    (i) This Section is in addition to and does not affect 14enforcement of judgments or citation proceedings thereto, by 15any other methods now or hereafter provided by law.16    (j) This Section does not grant the power to any court to 17order installment or other payments from, or compel the sale, 18delivery, surrender, assignment or conveyance of any property 19exempt by statute from the enforcement of a judgment thereon, 20a deduction order, garnishment, attachment, sequestration, 21process or other levy or seizure.22    (k) (Blank).23    (k-3) The court may enter any order upon or judgment 24against the respondent cited that could be entered in any 25garnishment proceeding under Part 7 of Article XII of this 26Code. This subsection (k-3) shall be construed as being   SB1738- 37 -LRB104 08986 JRC 19042 b1declarative of existing law and not as a new enactment.2    (k-5) If the court determines that any property held by a 3third party respondent is wages pursuant to Section 12-801, 4the court shall proceed as if a wage deduction proceeding had 5been filed and proceed to enter such necessary and proper 6orders as would have been entered in a wage deduction 7proceeding including but not limited to the granting of the 8statutory exemptions allowed by Section 12-803 and all other 9remedies allowed plaintiff and defendant pursuant to Part 8 of 10Article 12 of this Act. 11    (k-10) If a creditor discovers personal property of the 12judgment debtor that is subject to the lien of a citation to 13discover assets, the creditor may have the court impress a 14lien against a specific item of personal property, including a 15beneficial interest in a land trust. The lien survives the 16termination of the citation proceedings and remains as a lien 17against the personal property in the same manner that a 18judgment lien recorded against real property pursuant to 19Section 12-101 remains a lien on real property. If the 20judgment is revived before dormancy, the lien shall remain. A 21lien against personal property may, but need not, be recorded 22in the office of the recorder or filed as an informational 23filing pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code. 24    (l) At any citation hearing at which the judgment debtor 25appears and seeks a declaration that certain of his or her 26income or assets are exempt, the court shall proceed to   SB1738- 38 -LRB104 08986 JRC 19042 b1determine whether the property which the judgment debtor 2declares to be exempt is exempt from judgment. At any time 3before the return date specified on the citation, the judgment 4debtor may request, in writing, a hearing to declare exempt 5certain income and assets by notifying the clerk of the court 6before that time, using forms as may be provided by the clerk 7of the court. The clerk of the court will obtain a prompt 8hearing date from the court and will provide the necessary 9forms that must be prepared by the judgment debtor or the 10attorney for the judgment debtor and sent to the judgment 11creditor, or the judgment creditor's attorney, regarding the 12time and location of the hearing. This notice may be sent by 13regular first class mail. At the hearing, the court shall 14immediately, unless for good cause shown that the hearing is 15to be continued, shall proceed to determine whether the 16property which the judgment debtor declares to be exempt is 17exempt from judgment. The restraining provisions of subsection 18(f) shall not apply to any property determined by the court to 19be exempt.20    (m) The judgment or balance due on the judgment becomes a 21lien when a citation is served in accordance with subsection 22(a) of this Section, subject to subsection (c) of Section 2312-1001.1. The lien binds nonexempt personal property, 24including money, choses in action, and effects of the judgment 25debtor as follows:26        (1) When the citation is directed against the judgment   SB1738- 39 -LRB104 08986 JRC 19042 b1    debtor, upon all personal property belonging to the 2    judgment debtor in the possession or control of the 3    judgment debtor or which may thereafter be acquired or 4    come due to the judgment debtor to the time of the 5    disposition of the citation.6        (2) When the citation is directed against a third 7    party, upon all personal property belonging to the 8    judgment debtor in the possession or control of the third 9    party or which thereafter may be acquired or come due the 10    judgment debtor and comes into the possession or control 11    of the third party to the time of the disposition of the 12    citation.13    The lien established under this Section does not affect 14the rights of citation respondents in property prior to the 15service of the citation upon them and does not affect the 16rights of bona fide purchasers or lenders without notice of 17the citation. The rights of citation respondents in property 18belonging to the judgment debtor in the possession or control 19of the citation respondent are not affected, impaired, or 20abridged by the automatic exemption defined in Section 2112-1001.1. The lien is effective for the period specified by 22Supreme Court Rule.23    This subsection (m), as added by Public Act 88-48, is a 24declaration of existing law.25    (n) If any provision of this Act or its application to any 26person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity of that   SB1738- 40 -LRB104 08986 JRC 19042 b1provision or application does not affect the provisions or 2applications of the Act that can be given effect without the 3invalid provision or application.4    (o) The changes to this Section made by this amendatory 5Act of the 97th General Assembly apply only to citation 6proceedings commenced under this Section on or after the 7effective date of this amendatory Act of the 97th General 8Assembly. The requirements or limitations set forth in 9subsections (b-1), (b-5), (b-10), (c-5), and (d-5) do not 10apply to the enforcement of any order or judgment resulting 11from an adjudication of a municipal ordinance violation that 12is subject to Supreme Court Rules 570 through 579, or from an 13administrative adjudication of such an ordinance violation. 14(Source: P.A. 101-191, eff. 8-2-19.) 15    (735 ILCS 5/2-1402.1 new)16    Sec. 2-1402.1.

The court may modify an order for 11    installment payments, from time to time, upon application 12    of either party upon notice to the other.13        (3) Compel any person cited, other than the judgment 14    debtor, to deliver up any assets so discovered, to be 15    applied in satisfaction of the judgment, in whole or in 16    part, when those assets are held under such circumstances 17    that in an action by the judgment debtor he or she could 18    recover them in specie or obtain a judgment for the 19    proceeds or value thereof as for conversion or 20    embezzlement. A judgment creditor may recover a corporate 21    judgment debtor's property on behalf of the judgment 22    debtor for use of the judgment creditor by filing an 23    appropriate petition within the citation proceedings. 24        (4) Enter any order upon or judgment against the 25    person cited that could be entered in any garnishment 26    proceeding.  SB1738- 33 -LRB104 08986 JRC 19042 b1        (5) Compel any person cited to execute an assignment 2    of any chose in action or a conveyance of title to real or 3    personal property or resign memberships in exchanges, 4    clubs, or other entities in the same manner and to the same 5    extent as a court could do in any proceeding by a judgment 6    creditor to enforce payment of a judgment or in aid of the 7    enforcement of a judgment.8        (6) Authorize the judgment creditor to maintain an 9    action against any person or corporation that, it appears 10    upon proof satisfactory to the court, is indebted to the 11    judgment debtor, for the recovery of the debt, forbid the 12    transfer or other disposition of the debt until an action 13    can be commenced and prosecuted to judgment, direct that 14    the papers or proof in the possession or control of the 15    debtor and necessary in the prosecution of the action be 16    delivered to the creditor or impounded in court, and 17    provide for the disposition of any moneys in excess of the 18    sum required to pay the judgment creditor's judgment and 19    costs allowed by the court.20    (c-5) If a citation is directed to a judgment debtor who is 21a natural person, no payment order shall be entered under 22subsection (c) unless the Income and Asset Form was served 23upon the judgment debtor as required by subsection (b-1), the 24judgment debtor has had an opportunity to assert exemptions, 25and the payments are from non-exempt sources. 26    (d) No order or judgment shall be entered under subsection   SB1738- 34 -LRB104 08986 JRC 19042 b1(c) in favor of the judgment creditor unless there appears of 2record a certification of mailing showing that a copy of the 3citation and a copy of the citation notice was mailed to the 4judgment debtor as required by subsection (b).5    (d-5) If upon examination the court determines that the 6judgment debtor does not possess any non-exempt income or 7assets, then the citation shall be dismissed. 8    (e) All property ordered to be delivered up shall, except 9as otherwise provided in this Section, be delivered to the 10sheriff to be collected by the sheriff or sold at public sale 11and the proceeds thereof applied towards the payment of costs 12and the satisfaction of the judgment. If the judgment debtor's 13property is of such a nature that it is not readily delivered 14up to the sheriff for public sale or if another method of sale 15is more appropriate to liquidate the property or enhance its 16value at sale, the court may order the sale of such property by 17the debtor, third party respondent, or by a selling agent 18other than the sheriff upon such terms as are just and 19equitable. The proceeds of sale, after deducting reasonable 20and necessary expenses, are to be turned over to the creditor 21and applied to the balance due on the judgment. 22    (f)(1) The citation may prohibit the party to whom it is 23directed from making or allowing any transfer or other 24disposition of, or interfering with, any property not exempt 25from the enforcement of a judgment therefrom, a deduction 26order or garnishment, belonging to the judgment debtor or to   SB1738- 35 -LRB104 08986 JRC 19042 b1which he or she may be entitled or which may thereafter be 2acquired by or become due to him or her, and from paying over 3or otherwise disposing of any moneys not so exempt which are 4due or to become due to the judgment debtor, until the further 5order of the court or the termination of the proceeding, 6whichever occurs first. The third party may not be obliged to 7withhold the payment of any moneys beyond double the amount of 8the balance due sought to be enforced by the judgment 9creditor, subject to Section 12-1001.(d). The court may punish 10any party who violates the restraining provision of a citation 11as and for a contempt, or if the party is a third party may 12enter judgment against him or her in the amount of the unpaid 13portion of the judgment and costs allowable under this 14Section, or in the amount of the value of the property 15transferred, whichever is lesser. 16    (2) The court may enjoin any person, whether or not a party 17to the citation proceeding, from making or allowing any 18transfer or other disposition of, or interference with, the 19property of the judgment debtor not exempt from the 20enforcement of a judgment, a deduction order or garnishment, 21or the property or debt not so exempt concerning which any 22person is required to attend and be examined until further 23direction in the premises. The injunction order shall remain 24in effect until vacated by the court or until the proceeding is 25terminated, whichever first occurs.26    (g) If it appears that any property, chose in action,   SB1738- 36 -LRB104 08986 JRC 19042 b1credit or effect discovered, or any interest therein, is 2claimed by any person, the court shall, as in garnishment 3proceedings, permit or require the claimant to appear and 4maintain his or her right. The rights of the person cited and 5the rights of any adverse claimant shall be asserted and 6determined pursuant to the law relating to garnishment 7proceedings.8    (h) Costs in proceedings authorized by this Section shall 9be allowed, assessed and paid in accordance with rules, 10provided that if the court determines, in its discretion, that 11costs incurred by the judgment creditor were improperly 12incurred, those costs shall be paid by the judgment creditor.13    (i) This Section is in addition to and does not affect 14enforcement of judgments or citation proceedings thereto, by 15any other methods now or hereafter provided by law.16    (j) This Section does not grant the power to any court to 17order installment or other payments from, or compel the sale, 18delivery, surrender, assignment or conveyance of any property 19exempt by statute from the enforcement of a judgment thereon, 20a deduction order, garnishment, attachment, sequestration, 21process or other levy or seizure.22    (k) (Blank).23    (k-3) The court may enter any order upon or judgment 24against the respondent cited that could be entered in any 25garnishment proceeding under Part 7 of Article XII of this 26Code. This subsection (k-3) shall be construed as being   SB1738- 37 -LRB104 08986 JRC 19042 b1declarative of existing law and not as a new enactment.2    (k-5) If the court determines that any property held by a 3third party respondent is wages pursuant to Section 12-801, 4the court shall proceed as if a wage deduction proceeding had 5been filed and proceed to enter such necessary and proper 6orders as would have been entered in a wage deduction 7proceeding including but not limited to the granting of the 8statutory exemptions allowed by Section 12-803 and all other 9remedies allowed plaintiff and defendant pursuant to Part 8 of 10Article 12 of this Act. 11    (k-10) If a creditor discovers personal property of the 12judgment debtor that is subject to the lien of a citation to 13discover assets, the creditor may have the court impress a 14lien against a specific item of personal property, including a 15beneficial interest in a land trust. The lien survives the 16termination of the citation proceedings and remains as a lien 17against the personal property in the same manner that a 18judgment lien recorded against real property pursuant to 19Section 12-101 remains a lien on real property. If the 20judgment is revived before dormancy, the lien shall remain. A 21lien against personal property may, but need not, be recorded 22in the office of the recorder or filed as an informational 23filing pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code. 24    (l) At any citation hearing at which the judgment debtor 25appears and seeks a declaration that certain of his or her 26income or assets are exempt, the court shall proceed to   SB1738- 38 -LRB104 08986 JRC 19042 b1determine whether the property which the judgment debtor 2declares to be exempt is exempt from judgment. At any time 3before the return date specified on the citation, the judgment 4debtor may request, in writing, a hearing to declare exempt 5certain income and assets by notifying the clerk of the court 6before that time, using forms as may be provided by the clerk 7of the court. The clerk of the court will obtain a prompt 8hearing date from the court and will provide the necessary 9forms that must be prepared by the judgment debtor or the 10attorney for the judgment debtor and sent to the judgment 11creditor, or the judgment creditor's attorney, regarding the 12time and location of the hearing. This notice may be sent by 13regular first class mail. At the hearing, the court shall 14immediately, unless for good cause shown that the hearing is 15to be continued, shall proceed to determine whether the 16property which the judgment debtor declares to be exempt is 17exempt from judgment. The restraining provisions of subsection 18(f) shall not apply to any property determined by the court to 19be exempt.20    (m) The judgment or balance due on the judgment becomes a 21lien when a citation is served in accordance with subsection 22(a) of this Section, subject to subsection (c) of Section 2312-1001.1.
