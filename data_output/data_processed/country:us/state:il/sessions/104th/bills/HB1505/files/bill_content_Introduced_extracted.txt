The Illinois Horse Racing Act of 1975 is 5amended by changing Sections 26, 27, 28.1, and 31.1 as 6follows: 7    (230 ILCS 5/26)  (from Ch. 8, par. 37-26)8    Sec. 26. Wagering. 9    (a) Any licensee may conduct and supervise the pari-mutuel 10system of wagering, as defined in Section 3.12 of this Act, on 11horse races conducted by an Illinois organization licensee or 12conducted at a racetrack located in another state or country 13in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 26 of this Act. 14Subject to the prior consent of the Board, licensees may 15supplement any pari-mutuel pool in order to guarantee a 16minimum distribution. Such pari-mutuel method of wagering 17shall not, under any circumstances if conducted under the 18provisions of this Act, be held or construed to be unlawful, 19other statutes of this State to the contrary notwithstanding. 20Subject to rules for advance wagering promulgated by the 21Board, any licensee may accept wagers in advance of the day the 22race wagered upon occurs.23    (b) Except for those gaming activities for which a license   HB1505- 2 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1is obtained and authorized under the Illinois Lottery Law, the 2Charitable Games Act, the Raffles and Poker Runs Act, or the 3Illinois Gambling Act, no other method of betting, pool 4making, wagering or gambling shall be used or permitted by the 5licensee. Each licensee may retain, subject to the payment of 6all applicable taxes and purses, an amount not to exceed 17% of 7all money wagered under subsection (a) of this Section, except 8as may otherwise be permitted under this Act.9    (b-5) An individual may place a wager under the 10pari-mutuel system from any licensed location authorized under 11this Act provided that wager is electronically recorded in the 12manner described in Section 3.12 of this Act. Any wager made 13electronically by an individual while physically on the 14premises of a licensee shall be deemed to have been made at the 15premises of that licensee.16    (c) (Blank).17    (c-5) The sum held by any licensee for payment of 18outstanding pari-mutuel tickets, if unclaimed prior to 19December 31 of the next year, shall be retained by the licensee 20for payment of such tickets until that date. Within 10 days 21thereafter, the balance of such sum remaining unclaimed, less 22any uncashed supplements contributed by such licensee for the 23purpose of guaranteeing minimum distributions of any 24pari-mutuel pool, shall be evenly distributed to the purse 25account of the organization licensee and the organization 26licensee, except that the balance of the sum of all   HB1505- 3 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1outstanding pari-mutuel tickets generated from simulcast 2wagering and inter-track wagering by an organization licensee 3located in a county with a population in excess of 230,000 and 4borders the Mississippi River or any licensee that derives its 5license from that organization licensee shall be evenly 6distributed to the purse account of the organization licensee 7and the organization licensee.8    (d) A pari-mutuel ticket shall be honored until December 931 of the next calendar year, and the licensee shall pay the 10same and may charge the amount thereof against unpaid money 11similarly accumulated on account of pari-mutuel tickets not 12presented for payment.13    (e) No licensee shall knowingly permit any minor, other 14than an employee of such licensee or an owner, trainer, 15jockey, driver, or employee thereof, to be admitted during a 16racing program unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, or 17any minor to be a patron of the pari-mutuel system of wagering 18conducted or supervised by it. The admission of any 19unaccompanied minor, other than an employee of the licensee or 20an owner, trainer, jockey, driver, or employee thereof at a 21race track is a Class C misdemeanor.22    (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Act, an 23organization licensee may contract with an entity in another 24state or country to permit any legal wagering entity in 25another state or country to accept wagers solely within such 26other state or country on races conducted by the organization   HB1505- 4 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1licensee in this State. Beginning January 1, 2000, these 2wagers shall not be subject to State taxation. Until January 31, 2000, when the out-of-State entity conducts a pari-mutuel 4pool separate from the organization licensee, a privilege tax 5equal to 7 1/2% of all monies received by the organization 6licensee from entities in other states or countries pursuant 7to such contracts is imposed on the organization licensee, and 8such privilege tax shall be remitted to the Department of 9Revenue within 48 hours of receipt of the moneys from the 10simulcast. When the out-of-State entity conducts a combined 11pari-mutuel pool with the organization licensee, the tax shall 12be 10% of all monies received by the organization licensee 13with 25% of the receipts from this 10% tax to be distributed to 14the county in which the race was conducted.15    An organization licensee may permit one or more of its 16races to be utilized for pari-mutuel wagering at one or more 17locations in other states and may transmit audio and visual 18signals of races the organization licensee conducts to one or 19more locations outside the State or country and may also 20permit pari-mutuel pools in other states or countries to be 21combined with its gross or net wagering pools or with wagering 22pools established by other states.23    (g) A host track may accept interstate simulcast wagers on 24horse races conducted in other states or countries and shall 25control the number of signals and types of breeds of racing in 26its simulcast program, subject to the disapproval of the   HB1505- 5 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1Board. The Board may prohibit a simulcast program only if it 2finds that the simulcast program is clearly adverse to the 3integrity of racing. The host track simulcast program shall 4include the signal of live racing of all organization 5licensees. All non-host licensees and advance deposit wagering 6licensees shall carry the signal of and accept wagers on live 7racing of all organization licensees. Advance deposit wagering 8licensees shall not be permitted to accept out-of-state wagers 9on any Illinois signal provided pursuant to this Section 10without the approval and consent of the organization licensee 11providing the signal. For one year after August 15, 2014 (the 12effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host licensees may 13carry the host track simulcast program and shall accept wagers 14on all races included as part of the simulcast program of horse 15races conducted at race tracks located within North America 16upon which wagering is permitted. For a period of one year 17after August 15, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1898-968), on horse races conducted at race tracks located 19outside of North America, non-host licensees may accept wagers 20on all races included as part of the simulcast program upon 21which wagering is permitted. Beginning August 15, 2015 (one 22year after the effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host 23licensees may carry the host track simulcast program and shall 24accept wagers on all races included as part of the simulcast 25program upon which wagering is permitted. All organization 26licensees shall provide their live signal to all advance   HB1505- 6 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1deposit wagering licensees for a simulcast commission fee not 2to exceed 6% of the advance deposit wagering licensee's 3Illinois handle on the organization licensee's signal without 4prior approval by the Board. The Board may adopt rules under 5which it may permit simulcast commission fees in excess of 6%. 6The Board shall adopt rules limiting the interstate commission 7fees charged to an advance deposit wagering licensee. The 8Board shall adopt rules regarding advance deposit wagering on 9interstate simulcast races that shall reflect, among other 10things, the General Assembly's desire to maximize revenues to 11the State, horsemen purses, and organization licensees. 12However, organization licensees providing live signals 13pursuant to the requirements of this subsection (g) may 14petition the Board to withhold their live signals from an 15advance deposit wagering licensee if the organization licensee 16discovers and the Board finds reputable or credible 17information that the advance deposit wagering licensee is 18under investigation by another state or federal governmental 19agency, the advance deposit wagering licensee's license has 20been suspended in another state, or the advance deposit 21wagering licensee's license is in revocation proceedings in 22another state. The organization licensee's provision of their 23live signal to an advance deposit wagering licensee under this 24subsection (g) pertains to wagers placed from within Illinois. 25Advance deposit wagering licensees may place advance deposit 26wagering terminals at wagering facilities as a convenience to   HB1505- 7 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1customers. The advance deposit wagering licensee shall not 2charge or collect any fee from purses for the placement of the 3advance deposit wagering terminals. The costs and expenses of 4the host track and non-host licensees associated with 5interstate simulcast wagering, other than the interstate 6commission fee, shall be borne by the host track and all 7non-host licensees incurring these costs. The interstate 8commission fee shall not exceed 5% of Illinois handle on the 9interstate simulcast race or races without prior approval of 10the Board. The Board shall promulgate rules under which it may 11permit interstate commission fees in excess of 5%. The 12interstate commission fee and other fees charged by the 13sending racetrack, including, but not limited to, satellite 14decoder fees, shall be uniformly applied to the host track and 15all non-host licensees.16    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an 17organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 18association representing the largest number of owners, 19trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 20that organization licensee's racing meeting, may maintain a 21system whereby advance deposit wagering may take place or an 22organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 23association representing the largest number of owners, 24trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 25that organization licensee's racing meeting, may contract with 26another person to carry out a system of advance deposit   HB1505- 8 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1wagering. Such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Only 2with respect to an appeal to the Board that consent for an 3organization licensee that maintains its own advance deposit 4wagering system is being unreasonably withheld, the Board 5shall issue a final order within 30 days after initiation of 6the appeal, and the organization licensee's advance deposit 7wagering system may remain operational during that 30-day 8period. The actions of any organization licensee who conducts 9advance deposit wagering or any person who has a contract with 10an organization licensee to conduct advance deposit wagering 11who conducts advance deposit wagering on or after January 1, 122013 and prior to June 7, 2013 (the effective date of Public 13Act 98-18) taken in reliance on the changes made to this 14subsection (g) by Public Act 98-18 are hereby validated, 15provided payment of all applicable pari-mutuel taxes are 16remitted to the Board. All advance deposit wagers placed from 17within Illinois must be placed through a Board-approved 18advance deposit wagering licensee; no other entity may accept 19an advance deposit wager from a person within Illinois. All 20advance deposit wagering is subject to any rules adopted by 21the Board. The Board may adopt rules necessary to regulate 22advance deposit wagering through the use of emergency 23rulemaking in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Illinois 24Administrative Procedure Act. The General Assembly finds that 25the adoption of rules to regulate advance deposit wagering is 26deemed an emergency and necessary for the public interest,   HB1505- 9 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1safety, and welfare. An advance deposit wagering licensee may 2retain all moneys as agreed to by contract with an 3organization licensee. Any moneys retained by the organization 4licensee from advance deposit wagering, not including moneys 5retained by the advance deposit wagering licensee, shall be 6paid 50% to the organization licensee's purse account and 50% 7to the organization licensee. With the exception of any 8organization licensee that is owned by a publicly traded 9company that is incorporated in a state other than Illinois 10and advance deposit wagering licensees under contract with 11such organization licensees, organization licensees that 12maintain advance deposit wagering systems and advance deposit 13wagering licensees that contract with organization licensees 14shall provide sufficiently detailed monthly accountings to the 15horsemen association representing the largest number of 16owners, trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race 17horses at that organization licensee's racing meeting so that 18the horsemen association, as an interested party, can confirm 19the accuracy of the amounts paid to the purse account at the 20horsemen association's affiliated organization licensee from 21advance deposit wagering. If more than one breed races at the 22same race track facility, then the 50% of the moneys to be paid 23to an organization licensee's purse account shall be allocated 24among all organization licensees' purse accounts operating at 25that race track facility proportionately based on the actual 26number of host days that the Board grants to that breed at that   HB1505- 10 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1race track facility in the current calendar year. To the 2extent any fees from advance deposit wagering conducted in 3Illinois for wagers in Illinois or other states have been 4placed in escrow or otherwise withheld from wagers pending a 5determination of the legality of advance deposit wagering, no 6action shall be brought to declare such wagers or the 7disbursement of any fees previously escrowed illegal.8        (1) Between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. an 9    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 10    may supplement the host track simulcast program with 11    additional simulcast races or race programs, provided that 12    between January 1 and the third Friday in February of any 13    year, inclusive, if no live thoroughbred racing is 14    occurring in Illinois during this period, only 15    thoroughbred races may be used for supplemental interstate 16    simulcast purposes. The Board shall withhold approval for 17    a supplemental interstate simulcast only if it finds that 18    the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 19    racing. A supplemental interstate simulcast may be 20    transmitted from an inter-track wagering licensee to its 21    affiliated non-host licensees. The interstate commission 22    fee for a supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid 23    by the non-host licensee and its affiliated non-host 24    licensees receiving the simulcast.25        (2) Between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. an 26    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track   HB1505- 11 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1    may receive supplemental interstate simulcasts only with 2    the consent of the host track, except when the Board finds 3    that the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 4    racing. Consent granted under this paragraph (2) to any 5    inter-track wagering licensee shall be deemed consent to 6    all non-host licensees. The interstate commission fee for 7    the supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid by all 8    participating non-host licensees.9        (3) Each licensee conducting interstate simulcast 10    wagering may retain, subject to the payment of all 11    applicable taxes and the purses, an amount not to exceed 12    17% of all money wagered. If any licensee conducts the 13    pari-mutuel system wagering on races conducted at 14    racetracks in another state or country, each such race or 15    race program shall be considered a separate racing day for 16    the purpose of determining the daily handle and computing 17    the privilege tax of that daily handle as provided in 18    subsection (a) of Section 27. Until January 1, 2000, from 19    the sums permitted to be retained pursuant to this 20    subsection, each inter-track wagering location licensee 21    shall pay 1% of the pari-mutuel handle wagered on 22    simulcast wagering to the Horse Racing Tax Allocation 23    Fund, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of 24    paragraph (11) of subsection (h) of Section 26 of this 25    Act.26        (4) A licensee who receives an interstate simulcast   HB1505- 12 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1    may combine its gross or net pools with pools at the 2    sending racetracks pursuant to rules established by the 3    Board. All licensees combining their gross pools at a 4    sending racetrack shall adopt the takeout percentages of 5    the sending racetrack. A licensee may also establish a 6    separate pool and takeout structure for wagering purposes 7    on races conducted at race tracks outside of the State of 8    Illinois. The licensee may permit pari-mutuel wagers 9    placed in other states or countries to be combined with 10    its gross or net wagering pools or other wagering pools.11        (5) After the payment of the interstate commission fee 12    (except for the interstate commission fee on a 13    supplemental interstate simulcast, which shall be paid by 14    the host track and by each non-host licensee through the 15    host track) and all applicable State and local taxes, 16    except as provided in subsection (g) of Section 27 of this 17    Act, the remainder of moneys retained from simulcast 18    wagering pursuant to this subsection (g), and Section 26.2 19    shall be divided as follows:20            (A) For interstate simulcast wagers made at a host 21        track, 50% to the host track and 50% to purses at the 22        host track.23            (B) For wagers placed on interstate simulcast 24        races, supplemental simulcasts as defined in 25        subparagraphs (1) and (2), and separately pooled races 26        conducted outside of the State of Illinois made at a   HB1505- 13 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1        non-host licensee, 25% to the host track, 25% to the 2        non-host licensee, and 50% to the purses at the host 3        track.4        (6) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the 5    contrary, non-host licensees who derive their licenses 6    from a track located in a county with a population in 7    excess of 230,000 and that borders the Mississippi River 8    may receive supplemental interstate simulcast races at all 9    times subject to Board approval, which shall be withheld 10    only upon a finding that a supplemental interstate 11    simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of racing.12        (7) Effective January 1, 2017, notwithstanding any 13    provision of this Act to the contrary, after payment of 14    all applicable State and local taxes and interstate 15    commission fees, non-host licensees who derive their 16    licenses from a track located in a county with a 17    population in excess of 230,000 and that borders the 18    Mississippi River shall retain 50% of the retention from 19    interstate simulcast wagers and shall pay 50% to purses at 20    the track from which the non-host licensee derives its 21    license.22        (7.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 23    to the contrary, if no standardbred racing is conducted at 24    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar 25    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, and the 26    licensee that conducts horse racing at that racetrack   HB1505- 14 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1    requests from the Board at least as many racing dates as 2    were conducted in calendar year 2000, all moneys derived 3    by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and inter-track 4    wagering that (1) are to be used for purses and (2) are 5    generated between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. 6    during that calendar year shall be paid as follows:7            (A) Eighty percent If the licensee that conducts 8        horse racing at that racetrack requests from the Board 9        at least as many racing dates as were conducted in 10        calendar year 2000, 80% shall be paid to its 11        thoroughbred purse account; and12            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 13        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund and shall 14        be paid to purses for standardbred races for Illinois 15        conceived and foaled horses conducted at any county 16        fairgrounds.

The Illinois Horse Racing Act of 1975 is 5amended by changing Sections 26, 27, 28.1, and 31.1 as 6follows: 7    (230 ILCS 5/26)  (from Ch. 8, par. 37-26)8    Sec. 26. Wagering. 9    (a) Any licensee may conduct and supervise the pari-mutuel 10system of wagering, as defined in Section 3.12 of this Act, on 11horse races conducted by an Illinois organization licensee or 12conducted at a racetrack located in another state or country 13in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 26 of this Act. 14Subject to the prior consent of the Board, licensees may 15supplement any pari-mutuel pool in order to guarantee a 16minimum distribution. Such pari-mutuel method of wagering 17shall not, under any circumstances if conducted under the 18provisions of this Act, be held or construed to be unlawful, 19other statutes of this State to the contrary notwithstanding. 20Subject to rules for advance wagering promulgated by the 21Board, any licensee may accept wagers in advance of the day the 22race wagered upon occurs.23    (b) Except for those gaming activities for which a license   HB1505- 2 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1is obtained and authorized under the Illinois Lottery Law, the 2Charitable Games Act, the Raffles and Poker Runs Act, or the 3Illinois Gambling Act, no other method of betting, pool 4making, wagering or gambling shall be used or permitted by the 5licensee. Each licensee may retain, subject to the payment of 6all applicable taxes and purses, an amount not to exceed 17% of 7all money wagered under subsection (a) of this Section, except 8as may otherwise be permitted under this Act.9    (b-5) An individual may place a wager under the 10pari-mutuel system from any licensed location authorized under 11this Act provided that wager is electronically recorded in the 12manner described in Section 3.12 of this Act. Any wager made 13electronically by an individual while physically on the 14premises of a licensee shall be deemed to have been made at the 15premises of that licensee.16    (c) (Blank).17    (c-5) The sum held by any licensee for payment of 18outstanding pari-mutuel tickets, if unclaimed prior to 19December 31 of the next year, shall be retained by the licensee 20for payment of such tickets until that date. Within 10 days 21thereafter, the balance of such sum remaining unclaimed, less 22any uncashed supplements contributed by such licensee for the 23purpose of guaranteeing minimum distributions of any 24pari-mutuel pool, shall be evenly distributed to the purse 25account of the organization licensee and the organization 26licensee, except that the balance of the sum of all   HB1505- 3 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1outstanding pari-mutuel tickets generated from simulcast 2wagering and inter-track wagering by an organization licensee 3located in a county with a population in excess of 230,000 and 4borders the Mississippi River or any licensee that derives its 5license from that organization licensee shall be evenly 6distributed to the purse account of the organization licensee 7and the organization licensee.8    (d) A pari-mutuel ticket shall be honored until December 931 of the next calendar year, and the licensee shall pay the 10same and may charge the amount thereof against unpaid money 11similarly accumulated on account of pari-mutuel tickets not 12presented for payment.13    (e) No licensee shall knowingly permit any minor, other 14than an employee of such licensee or an owner, trainer, 15jockey, driver, or employee thereof, to be admitted during a 16racing program unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, or 17any minor to be a patron of the pari-mutuel system of wagering 18conducted or supervised by it. The admission of any 19unaccompanied minor, other than an employee of the licensee or 20an owner, trainer, jockey, driver, or employee thereof at a 21race track is a Class C misdemeanor.22    (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Act, an 23organization licensee may contract with an entity in another 24state or country to permit any legal wagering entity in 25another state or country to accept wagers solely within such 26other state or country on races conducted by the organization   HB1505- 4 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1licensee in this State. Beginning January 1, 2000, these 2wagers shall not be subject to State taxation. Until January 31, 2000, when the out-of-State entity conducts a pari-mutuel 4pool separate from the organization licensee, a privilege tax 5equal to 7 1/2% of all monies received by the organization 6licensee from entities in other states or countries pursuant 7to such contracts is imposed on the organization licensee, and 8such privilege tax shall be remitted to the Department of 9Revenue within 48 hours of receipt of the moneys from the 10simulcast. When the out-of-State entity conducts a combined 11pari-mutuel pool with the organization licensee, the tax shall 12be 10% of all monies received by the organization licensee 13with 25% of the receipts from this 10% tax to be distributed to 14the county in which the race was conducted.15    An organization licensee may permit one or more of its 16races to be utilized for pari-mutuel wagering at one or more 17locations in other states and may transmit audio and visual 18signals of races the organization licensee conducts to one or 19more locations outside the State or country and may also 20permit pari-mutuel pools in other states or countries to be 21combined with its gross or net wagering pools or with wagering 22pools established by other states.23    (g) A host track may accept interstate simulcast wagers on 24horse races conducted in other states or countries and shall 25control the number of signals and types of breeds of racing in 26its simulcast program, subject to the disapproval of the   HB1505- 5 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1Board. The Board may prohibit a simulcast program only if it 2finds that the simulcast program is clearly adverse to the 3integrity of racing. The host track simulcast program shall 4include the signal of live racing of all organization 5licensees. All non-host licensees and advance deposit wagering 6licensees shall carry the signal of and accept wagers on live 7racing of all organization licensees. Advance deposit wagering 8licensees shall not be permitted to accept out-of-state wagers 9on any Illinois signal provided pursuant to this Section 10without the approval and consent of the organization licensee 11providing the signal. For one year after August 15, 2014 (the 12effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host licensees may 13carry the host track simulcast program and shall accept wagers 14on all races included as part of the simulcast program of horse 15races conducted at race tracks located within North America 16upon which wagering is permitted. For a period of one year 17after August 15, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1898-968), on horse races conducted at race tracks located 19outside of North America, non-host licensees may accept wagers 20on all races included as part of the simulcast program upon 21which wagering is permitted. Beginning August 15, 2015 (one 22year after the effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host 23licensees may carry the host track simulcast program and shall 24accept wagers on all races included as part of the simulcast 25program upon which wagering is permitted. All organization 26licensees shall provide their live signal to all advance   HB1505- 6 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1deposit wagering licensees for a simulcast commission fee not 2to exceed 6% of the advance deposit wagering licensee's 3Illinois handle on the organization licensee's signal without 4prior approval by the Board. The Board may adopt rules under 5which it may permit simulcast commission fees in excess of 6%. 6The Board shall adopt rules limiting the interstate commission 7fees charged to an advance deposit wagering licensee. The 8Board shall adopt rules regarding advance deposit wagering on 9interstate simulcast races that shall reflect, among other 10things, the General Assembly's desire to maximize revenues to 11the State, horsemen purses, and organization licensees. 12However, organization licensees providing live signals 13pursuant to the requirements of this subsection (g) may 14petition the Board to withhold their live signals from an 15advance deposit wagering licensee if the organization licensee 16discovers and the Board finds reputable or credible 17information that the advance deposit wagering licensee is 18under investigation by another state or federal governmental 19agency, the advance deposit wagering licensee's license has 20been suspended in another state, or the advance deposit 21wagering licensee's license is in revocation proceedings in 22another state. The organization licensee's provision of their 23live signal to an advance deposit wagering licensee under this 24subsection (g) pertains to wagers placed from within Illinois. 25Advance deposit wagering licensees may place advance deposit 26wagering terminals at wagering facilities as a convenience to   HB1505- 7 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1customers. The advance deposit wagering licensee shall not 2charge or collect any fee from purses for the placement of the 3advance deposit wagering terminals. The costs and expenses of 4the host track and non-host licensees associated with 5interstate simulcast wagering, other than the interstate 6commission fee, shall be borne by the host track and all 7non-host licensees incurring these costs. The interstate 8commission fee shall not exceed 5% of Illinois handle on the 9interstate simulcast race or races without prior approval of 10the Board. The Board shall promulgate rules under which it may 11permit interstate commission fees in excess of 5%. The 12interstate commission fee and other fees charged by the 13sending racetrack, including, but not limited to, satellite 14decoder fees, shall be uniformly applied to the host track and 15all non-host licensees.16    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an 17organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 18association representing the largest number of owners, 19trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 20that organization licensee's racing meeting, may maintain a 21system whereby advance deposit wagering may take place or an 22organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 23association representing the largest number of owners, 24trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 25that organization licensee's racing meeting, may contract with 26another person to carry out a system of advance deposit   HB1505- 8 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1wagering. Such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Only 2with respect to an appeal to the Board that consent for an 3organization licensee that maintains its own advance deposit 4wagering system is being unreasonably withheld, the Board 5shall issue a final order within 30 days after initiation of 6the appeal, and the organization licensee's advance deposit 7wagering system may remain operational during that 30-day 8period. The actions of any organization licensee who conducts 9advance deposit wagering or any person who has a contract with 10an organization licensee to conduct advance deposit wagering 11who conducts advance deposit wagering on or after January 1, 122013 and prior to June 7, 2013 (the effective date of Public 13Act 98-18) taken in reliance on the changes made to this 14subsection (g) by Public Act 98-18 are hereby validated, 15provided payment of all applicable pari-mutuel taxes are 16remitted to the Board. All advance deposit wagers placed from 17within Illinois must be placed through a Board-approved 18advance deposit wagering licensee; no other entity may accept 19an advance deposit wager from a person within Illinois. All 20advance deposit wagering is subject to any rules adopted by 21the Board. The Board may adopt rules necessary to regulate 22advance deposit wagering through the use of emergency 23rulemaking in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Illinois 24Administrative Procedure Act. The General Assembly finds that 25the adoption of rules to regulate advance deposit wagering is 26deemed an emergency and necessary for the public interest,   HB1505- 9 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1safety, and welfare. An advance deposit wagering licensee may 2retain all moneys as agreed to by contract with an 3organization licensee. Any moneys retained by the organization 4licensee from advance deposit wagering, not including moneys 5retained by the advance deposit wagering licensee, shall be 6paid 50% to the organization licensee's purse account and 50% 7to the organization licensee. With the exception of any 8organization licensee that is owned by a publicly traded 9company that is incorporated in a state other than Illinois 10and advance deposit wagering licensees under contract with 11such organization licensees, organization licensees that 12maintain advance deposit wagering systems and advance deposit 13wagering licensees that contract with organization licensees 14shall provide sufficiently detailed monthly accountings to the 15horsemen association representing the largest number of 16owners, trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race 17horses at that organization licensee's racing meeting so that 18the horsemen association, as an interested party, can confirm 19the accuracy of the amounts paid to the purse account at the 20horsemen association's affiliated organization licensee from 21advance deposit wagering. If more than one breed races at the 22same race track facility, then the 50% of the moneys to be paid 23to an organization licensee's purse account shall be allocated 24among all organization licensees' purse accounts operating at 25that race track facility proportionately based on the actual 26number of host days that the Board grants to that breed at that   HB1505- 10 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1race track facility in the current calendar year. To the 2extent any fees from advance deposit wagering conducted in 3Illinois for wagers in Illinois or other states have been 4placed in escrow or otherwise withheld from wagers pending a 5determination of the legality of advance deposit wagering, no 6action shall be brought to declare such wagers or the 7disbursement of any fees previously escrowed illegal.8        (1) Between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. an 9    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 10    may supplement the host track simulcast program with 11    additional simulcast races or race programs, provided that 12    between January 1 and the third Friday in February of any 13    year, inclusive, if no live thoroughbred racing is 14    occurring in Illinois during this period, only 15    thoroughbred races may be used for supplemental interstate 16    simulcast purposes. The Board shall withhold approval for 17    a supplemental interstate simulcast only if it finds that 18    the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 19    racing. A supplemental interstate simulcast may be 20    transmitted from an inter-track wagering licensee to its 21    affiliated non-host licensees. The interstate commission 22    fee for a supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid 23    by the non-host licensee and its affiliated non-host 24    licensees receiving the simulcast.25        (2) Between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. an 26    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track   HB1505- 11 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1    may receive supplemental interstate simulcasts only with 2    the consent of the host track, except when the Board finds 3    that the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 4    racing. Consent granted under this paragraph (2) to any 5    inter-track wagering licensee shall be deemed consent to 6    all non-host licensees. The interstate commission fee for 7    the supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid by all 8    participating non-host licensees.9        (3) Each licensee conducting interstate simulcast 10    wagering may retain, subject to the payment of all 11    applicable taxes and the purses, an amount not to exceed 12    17% of all money wagered. If any licensee conducts the 13    pari-mutuel system wagering on races conducted at 14    racetracks in another state or country, each such race or 15    race program shall be considered a separate racing day for 16    the purpose of determining the daily handle and computing 17    the privilege tax of that daily handle as provided in 18    subsection (a) of Section 27. Until January 1, 2000, from 19    the sums permitted to be retained pursuant to this 20    subsection, each inter-track wagering location licensee 21    shall pay 1% of the pari-mutuel handle wagered on 22    simulcast wagering to the Horse Racing Tax Allocation 23    Fund, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of 24    paragraph (11) of subsection (h) of Section 26 of this 25    Act.26        (4) A licensee who receives an interstate simulcast   HB1505- 12 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1    may combine its gross or net pools with pools at the 2    sending racetracks pursuant to rules established by the 3    Board. All licensees combining their gross pools at a 4    sending racetrack shall adopt the takeout percentages of 5    the sending racetrack. A licensee may also establish a 6    separate pool and takeout structure for wagering purposes 7    on races conducted at race tracks outside of the State of 8    Illinois. The licensee may permit pari-mutuel wagers 9    placed in other states or countries to be combined with 10    its gross or net wagering pools or other wagering pools.11        (5) After the payment of the interstate commission fee 12    (except for the interstate commission fee on a 13    supplemental interstate simulcast, which shall be paid by 14    the host track and by each non-host licensee through the 15    host track) and all applicable State and local taxes, 16    except as provided in subsection (g) of Section 27 of this 17    Act, the remainder of moneys retained from simulcast 18    wagering pursuant to this subsection (g), and Section 26.2 19    shall be divided as follows:20            (A) For interstate simulcast wagers made at a host 21        track, 50% to the host track and 50% to purses at the 22        host track.23            (B) For wagers placed on interstate simulcast 24        races, supplemental simulcasts as defined in 25        subparagraphs (1) and (2), and separately pooled races 26        conducted outside of the State of Illinois made at a   HB1505- 13 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1        non-host licensee, 25% to the host track, 25% to the 2        non-host licensee, and 50% to the purses at the host 3        track.4        (6) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the 5    contrary, non-host licensees who derive their licenses 6    from a track located in a county with a population in 7    excess of 230,000 and that borders the Mississippi River 8    may receive supplemental interstate simulcast races at all 9    times subject to Board approval, which shall be withheld 10    only upon a finding that a supplemental interstate 11    simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of racing.12        (7) Effective January 1, 2017, notwithstanding any 13    provision of this Act to the contrary, after payment of 14    all applicable State and local taxes and interstate 15    commission fees, non-host licensees who derive their 16    licenses from a track located in a county with a 17    population in excess of 230,000 and that borders the 18    Mississippi River shall retain 50% of the retention from 19    interstate simulcast wagers and shall pay 50% to purses at 20    the track from which the non-host licensee derives its 21    license.22        (7.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 23    to the contrary, if no standardbred racing is conducted at 24    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar 25    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, and the 26    licensee that conducts horse racing at that racetrack   HB1505- 14 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1    requests from the Board at least as many racing dates as 2    were conducted in calendar year 2000, all moneys derived 3    by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and inter-track 4    wagering that (1) are to be used for purses and (2) are 5    generated between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. 6    during that calendar year shall be paid as follows:7            (A) Eighty percent If the licensee that conducts 8        horse racing at that racetrack requests from the Board 9        at least as many racing dates as were conducted in 10        calendar year 2000, 80% shall be paid to its 11        thoroughbred purse account; and12            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 13        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund and shall 14        be paid to purses for standardbred races for Illinois 15        conceived and foaled horses conducted at any county 16        fairgrounds.

The moneys deposited pursuant to this 23        subparagraph (B) shall be allocated as provided by the 24        Department of Agriculture, with the advice and 25        assistance of the Illinois Standardbred Breeders Fund 26        Advisory Board.  HB1505- 15 -LRB104 08400 LNS 18451 b1        (7.2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 2    to the contrary, if no thoroughbred racing is conducted at 3    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar 4    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, and the 5    licensee that conducts horse racing at that racetrack 6    requests from the Board at least as many racing dates as 7    were conducted in calendar year 2000, all moneys derived 8    by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and inter-track 9    wagering that (1) are to be used for purses and (2) are 10    generated between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. 11    during that calendar year shall be deposited as follows:12            (A) Eighty percent If the licensee that conducts 13        horse racing at that racetrack requests from the Board 14        at least as many racing dates as were conducted in 15        calendar year 2000, 80% shall be deposited into its 16        standardbred purse account; and17            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 18        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund.
