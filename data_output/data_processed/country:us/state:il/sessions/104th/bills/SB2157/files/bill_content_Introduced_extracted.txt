Rachel Ventura SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act    Creates the Deforestation-Free Illinois Act. Provides that neither the State nor any government agency of the State shall purchase, at wholesale or retail, or obtain for any purpose any tropical hardwood or tropical hardwood product. Provides that no bid proposal or solicitation, request for bid or proposal, or contract for the construction of any public work, building maintenance, or improvement for or on behalf of the State or any government agency of the State shall require or permit the use of any tropical hardwood or tropical hardwood product. Provides that every contract entered into by a State agency that includes the procurement of any product that consists, in whole or in part, of a forest-risk commodity shall require the contractor to confirm that the commodity furnished to the State under the contract was not extracted from, grown, derived, harvested, reared, or produced on land where deforestation or forest degradation occurred. Effective immediately.LRB104 09412 HLH 19471 b  A BILL FOR SB2157LRB104 09412 HLH 19471 b1    AN ACT concerning finance. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Deforestation-Free Illinois Act. 6    Section 5. Legislative findings. The General Assembly 7finds and declares the following:8        (1) Studies show that preventing deforestation is 9    among the most cost-effective climate mitigation 10    strategies with large global mitigation benefits. 11    Preventing deforestation is also one of the few large 12    mitigation options that does not risk trade-offs to 13    solving other challenges; on the contrary, it provides 14    co-benefits like enhancing health, clean water, and 15    sanitation.16        (2) Studies also suggest that protecting existing 17    forests and allowing them to mature could potentially 18    store 151.7 gigatons of carbon, or about a quarter of 19    excess emissions since industrialization.20        (3) Deforestation and forest degradation generates 21    between 4.3 and 5.5 GtCO2eq annually. This is between 7% 22    and 10% of all CO2 equivalent emissions from all sources 23    globally. Emissions associated with deforestation and   SB2157- 2 -LRB104 09412 HLH 19471 b1    forest degradation contribute most of the 13% of total 2    anthropogenic CO2 emissions attributed to agriculture.3        (4) Most forest destruction is caused by a few 4    high-risk commodities we can avoid - cattle products, 5    cocoa, coffee, soy, palm oil, paper, and rubber - by 6    selecting products from supply chains not contributing to 7    deforestation, forest degradation, and interrelated human 8    rights abuses. 9Article 60. Deforestation-Free Procurement. 10    Section 60-1. Definitions. As used in this Section:11    "Contractor" means any person or entity that has a 12contract with a State agency for any of the following: 13        (1) public works or improvements;14        (2) a franchise, concession, or lease of property; or15        (3) grant moneys or goods and services or supplies to 16    be purchased at the expense of the State agency or to be 17    paid for out of moneys deposited into the State treasury 18    or out of trust moneys under the control of or collected by 19    the State agency.20    "Deforestation" means direct human-induced conversion of 21forest to agriculture, a tree plantation, or other non-forest 22land use.23    "Forest degradation" means structural changes to forest 24cover that result in a change in species composition,   SB2157- 3 -LRB104 09412 HLH 19471 b1structure, or ecological function of that forest, as indicated 2by factors including impacts to carbon storage and other 3ecosystem services, native species abundance and composition, 4forest structure, and tree age class distribution.

Rachel Ventura SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act    Creates the Deforestation-Free Illinois Act. Provides that neither the State nor any government agency of the State shall purchase, at wholesale or retail, or obtain for any purpose any tropical hardwood or tropical hardwood product. Provides that no bid proposal or solicitation, request for bid or proposal, or contract for the construction of any public work, building maintenance, or improvement for or on behalf of the State or any government agency of the State shall require or permit the use of any tropical hardwood or tropical hardwood product. Provides that every contract entered into by a State agency that includes the procurement of any product that consists, in whole or in part, of a forest-risk commodity shall require the contractor to confirm that the commodity furnished to the State under the contract was not extracted from, grown, derived, harvested, reared, or produced on land where deforestation or forest degradation occurred. Effective immediately.LRB104 09412 HLH 19471 b  A BILL FOR SB2157LRB104 09412 HLH 19471 b1    AN ACT concerning finance. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Deforestation-Free Illinois Act. 6    Section 5. Legislative findings. The General Assembly 7finds and declares the following:8        (1) Studies show that preventing deforestation is 9    among the most cost-effective climate mitigation 10    strategies with large global mitigation benefits. 11    Preventing deforestation is also one of the few large 12    mitigation options that does not risk trade-offs to 13    solving other challenges; on the contrary, it provides 14    co-benefits like enhancing health, clean water, and 15    sanitation.16        (2) Studies also suggest that protecting existing 17    forests and allowing them to mature could potentially 18    store 151.7 gigatons of carbon, or about a quarter of 19    excess emissions since industrialization.20        (3) Deforestation and forest degradation generates 21    between 4.3 and 5.5 GtCO2eq annually. This is between 7% 22    and 10% of all CO2 equivalent emissions from all sources 23    globally. Emissions associated with deforestation and   SB2157- 2 -LRB104 09412 HLH 19471 b1    forest degradation contribute most of the 13% of total 2    anthropogenic CO2 emissions attributed to agriculture.3        (4) Most forest destruction is caused by a few 4    high-risk commodities we can avoid - cattle products, 5    cocoa, coffee, soy, palm oil, paper, and rubber - by 6    selecting products from supply chains not contributing to 7    deforestation, forest degradation, and interrelated human 8    rights abuses. 9Article 60. Deforestation-Free Procurement. 10    Section 60-1. Definitions. As used in this Section:11    "Contractor" means any person or entity that has a 12contract with a State agency for any of the following: 13        (1) public works or improvements;14        (2) a franchise, concession, or lease of property; or15        (3) grant moneys or goods and services or supplies to 16    be purchased at the expense of the State agency or to be 17    paid for out of moneys deposited into the State treasury 18    or out of trust moneys under the control of or collected by 19    the State agency.20    "Deforestation" means direct human-induced conversion of 21forest to agriculture, a tree plantation, or other non-forest 22land use.23    "Forest degradation" means structural changes to forest 24cover that result in a change in species composition,   SB2157- 3 -LRB104 09412 HLH 19471 b1structure, or ecological function of that forest, as indicated 2by factors including impacts to carbon storage and other 3ecosystem services, native species abundance and composition, 4forest structure, and tree age class distribution.
