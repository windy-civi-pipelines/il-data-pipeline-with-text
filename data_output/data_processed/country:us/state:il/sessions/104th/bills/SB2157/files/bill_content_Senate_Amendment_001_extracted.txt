Amend Senate Bill 2157 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 5. The Illinois Procurement Code is amended by 5adding Article 54 as follows: 6    (30 ILCS 500/Art. 54 heading new)7ARTICLE 54. DEFORESTATION-FREE ILLINOIS LAW 8    (30 ILCS 500/54-1 new)9    Sec. 54-1. Short title. This Article 54 may be cited as the 10Deforestation-Free Illinois Law. 11    (30 ILCS 500/54-2 new)12    Sec. 54-2. Legislative findings. The General Assembly 13finds and declares the following:14        (1) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization   10400SB2157sam001- 2 -LRB104 09412 HLH 23950 a1    of the United Nations, 31% of land on earth is covered in 2    forests, but that area is rapidly decreasing. An estimated 3    1,600,000 square miles of forest has been converted to 4    other land uses since 1990, with 42,500 square miles 5    converted annually since 2010 6        (2) Studies show that preventing deforestation is 7    among the most cost-effective climate mitigation 8    strategies with large global mitigation benefits. 9    Preventing deforestation is also one of the few large 10    mitigation options that does not risk trade-offs to 11    solving other challenges; on the contrary, it provides 12    co-benefits like enhancing health, clean water, and 13    sanitation. 14        (3) Cost-effective greenhouse gas emission mitigation 15    from forests and land use can provide roughly one-third of 16    the mitigation required by 2030 to hold the increase in 17    the global average temperature below 2 degrees Celsius 18    above pre-industrial levels. Studies also suggest that 19    protecting existing forests and allowing them to mature 20    could potentially store 151.7 gigatons of carbon, or about 21    a quarter of excess emissions since industrialization. 22        (4) Deforestation and forest degradation generates 23    between 4.3 and 5.5 GtCO2eq annually. This is between 7% 24    and 10% of all CO2 equivalent emissions from all sources 25    globally. Emissions associated with deforestation and 26    forest degradation contribute most of the 13% of total   10400SB2157sam001- 3 -LRB104 09412 HLH 23950 a1    anthropogenic CO2 emissions attributed to agriculture. 2        (5) The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on 3    Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found, in 2019, that 4    (i) the rate of global species extinction is accelerating 5    and is now tens to hundreds of times higher than the 6    average rate over the last 10,000,000 years, threatening 7    the loss of 1,000,000 species, and (ii) rampant land-use 8    change has an overwhelming relative impact on terrestrial 9    ecosystems. 10        (6) Most forest destruction is caused by a few 11    high-risk commodities, including, but not limtied to, 12    cattle products, cocoa, coffee, soy, palm oil, paper, and 13    rubber. The State should should endeavour to use and 14    purchase products from supply chains that do not 15    contribute to deforestation, forest degradation, and 16    interrelated human rights abuses.  17    (30 ILCS 500/54-3 new)18    Sec. 54-3. Definitions. As used in this Article:19    "Contractor" means any person or entity that has a 20contract with a State agency for any of the following: 21        (1) public works or improvements; 22        (2) a franchise, concession, or lease of property; or 23        (3) grant moneys or goods and services or supplies to 24    be purchased at the expense of the State agency or to be 25    paid for out of moneys deposited into the State treasury   10400SB2157sam001- 4 -LRB104 09412 HLH 23950 a1    or out of trust fund moneys that are under the control of 2    or collected by the State agency. 3    "Deforestation" means direct human-induced conversion of 4forest to agriculture, a tree plantation, or other non-forest 5land use.6    "Forest degradation" means structural changes to forest 7cover that result in a change in species composition, 8structure, or ecological function of that forest, as indicated 9by factors including impacts to carbon storage and other 10ecosystem services, native species abundance and composition, 11forest structure, and tree age class distribution.

Amend Senate Bill 2157 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 5. The Illinois Procurement Code is amended by 5adding Article 54 as follows: 6    (30 ILCS 500/Art. 54 heading new)7ARTICLE 54. DEFORESTATION-FREE ILLINOIS LAW 8    (30 ILCS 500/54-1 new)9    Sec. 54-1. Short title. This Article 54 may be cited as the 10Deforestation-Free Illinois Law. 11    (30 ILCS 500/54-2 new)12    Sec. 54-2. Legislative findings. The General Assembly 13finds and declares the following:14        (1) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization   10400SB2157sam001- 2 -LRB104 09412 HLH 23950 a1    of the United Nations, 31% of land on earth is covered in 2    forests, but that area is rapidly decreasing. An estimated 3    1,600,000 square miles of forest has been converted to 4    other land uses since 1990, with 42,500 square miles 5    converted annually since 2010 6        (2) Studies show that preventing deforestation is 7    among the most cost-effective climate mitigation 8    strategies with large global mitigation benefits. 9    Preventing deforestation is also one of the few large 10    mitigation options that does not risk trade-offs to 11    solving other challenges; on the contrary, it provides 12    co-benefits like enhancing health, clean water, and 13    sanitation. 14        (3) Cost-effective greenhouse gas emission mitigation 15    from forests and land use can provide roughly one-third of 16    the mitigation required by 2030 to hold the increase in 17    the global average temperature below 2 degrees Celsius 18    above pre-industrial levels. Studies also suggest that 19    protecting existing forests and allowing them to mature 20    could potentially store 151.7 gigatons of carbon, or about 21    a quarter of excess emissions since industrialization. 22        (4) Deforestation and forest degradation generates 23    between 4.3 and 5.5 GtCO2eq annually. This is between 7% 24    and 10% of all CO2 equivalent emissions from all sources 25    globally. Emissions associated with deforestation and 26    forest degradation contribute most of the 13% of total   10400SB2157sam001- 3 -LRB104 09412 HLH 23950 a1    anthropogenic CO2 emissions attributed to agriculture. 2        (5) The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on 3    Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services found, in 2019, that 4    (i) the rate of global species extinction is accelerating 5    and is now tens to hundreds of times higher than the 6    average rate over the last 10,000,000 years, threatening 7    the loss of 1,000,000 species, and (ii) rampant land-use 8    change has an overwhelming relative impact on terrestrial 9    ecosystems. 10        (6) Most forest destruction is caused by a few 11    high-risk commodities, including, but not limtied to, 12    cattle products, cocoa, coffee, soy, palm oil, paper, and 13    rubber. The State should should endeavour to use and 14    purchase products from supply chains that do not 15    contribute to deforestation, forest degradation, and 16    interrelated human rights abuses.  17    (30 ILCS 500/54-3 new)18    Sec. 54-3. Definitions. As used in this Article:19    "Contractor" means any person or entity that has a 20contract with a State agency for any of the following: 21        (1) public works or improvements; 22        (2) a franchise, concession, or lease of property; or 23        (3) grant moneys or goods and services or supplies to 24    be purchased at the expense of the State agency or to be 25    paid for out of moneys deposited into the State treasury   10400SB2157sam001- 4 -LRB104 09412 HLH 23950 a1    or out of trust fund moneys that are under the control of 2    or collected by the State agency. 3    "Deforestation" means direct human-induced conversion of 4forest to agriculture, a tree plantation, or other non-forest 5land use.6    "Forest degradation" means structural changes to forest 7cover that result in a change in species composition, 8structure, or ecological function of that forest, as indicated 9by factors including impacts to carbon storage and other 10ecosystem services, native species abundance and composition, 11forest structure, and tree age class distribution. "Forest 12degradation" includes converting primary forest or naturally 13regenerating forest into plantation forest or into other 14wooded land and the conversion of primary forest into planted 15forests.16    "Forest-risk commodity" means:17        (1) any commodity, including any agricultural or 18    nonagricultural commodity, whether in raw or processed 19    form, that is commonly extracted from or grown, derived, 20    harvested, reared, or produced on land where deforestation 21    or forest degradation has occurred or is likely to occur; 22    or23        (2) any product derived from a product described in 24    paragraph (1). 25    "Forest-risk commodity" includes beef, cocoa, coffee, 26leather, logs, lumber, palm oil, paper, soy, rubber, wood   10400SB2157sam001- 5 -LRB104 09412 HLH 23950 a1pulp, and any other commodity identified as such by the 2Director of Central Management Services by rule. "Forest-risk 3commodity" does not include wood pulp or paper made entirely 4from recovered fiber. For any wood pulp or paper product made 5partially from recovered fiber, the contractor must only 6confirm that the components that were not derived from 7recovered fibers were not extracted from, grown, derived, 8harvested, reared, or produced on land where deforestation or 9forest degradation occurred in accordance with rules as 10provided in Section 54-13.
