If the unadjusted percentage change 5        in the consumer price index-u for a 12-month period 6        ending in September is zero or, when compared with the 7        preceding period, decreases, then the annuity shall 8        not be increased.9            For the purposes of this Section, "consumer price 10        index-u" means the index published by the Bureau of 11        Labor Statistics of the United States Department of 12        Labor that measures the average change in prices of 13        goods and services purchased by all urban consumers, 14        United States city average, all items, 1982-84 = 100. 15        The new amount resulting from each annual adjustment 16        shall be determined by the Public Pension Division of 17        the Department of Insurance and made available to the 18        boards of the pension funds.19            (F) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this 20        paragraph (1), for a qualified surviving spouse who is 21        entitled to a Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity under 22        subdivision (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this paragraph 23        (1), that Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity shall not 24        be less than the amount of the minimum widow's annuity 25        established from time to time under Section 5-167.4.26        (2) Surviving children of a deceased policeman subject   10400HB3657sam002- 10 -LRB104 08622 RPS 26821 a1    to this Section who would otherwise meet the eligibility 2    requirements for a child's annuity set forth in Sections 3    5-151 and 5-152 shall be deemed qualified to receive a 4    Tier 2 child's annuity under this subsection (c), which 5    shall be in lieu of, but in the same amount and paid in the 6    same manner as, the child's annuity provided under those 7    Sections; except that any salary used for computing a Tier 8    2 child's annuity shall be subject to the Tier 2 salary cap 9    provided under subsection (b) of this Section. For 10    purposes of determining any pro rata reduction in child's 11    annuities under this subsection (c), references in Section 12    5-152 to the combined annuities of the family shall be 13    deemed to refer to the combined Tier 2 surviving spouse's 14    annuity, if any, and the Tier 2 child's annuities payable 15    under this subsection (c).16        (3) Surviving parents of a deceased policeman subject 17    to this Section who would otherwise meet the eligibility 18    requirements for a parent's annuity set forth in Section 19    5-152 shall be deemed qualified to receive a Tier 2 20    parent's annuity under this subsection (c), which shall be 21    in lieu of, but in the same amount and paid in the same 22    manner as, the parent's annuity provided under Section 23    5-152.1; except that any salary used for computing a Tier 24    2 parent's annuity shall be subject to the Tier 2 salary 25    cap provided under subsection (b) of this Section.

The Tier 2 monthly retirement annuity is in lieu 10of any age and service annuity or other form of retirement 11annuity under this Article.12    The maximum retirement annuity under this subsection (b) 13shall be 75% of final average salary.14    For the purposes of this subsection (b), "final average 15salary" means the greater of: (i) the average monthly salary 16obtained by dividing the total salary of the policeman during 17the 96 consecutive months of service within the last 120 18months of service in which the total salary was the highest by 19the number of months of service in that period; or (ii) the 20average monthly salary obtained by dividing the total salary 21of the policeman during the 48 consecutive months of service 22within the last 60 months of service in which the total salary 23was the highest by the number of months of service in that 24period. 25    Beginning on January 1, 2011, for all purposes under this 26Code (including without limitation the calculation of benefits   10400HB3657sam002- 3 -LRB104 08622 RPS 26821 a1and employee contributions), the annual salary based on the 2plan year of a member or participant to whom this Section 3applies shall not exceed $106,800; however, beginning July 1, 42025, the annual salary shall not exceed $141,407.74 and that 5amount shall annually thereafter be increased by the lesser of 6(i) 3% of that amount, including all previous adjustments, or 7(ii) one-half the annual unadjusted percentage increase (but 8not less than zero) in the consumer price index-u for the 12 9months ending with the September preceding each November 1, 10including all previous adjustments. 11    Nothing in this amendatory Act of the 104th General 12Assembly shall cause or otherwise result in any retroactive 13adjustment of any employee contributions. 14    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, 15for a person who first becomes a policeman under this Article 16on or after January 1, 2011, eligibility for and the amount of 17the annuity to which the qualified surviving spouse, children, 18and parents are entitled under this subsection (c) shall be 19determined as follows:20        (1) The surviving spouse of a deceased policeman to 21    whom this Section applies shall be deemed qualified to 22    receive a Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity under this 23    paragraph (1) if: (i) the deceased policeman meets the 24    requirements specified under subdivision (A), (B), (C), or 25    (D) of this paragraph (1); and (ii) the surviving spouse 26    would not otherwise be excluded from receiving a widow's   10400HB3657sam002- 4 -LRB104 08622 RPS 26821 a1    annuity under the eligibility requirements for a widow's 2    annuity set forth in Section 5-146. The Tier 2 surviving 3    spouse's annuity is in lieu of the widow's annuity 4    determined under any other Section of this Article and is 5    subject to the requirements of Section 5-147.1.6        As used in this subsection (c), "earned annuity" means 7    a Tier 2 monthly retirement annuity determined under 8    subsection (b) of this Section, including any increases 9    the policeman had received pursuant to Section 5-167.1. 10            (A) If the deceased policeman was receiving an 11        earned annuity at the date of his or her death, the 12        Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity under this paragraph 13        (1) shall be in the amount of 66 2/3% of the 14        policeman's earned annuity at the date of death.15            If the deceased policeman was a parent of a child 16        or children, including any child who has been 17        conceived but not yet born, and there is a surviving 18        spouse, 12% of the policeman's earned annuity at the 19        date of death shall be granted to the guardian of any 20        such minor child or children for each such child until 21        attainment of age 18.

If the unadjusted percentage change 5        in the consumer price index-u for a 12-month period 6        ending in September is zero or, when compared with the 7        preceding period, decreases, then the annuity shall 8        not be increased.9            For the purposes of this Section, "consumer price 10        index-u" means the index published by the Bureau of 11        Labor Statistics of the United States Department of 12        Labor that measures the average change in prices of 13        goods and services purchased by all urban consumers, 14        United States city average, all items, 1982-84 = 100. 15        The new amount resulting from each annual adjustment 16        shall be determined by the Public Pension Division of 17        the Department of Insurance and made available to the 18        boards of the pension funds.19            (F) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this 20        paragraph (1), for a qualified surviving spouse who is 21        entitled to a Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity under 22        subdivision (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this paragraph 23        (1), that Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity shall not 24        be less than the amount of the minimum widow's annuity 25        established from time to time under Section 5-167.4.26        (2) Surviving children of a deceased policeman subject   10400HB3657sam002- 10 -LRB104 08622 RPS 26821 a1    to this Section who would otherwise meet the eligibility 2    requirements for a child's annuity set forth in Sections 3    5-151 and 5-152 shall be deemed qualified to receive a 4    Tier 2 child's annuity under this subsection (c), which 5    shall be in lieu of, but in the same amount and paid in the 6    same manner as, the child's annuity provided under those 7    Sections; except that any salary used for computing a Tier 8    2 child's annuity shall be subject to the Tier 2 salary cap 9    provided under subsection (b) of this Section.
