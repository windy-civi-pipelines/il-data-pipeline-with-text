The plan shall also consider the use of renewable 20energy, energy storage, demand response, transmission 21development, or other strategies to resolve the identified 22resource adequacy shortfall or reliability violation.23        (1) In developing the plan, the Environmental 24    Protection Agency and the Illinois Power Agency shall hold 25    at least one workshop open to, and accessible at a time and 26    place convenient to, the public and shall consider any   HB1546- 13 -LRB104 03414 BDA 13436 b1    comments made by stakeholders or the public. Upon 2    development of the plan, copies of the plan shall be 3    posted and made publicly available on the Environmental 4    Protection Agency's, the Illinois Power Agency's, and the 5    Illinois Commerce Commission's websites. All interested 6    parties shall have 60 days following the date of posting 7    to provide comment to the Environmental Protection Agency 8    and the Illinois Power Agency on the plan. All comments 9    submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency and the 10    Illinois Power Agency shall be encouraged to be specific, 11    supported by data or other detailed analyses, and, if 12    objecting to all or a portion of the plan, accompanied by 13    specific alternative wording or proposals. All comments 14    shall be posted on the Environmental Protection Agency's, 15    the Illinois Power Agency's, and the Illinois Commerce 16    Commission's websites. Within 30 days following the end of 17    the 60-day review period, the Environmental Protection 18    Agency and the Illinois Power Agency shall revise the plan 19    as necessary based on the comments received and file its 20    revised plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission for 21    approval.22        (2) Within 60 days after the filing of the revised 23    plan at the Illinois Commerce Commission, any person 24    objecting to the plan shall file an objection with the 25    Illinois Commerce Commission. Within 30 days after the 26    expiration of the comment period, the Illinois Commerce   HB1546- 14 -LRB104 03414 BDA 13436 b1    Commission shall determine whether an evidentiary hearing 2    is necessary. The Illinois Commerce Commission shall also 3    host 3 public hearings within 90 days after the plan is 4    filed. Following the evidentiary and public hearings, the 5    Illinois Commerce Commission shall enter its order 6    approving or approving with modifications the reliability 7    mitigation plan within 180 days.8        (3) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall only 9    approve the plan if the Illinois Commerce Commission 10    determines that it will resolve the resource adequacy or 11    reliability deficiency identified in the reliability 12    mitigation plan at the least amount of CO2e and copollutant 13    emissions, taking into consideration the emissions impacts 14    on environmental justice communities, and that it will 15    ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and 16    environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest 17    total cost over time, taking into account the impact of 18    increases in emissions.19        (4) If the resource adequacy or reliability deficiency 20    identified in the reliability mitigation plan is resolved 21    or reduced, the Environmental Protection Agency and the 22    Illinois Power Agency may file an amended plan adjusting 23    the reduction or delay in CO2e and copollutant emission 24    reduction requirements identified in the plan. 25(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 102-1031, eff. 5-27-22.)

If the Environmental 23Protection Agency, Illinois Power Agency, and Illinois 24Commerce Commission jointly conclude in the report that the 25data from the regional grid operators, the pace of renewable 26energy development, the pace of development of energy storage   HB1546- 12 -LRB104 03414 BDA 13436 b1and demand response utilization, transmission capacity, and 2the CO2e and copollutant emissions reductions required by 3subsection (i) or (k-5) reasonably demonstrate that a resource 4adequacy shortfall will occur, including whether there will be 5sufficient in-state capacity to meet the zonal requirements of 6MISO Zone 4 or the PJM ComEd Zone, per the requirements of the 7regional transmission organizations, or that the regional 8transmission operators determine that a reliability violation 9will occur during the time frame the study is evaluating, then 10the Illinois Power Agency, in conjunction with the 11Environmental Protection Agency shall develop a plan to reduce 12or delay CO2e and copollutant emissions reductions 13requirements only to the extent and for the duration necessary 14to meet the resource adequacy and reliability needs of the 15State, including allowing any plants whose emission reduction 16deadline has been identified in the plan as creating a 17reliability concern to continue operating, including operating 18with reduced emissions or as emergency backup where 19appropriate. The plan shall also consider the use of renewable 20energy, energy storage, demand response, transmission 21development, or other strategies to resolve the identified 22resource adequacy shortfall or reliability violation.23        (1) In developing the plan, the Environmental 24    Protection Agency and the Illinois Power Agency shall hold 25    at least one workshop open to, and accessible at a time and 26    place convenient to, the public and shall consider any   HB1546- 13 -LRB104 03414 BDA 13436 b1    comments made by stakeholders or the public. Upon 2    development of the plan, copies of the plan shall be 3    posted and made publicly available on the Environmental 4    Protection Agency's, the Illinois Power Agency's, and the 5    Illinois Commerce Commission's websites. All interested 6    parties shall have 60 days following the date of posting 7    to provide comment to the Environmental Protection Agency 8    and the Illinois Power Agency on the plan. All comments 9    submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency and the 10    Illinois Power Agency shall be encouraged to be specific, 11    supported by data or other detailed analyses, and, if 12    objecting to all or a portion of the plan, accompanied by 13    specific alternative wording or proposals. All comments 14    shall be posted on the Environmental Protection Agency's, 15    the Illinois Power Agency's, and the Illinois Commerce 16    Commission's websites. Within 30 days following the end of 17    the 60-day review period, the Environmental Protection 18    Agency and the Illinois Power Agency shall revise the plan 19    as necessary based on the comments received and file its 20    revised plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission for 21    approval.22        (2) Within 60 days after the filing of the revised 23    plan at the Illinois Commerce Commission, any person 24    objecting to the plan shall file an objection with the 25    Illinois Commerce Commission. Within 30 days after the 26    expiration of the comment period, the Illinois Commerce   HB1546- 14 -LRB104 03414 BDA 13436 b1    Commission shall determine whether an evidentiary hearing 2    is necessary. The Illinois Commerce Commission shall also 3    host 3 public hearings within 90 days after the plan is 4    filed. Following the evidentiary and public hearings, the 5    Illinois Commerce Commission shall enter its order 6    approving or approving with modifications the reliability 7    mitigation plan within 180 days.8        (3) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall only 9    approve the plan if the Illinois Commerce Commission 10    determines that it will resolve the resource adequacy or 11    reliability deficiency identified in the reliability 12    mitigation plan at the least amount of CO2e and copollutant 13    emissions, taking into consideration the emissions impacts 14    on environmental justice communities, and that it will 15    ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and 16    environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest 17    total cost over time, taking into account the impact of 18    increases in emissions.19        (4) If the resource adequacy or reliability deficiency 20    identified in the reliability mitigation plan is resolved 21    or reduced, the Environmental Protection Agency and the 22    Illinois Power Agency may file an amended plan adjusting 23    the reduction or delay in CO2e and copollutant emission 24    reduction requirements identified in the plan. 25(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 102-1031, eff. 5-27-22.)
