And so often thereafter as it shall 24appear by the number of votes cast at the general election held 25in November of any year, that any election district or 26undivided election precinct contains more than 1,200   SB0181- 20 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1registered voters, the County Board of the county in which the 2district or precinct may be, shall at its regular meeting in 3June, or an adjourned meeting in July next, after such 4November election, redivide or readjust such election district 5or election precinct, so that no district or election precinct 6shall contain more than the number of votes above specified. 7If for any reason the County Board fails in any year to 8redivide or readjust the election districts or election 9precinct, then the districts or precincts as then existing 10shall continue until the next regular June meeting of the 11County Board; at which regular June meeting or an adjourned 12meeting in July the County Board shall redivide or readjust 13the election districts or election precincts in manner as 14herein required. When at any meeting of the County Board any 15redivision, readjustment or change in name or number of 16election districts or election precincts is made by the County 17Board, the County Clerk shall immediately notify the State 18Board of Elections of such redivision, readjustment or change. 19The County Board in every case shall fix and establish the 20places for holding elections in its respective county and all 21elections shall be held at the places so fixed. The polling 22places shall in all cases be upon the ground floor in the front 23room, the entrance to which is in a highway or public street 24which is at least 40 feet wide, and is as near the center of 25the voting population of the precinct as is practicable, and 26for the convenience of the greatest number of electors to vote   SB0181- 21 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1thereat; provided, however, where the County Board is unable 2to secure a suitable polling place within the boundaries of a 3precinct, it may select a polling place at the most 4conveniently located suitable place outside the precinct; but 5in no case shall an election be held in any residential 6building, including, but not limited to, an apartment or 7dormitory, or any room used or occupied as a saloon, dramshop, 8bowling alley or as a place of resort for idlers and 9disreputable persons, billiard hall or in any room connected 10therewith by doors or hallways. No person shall be permitted 11to vote at any election except at the polling place for the 12precinct in which he resides, except as otherwise provided in 13this Section or Article 19 of this Act. In counties having a 14population of 3,000,000 inhabitants or over the County Board 15shall divide its election precincts and shall fix and 16establish places for holding elections as hereinbefore 17provided during the month of January instead of at its regular 18meeting in June or at an adjourned meeting in July.19    However, in the event that additional divisions of 20election precincts are indicated after a division made by the 21County Board in the month of January, such additional 22divisions may be made by the County Board in counties having a 23population of 3,000,000 inhabitants or over, at the regular 24meeting in June or at adjourned meeting in July. The county 25board of such county may divide or readjust precincts at any 26meeting of the county board when the voter registration in a   SB0181- 22 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1precinct has increased beyond 1,800 registered voters and an 2election is scheduled before the next regular January or June 3meeting of the county board.4    When in any city, village or incorporated town territory 5has been annexed thereto or disconnected therefrom, which 6annexation or disconnection becomes effective after election 7precincts or election districts have been established as above 8provided in this Section, the clerk of the municipality shall 9inform the county clerk thereof as provided in Section 4-21, 105-28.1, or 6-31.1, whichever is applicable. In the event that 11a regular meeting of the County Board is to be held after such 12notification and before any election, the County Board shall, 13at its next regular meeting establish new election precinct 14lines in affected territory. In the event that no regular 15meeting of the County Board is to be held before such election 16the county clerk shall, within 5 days after being so informed, 17call a special meeting of the county board on a day fixed by 18him not more than 20 days thereafter for the purpose of 19establishing election precincts or election districts in the 20affected territory for the ensuing elections.21    At any consolidated primary or consolidated election at 22which municipal officers are to be elected, and at any 23emergency referendum at which a public question relating to a 24municipality is to be voted on, notwithstanding any other 25provision of this Code, the election authority shall establish 26a polling place within such municipality, upon the request of   SB0181- 23 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1the municipal council or board of trustees at least 60 days 2before the election and provided that the municipality 3provides a suitable polling place. To accomplish this purpose, 4the election authority may establish an election precinct 5constituting a single municipality of under 500 population for 6all elections, notwithstanding the minimum precinct size 7otherwise specified herein.8    Notwithstanding the above, when there are no more than 50 9registered voters in a precinct who are entitled to vote in a 10local government or school district election, the election 11authority having jurisdiction over the precinct is authorized 12to reassign such voters to one or more polling places in 13adjacent precincts, within or without the election authority's 14jurisdiction, for that election. For the purposes of such 15local government or school district election only, the votes 16of the reassigned voters shall be tallied and canvassed as 17votes from the precinct of the polling place to which such 18voters have been reassigned. The election authority having 19jurisdiction over the precinct shall approve all 20administrative and polling place procedures. Such procedures 21shall take into account voter convenience, and ensure that the 22integrity of the election process is maintained and that the 23secrecy of the ballot is not violated.24    Except in the event of a fire, flood or total loss of heat 25in a place fixed or established by any county board or election 26authority pursuant to this Section as a polling place for an   SB0181- 24 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1election, no election authority shall change the location of a 2polling place so established for any precinct after notice of 3the place of holding the election for that precinct has been 4given as required under Article 12 unless the election 5authority notifies all registered voters in the precinct of 6the change in location by first class mail in sufficient time 7for such notice to be received by the registered voters in the 8precinct at least one day prior to the date of the election.9    The provisions of this Section apply to all precincts, 10including those where voting machines or electronic voting 11systems are used.12(Source: P.A. 102-668, eff. 11-15-21.) 13    (10 ILCS 5/11-8)14    (Section scheduled to be repealed on July 1, 2029)15    Sec. 11-8.

Election authorities may establish more than one vote 3center, but in jurisdictions with a population of more than 4500,000 inhabitants, the election authority shall establish at 5least 2 vote centers. An election authority establishing such 6a vote center location under this Section shall identify the 7locations location and any health and safety requirements by 8the 40th day preceding an election and shall certify such to 9the State Board of Elections.10    (b) This Section is repealed on July 1, 2029.11(Source: P.A. 102-15, eff. 6-17-21; 102-668, eff. 11-15-21; 12102-1109, eff. 12-21-22; 103-467, eff. 8-4-23.) 13    (10 ILCS 5/16-5)  (from Ch. 46, par. 16-5)14    Sec. 16-5.

Ballots shall be 23printed and in possession of the respective election 24authorities at least two days before each election and subject 25to the inspection of candidates and their agents; if any   SB0181- 26 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1mistakes be discovered they shall be corrected without delay. 2The election authority shall cause to be delivered to the 3judges of election at the polling place of each precinct or 4district, not less than twelve hours before the time fixed by 5law for the opening of the polls therein, at least 10% more 6ballots of the kind to be voted in such precinct or district 7than the number of voters registered therein for the purposes 8of such election, such ballots shall be put up in separate 9sealed packages, with marks on the outside clearly designating 10the polling place for which they are intended and the number of 11ballots enclosed, and receipt therefor shall be given by the 12judges of election to whom they are delivered, which receipt 13shall be preserved by the election authority. The election 14authority shall provide and retain at its office an ample 15supply of ballots, in addition to those distributed to the 16several voting precincts or districts, and if at any time on or 17before the day of election the ballots furnished to any 18precinct shall be lost, destroyed or exhausted before the 19polls are closed, on written application signed by a majority 20of the judges he or they shall immediately cause to be 21delivered to such judges at the polling place, such additional 22supply of ballots as may be required and sufficient to comply 23with the provisions of this Act.24    (b) No person, other than a person acting on behalf of an 25election authority, shall print and distribute ballots to the 26judges of election at a polling place at a precinct or   SB0181- 27 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1district.2    (c) Each election authority shall keep a secure record of 3the number of ballots printed and distributed to the judges of 4election at each polling place of each precinct or district. 5The State Board of Elections shall develop standards that each 6election authority shall implement for the 2026 general 7primary election, and all subsequent elections, to count and 8track the number of ballots printed and distributed as 9described in this Section.10(Source: P.A. 80-1469.) 11    (10 ILCS 5/17-9)  (from Ch. 46, par. 17-9)12    Sec. 17-9.

Judges of election shall enforce the 19provisions of this Section.20    (b) Election officers shall place 2 or more cones, small 21United States national flags, or some other marker a distance 22of 100 horizontal feet from each entrance to the room used by 23voters to engage in voting, which shall be known as the polling 24room. If the polling room is located within a building that is   SB0181- 33 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1a private business, a public or private school, or a church or 2other organization founded for the purpose of religious 3worship and the distance of 100 horizontal feet ends within 4the interior of the building, then the markers shall be placed 5outside of the building at each entrance used by voters to 6enter that building on the grounds adjacent to the 7thoroughfare or walkway. If the polling room is located within 8a public or private building with 2 or more floors and the 9polling room is located on the ground floor, then the markers 10shall be placed 100 horizontal feet from each entrance to the 11polling room used by voters to engage in voting. If the polling 12room is located in a public or private building with 2 or more 13floors and the polling room is located on a floor above or 14below the ground floor, then the markers shall be placed a 15distance of 100 feet from the nearest elevator or staircase 16used by voters on the ground floor to access the floor where 17the polling room is located. The area within where the markers 18are placed shall be known as a campaign free zone, and 19electioneering is prohibited pursuant to this subsection. 20Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a church 21or private school may choose to apply the campaign free zone to 22its entire property, and, if so, the markers shall be placed 23near the boundaries on the grounds adjacent to the 24thoroughfares or walkways leading to the entrances used by the 25voters.

A voter 16whose ballot is identified as under-voted for a statewide 17constitutional office may return to the voting booth and 18complete the voting of that ballot. A voter whose ballot is not 19accepted by the voting equipment may, upon surrendering the 20ballot, request and vote another ballot. The voter's 21surrendered ballot shall be initialed by the election judge 22and handled as provided in the appropriate Article governing 23that voting equipment.24    The voter shall, upon quitting the voting booth, deliver 25to one of the judges of election all of the ballots, properly 26folded, which he received. The judge of election to whom the   SB0181- 40 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1voter delivers his ballots shall not accept the same unless 2all of the ballots given to the voter are returned by him. If a 3voter delivers less than all of the ballots given to him, the 4judge to whom the same are offered shall advise him in a voice 5clearly audible to the other judges of election that the voter 6must return the remainder of the ballots. The statement of the 7judge to the voter shall clearly express the fact that the 8voter is not required to vote such remaining ballots but that 9whether or not he votes them he must fold and deliver them to 10the judge. In making such statement the judge of election 11shall not indicate by word, gesture or intonation of voice 12that the unreturned ballots shall be voted in any particular 13manner. No new voter shall be permitted to enter the voting 14booth of a voter who has failed to deliver the total number of 15ballots received by him until such voter has returned to the 16voting booth pursuant to the judge's request and again quit 17the booth with all of the ballots required to be returned by 18him. Upon receipt of all such ballots the judges of election 19shall enter the name of the voter, and his number, as above 20provided in this Section, and the judge to whom the ballots are 21delivered shall immediately put the ballots into the ballot 22box. If any voter who has failed to deliver all the ballots 23received by him refuses to return to the voting booth after 24being advised by the judge of election as herein provided, the 25judge shall inform the other judges of such refusal, and 26thereupon the ballot or ballots returned to the judge shall be   SB0181- 41 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1deposited in the ballot box, the voter shall be permitted to 2depart from the polling place, and a new voter shall be 3permitted to enter the voting booth. 4    The judge of election who receives the ballot or ballots 5from the voter shall announce the residence and name of such 6voter in a loud voice. The judge shall put the ballot or 7ballots received from the voter into the ballot box in the 8presence of the voter and the judges of election, and in plain 9view of the public. The judges having charge of such registers 10shall then, in a column prepared thereon, in the same line of, 11the name of the voter, mark "Voted" or the letter "V". 12    No judge of election shall accept from any voter less than 13the full number of ballots received by such voter without 14first advising the voter in the manner above provided of the 15necessity of returning all of the ballots, nor shall any such 16judge advise such voter in a manner contrary to that which is 17herein permitted, or in any other manner violate the 18provisions of this Section; provided, that the acceptance by a 19judge of election of less than the full number of ballots 20delivered to a voter who refuses to return to the voting booth 21after being properly advised by such judge shall not be a 22violation of this Section. 23(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 24    (10 ILCS 5/18A-5)25    Sec. 18A-5.

The election 16    judge shall place the original written affidavit in a 17    self-adhesive clear plastic packing list envelope that 18    must be attached to a separate envelope marked as a 19    "provisional ballot envelope". The election judge shall 20    also place any information provided by the person who 21    casts a provisional ballot in the clear plastic packing 22    list envelope. Each county clerk or board of election 23    commissioners, as the case may be, must design, obtain or 24    procure self-adhesive clear plastic packing list envelopes 25    and provisional ballot envelopes that are suitable for 26    implementing this subsection (b)(4) of this Section.  SB0181- 46 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1        (5) The election judge shall provide the person with a 2    provisional ballot, written instructions for casting a 3    provisional ballot, and the provisional ballot envelope 4    with the clear plastic packing list envelope affixed to 5    it, which contains the person's original written affidavit 6    and, if any, information provided by the provisional voter 7    to support his or her claim that he or she is a duly 8    registered voter. An election judge must also give the 9    person written information that states that any person who 10    casts a provisional ballot shall be able to ascertain, 11    pursuant to guidelines established by the State Board of 12    Elections, whether the provisional vote was counted in the 13    official canvass of votes for that election and, if the 14    provisional vote was not counted, the reason that the vote 15    was not counted.16        (6) After the person has completed marking his or her 17    provisional ballot, he or she shall place the marked 18    ballot inside of the provisional ballot envelope, close 19    and seal the envelope, and return the envelope to an 20    election judge, who shall then deposit the sealed 21    provisional ballot envelope into a securable container 22    separately identified and utilized for containing sealed 23    provisional ballot envelopes.

Upon the 26    closing of the polls, the securable container shall be   SB0181- 47 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1    sealed with filament tape provided for that purpose, which 2    shall be wrapped around the box lengthwise and crosswise, 3    at least twice each way, and each of the election judges 4    shall sign the seal.5    (c) Instead of the affidavit form described in subsection 6(b), the county clerk or board of election commissioners, as 7the case may be, may design and use a multi-part affidavit form 8that is imprinted upon or attached to the provisional ballot 9envelope described in subsection (b). If a county clerk or 10board of election commissioners elects to design and use its 11own multi-part affidavit form, then the county clerk or board 12of election commissioners shall establish a mechanism for 13accepting any information the provisional voter has supplied 14to the election judge to support his or her claim that he or 15she is a duly registered voter. In all other respects, a county 16clerk or board of election commissioners shall establish 17procedures consistent with subsection (b).18    (d) The county clerk or board of election commissioners, 19as the case may be, shall use the completed affidavit form 20described in subsection (b) to update the person's voter 21registration information in the State voter registration 22database and voter registration database of the county clerk 23or board of election commissioners, as the case may be. If a 24person is later determined not to be a registered voter based 25on Section 18A-15 of this Code, then the affidavit shall be 26processed by the county clerk or board of election   SB0181- 48 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1commissioners, as the case may be, as a voter registration 2application.3(Source: P.A. 100-201, eff. 8-18-17.) 4    (10 ILCS 5/18A-15)5    Sec. 18A-15. Validating and counting provisional ballots. 6    (a) The county clerk or board of election commissioners 7shall complete the validation and counting of provisional 8ballots within 7 14 calendar days after of the day of the 9election. The county clerk or board of election commissioners 10shall have 7 calendar days from the completion of the 11validation and counting of provisional ballots to conduct its 12final canvass. The State Board of Elections shall complete 13within 31 calendar days of the election or sooner if all the 14returns are received, its final canvass of the vote for all 15public offices.16    (b) If a county clerk or board of election commissioners 17determines that all of the following apply, then a provisional 18ballot is valid and shall be counted as a vote:19        (1) the provisional voter cast the provisional ballot 20    in the correct precinct based on the address provided by 21    the provisional voter. The provisional voter's affidavit 22    shall serve as a change of address request by that voter 23    for registration purposes for the next ensuing election if 24    it bears an address different from that in the records of 25    the election authority. Votes for federal and statewide   SB0181- 49 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1    offices on a provisional ballot cast in the incorrect 2    precinct that meet the other requirements of this 3    subsection shall be valid and counted in accordance with 4    this Article. As used in this item, "federal office" is 5    defined as provided in Section 20-1 and "statewide office" 6    means the Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, 7    Comptroller, and Treasurer. Votes for General Assembly, 8    countywide, citywide, or township office on a provisional 9    ballot cast in the incorrect precinct but in the correct 10    legislative district, representative district, county, 11    municipality, or township, as the case may be, shall be 12    valid and counted in accordance with this Article. As used 13    in this item, "citywide office" means an office elected by 14    the electors of an entire municipality. As used in this 15    item, "township office" means an office elected by the 16    electors of an entire township;17        (2) the affidavit executed by the provisional voter 18    pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5 contains, 19    at a minimum, the provisional voter's first and last name, 20    house number and street name, and signature or mark;21        (3) except as permitted by item (5) of subsection (b) 22    of this Section, the provisional voter is a registered 23    voter based on information available to the county clerk 24    or board of election commissioners provided by or obtained 25    from any of the following:26            i. the provisional voter;  SB0181- 50 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1            ii. an election judge;2            iii. the statewide voter registration database 3        maintained by the State Board of Elections;4            iv. the records of the county clerk or board of 5        election commissioners' database; or6            v. the records of the Secretary of State; and7        (4) for a provisional ballot cast under item (6) of 8    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter did not vote by 9    mail ballot in the election at which the provisional 10    ballot was cast; or 11        (5) for a provisional ballot cast under item (7) of 12    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter provides the 13    election authority with the necessary documentation within 14    7 days of election day. 15    (c) With respect to subsection (b)(3) of this Section, the 16county clerk or board of election commissioners shall 17investigate and record whether or not the specified 18information is available from each of the 5 identified 19sources. If the information is available from one or more of 20the identified sources, then the county clerk or board of 21election commissioners shall seek to obtain the information 22from each of those sources until satisfied, with information 23from at least one of those sources, that the provisional voter 24is registered and entitled to vote. The county clerk or board 25of election commissioners shall use any information it obtains 26as the basis for determining the voter registration status of   SB0181- 51 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1the provisional voter. If a conflict exists among the 2information available to the county clerk or board of election 3commissioners as to the registration status of the provisional 4voter, then the county clerk or board of election 5commissioners shall make a determination based on the totality 6of the circumstances. In a case where the above information 7equally supports or opposes the registration status of the 8voter, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 9shall decide in favor of the provisional voter as being duly 10registered to vote. If the statewide voter registration 11database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 12that the provisional voter is registered to vote, but the 13county clerk's or board of election commissioners' voter 14registration database indicates that the provisional voter is 15not registered to vote, then the information found in the 16statewide voter registration database shall control the matter 17and the provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to 18vote. If the records of the county clerk or board of election 19commissioners indicates that the provisional voter is 20registered to vote, but the statewide voter registration 21database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 22that the provisional voter is not registered to vote, then the 23information found in the records of the county clerk or board 24of election commissioners shall control the matter and the 25provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to vote. If 26the provisional voter's signature on his or her provisional   SB0181- 52 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1ballot request varies from the signature on an otherwise valid 2registration application solely because of the substitution of 3initials for the first or middle name, the election authority 4may not reject the provisional ballot.5    (d) In validating the registration status of a person 6casting a provisional ballot, the county clerk or board of 7election commissioners shall not require a provisional voter 8to complete any form other than the affidavit executed by the 9provisional voter under subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5. In 10addition, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 11shall not require all provisional voters or any particular 12class or group of provisional voters to appear personally 13before the county clerk or board of election commissioners or 14as a matter of policy require provisional voters to submit 15additional information to verify or otherwise support the 16information already submitted by the provisional voter. Within 172 calendar days after the election, the election authority 18shall transmit by electronic means pursuant to a process 19established by the State Board of Elections the name, street 20address, e-mail address, and precinct, ward, township, and 21district numbers, as the case may be, of each person casting a 22provisional ballot to the State Board of Elections, which 23shall maintain those names and that information in an 24electronic format on its website, arranged by county and 25accessible to State and local political committees. The 26provisional voter may, within 7 calendar days after the   SB0181- 53 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1election, submit additional information to the county clerk or 2board of election commissioners, except that in the case of 3provisional voting under paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of 4Section 18A-5, the provisional voter has 7 days to provide the 5county clerk or board of election commissioners with the 6required photo identification card. This information must be 7received by the county clerk or board of election 8commissioners within the applicable 7-calendar-day or 910-calendar-day period.10    (e) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 11determines that subsection (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) does not 12apply, then the provisional ballot is not valid and may not be 13counted. The provisional ballot envelope containing the ballot 14cast by the provisional voter may not be opened. The county 15clerk or board of election commissioners shall write on the 16provisional ballot envelope the following: "Provisional ballot 17determined invalid.".18    (f) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 19determines that a provisional ballot is valid under this 20Section, then the provisional ballot envelope shall be opened. 21The outside of each provisional ballot envelope shall also be 22marked to identify the precinct and the date of the election.23    (g) Provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be 24counted at the election authority's central ballot counting 25location and shall not be counted in precincts. The 26provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be added to   SB0181- 54 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1the vote totals for the precincts from which they were cast in 2the order in which the ballots were opened. The validation and 3counting of provisional ballots shall be subject to the 4provisions of this Code that apply to pollwatchers. If the 5provisional ballots are a ballot of a punch card voting 6system, then the provisional ballot shall be counted in a 7manner consistent with Article 24A. If the provisional ballots 8are a ballot of optical scan or other type of approved 9electronic voting system, then the provisional ballots shall 10be counted in a manner consistent with Article 24B.11    (h) As soon as the ballots have been counted, the election 12judges or election officials shall, in the presence of the 13county clerk or board of election commissioners, place each of 14the following items in a separate envelope or bag: (1) all 15provisional ballots, voted or spoiled; (2) all provisional 16ballot envelopes of provisional ballots voted or spoiled; and 17(3) all executed affidavits of the provisional ballots voted 18or spoiled. All provisional ballot envelopes for provisional 19voters who have been determined not to be registered to vote 20shall remain sealed. The county clerk or board of election 21commissioners shall treat the provisional ballot envelope 22containing the written affidavit as a voter registration 23application for that person for the next election and process 24that application. The election judges or election officials 25shall then securely seal each envelope or bag, initial the 26envelope or bag, and plainly mark on the outside of the   SB0181- 55 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1envelope or bag in ink the precinct in which the provisional 2ballots were cast. The election judges or election officials 3shall then place each sealed envelope or bag into a box, secure 4and seal it in the same manner as described in item (6) of 5subsection (b) of Section 18A-5. Each election judge or 6election official shall take and subscribe an oath before the 7county clerk or board of election commissioners that the 8election judge or election official securely kept the ballots 9and papers in the box, did not permit any person to open the 10box or otherwise touch or tamper with the ballots and papers in 11the box, and has no knowledge of any other person opening the 12box. For purposes of this Section, the term "election 13official" means the county clerk, a member of the board of 14election commissioners, as the case may be, and their 15respective employees.16(Source: P.A. 97-766, eff. 7-6-12; 98-115, eff. 7-29-13; 1798-691, eff. 7-1-14; 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 18    (10 ILCS 5/19-2)  (from Ch. 46, par. 19-2)19    Sec. 19-2.

The 24registration places so designated shall be open from 8:00 25o'clock a.m. until 9:00 o'clock p.m. on each of such days of   SB0181- 10 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1registration.2    The first of said two days of registration shall be on 3Saturday preceding the Tuesday four weeks before said 4election; the second of said two days of registration shall be 5on Tuesday three weeks preceding said election; provided, 6however, that in cities, villages and incorporated towns of 7200,000 or more, having a board of election commissioners, and 8in cities, villages and incorporated towns within the 9jurisdiction of said board of election commissioners, the 10first day of registration shall be on Saturday preceding the 11Tuesday six weeks preceding said election; and the second day 12of such registration shall be on Tuesday four weeks preceding 13said election.14    In addition to the two days of registration hereinabove 15provided, the Board of Election Commissioners may provide for 16additional days of registration (not exceeding two) before 17said election. The last day so designated shall be earlier 18than the last day of registration hereinabove provided for 19cities, villages and incorporated towns under the jurisdiction 20of such Board.21    For the registration held in accordance with the terms of 22this section there shall be a board of registry composed of two 23deputy registrars and one judge of registration for each 24precinct. The political party with which the minority member 25of the Board of Election Commissioners is affiliated, shall be 26entitled to be represented by one deputy registrar in each   SB0181- 11 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1precinct. The political party with which the majority of the 2members of the Board of Election Commissioners are affiliated 3shall be entitled to be represented by one deputy registrar in 4each precinct.5    In the even numbered precincts the political party with 6which a majority of the members of the Board of Election 7Commissioners are affiliated, shall be entitled to be 8represented by the judge of registration.9    In the odd numbered precincts the party represented by the 10minority member of the Board of Election Commissioners shall 11be entitled to be represented by the judge of registration.12    Such board shall cause the printed list and supplement of 13the registration for the previous election to be posted up at 14the place of registration two days before such registration, 15with a printed notice of the time and place of the next 16registration. After the first registration under this article, 17the printed lists required to be posted shall be those for the 18precincts served by the registration places designated by the 19Board of Election Commissioners.20    The election authorities shall issue credentials to 21registration day pollwatchers in the manner and on the terms 22prescribed in Section 17-23 with respect to pollwatchers at 23elections. Registration day pollwatchers shall be allowed to 24see the names and addresses of the people who have registered 25during the course of the day.26    No person shall, at any precinct registration or   SB0181- 12 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1reregistration, do any electioneering or soliciting of votes 2or engage in any political discussion within any precinct 3registration place or within 30 feet thereof. Nothing in this 4Act shall be construed to prohibit any candidate from being 5present in or near any precinct registration place. All 6persons who register to vote at any precinct registration 7place must be residents of the precinct in which they 8register.9    As used in this Section, "electioneering" includes, except 10in the ordinary course of business, the distribution of food 11or drinks to voters.12(Source: P.A. 81-1535.) 13    (10 ILCS 5/6-100)14    Sec. 6-100. Grace period. Notwithstanding any other 15provision of this Code to the contrary, each election 16authority shall establish procedures for the registration of 17voters and for change of address during the period from the 18close of registration for an election until the 7th day before 19the election and including the day of the election. During 20this grace period, an unregistered qualified elector may 21register to vote, and a registered voter may submit a change of 22address form, in person in the office of the election 23authority, at a permanent polling place established under 24Section 19A-10, at any other early voting site beginning 15 25days prior to the election, at a polling place on election day,   SB0181- 13 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1or at a voter registration location specifically designated 2for this purpose by the election authority. Grace period 3registration and changes of address shall also be conducted 4for eligible residents in connection with voting at facilities 5under Section 19-12.2 of this Code. The election authority 6shall register that individual, or change a registered voter's 7address, in the same manner as otherwise provided by this 8Article for registration and change of address.9    If a voter who registers or changes address during this 10grace period wishes to vote at the election or primary 11occurring during the grace period. The election authority 12shall offer in-person grace period voting at the authority's 13office, any permanent polling place established under Section 1419A-10, and at any other early voting site beginning 15 days 15prior to the election, at a polling place on election day, 16where grace period registration is required by this Section; 17and may offer in-person grace period voting at additional 18hours and locations specifically designated for the purpose of 19grace period voting by the election authority. The election 20authority may allow grace period voting by mail only if the 21election authority has no ballots prepared at the authority's 22office. Grace period voting shall be in a manner substantially 23similar to voting under Article 19A. 24    Within one day after a voter casts a grace period ballot, 25or within one day after the ballot is received by the election 26authority if the election authority allows grace period voting   SB0181- 14 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1by mail, the election authority shall transmit by electronic 2means pursuant to a process established by the State Board of 3Elections the voter's name, street address, e-mail address, 4and precinct, ward, township, and district numbers, as the 5case may be, to the State Board of Elections, which shall 6maintain those names and that information in an electronic 7format on its website, arranged by county and accessible to 8State and local political committees. The name of each person 9issued a grace period ballot shall also be placed on the 10appropriate precinct list of persons to whom vote by mail and 11early ballots have been issued, for use as provided in 12Sections 17-9 and 18-5.13    A person who casts a grace period ballot shall not be 14permitted to revoke that ballot and vote another ballot with 15respect to that primary or election. Ballots cast by persons 16who register or change address during the grace period at a 17location other than their designated polling place on election 18day must be transmitted to and counted at the election 19authority's central ballot counting location and shall not be 20transmitted to and counted at precinct polling places. The 21grace period ballots determined to be valid shall be added to 22the vote totals for the precincts for which they were cast in 23the order in which the ballots were opened.24    In counties with a population of less than 100,000 that do 25not have electronic poll books, the election authority may opt 26out of registration in the polling place if the election   SB0181- 15 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1authority establishes grace period registration and voting at 2other sites on election day at the following sites: (i) the 3election authority's main office and (ii) a polling place in 4each municipality where 20% or more of the county's residents 5reside if the election authority's main office is not located 6in that municipality. The election authority may establish 7other grace period registration and voting sites on election 8day provided that the election authority has met the notice 9requirements of Section 19A-25 for permanent and temporary 10early voting sites. 11(Source: P.A. 100-442, eff. 8-25-17.) 12    (10 ILCS 5/7-41)  (from Ch. 46, par. 7-41)13    Sec. 7-41. (a) All officers upon whom is imposed by law the 14duty of designating and providing polling places for general 15elections, shall provide in each such polling place so 16designated and provided, a sufficient number of booths for 17such primary election, which booths shall be provided with 18shelves, such supplies and pencils as will enable the voter to 19prepare his ballot for voting and in which voters may prepare 20their ballots screened from all observation as to the manner 21in which they do so. Such booths shall be within plain view of 22the election officers and both they and the ballot boxes shall 23be within plain view of those within the proximity of the 24voting booths. No person other than election officers and the 25challengers allowed by law and those admitted for the purpose   SB0181- 16 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1of voting, as hereinafter provided, shall be permitted within 2the proximity of the voting booths, except by authority of the 3primary officers to keep order and enforce the law.4    (b) The number of such voting booths shall not be less than 5one to every seventy-five voters or fraction thereof, who 6voted at the last preceding election in the precinct or 7election district.8    (c) No person shall do any electioneering or soliciting of 9votes on primary day within any polling place or within one 10hundred feet of any polling place, or, at the option of a 11church or private school, on any of the property of that church 12or private school that is a polling place. Election officers 13shall place 2 or more cones, small United States national 14flags, or some other marker a distance of 100 horizontal feet 15from each entrance to the room used by voters to engage in 16voting, which shall be known as the polling room. If the 17polling room is located within a building that is a private 18business, a public or private school, or a church or other 19organization founded for the purpose of religious worship and 20the distance of 100 horizontal feet ends within the interior 21of the building, then the markers shall be placed outside of 22the building at each entrance used by voters to enter that 23building on the grounds adjacent to the thoroughfare or 24walkway. If the polling room is located within a public or 25private building with 2 or more floors and the polling room is 26located on the ground floor, then the markers shall be placed   SB0181- 17 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1100 horizontal feet from each entrance to the polling room 2used by voters to engage in voting. If the polling room is 3located in a public or private building with 2 or more floors 4and the polling room is located on a floor above or below the 5ground floor, then the markers shall be placed a distance of 6100 feet from the nearest elevator or staircase used by voters 7on the ground floor to access the floor where the polling room 8is located. The area within where the markers are placed shall 9be known as a campaign free zone, and electioneering is 10prohibited pursuant to this subsection. Notwithstanding any 11other provision of this Section, a church or private school 12may choose to apply the campaign free zone to its entire 13property, and, if so, the markers shall be placed near the 14boundaries on the grounds adjacent to the thoroughfares or 15walkways leading to the entrances used by the voters. At or 16near the door of each polling place, the election judges shall 17place signage indicating the proper entrance to the polling 18place. In addition, the election judges shall ensure that a 19sign identifying the location of the polling place is placed 20on a nearby public roadway. The State Board of Elections shall 21establish guidelines for the placement of polling place 22signage. 23    The area on polling place property beyond the campaign 24free zone, whether publicly or privately owned, is a public 25forum for the time that the polls are open on an election day. 26At the request of election officers any publicly owned   SB0181- 18 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1building must be made available for use as a polling place. A 2person shall have the right to congregate and engage in 3electioneering on any polling place property while the polls 4are open beyond the campaign free zone, including but not 5limited to, the placement of temporary signs. This subsection 6shall be construed liberally in favor of persons engaging in 7electioneering on all polling place property beyond the 8campaign free zone for the time that the polls are open on an 9election day.10    (d) The regulation of electioneering on polling place 11property on an election day, including but not limited to the 12placement of temporary signs, is an exclusive power and 13function of the State. A home rule unit may not regulate 14electioneering and any ordinance or local law contrary to 15subsection (c) is declared void. This is a denial and 16limitation of home rule powers and functions under subsection 17(h) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution.18    (e) As used in this Section, "electioneering" includes, 19except in the ordinary course of business, the distribution of 20food or drinks to voters.21(Source: P.A. 95-699, eff. 11-9-07.) 22    (10 ILCS 5/11-2)  (from Ch. 46, par. 11-2)23    Sec. 11-2. Election precincts. The County Board in each 24county, except in counties having a population of 3,000,000 25inhabitants or over, shall, at its regular meeting in June or   SB0181- 19 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1an adjourned meeting in July, divide its election precincts so 2that each precinct shall contain, as near as may be 3practicable, 1,200 registered voters. Insofar as is 4practicable, each precinct shall be situated within a single 5congressional, legislative and representative district and in 6not more than one County Board district and one municipal 7ward. In order to situate each precinct within a single 8district or ward, the County Board shall change the boundaries 9of election precincts after each decennial census as soon as 10is practicable following the completion of congressional and 11legislative redistricting, except that, in 2021, the county 12board shall change the boundaries at a regular or special 13meeting within 60 days after the effective date of this 14amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly. In determining 15whether a division of precincts should be made, the county 16board may anticipate increased voter registration in any 17precinct in which there is in progress new construction of 18dwelling units which will be occupied by voters more than 30 19days before the next election. Each district shall be composed 20of contiguous territory in as compact form as can be for the 21convenience of the electors voting therein. The several county 22boards in establishing districts shall describe them by metes 23and bounds and number them. And so often thereafter as it shall 24appear by the number of votes cast at the general election held 25in November of any year, that any election district or 26undivided election precinct contains more than 1,200   SB0181- 20 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1registered voters, the County Board of the county in which the 2district or precinct may be, shall at its regular meeting in 3June, or an adjourned meeting in July next, after such 4November election, redivide or readjust such election district 5or election precinct, so that no district or election precinct 6shall contain more than the number of votes above specified. 7If for any reason the County Board fails in any year to 8redivide or readjust the election districts or election 9precinct, then the districts or precincts as then existing 10shall continue until the next regular June meeting of the 11County Board; at which regular June meeting or an adjourned 12meeting in July the County Board shall redivide or readjust 13the election districts or election precincts in manner as 14herein required. When at any meeting of the County Board any 15redivision, readjustment or change in name or number of 16election districts or election precincts is made by the County 17Board, the County Clerk shall immediately notify the State 18Board of Elections of such redivision, readjustment or change. 19The County Board in every case shall fix and establish the 20places for holding elections in its respective county and all 21elections shall be held at the places so fixed. The polling 22places shall in all cases be upon the ground floor in the front 23room, the entrance to which is in a highway or public street 24which is at least 40 feet wide, and is as near the center of 25the voting population of the precinct as is practicable, and 26for the convenience of the greatest number of electors to vote   SB0181- 21 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1thereat; provided, however, where the County Board is unable 2to secure a suitable polling place within the boundaries of a 3precinct, it may select a polling place at the most 4conveniently located suitable place outside the precinct; but 5in no case shall an election be held in any residential 6building, including, but not limited to, an apartment or 7dormitory, or any room used or occupied as a saloon, dramshop, 8bowling alley or as a place of resort for idlers and 9disreputable persons, billiard hall or in any room connected 10therewith by doors or hallways. No person shall be permitted 11to vote at any election except at the polling place for the 12precinct in which he resides, except as otherwise provided in 13this Section or Article 19 of this Act. In counties having a 14population of 3,000,000 inhabitants or over the County Board 15shall divide its election precincts and shall fix and 16establish places for holding elections as hereinbefore 17provided during the month of January instead of at its regular 18meeting in June or at an adjourned meeting in July.19    However, in the event that additional divisions of 20election precincts are indicated after a division made by the 21County Board in the month of January, such additional 22divisions may be made by the County Board in counties having a 23population of 3,000,000 inhabitants or over, at the regular 24meeting in June or at adjourned meeting in July. The county 25board of such county may divide or readjust precincts at any 26meeting of the county board when the voter registration in a   SB0181- 22 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1precinct has increased beyond 1,800 registered voters and an 2election is scheduled before the next regular January or June 3meeting of the county board.4    When in any city, village or incorporated town territory 5has been annexed thereto or disconnected therefrom, which 6annexation or disconnection becomes effective after election 7precincts or election districts have been established as above 8provided in this Section, the clerk of the municipality shall 9inform the county clerk thereof as provided in Section 4-21, 105-28.1, or 6-31.1, whichever is applicable. In the event that 11a regular meeting of the County Board is to be held after such 12notification and before any election, the County Board shall, 13at its next regular meeting establish new election precinct 14lines in affected territory. In the event that no regular 15meeting of the County Board is to be held before such election 16the county clerk shall, within 5 days after being so informed, 17call a special meeting of the county board on a day fixed by 18him not more than 20 days thereafter for the purpose of 19establishing election precincts or election districts in the 20affected territory for the ensuing elections.21    At any consolidated primary or consolidated election at 22which municipal officers are to be elected, and at any 23emergency referendum at which a public question relating to a 24municipality is to be voted on, notwithstanding any other 25provision of this Code, the election authority shall establish 26a polling place within such municipality, upon the request of   SB0181- 23 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1the municipal council or board of trustees at least 60 days 2before the election and provided that the municipality 3provides a suitable polling place. To accomplish this purpose, 4the election authority may establish an election precinct 5constituting a single municipality of under 500 population for 6all elections, notwithstanding the minimum precinct size 7otherwise specified herein.8    Notwithstanding the above, when there are no more than 50 9registered voters in a precinct who are entitled to vote in a 10local government or school district election, the election 11authority having jurisdiction over the precinct is authorized 12to reassign such voters to one or more polling places in 13adjacent precincts, within or without the election authority's 14jurisdiction, for that election. For the purposes of such 15local government or school district election only, the votes 16of the reassigned voters shall be tallied and canvassed as 17votes from the precinct of the polling place to which such 18voters have been reassigned. The election authority having 19jurisdiction over the precinct shall approve all 20administrative and polling place procedures. Such procedures 21shall take into account voter convenience, and ensure that the 22integrity of the election process is maintained and that the 23secrecy of the ballot is not violated.24    Except in the event of a fire, flood or total loss of heat 25in a place fixed or established by any county board or election 26authority pursuant to this Section as a polling place for an   SB0181- 24 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1election, no election authority shall change the location of a 2polling place so established for any precinct after notice of 3the place of holding the election for that precinct has been 4given as required under Article 12 unless the election 5authority notifies all registered voters in the precinct of 6the change in location by first class mail in sufficient time 7for such notice to be received by the registered voters in the 8precinct at least one day prior to the date of the election.9    The provisions of this Section apply to all precincts, 10including those where voting machines or electronic voting 11systems are used.12(Source: P.A. 102-668, eff. 11-15-21.) 13    (10 ILCS 5/11-8)14    (Section scheduled to be repealed on July 1, 2029)15    Sec. 11-8.

Election authorities may establish more than one vote 3center, but in jurisdictions with a population of more than 4500,000 inhabitants, the election authority shall establish at 5least 2 vote centers. An election authority establishing such 6a vote center location under this Section shall identify the 7locations location and any health and safety requirements by 8the 40th day preceding an election and shall certify such to 9the State Board of Elections.10    (b) This Section is repealed on July 1, 2029.11(Source: P.A. 102-15, eff. 6-17-21; 102-668, eff. 11-15-21; 12102-1109, eff. 12-21-22; 103-467, eff. 8-4-23.) 13    (10 ILCS 5/16-5)  (from Ch. 46, par. 16-5)14    Sec. 16-5.

Ballots shall be 23printed and in possession of the respective election 24authorities at least two days before each election and subject 25to the inspection of candidates and their agents; if any   SB0181- 26 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1mistakes be discovered they shall be corrected without delay. 2The election authority shall cause to be delivered to the 3judges of election at the polling place of each precinct or 4district, not less than twelve hours before the time fixed by 5law for the opening of the polls therein, at least 10% more 6ballots of the kind to be voted in such precinct or district 7than the number of voters registered therein for the purposes 8of such election, such ballots shall be put up in separate 9sealed packages, with marks on the outside clearly designating 10the polling place for which they are intended and the number of 11ballots enclosed, and receipt therefor shall be given by the 12judges of election to whom they are delivered, which receipt 13shall be preserved by the election authority. The election 14authority shall provide and retain at its office an ample 15supply of ballots, in addition to those distributed to the 16several voting precincts or districts, and if at any time on or 17before the day of election the ballots furnished to any 18precinct shall be lost, destroyed or exhausted before the 19polls are closed, on written application signed by a majority 20of the judges he or they shall immediately cause to be 21delivered to such judges at the polling place, such additional 22supply of ballots as may be required and sufficient to comply 23with the provisions of this Act.24    (b) No person, other than a person acting on behalf of an 25election authority, shall print and distribute ballots to the 26judges of election at a polling place at a precinct or   SB0181- 27 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1district.2    (c) Each election authority shall keep a secure record of 3the number of ballots printed and distributed to the judges of 4election at each polling place of each precinct or district. 5The State Board of Elections shall develop standards that each 6election authority shall implement for the 2026 general 7primary election, and all subsequent elections, to count and 8track the number of ballots printed and distributed as 9described in this Section.10(Source: P.A. 80-1469.) 11    (10 ILCS 5/17-9)  (from Ch. 46, par. 17-9)12    Sec. 17-9.

(a) No judge of election, pollwatcher, or 11other person shall, at any primary or election, do any 12electioneering or soliciting of votes or engage in any 13political discussion within any polling place, within 100 feet 14of any polling place, or, at the option of a church or private 15school, on any of the property of that church or private school 16that is a polling place; no person shall interrupt, hinder or 17oppose any voter while approaching within those areas for the 18purpose of voting. Judges of election shall enforce the 19provisions of this Section.20    (b) Election officers shall place 2 or more cones, small 21United States national flags, or some other marker a distance 22of 100 horizontal feet from each entrance to the room used by 23voters to engage in voting, which shall be known as the polling 24room. If the polling room is located within a building that is   SB0181- 33 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1a private business, a public or private school, or a church or 2other organization founded for the purpose of religious 3worship and the distance of 100 horizontal feet ends within 4the interior of the building, then the markers shall be placed 5outside of the building at each entrance used by voters to 6enter that building on the grounds adjacent to the 7thoroughfare or walkway. If the polling room is located within 8a public or private building with 2 or more floors and the 9polling room is located on the ground floor, then the markers 10shall be placed 100 horizontal feet from each entrance to the 11polling room used by voters to engage in voting. If the polling 12room is located in a public or private building with 2 or more 13floors and the polling room is located on a floor above or 14below the ground floor, then the markers shall be placed a 15distance of 100 feet from the nearest elevator or staircase 16used by voters on the ground floor to access the floor where 17the polling room is located. The area within where the markers 18are placed shall be known as a campaign free zone, and 19electioneering is prohibited pursuant to this subsection. 20Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a church 21or private school may choose to apply the campaign free zone to 22its entire property, and, if so, the markers shall be placed 23near the boundaries on the grounds adjacent to the 24thoroughfares or walkways leading to the entrances used by the 25voters. If an election authority maintains a website, no later 26than 5 days before election day, each election authority shall   SB0181- 34 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1post on its website the name and address of every polling place 2designated as a campaign free zone. This information shall be 3immediately provided to any person upon request, and a 4requester shall not be required to submit a request under the 5Freedom of Information Act. 6    The area on polling place property beyond the campaign 7free zone, whether publicly or privately owned, is a public 8forum for the time that the polls are open on an election day. 9At the request of election officers any publicly owned 10building must be made available for use as a polling place. A 11person shall have the right to congregate and engage in 12electioneering on any polling place property while the polls 13are open beyond the campaign free zone, including but not 14limited to, the placement of temporary signs. This subsection 15shall be construed liberally in favor of persons engaging in 16electioneering on all polling place property beyond the 17campaign free zone for the time that the polls are open on an 18election day. At or near the door of each polling place, the 19election judges shall place signage indicating the proper 20entrance to the polling place. In addition, the election 21judges shall ensure that a sign identifying the location of 22the polling place is placed on a nearby public roadway. The 23State Board of Elections shall establish guidelines for the 24placement of polling place signage. 25    (c) The regulation of electioneering on polling place 26property on an election day, including but not limited to the   SB0181- 35 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1placement of temporary signs, is an exclusive power and 2function of the State. A home rule unit may not regulate 3electioneering and any ordinance or local law contrary to 4subsection (c) is declared void. This is a denial and 5limitation of home rule powers and functions under subsection 6(h) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution.7    (d) As used in this Section, "electioneering" includes, 8except in the ordinary course of business, the distribution of 9food or drinks to voters.10(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 11    (10 ILCS 5/18-5)  (from Ch. 46, par. 18-5)12    Sec. 18-5. Any person desiring to vote and whose name is 13found upon the register of voters by the person having charge 14thereof shall (i) present to the judges of election for 15verification of the person's identity a government-issued 16photo identification card, as defined in Section 3-8, or his 17or her Voter Identification Card, (ii) , shall then be 18questioned by one of the judges as to his nativity, his term of 19residence at present address, precinct, State and United 20States, his age, whether naturalized and if so the date of 21naturalization papers and court from which secured, and (iii) 22he shall be asked to state his residence when last previously 23registered and the date of the election for which he then 24registered. The judges of elections shall check each 25application for ballot against the list of voters registered   SB0181- 36 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1in that precinct to whom grace period, vote by mail, and early 2ballots have been issued for that election, which shall be 3provided by the election authority and which list shall be 4available for inspection by pollwatchers. A voter applying to 5vote in the precinct on election day whose name appears on the 6list as having been issued a grace period, vote by mail, or 7early ballot shall not be permitted to vote in the precinct, 8except that a voter to whom a vote by mail ballot was issued 9may vote in the precinct if the voter submits to the election 10judges that vote by mail ballot for cancellation. If the voter 11is unable to submit the vote by mail ballot, it shall be 12sufficient for the voter to submit to the election judges (i) a 13portion of the vote by mail ballot if the vote by mail ballot 14was torn or mutilated or (ii) an affidavit executed before the 15election judges specifying that (A) the voter never received a 16vote by mail ballot or (B) the voter completed and returned a 17vote by mail ballot and was informed that the election 18authority did not receive that vote by mail ballot. If such 19person so registered shall be challenged as disqualified, the 20party challenging shall assign his reasons therefor, and 21thereupon one of the judges shall administer to him an oath to 22answer questions, and if he shall take the oath he shall then 23be questioned by the judge or judges touching such cause of 24challenge, and touching any other cause of disqualification. 25And he may also be questioned by the person challenging him in 26regard to his qualifications and identity. But if a majority   SB0181- 37 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1of the judges are of the opinion that he is the person so 2registered and a qualified voter, his vote shall then be 3received accordingly. But if his vote be rejected by such 4judges, such person may afterward produce and deliver an 5affidavit to such judges, subscribed and sworn to by him 6before one of the judges, in which it shall be stated how long 7he has resided in such precinct, and state; that he is a 8citizen of the United States, and is a duly qualified voter in 9such precinct, and that he is the identical person so 10registered. In addition to such an affidavit, the person so 11challenged shall provide to the judges of election proof of 12residence by producing 2 forms of identification showing the 13person's current residence address, provided that such 14identification may include a lease or contract for a residence 15and not more than one piece of mail addressed to the person at 16his current residence address and postmarked not earlier than 1730 days prior to the date of the election, or the person shall 18procure a witness personally known to the judges of election, 19and resident in the precinct (or district), or who shall be 20proved by some legal voter of such precinct or district, known 21to the judges to be such, who shall take the oath following, 22viz: 23    I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am a resident of 24this election precinct (or district), and entitled to vote at 25this election, and that I have been a resident of this State 26for 30 days last past, and am well acquainted with the person   SB0181- 38 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1whose vote is now offered; that he is an actual and bona fide 2resident of this election precinct (or district), and has 3resided herein 30 days, and as I verily believe, in this State, 430 days next preceding this election. 5    The oath in each case may be administered by one of the 6judges of election, or by any officer, resident in the 7precinct or district, authorized by law to administer oaths. 8Also supported by an affidavit by a registered voter residing 9in such precinct, stating his own residence, and that he knows 10such person; and that he does reside at the place mentioned and 11has resided in such precinct and state for the length of time 12as stated by such person, which shall be subscribed and sworn 13to in the same way. For purposes of this Section, the 14submission of a photo identification issued by a college or 15university, accompanied by either (i) a copy of the 16applicant's contract or lease for a residence or (ii) one 17piece of mail addressed to the person at his or her current 18residence address and postmarked not earlier than 30 days 19prior to the date of the election, shall be sufficient to 20establish proof of residence. Whereupon the vote of such 21person shall be received, and entered as other votes. But such 22judges, having charge of such registers, shall state in their 23respective books the facts in such case, and the affidavits, 24so delivered to the judges, shall be preserved and returned to 25the office of the commissioners of election. Blank affidavits 26of the character aforesaid shall be sent out to the judges of   SB0181- 39 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1all the precincts, and the judges of election shall furnish 2the same on demand and administer the oaths without criticism. 3Such oaths, if administered by any other officer than such 4judge of election, shall not be received. Whenever a proposal 5for a constitutional amendment or for the calling of a 6constitutional convention is to be voted upon at the election, 7the separate blue ballot or ballots pertaining thereto shall 8be placed on top of the other ballots to be voted at the 9election in such manner that the legend appearing on the back 10thereof, as prescribed in Section 16-6 of this Act, shall be 11plainly visible to the voter, and in this fashion the ballots 12shall be handed to the voter by the judge. 13    Immediately after voting, the voter shall be instructed 14whether the voting equipment, if used, accepted or rejected 15the ballot or identified the ballot as under-voted. A voter 16whose ballot is identified as under-voted for a statewide 17constitutional office may return to the voting booth and 18complete the voting of that ballot. A voter whose ballot is not 19accepted by the voting equipment may, upon surrendering the 20ballot, request and vote another ballot. The voter's 21surrendered ballot shall be initialed by the election judge 22and handled as provided in the appropriate Article governing 23that voting equipment.24    The voter shall, upon quitting the voting booth, deliver 25to one of the judges of election all of the ballots, properly 26folded, which he received. The judge of election to whom the   SB0181- 40 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1voter delivers his ballots shall not accept the same unless 2all of the ballots given to the voter are returned by him. If a 3voter delivers less than all of the ballots given to him, the 4judge to whom the same are offered shall advise him in a voice 5clearly audible to the other judges of election that the voter 6must return the remainder of the ballots. The statement of the 7judge to the voter shall clearly express the fact that the 8voter is not required to vote such remaining ballots but that 9whether or not he votes them he must fold and deliver them to 10the judge. In making such statement the judge of election 11shall not indicate by word, gesture or intonation of voice 12that the unreturned ballots shall be voted in any particular 13manner. No new voter shall be permitted to enter the voting 14booth of a voter who has failed to deliver the total number of 15ballots received by him until such voter has returned to the 16voting booth pursuant to the judge's request and again quit 17the booth with all of the ballots required to be returned by 18him. Upon receipt of all such ballots the judges of election 19shall enter the name of the voter, and his number, as above 20provided in this Section, and the judge to whom the ballots are 21delivered shall immediately put the ballots into the ballot 22box. If any voter who has failed to deliver all the ballots 23received by him refuses to return to the voting booth after 24being advised by the judge of election as herein provided, the 25judge shall inform the other judges of such refusal, and 26thereupon the ballot or ballots returned to the judge shall be   SB0181- 41 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1deposited in the ballot box, the voter shall be permitted to 2depart from the polling place, and a new voter shall be 3permitted to enter the voting booth. 4    The judge of election who receives the ballot or ballots 5from the voter shall announce the residence and name of such 6voter in a loud voice. The judge shall put the ballot or 7ballots received from the voter into the ballot box in the 8presence of the voter and the judges of election, and in plain 9view of the public. The judges having charge of such registers 10shall then, in a column prepared thereon, in the same line of, 11the name of the voter, mark "Voted" or the letter "V". 12    No judge of election shall accept from any voter less than 13the full number of ballots received by such voter without 14first advising the voter in the manner above provided of the 15necessity of returning all of the ballots, nor shall any such 16judge advise such voter in a manner contrary to that which is 17herein permitted, or in any other manner violate the 18provisions of this Section; provided, that the acceptance by a 19judge of election of less than the full number of ballots 20delivered to a voter who refuses to return to the voting booth 21after being properly advised by such judge shall not be a 22violation of this Section. 23(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 24    (10 ILCS 5/18A-5)25    Sec. 18A-5.

As used in this 15    item, "township office" means an office elected by the 16    electors of an entire township;17        (2) the affidavit executed by the provisional voter 18    pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5 contains, 19    at a minimum, the provisional voter's first and last name, 20    house number and street name, and signature or mark;21        (3) except as permitted by item (5) of subsection (b) 22    of this Section, the provisional voter is a registered 23    voter based on information available to the county clerk 24    or board of election commissioners provided by or obtained 25    from any of the following:26            i. the provisional voter;  SB0181- 50 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1            ii. an election judge;2            iii. the statewide voter registration database 3        maintained by the State Board of Elections;4            iv. the records of the county clerk or board of 5        election commissioners' database; or6            v. the records of the Secretary of State; and7        (4) for a provisional ballot cast under item (6) of 8    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter did not vote by 9    mail ballot in the election at which the provisional 10    ballot was cast; or 11        (5) for a provisional ballot cast under item (7) of 12    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter provides the 13    election authority with the necessary documentation within 14    7 days of election day. 15    (c) With respect to subsection (b)(3) of this Section, the 16county clerk or board of election commissioners shall 17investigate and record whether or not the specified 18information is available from each of the 5 identified 19sources. If the information is available from one or more of 20the identified sources, then the county clerk or board of 21election commissioners shall seek to obtain the information 22from each of those sources until satisfied, with information 23from at least one of those sources, that the provisional voter 24is registered and entitled to vote. The county clerk or board 25of election commissioners shall use any information it obtains 26as the basis for determining the voter registration status of   SB0181- 51 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1the provisional voter. If a conflict exists among the 2information available to the county clerk or board of election 3commissioners as to the registration status of the provisional 4voter, then the county clerk or board of election 5commissioners shall make a determination based on the totality 6of the circumstances. In a case where the above information 7equally supports or opposes the registration status of the 8voter, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 9shall decide in favor of the provisional voter as being duly 10registered to vote. If the statewide voter registration 11database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 12that the provisional voter is registered to vote, but the 13county clerk's or board of election commissioners' voter 14registration database indicates that the provisional voter is 15not registered to vote, then the information found in the 16statewide voter registration database shall control the matter 17and the provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to 18vote. If the records of the county clerk or board of election 19commissioners indicates that the provisional voter is 20registered to vote, but the statewide voter registration 21database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 22that the provisional voter is not registered to vote, then the 23information found in the records of the county clerk or board 24of election commissioners shall control the matter and the 25provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to vote. If 26the provisional voter's signature on his or her provisional   SB0181- 52 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1ballot request varies from the signature on an otherwise valid 2registration application solely because of the substitution of 3initials for the first or middle name, the election authority 4may not reject the provisional ballot.5    (d) In validating the registration status of a person 6casting a provisional ballot, the county clerk or board of 7election commissioners shall not require a provisional voter 8to complete any form other than the affidavit executed by the 9provisional voter under subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5. In 10addition, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 11shall not require all provisional voters or any particular 12class or group of provisional voters to appear personally 13before the county clerk or board of election commissioners or 14as a matter of policy require provisional voters to submit 15additional information to verify or otherwise support the 16information already submitted by the provisional voter. Within 172 calendar days after the election, the election authority 18shall transmit by electronic means pursuant to a process 19established by the State Board of Elections the name, street 20address, e-mail address, and precinct, ward, township, and 21district numbers, as the case may be, of each person casting a 22provisional ballot to the State Board of Elections, which 23shall maintain those names and that information in an 24electronic format on its website, arranged by county and 25accessible to State and local political committees. The 26provisional voter may, within 7 calendar days after the   SB0181- 53 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1election, submit additional information to the county clerk or 2board of election commissioners, except that in the case of 3provisional voting under paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of 4Section 18A-5, the provisional voter has 7 days to provide the 5county clerk or board of election commissioners with the 6required photo identification card. This information must be 7received by the county clerk or board of election 8commissioners within the applicable 7-calendar-day or 910-calendar-day period.10    (e) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 11determines that subsection (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) does not 12apply, then the provisional ballot is not valid and may not be 13counted. The provisional ballot envelope containing the ballot 14cast by the provisional voter may not be opened. The county 15clerk or board of election commissioners shall write on the 16provisional ballot envelope the following: "Provisional ballot 17determined invalid.".18    (f) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 19determines that a provisional ballot is valid under this 20Section, then the provisional ballot envelope shall be opened. 21The outside of each provisional ballot envelope shall also be 22marked to identify the precinct and the date of the election.23    (g) Provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be 24counted at the election authority's central ballot counting 25location and shall not be counted in precincts. The 26provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be added to   SB0181- 54 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1the vote totals for the precincts from which they were cast in 2the order in which the ballots were opened. The validation and 3counting of provisional ballots shall be subject to the 4provisions of this Code that apply to pollwatchers. If the 5provisional ballots are a ballot of a punch card voting 6system, then the provisional ballot shall be counted in a 7manner consistent with Article 24A. If the provisional ballots 8are a ballot of optical scan or other type of approved 9electronic voting system, then the provisional ballots shall 10be counted in a manner consistent with Article 24B.11    (h) As soon as the ballots have been counted, the election 12judges or election officials shall, in the presence of the 13county clerk or board of election commissioners, place each of 14the following items in a separate envelope or bag: (1) all 15provisional ballots, voted or spoiled; (2) all provisional 16ballot envelopes of provisional ballots voted or spoiled; and 17(3) all executed affidavits of the provisional ballots voted 18or spoiled. All provisional ballot envelopes for provisional 19voters who have been determined not to be registered to vote 20shall remain sealed. The county clerk or board of election 21commissioners shall treat the provisional ballot envelope 22containing the written affidavit as a voter registration 23application for that person for the next election and process 24that application. The election judges or election officials 25shall then securely seal each envelope or bag, initial the 26envelope or bag, and plainly mark on the outside of the   SB0181- 55 -LRB104 07582 SPS 17626 b1envelope or bag in ink the precinct in which the provisional 2ballots were cast. The election judges or election officials 3shall then place each sealed envelope or bag into a box, secure 4and seal it in the same manner as described in item (6) of 5subsection (b) of Section 18A-5. Each election judge or 6election official shall take and subscribe an oath before the 7county clerk or board of election commissioners that the 8election judge or election official securely kept the ballots 9and papers in the box, did not permit any person to open the 10box or otherwise touch or tamper with the ballots and papers in 11the box, and has no knowledge of any other person opening the 12box. For purposes of this Section, the term "election 13official" means the county clerk, a member of the board of 14election commissioners, as the case may be, and their 15respective employees.16(Source: P.A. 97-766, eff. 7-6-12; 98-115, eff. 7-29-13; 1798-691, eff. 7-1-14; 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 18    (10 ILCS 5/19-2)  (from Ch. 46, par. 19-2)19    Sec. 19-2.
