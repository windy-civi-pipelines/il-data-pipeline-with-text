At the forfeiture hearing the 3people shall have the burden of establishing, by a 4preponderance of the evidence, that property or property 5interests are subject to forfeiture under this Act. There is a 6rebuttable presumption at such hearing that any property or 7property interest of a person charged by information or 8indictment with narcotics racketeering or who is convicted of 9a violation of Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act 10is subject to forfeiture under this Section if the State 11establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that:12        (1) such property or property interest was acquired by 13    such person during the period of the violation of this Act 14    or Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act or 15    within a reasonable time after such period; and16        (2) there was no likely source for such property or 17    property interest other than the violation of this Act or 18    Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act.19    (c) In an action brought by the People of the State of 20Illinois under this Act, wherein any restraining order, 21injunction or prohibition or any other action in connection 22with any property or property interest subject to forfeiture 23under this Act is sought, the circuit court which shall 24preside over the trial of the person or persons charged with 25narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 of this Act or 26violating Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act   SB2002 Enrolled- 74 -LRB104 03188 RTM 13209 b1shall first determine whether there is probable cause to 2believe that the person or persons so charged has committed 3the offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 4of this Act or a violation of Section 3 of the Drug 5Paraphernalia Control Act and whether the property or property 6interest is subject to forfeiture pursuant to this Act.7    In order to make such a determination, prior to entering 8any such order, the court shall conduct a hearing without a 9jury, wherein the People shall establish that there is: (i) 10probable cause that the person or persons so charged have 11committed the offense of narcotics racketeering or violating 12Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act and (ii) 13probable cause that any property or property interest may be 14subject to forfeiture pursuant to this Act.
