(a) A person who commits the offense of narcotics 24racketeering shall:  SB2002- 72 -LRB104 03188 RTM 13209 b1        (1) be guilty of a Class 1 felony; and2        (2) be subject to a fine of up to $250,000.3    A person who commits the offense of narcotics racketeering 4or who violates Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control 5Act shall forfeit to the State of Illinois: (A) any profits or 6proceeds and any property or property interest he has acquired 7or maintained in violation of this Act or Section 3 of the Drug 8Paraphernalia Control Act or has used to facilitate a 9violation of this Act that the court determines, after a 10forfeiture hearing, under subsection (b) of this Section to 11have been acquired or maintained as a result of narcotics 12racketeering or violating Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia 13Control Act, or used to facilitate narcotics racketeering; and 14(B) any interest in, security of, claim against, or property 15or contractual right of any kind affording a source of 16influence over, any enterprise which he has established, 17operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the 18conduct of, in violation of this Act or Section 3 of the Drug 19Paraphernalia Control Act, that the court determines, after a 20forfeiture hearing, under subsection (b) of this Section to 21have been acquired or maintained as a result of narcotics 22racketeering or violating Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia 23Control Act or used to facilitate narcotics racketeering.24    (b) The court shall, upon petition by the Attorney General 25or State's Attorney, at any time subsequent to the filing of an 26information or return of an indictment, conduct a hearing to   SB2002- 73 -LRB104 03188 RTM 13209 b1determine whether any property or property interest is subject 2to forfeiture under this Act. At the forfeiture hearing the 3people shall have the burden of establishing, by a 4preponderance of the evidence, that property or property 5interests are subject to forfeiture under this Act. There is a 6rebuttable presumption at such hearing that any property or 7property interest of a person charged by information or 8indictment with narcotics racketeering or who is convicted of 9a violation of Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act 10is subject to forfeiture under this Section if the State 11establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that:12        (1) such property or property interest was acquired by 13    such person during the period of the violation of this Act 14    or Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act or 15    within a reasonable time after such period; and16        (2) there was no likely source for such property or 17    property interest other than the violation of this Act or 18    Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act.19    (c) In an action brought by the People of the State of 20Illinois under this Act, wherein any restraining order, 21injunction or prohibition or any other action in connection 22with any property or property interest subject to forfeiture 23under this Act is sought, the circuit court which shall 24preside over the trial of the person or persons charged with 25narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 of this Act or 26violating Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act   SB2002- 74 -LRB104 03188 RTM 13209 b1shall first determine whether there is probable cause to 2believe that the person or persons so charged has committed 3the offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 4of this Act or a violation of Section 3 of the Drug 5Paraphernalia Control Act and whether the property or property 6interest is subject to forfeiture pursuant to this Act.7    In order to make such a determination, prior to entering 8any such order, the court shall conduct a hearing without a 9jury, wherein the People shall establish that there is: (i) 10probable cause that the person or persons so charged have 11committed the offense of narcotics racketeering or violating 12Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act and (ii) 13probable cause that any property or property interest may be 14subject to forfeiture pursuant to this Act. Such hearing may 15be conducted simultaneously with a preliminary hearing, if the 16prosecution is commenced by information or complaint, or by 17motion of the People, at any stage in the proceedings. The 18court may accept a finding of probable cause at a preliminary 19hearing following the filing of an information charging the 20offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 of 21this Act or the return of an indictment by a grand jury 22charging the offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in 23Section 4 of this Act or after a charge is filed for violating 24Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act as sufficient 25evidence of probable cause as provided in item (i) above.26    Upon such a finding, the circuit court shall enter such   SB2002- 75 -LRB104 03188 RTM 13209 b1restraining order, injunction or prohibition, or shall take 2such other action in connection with any such property or 3property interest subject to forfeiture under this Act, as is 4necessary to insure that such property is not removed from the 5jurisdiction of the court, concealed, destroyed or otherwise 6disposed of by the owner of that property or property interest 7prior to a forfeiture hearing under subsection (b) of this 8Section. The Attorney General or State's Attorney shall file a 9certified copy of such restraining order, injunction or other 10prohibition with the recorder of deeds or registrar of titles 11of each county where any such property of the defendant may be 12located.

The distribution 22    shall bear a reasonable relationship to the degree of 23    direct participation in the prosecution of the offense, 24    taking into account the total value of the property 25    forfeited and the total amount of time spent in preparing 26    and presenting the case, the complexity of the case and   SB2002- 80 -LRB104 03188 RTM 13209 b1    other similar factors.

(a) A person who commits the offense of narcotics 24racketeering shall:  SB2002- 72 -LRB104 03188 RTM 13209 b1        (1) be guilty of a Class 1 felony; and2        (2) be subject to a fine of up to $250,000.3    A person who commits the offense of narcotics racketeering 4or who violates Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control 5Act shall forfeit to the State of Illinois: (A) any profits or 6proceeds and any property or property interest he has acquired 7or maintained in violation of this Act or Section 3 of the Drug 8Paraphernalia Control Act or has used to facilitate a 9violation of this Act that the court determines, after a 10forfeiture hearing, under subsection (b) of this Section to 11have been acquired or maintained as a result of narcotics 12racketeering or violating Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia 13Control Act, or used to facilitate narcotics racketeering; and 14(B) any interest in, security of, claim against, or property 15or contractual right of any kind affording a source of 16influence over, any enterprise which he has established, 17operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the 18conduct of, in violation of this Act or Section 3 of the Drug 19Paraphernalia Control Act, that the court determines, after a 20forfeiture hearing, under subsection (b) of this Section to 21have been acquired or maintained as a result of narcotics 22racketeering or violating Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia 23Control Act or used to facilitate narcotics racketeering.24    (b) The court shall, upon petition by the Attorney General 25or State's Attorney, at any time subsequent to the filing of an 26information or return of an indictment, conduct a hearing to   SB2002- 73 -LRB104 03188 RTM 13209 b1determine whether any property or property interest is subject 2to forfeiture under this Act. At the forfeiture hearing the 3people shall have the burden of establishing, by a 4preponderance of the evidence, that property or property 5interests are subject to forfeiture under this Act. There is a 6rebuttable presumption at such hearing that any property or 7property interest of a person charged by information or 8indictment with narcotics racketeering or who is convicted of 9a violation of Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act 10is subject to forfeiture under this Section if the State 11establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that:12        (1) such property or property interest was acquired by 13    such person during the period of the violation of this Act 14    or Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act or 15    within a reasonable time after such period; and16        (2) there was no likely source for such property or 17    property interest other than the violation of this Act or 18    Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act.19    (c) In an action brought by the People of the State of 20Illinois under this Act, wherein any restraining order, 21injunction or prohibition or any other action in connection 22with any property or property interest subject to forfeiture 23under this Act is sought, the circuit court which shall 24preside over the trial of the person or persons charged with 25narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 of this Act or 26violating Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act   SB2002- 74 -LRB104 03188 RTM 13209 b1shall first determine whether there is probable cause to 2believe that the person or persons so charged has committed 3the offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 4of this Act or a violation of Section 3 of the Drug 5Paraphernalia Control Act and whether the property or property 6interest is subject to forfeiture pursuant to this Act.7    In order to make such a determination, prior to entering 8any such order, the court shall conduct a hearing without a 9jury, wherein the People shall establish that there is: (i) 10probable cause that the person or persons so charged have 11committed the offense of narcotics racketeering or violating 12Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act and (ii) 13probable cause that any property or property interest may be 14subject to forfeiture pursuant to this Act. Such hearing may 15be conducted simultaneously with a preliminary hearing, if the 16prosecution is commenced by information or complaint, or by 17motion of the People, at any stage in the proceedings. The 18court may accept a finding of probable cause at a preliminary 19hearing following the filing of an information charging the 20offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 of 21this Act or the return of an indictment by a grand jury 22charging the offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in 23Section 4 of this Act or after a charge is filed for violating 24Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act as sufficient 25evidence of probable cause as provided in item (i) above.26    Upon such a finding, the circuit court shall enter such   SB2002- 75 -LRB104 03188 RTM 13209 b1restraining order, injunction or prohibition, or shall take 2such other action in connection with any such property or 3property interest subject to forfeiture under this Act, as is 4necessary to insure that such property is not removed from the 5jurisdiction of the court, concealed, destroyed or otherwise 6disposed of by the owner of that property or property interest 7prior to a forfeiture hearing under subsection (b) of this 8Section. The Attorney General or State's Attorney shall file a 9certified copy of such restraining order, injunction or other 10prohibition with the recorder of deeds or registrar of titles 11of each county where any such property of the defendant may be 12located.

The distribution 22    shall bear a reasonable relationship to the degree of 23    direct participation in the prosecution of the offense, 24    taking into account the total value of the property 25    forfeited and the total amount of time spent in preparing 26    and presenting the case, the complexity of the case and   SB2002- 80 -LRB104 03188 RTM 13209 b1    other similar factors.
