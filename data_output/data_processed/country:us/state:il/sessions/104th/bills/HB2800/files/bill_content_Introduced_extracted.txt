The provisional voter's affidavit   HB2800- 2 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1    shall serve as a change of address request by that voter 2    for registration purposes for the next ensuing election if 3    it bears an address different from that in the records of 4    the election authority. Votes for federal and statewide 5    offices on a provisional ballot cast in the incorrect 6    precinct that meet the other requirements of this 7    subsection shall be valid and counted in accordance with 8    this Article. As used in this item, "federal office" is 9    defined as provided in Section 20-1 and "statewide office" 10    means the Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, 11    Comptroller, and Treasurer. Votes for General Assembly, 12    countywide, citywide, or township office on a provisional 13    ballot cast in the incorrect precinct but in the correct 14    legislative district, representative district, county, 15    municipality, or township, as the case may be, shall be 16    valid and counted in accordance with this Article. As used 17    in this item, "citywide office" means an office elected by 18    the electors of an entire municipality. As used in this 19    item, "township office" means an office elected by the 20    electors of an entire township;21        (2) the affidavit executed by the provisional voter 22    pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5 contains, 23    at a minimum, the provisional voter's first and last name, 24    house number and street name, and signature or mark;25        (3) except as permitted by item (5) of subsection (b) 26    of this Section, the provisional voter is a registered   HB2800- 3 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1    voter based on information available to the county clerk 2    or board of election commissioners provided by or obtained 3    from any of the following:4            i. the provisional voter;5            ii. an election judge;6            iii. the statewide voter registration database 7        maintained by the State Board of Elections;8            iv. the records of the county clerk or board of 9        election commissioners' database; or10            v. the records of the Secretary of State; and11        (4) for a provisional ballot cast under item (6) of 12    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter did not vote by 13    mail ballot in the election at which the provisional 14    ballot was cast; or 15        (5) for a provisional ballot cast under item (7) of 16    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter provides the 17    election authority with the necessary documentation within 18    7 days of election day. 19    (c) With respect to subsection (b)(3) of this Section, the 20county clerk or board of election commissioners shall 21investigate and record whether or not the specified 22information is available from each of the 5 identified 23sources. If the information is available from one or more of 24the identified sources, then the county clerk or board of 25election commissioners shall seek to obtain the information 26from each of those sources until satisfied, with information   HB2800- 4 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1from at least one of those sources, that the provisional voter 2is registered and entitled to vote. The county clerk or board 3of election commissioners shall use any information it obtains 4as the basis for determining the voter registration status of 5the provisional voter. If a conflict exists among the 6information available to the county clerk or board of election 7commissioners as to the registration status of the provisional 8voter, then the county clerk or board of election 9commissioners shall make a determination based on the totality 10of the circumstances. In a case where the above information 11equally supports or opposes the registration status of the 12voter, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 13shall decide in favor of the provisional voter as being duly 14registered to vote. If the statewide voter registration 15database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 16that the provisional voter is registered to vote, but the 17county clerk's or board of election commissioners' voter 18registration database indicates that the provisional voter is 19not registered to vote, then the information found in the 20statewide voter registration database shall control the matter 21and the provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to 22vote. If the records of the county clerk or board of election 23commissioners indicates that the provisional voter is 24registered to vote, but the statewide voter registration 25database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 26that the provisional voter is not registered to vote, then the   HB2800- 5 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1information found in the records of the county clerk or board 2of election commissioners shall control the matter and the 3provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to vote. If 4the provisional voter's signature on his or her provisional 5ballot request varies from the signature on an otherwise valid 6registration application solely because of the substitution of 7initials for the first or middle name, the election authority 8may not reject the provisional ballot.9    (d) In validating the registration status of a person 10casting a provisional ballot, the county clerk or board of 11election commissioners shall not require a provisional voter 12to complete any form other than the affidavit executed by the 13provisional voter under subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5. In 14addition, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 15shall not require all provisional voters or any particular 16class or group of provisional voters to appear personally 17before the county clerk or board of election commissioners or 18as a matter of policy require provisional voters to submit 19additional information to verify or otherwise support the 20information already submitted by the provisional voter. Within 212 calendar days after the election, the election authority 22shall transmit by electronic means pursuant to a process 23established by the State Board of Elections the name, street 24address, e-mail address, and precinct, ward, township, and 25district numbers, as the case may be, of each person casting a 26provisional ballot to the State Board of Elections, which   HB2800- 6 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1shall maintain those names and that information in an 2electronic format on its website, arranged by county and 3accessible to State and local political committees. The 4provisional voter may, within 7 calendar days after the 5election, submit additional information to the county clerk or 6board of election commissioners. This information must be 7received by the county clerk or board of election 8commissioners within the 7-calendar-day period.9    (e) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 10determines that subsection (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) does not 11apply, then the provisional ballot is not valid and may not be 12counted. The provisional ballot envelope containing the ballot 13cast by the provisional voter may not be opened. The county 14clerk or board of election commissioners shall write on the 15provisional ballot envelope the following: "Provisional ballot 16determined invalid.".17    (f) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 18determines that a provisional ballot is valid under this 19Section, then the provisional ballot envelope shall be opened. 20The outside of each provisional ballot envelope shall also be 21marked to identify the precinct and the date of the election.22    (g) Provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be 23counted at the election authority's central ballot counting 24location and shall not be counted in precincts. The 25provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be added to 26the vote totals for the precincts from which they were cast in   HB2800- 7 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1the order in which the ballots were opened. The validation and 2counting of provisional ballots shall be subject to the 3provisions of this Code that apply to pollwatchers. If the 4provisional ballots are a ballot of a punch card voting 5system, then the provisional ballot shall be counted in a 6manner consistent with Article 24A. If the provisional ballots 7are a ballot of optical scan or other type of approved 8electronic voting system, then the provisional ballots shall 9be counted in a manner consistent with Article 24B.10    (h) As soon as the ballots have been counted, the election 11judges or election officials shall, in the presence of the 12county clerk or board of election commissioners, place each of 13the following items in a separate envelope or bag: (1) all 14provisional ballots, voted or spoiled; (2) all provisional 15ballot envelopes of provisional ballots voted or spoiled; and 16(3) all executed affidavits of the provisional ballots voted 17or spoiled. All provisional ballot envelopes for provisional 18voters who have been determined not to be registered to vote 19shall remain sealed. The county clerk or board of election 20commissioners shall treat the provisional ballot envelope 21containing the written affidavit as a voter registration 22application for that person for the next election and process 23that application. The election judges or election officials 24shall then securely seal each envelope or bag, initial the 25envelope or bag, and plainly mark on the outside of the 26envelope or bag in ink the precinct in which the provisional   HB2800- 8 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1ballots were cast. The election judges or election officials 2shall then place each sealed envelope or bag into a box, secure 3and seal it in the same manner as described in item (6) of 4subsection (b) of Section 18A-5. Each election judge or 5election official shall take and subscribe an oath before the 6county clerk or board of election commissioners that the 7election judge or election official securely kept the ballots 8and papers in the box, did not permit any person to open the 9box or otherwise touch or tamper with the ballots and papers in 10the box, and has no knowledge of any other person opening the 11box.

As used in this 19    item, "township office" means an office elected by the 20    electors of an entire township;21        (2) the affidavit executed by the provisional voter 22    pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5 contains, 23    at a minimum, the provisional voter's first and last name, 24    house number and street name, and signature or mark;25        (3) except as permitted by item (5) of subsection (b) 26    of this Section, the provisional voter is a registered   HB2800- 3 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1    voter based on information available to the county clerk 2    or board of election commissioners provided by or obtained 3    from any of the following:4            i. the provisional voter;5            ii. an election judge;6            iii. the statewide voter registration database 7        maintained by the State Board of Elections;8            iv. the records of the county clerk or board of 9        election commissioners' database; or10            v. the records of the Secretary of State; and11        (4) for a provisional ballot cast under item (6) of 12    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter did not vote by 13    mail ballot in the election at which the provisional 14    ballot was cast; or 15        (5) for a provisional ballot cast under item (7) of 16    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter provides the 17    election authority with the necessary documentation within 18    7 days of election day. 19    (c) With respect to subsection (b)(3) of this Section, the 20county clerk or board of election commissioners shall 21investigate and record whether or not the specified 22information is available from each of the 5 identified 23sources. If the information is available from one or more of 24the identified sources, then the county clerk or board of 25election commissioners shall seek to obtain the information 26from each of those sources until satisfied, with information   HB2800- 4 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1from at least one of those sources, that the provisional voter 2is registered and entitled to vote. The county clerk or board 3of election commissioners shall use any information it obtains 4as the basis for determining the voter registration status of 5the provisional voter. If a conflict exists among the 6information available to the county clerk or board of election 7commissioners as to the registration status of the provisional 8voter, then the county clerk or board of election 9commissioners shall make a determination based on the totality 10of the circumstances. In a case where the above information 11equally supports or opposes the registration status of the 12voter, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 13shall decide in favor of the provisional voter as being duly 14registered to vote. If the statewide voter registration 15database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 16that the provisional voter is registered to vote, but the 17county clerk's or board of election commissioners' voter 18registration database indicates that the provisional voter is 19not registered to vote, then the information found in the 20statewide voter registration database shall control the matter 21and the provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to 22vote.

If 4the provisional voter's signature on his or her provisional 5ballot request varies from the signature on an otherwise valid 6registration application solely because of the substitution of 7initials for the first or middle name, the election authority 8may not reject the provisional ballot.9    (d) In validating the registration status of a person 10casting a provisional ballot, the county clerk or board of 11election commissioners shall not require a provisional voter 12to complete any form other than the affidavit executed by the 13provisional voter under subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5. In 14addition, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 15shall not require all provisional voters or any particular 16class or group of provisional voters to appear personally 17before the county clerk or board of election commissioners or 18as a matter of policy require provisional voters to submit 19additional information to verify or otherwise support the 20information already submitted by the provisional voter. Within 212 calendar days after the election, the election authority 22shall transmit by electronic means pursuant to a process 23established by the State Board of Elections the name, street 24address, e-mail address, and precinct, ward, township, and 25district numbers, as the case may be, of each person casting a 26provisional ballot to the State Board of Elections, which   HB2800- 6 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1shall maintain those names and that information in an 2electronic format on its website, arranged by county and 3accessible to State and local political committees.

This information must be 7received by the county clerk or board of election 8commissioners within the 7-calendar-day period.9    (e) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 10determines that subsection (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) does not 11apply, then the provisional ballot is not valid and may not be 12counted. The provisional ballot envelope containing the ballot 13cast by the provisional voter may not be opened. The county 14clerk or board of election commissioners shall write on the 15provisional ballot envelope the following: "Provisional ballot 16determined invalid.".17    (f) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 18determines that a provisional ballot is valid under this 19Section, then the provisional ballot envelope shall be opened. 20The outside of each provisional ballot envelope shall also be 21marked to identify the precinct and the date of the election.22    (g) Provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be 23counted at the election authority's central ballot counting 24location and shall not be counted in precincts. The 25provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be added to 26the vote totals for the precincts from which they were cast in   HB2800- 7 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1the order in which the ballots were opened. The validation and 2counting of provisional ballots shall be subject to the 3provisions of this Code that apply to pollwatchers. If the 4provisional ballots are a ballot of a punch card voting 5system, then the provisional ballot shall be counted in a 6manner consistent with Article 24A. If the provisional ballots 7are a ballot of optical scan or other type of approved 8electronic voting system, then the provisional ballots shall 9be counted in a manner consistent with Article 24B.10    (h) As soon as the ballots have been counted, the election 11judges or election officials shall, in the presence of the 12county clerk or board of election commissioners, place each of 13the following items in a separate envelope or bag: (1) all 14provisional ballots, voted or spoiled; (2) all provisional 15ballot envelopes of provisional ballots voted or spoiled; and 16(3) all executed affidavits of the provisional ballots voted 17or spoiled.

The county clerk or board of election 20commissioners shall treat the provisional ballot envelope 21containing the written affidavit as a voter registration 22application for that person for the next election and process 23that application. The election judges or election officials 24shall then securely seal each envelope or bag, initial the 25envelope or bag, and plainly mark on the outside of the 26envelope or bag in ink the precinct in which the provisional   HB2800- 8 -LRB104 08174 SPS 18223 b1ballots were cast. The election judges or election officials 2shall then place each sealed envelope or bag into a box, secure 3and seal it in the same manner as described in item (6) of 4subsection (b) of Section 18A-5. Each election judge or 5election official shall take and subscribe an oath before the 6county clerk or board of election commissioners that the 7election judge or election official securely kept the ballots 8and papers in the box, did not permit any person to open the 9box or otherwise touch or tamper with the ballots and papers in 10the box, and has no knowledge of any other person opening the 11box.
