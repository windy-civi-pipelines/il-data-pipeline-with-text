Additionally, a nonconsenting pore 20    space owner's such compensation shall be no less than the 21    average total payment package, considered as a whole with 22    respect to an individual owner, provided in agreements 23    during the previous 365 days to similarly situated 24    consenting pore space owners for use of their pore space 25    by the same sequestration operator for the same 26    sequestration project. The nonconsenting pore space   10400SB1697sam002- 11 -LRB104 09225 AAS 26415 a1    owner's compensation shall include just compensation and 2    any operations term or injection term payments made upon 3    or after the initiation of injection provided to 4    consenting pore space owners in consideration of allowing 5    use of their pore space for sequestration of carbon 6    dioxide, but Such compensation shall exclude any 7    incentives, such as signing bonuses, provided to 8    consenting pore space owners prior to the initiation of 9    injection. Such compensation shall include any operations 10    term or injection term payments made upon or after the 11    initiation of injection provided to consenting pore space 12    owners in consideration of allowing use of their pore 13    space for sequestration of carbon dioxide. In determining 14    if pore space owners are similarly situated, the 15    Department of Natural Resources shall take into account: 16    the size, location, and proximity of the pore space; the 17    geologic characteristics of the pore space; the 18    restrictions on the use of the surface; the actual use of 19    the surface; the relevant law applicable at the time the 20    consenting pore space agreement was signed; title defects 21    and title warranties; the proximity of the pore space 22    owners' property to any carbon sequestration 23    infrastructure on the surface; whether the injection 24    interferes with any known mineral rights; and the fair 25    market value of pore space when entering into a commercial 26    contract. When evaluating the compensation provided to a   10400SB1697sam002- 12 -LRB104 09225 AAS 26415 a1    similarly situated pore space owner, the Department of 2    Natural Resources shall exclude any compensation provided 3    to a pore space owner of a property identified by the 4    applicant in paragraph (3) of subsection (b) and any 5    compensation that was not provided as part of an arm's 6    length transaction.7        Unknown or nonlocatable pore space owners shall also 8    receive just compensation in the same manner as provided 9    to the other nonconsenting pore space owners that must be 10    held in a separate escrow account for 20 years for future 11    payment to the previously unknown or nonlocatable pore 12    space owner upon discovery of that owner. After 20 years, 13    the compensation shall be transferred to the State 14    Treasurer under the Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property 15    Act.16    (f) The Department of Natural Resources' order for 17unitization and integration of pore space under this Section 18is not effective until the petitioner has been issued a Class 19VI well permit from the United States Environmental Protection 20Agency and the carbon sequestration permit from the Illinois 21Environmental Protection Agency.22    (g) An order for integration and unitization under this 23Section shall: provide for the unitization of the pore space 24identified in the petition; authorize the integration of pore 25space of nonconsenting pore space owners in the pore space 26identified; provide for who may unitize the pore space to   10400SB1697sam002- 13 -LRB104 09225 AAS 26415 a1establish a sequestration facility to be permitted by the 2Illinois Environmental Protection Agency; and make provision 3for payment of just compensation to nonconsenting pore space 4owner under the integration order. 5    (h) A petitioner shall provide a copy of any order for 6unitization and integration of pore space to the Illinois 7Environmental Protection Agency.8    (i) If groundwater monitoring required by a Class VI 9permit indicates that the source of drinking water has been 10rendered unsafe to drink or to provide to livestock, the 11sequestration operator shall provide an alternate supply of 12potable drinking water within 24 hours of the monitoring 13results becoming available and an alternate supply of water 14that is safe for other uses necessary within 30 days of the 15monitoring results becoming available. The alternate supplies 16of both potable water and water that is safe for other uses 17shall continue until additional monitoring by the 18sequestration operator shows that the water is safe for 19drinking and other uses.20    (j) After an order for unitization and integration of pore 21space is issued, the petitioner shall request that the 22Department of Natural Resources issue separate orders 23establishing the amount of just compensation to be provided to 24each nonconsenting pore space owner. When submitting this 25request, the petitioner shall provide information 26demonstrating the good faith efforts taken to negotiate an   10400SB1697sam002- 14 -LRB104 09225 AAS 26415 a1agreement with the nonconsenting pore space owner, including, 2but not limited to, the number and extent of the petitioner's 3contacts with the pore space owner, whether the petitioner 4explained the compensation offer to the pore space owner, 5whether the compensation offer was comparable to similarly 6situated pore space owners, what efforts were made to address 7the pore space owner's concerns, and the likelihood that 8further negotiations would be successful. All orders requiring 9the provision of just compensation shall be made after notice 10and hearing in which the Department of Natural Resources shall 11determine the appropriate amount of just compensation to be 12provided to each nonconsenting pore space owner as described 13in this Section. The Department shall adopt reasonable rules 14governing such hearings as may be necessary. In such a 15hearing, the burden shall be on the petitioner to prove the 16appropriate amount of just compensation consistent with this 17Section. Both the petitioner and the pore space owner shall be 18permitted to provide testimony and evidence regarding the 19appropriateness of the amount of just compensation proposed by 20the sequestration operator. An order by the Department of 21Natural Resources establishing the appropriate amount of just 22compensation to be provided to a nonconsenting pore space 23owner shall be a final agency decision subject to judicial 24review under the Administrative Review Law. Such proceedings 25for judicial review may be commenced in the circuit court of 26the county in which any part of the pore space is situated. The   10400SB1697sam002- 15 -LRB104 09225 AAS 26415 a1Department of Natural Resources shall not be required to 2certify any record to the court or file any answer in court or 3otherwise appear in any court in a judicial review proceeding, 4unless there is filed in the court with the complaint a receipt 5from the Department of Natural Resources acknowledging payment 6of the costs of furnishing and certifying the record. Failure 7on the part of the plaintiff to file such receipt in court 8shall be grounds for dismissal of the action. 9(Source: P.A. 103-651, eff. 7-18-24.)".

Additionally, a nonconsenting pore 20    space owner's such compensation shall be no less than the 21    average total payment package, considered as a whole with 22    respect to an individual owner, provided in agreements 23    during the previous 365 days to similarly situated 24    consenting pore space owners for use of their pore space 25    by the same sequestration operator for the same 26    sequestration project. The nonconsenting pore space   10400SB1697sam002- 11 -LRB104 09225 AAS 26415 a1    owner's compensation shall include just compensation and 2    any operations term or injection term payments made upon 3    or after the initiation of injection provided to 4    consenting pore space owners in consideration of allowing 5    use of their pore space for sequestration of carbon 6    dioxide, but Such compensation shall exclude any 7    incentives, such as signing bonuses, provided to 8    consenting pore space owners prior to the initiation of 9    injection. Such compensation shall include any operations 10    term or injection term payments made upon or after the 11    initiation of injection provided to consenting pore space 12    owners in consideration of allowing use of their pore 13    space for sequestration of carbon dioxide. In determining 14    if pore space owners are similarly situated, the 15    Department of Natural Resources shall take into account: 16    the size, location, and proximity of the pore space; the 17    geologic characteristics of the pore space; the 18    restrictions on the use of the surface; the actual use of 19    the surface; the relevant law applicable at the time the 20    consenting pore space agreement was signed; title defects 21    and title warranties; the proximity of the pore space 22    owners' property to any carbon sequestration 23    infrastructure on the surface; whether the injection 24    interferes with any known mineral rights; and the fair 25    market value of pore space when entering into a commercial 26    contract. When evaluating the compensation provided to a   10400SB1697sam002- 12 -LRB104 09225 AAS 26415 a1    similarly situated pore space owner, the Department of 2    Natural Resources shall exclude any compensation provided 3    to a pore space owner of a property identified by the 4    applicant in paragraph (3) of subsection (b) and any 5    compensation that was not provided as part of an arm's 6    length transaction.7        Unknown or nonlocatable pore space owners shall also 8    receive just compensation in the same manner as provided 9    to the other nonconsenting pore space owners that must be 10    held in a separate escrow account for 20 years for future 11    payment to the previously unknown or nonlocatable pore 12    space owner upon discovery of that owner. After 20 years, 13    the compensation shall be transferred to the State 14    Treasurer under the Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property 15    Act.16    (f) The Department of Natural Resources' order for 17unitization and integration of pore space under this Section 18is not effective until the petitioner has been issued a Class 19VI well permit from the United States Environmental Protection 20Agency and the carbon sequestration permit from the Illinois 21Environmental Protection Agency.22    (g) An order for integration and unitization under this 23Section shall: provide for the unitization of the pore space 24identified in the petition; authorize the integration of pore 25space of nonconsenting pore space owners in the pore space 26identified; provide for who may unitize the pore space to   10400SB1697sam002- 13 -LRB104 09225 AAS 26415 a1establish a sequestration facility to be permitted by the 2Illinois Environmental Protection Agency; and make provision 3for payment of just compensation to nonconsenting pore space 4owner under the integration order. 5    (h) A petitioner shall provide a copy of any order for 6unitization and integration of pore space to the Illinois 7Environmental Protection Agency.8    (i) If groundwater monitoring required by a Class VI 9permit indicates that the source of drinking water has been 10rendered unsafe to drink or to provide to livestock, the 11sequestration operator shall provide an alternate supply of 12potable drinking water within 24 hours of the monitoring 13results becoming available and an alternate supply of water 14that is safe for other uses necessary within 30 days of the 15monitoring results becoming available. The alternate supplies 16of both potable water and water that is safe for other uses 17shall continue until additional monitoring by the 18sequestration operator shows that the water is safe for 19drinking and other uses.20    (j) After an order for unitization and integration of pore 21space is issued, the petitioner shall request that the 22Department of Natural Resources issue separate orders 23establishing the amount of just compensation to be provided to 24each nonconsenting pore space owner. When submitting this 25request, the petitioner shall provide information 26demonstrating the good faith efforts taken to negotiate an   10400SB1697sam002- 14 -LRB104 09225 AAS 26415 a1agreement with the nonconsenting pore space owner, including, 2but not limited to, the number and extent of the petitioner's 3contacts with the pore space owner, whether the petitioner 4explained the compensation offer to the pore space owner, 5whether the compensation offer was comparable to similarly 6situated pore space owners, what efforts were made to address 7the pore space owner's concerns, and the likelihood that 8further negotiations would be successful. All orders requiring 9the provision of just compensation shall be made after notice 10and hearing in which the Department of Natural Resources shall 11determine the appropriate amount of just compensation to be 12provided to each nonconsenting pore space owner as described 13in this Section. The Department shall adopt reasonable rules 14governing such hearings as may be necessary. In such a 15hearing, the burden shall be on the petitioner to prove the 16appropriate amount of just compensation consistent with this 17Section. Both the petitioner and the pore space owner shall be 18permitted to provide testimony and evidence regarding the 19appropriateness of the amount of just compensation proposed by 20the sequestration operator. An order by the Department of 21Natural Resources establishing the appropriate amount of just 22compensation to be provided to a nonconsenting pore space 23owner shall be a final agency decision subject to judicial 24review under the Administrative Review Law. Such proceedings 25for judicial review may be commenced in the circuit court of 26the county in which any part of the pore space is situated. The   10400SB1697sam002- 15 -LRB104 09225 AAS 26415 a1Department of Natural Resources shall not be required to 2certify any record to the court or file any answer in court or 3otherwise appear in any court in a judicial review proceeding, 4unless there is filed in the court with the complaint a receipt 5from the Department of Natural Resources acknowledging payment 6of the costs of furnishing and certifying the record. Failure 7on the part of the plaintiff to file such receipt in court 8shall be grounds for dismissal of the action. 9(Source: P.A. 103-651, eff. 7-18-24.)".
