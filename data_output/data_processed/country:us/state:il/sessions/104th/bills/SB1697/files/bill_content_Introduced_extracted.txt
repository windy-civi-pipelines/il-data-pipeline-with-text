Laura Fine SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 220 ILCS 75/20220 ILCS 75/22 new415 ILCS 185/15    Amends the Carbon Dioxide Transportation and Sequestration Act. Provides that the Illinois Commerce Commission shall not issue any certificate of authority under the Act before July 1, 2026. Removes language providing that if, after July 1, 2026, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has not adopted final revisions to specified pipeline safety rules, the Commission may only approve a certificate of authority if it finds that the applicant has met all of the requirements of the Act, has already acquired all of its other necessary approvals, and is compliant with any requirements or conditions adopted by the Commission. Provides that a nonconsenting pore space owner's compensation shall include just compensation and any operations term or injection term payments made upon or after the initiation of injection provided to consenting pore space owners in consideration of allowing use of their pore space for sequestration of carbon dioxide. Provides that a nonconsenting pore space owner's compensation shall be no less than the average total payment package, considered as a whole with respect to an individual owner, provided in agreements to similarly situated consenting pore space owners for use of their pore space by the same sequestration operator for the same sequestration project (instead of provided in agreements during the previous 365 days to similarly situated consenting pore space owners). Amends the Safety and Aid for the Environment in Carbon Capture and Sequestration Act. Provides that an affected landowner is entitled to reasonable compensation from an applicant that has been granted a certificate of authority under this Act for damages resulting from access to the landowner's property for required activities taken to construct the pipeline, including, but not limited to, compensation for specified damages. Sets forth provisions concerning payment of the compensation; attorney's fees; and an applicant entering into an agreement with the Department of Agriculture that governs the mitigation of agricultural impacts associated with the construction of the proposed pipeline. Makes other changes.LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b  A BILL FOR SB1697LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5.

Application. 9    (a) No person or entity may construct, operate, or repair 10a carbon dioxide pipeline unless the person or entity 11possesses a certificate of authority. Nothing in this Act 12requires a legacy carbon dioxide pipeline to obtain a 13certificate of authority.14    (b) The Commission, after a hearing, may grant an 15application for a certificate of authority authorizing the 16construction and operation of a carbon dioxide pipeline if it 17makes a specific written finding as to each of the following:18        (1) the application was properly filed;19        (2) the applicant is fit, willing, and able to 20    construct and operate the pipeline in compliance with this 21    Act and with Commission regulations and orders of the 22    Commission or any applicable federal agencies;23        (3) the applicant has entered into one or more   SB1697- 2 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    agreements with a source or sources that will result in 2    the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from that source 3    or sources and the applicant has filed such agreement or 4    agreements as part of its application;5        (4) the applicant has filed with the Pipeline and 6    Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the U.S. 7    Department of Transportation all forms required by that 8    agency in advance of constructing a carbon dioxide 9    pipeline;10        (5) the applicant has filed with the U.S. Army Corps 11    of Engineers all applications for permits required by that 12    agency in advance of constructing a carbon dioxide 13    pipeline;14        (6) the applicant has entered into an agreement with 15    the Illinois Department of Agriculture that governs the 16    mitigation of agricultural impacts associated with the 17    construction of the proposed pipeline;18        (6.1) the applicant has applied for any and all other 19    federal permits necessary to construct and operate a 20    carbon dioxide pipeline;21        (6.2) the applicant has held at least 2 prefiling 22    public meetings to receive public comment concerning the 23    proposed carbon dioxide pipeline in each county where the 24    pipeline is to be located, no earlier than 6 months prior 25    to the filing of the application. Notice of the public 26    meeting shall be published in a newspaper of general   SB1697- 3 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    circulation within the affected county once a week for 3 2    consecutive weeks, beginning no earlier than one month 3    prior to the first public meeting. Notice of each public 4    meeting, including a description of the carbon dioxide 5    pipeline, must be provided in writing to the clerk of each 6    county where the project is to be located and to the chief 7    clerk of the Commission. A representative of the 8    Commission shall be invited to each prefiling public 9    meeting. The applicant shall maintain a dedicated public 10    website which provides details regarding the proposed 11    route of the pipeline, plans for construction, status of 12    the application, and the manner in which members of the 13    public may offer their opinions regarding the pipeline;14        (6.3) the applicant has directly contacted the owner 15    of each parcel of land located within 2 miles of the 16    proposed pipeline route by certified mail, or made good 17    faith efforts if the owner of record cannot be located, 18    advising them of the proposed pipeline route and of the 19    date and time of each public meeting to be held in the 20    county in which each landowner's property is located;21        (6.4) the applicant has prepared and submitted a 22    detailed emergency operations plan, which addresses at a 23    minimum, emergency operations plan requirements adopted by 24    the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and Office of 25    Homeland Security under paragraph (4) of subsection (f) of 26    Section 5 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act.   SB1697- 4 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    The submitted emergency operations plan shall also provide 2    for post-emergency analysis and controller actions. In 3    addition, the applicant shall demonstrate that it has 4    communicated with the county emergency services and 5    disaster agency (ESDA), or other relevant mandated ESDA, 6    to coordinate its emergency operations plan for the 7    pipeline with the county ESDA's, or other relevant 8    mandated ESDA's, emergency operations plan; 9        (7) the applicant possesses the financial, managerial, 10    legal, and technical qualifications necessary to construct 11    and operate the proposed carbon dioxide pipeline; and 12        (8) the proposed pipeline is consistent with the 13    public interest, public benefit, and legislative purpose 14    as set forth in this Act. In addition to any other evidence 15    the Commission may consider on this specific finding, the 16    Commission shall consider the following:17            (A) any evidence of the effect of the pipeline 18        upon the economy, infrastructure, and public safety 19        presented by local governmental units that will be 20        affected by the proposed pipeline route;21            (B) any evidence of the effect of the pipeline 22        presented by property owners who will be affected by 23        the proposed pipeline or facility, provided that the 24        Commission need not hear evidence as to the actual 25        valuation of property such as that as would be 26        presented to and determined by the courts under the   SB1697- 5 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1        Eminent Domain Act;2            (C) any evidence presented by the Department of 3        Commerce and Economic Opportunity regarding the 4        current and future local, statewide State-wide, or 5        regional economic effect, direct or indirect, of the 6        proposed pipeline or facility including, but not 7        limited to, ability of the State to attract economic 8        growth, meet future energy requirements, and ensure 9        compliance with environmental requirements and goals;10            (D) any evidence addressing the factors described 11        in items (1) through (8) of this subsection (b) or 12        other relevant factors that is presented by any other 13        State agency, unit of local government, the applicant, 14        a party, or other entity that participates in the 15        proceeding, including evidence presented by the 16        Commission's staff; and17            (E) any evidence presented by any State or federal 18        governmental entity as to how the proposed pipeline 19        will affect the security, stability, and reliability 20        of public infrastructure.21    In its written order, the Commission shall address all of 22the evidence presented, and if the order is contrary to any of 23the evidence, the Commission shall state the reasons for its 24determination with regard to that evidence. 25    (c) When an applicant files its application for a 26certificate of authority with the Commission, it shall provide   SB1697- 6 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1notice to each unit of local government where the proposed 2pipeline will be located and include a map of the proposed 3pipeline route. The applicant shall also publish notice in a 4newspaper of general circulation in each county where the 5proposed pipeline is located.6    (d) An application for a certificate of authority filed 7pursuant to this Section shall request either that the 8Commission review and approve a specific route for a carbon 9dioxide pipeline, or that the Commission review and approve a 10project route width that identifies the areas in which the 11pipeline would be located, with such width ranging from the 12minimum width required for a pipeline right-of-way up to 200 13feet in width. A map of the route or route width shall be 14included in the application. The purpose for allowing the 15option of review and approval of a project route width is to 16provide increased flexibility during the construction process 17to accommodate specific landowner requests, avoid 18environmentally sensitive areas, or address special 19environmental permitting requirements.20    (e) The Commission's rules shall ensure that notice of an 21application for a certificate of authority is provided within 2230 days after filing to the landowners along a proposed 23project route, or to the potentially affected landowners 24within a proposed project route width, using the notification 25procedures set forth in the Commission's rules. If the 26Commission grants approval of a project route width as opposed   SB1697- 7 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1to a specific project route, then the applicant must, as it 2finalizes the actual pipeline alignment within the project 3route width, file its final list of affected landowners with 4the Commission at least 14 days in advance of beginning 5construction on any tract within the project route width and 6also provide the Commission with at least 14 days' notice 7before filing a complaint for eminent domain in the circuit 8court with regard to any tract within the project route width.9    (f) If an applicant has obtained all necessary federal 10licenses, permits, and authority necessary to construct and 11operate a carbon dioxide pipeline before it files an 12application pursuant to this Section, then the Commission 13shall make its determination on any application for a 14certificate of authority and issue its final order within 11 15months after the date that the application is filed. The 16Commission's failure to act within this time period shall not 17be deemed an approval or denial of the application.18    (g) A final order of the Commission granting a certificate 19of authority pursuant to this Act shall be conditioned upon 20the applicant obtaining all required permits or approvals from 21the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of 22the U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Army Corps of 23Engineers, and Illinois Department of Agriculture, in addition 24to all other permits and approvals necessary for the 25construction and operation of the pipeline prior to the start 26of any construction. The final order must specifically   SB1697- 8 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1prohibit the start of any construction until all such permits 2and approvals have been obtained. The Commission shall not 3issue any certificate of authority under this Act before July 41, 2026 and until (i) the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 5Safety Administration has adopted final revisions to its 6pipeline safety rules intended to enhance the safe 7transportation of carbon dioxide by pipelines to accommodate 8an anticipated increase in the number of carbon dioxide 9pipelines and volume of carbon dioxide transported in the 10proposed rulemaking designated Regulatory Information Number 112137-AF60, and (ii) the Commission has verified that the 12submitted application complies with those finalized rules. If, 13after July 1, 2026, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 14Safety Administration has not adopted final revisions to its 15pipeline safety rules under the proposed rulemaking designated 16Regulatory Information Number 2137-AF60, the Commission may 17only approve a certificate of authority under this Section if 18it finds that the applicant has met all of the requirements of 19this Act, has already acquired all of its other necessary 20approvals, and is compliant with any requirements or 21conditions adopted by the Commission subsection (g-5). 22    (g-5) In granting a certificate under this Act, the 23Commission shall adopt such requirements or impose such 24conditions upon a certificate as in its opinion are necessary 25to preserve public safety, as long as such requirements are 26compatible with the minimum standards prescribed by the   SB1697- 9 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration. 2    (h) Within 6 months after the Commission's entry of an 3order approving either a specific route or a project route 4width under this Section, the owner or operator of the carbon 5dioxide pipeline that receives that order may file 6supplemental applications for minor route deviations outside 7the approved project route width, allowing for additions or 8changes to the approved route to address environmental 9concerns encountered during construction or to accommodate 10landowner requests. The supplemental application shall 11specifically detail the environmental concerns or landowner 12requests prompting the route changes, including the names of 13any landowners or entities involved. Notice of a supplemental 14application shall be provided to any State agency or unit of 15local government that appeared in the original proceeding and 16to any landowner affected by the proposed route deviation at 17the time that supplemental application is filed. The route 18deviations shall be approved by the Commission no sooner than 1990 days after all interested parties receive notice of the 20supplemental application, unless a written objection is filed 21to the supplemental application within 45 days after such 22notice is received. If a written objection is filed, then the 23Commission shall issue an order either granting or denying the 24route deviation within 90 days after the filing of the 25objection. Hearings on any such supplemental application shall 26be limited to the reasonableness of the specific variance   SB1697- 10 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1proposed, and the issues of the public interest and benefit of 2the project or fitness of the applicant shall be considered 3only to the extent that the route deviation has raised new 4concerns with regard to those issues.5    (i) A certificate of authority to construct and operate a 6carbon dioxide pipeline issued by the Commission shall contain 7and include all of the following:8        (1) a grant of authority to construct and operate a 9    carbon dioxide pipeline as requested in the application, 10    subject to the laws of this State; and11        (2) the right to seek eminent domain authority from 12    the Commission under Section 8-509 of the Public Utilities 13    Act.14    (j) All applications under this Act pending before the 15Commission on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 16103rd General Assembly shall be dismissed without prejudice. 17(Source: P.A. 103-651, eff. 7-18-24.) 18    (220 ILCS 75/22 new)19    Sec. 22.

Such compensation shall include any operations 8    term or injection term payments made upon or after the 9    initiation of injection provided to consenting pore space 10    owners in consideration of allowing use of their pore 11    space for sequestration of carbon dioxide. In determining 12    if pore space owners are similarly situated, the 13    Department of Natural Resources shall take into account: 14    the size, location, and proximity of the pore space; the 15    geologic characteristics of the pore space; the 16    restrictions on the use of the surface; the actual use of 17    the surface; the relevant law applicable at the time the 18    consenting pore space agreement was signed; title defects 19    and title warranties; the proximity of the pore space 20    owners' property to any carbon sequestration 21    infrastructure on the surface; whether the injection 22    interferes with any known mineral rights; and the fair 23    market value of pore space when entering into a commercial 24    contract. When evaluating the compensation provided to a 25    similarly situated pore space owner, the Department of 26    Natural Resources shall exclude any compensation provided   SB1697- 21 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    to a pore space owner of a property identified by the 2    applicant in paragraph (3) of subsection (b) and any 3    compensation that was not provided as part of an arm's 4    length transaction.5        Unknown or nonlocatable pore space owners shall also 6    receive just compensation in the same manner as provided 7    to the other nonconsenting pore space owners that must be 8    held in a separate escrow account for 20 years for future 9    payment to the previously unknown or nonlocatable pore 10    space owner upon discovery of that owner. After 20 years, 11    the compensation shall be transferred to the State 12    Treasurer under the Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property 13    Act.14    (f) The Department of Natural Resources' order for 15unitization and integration of pore space under this Section 16is not effective until the petitioner has been issued a Class 17VI well permit from the United States Environmental Protection 18Agency and the carbon sequestration permit from the Illinois 19Environmental Protection Agency.20    (g) An order for integration and unitization under this 21Section shall: provide for the unitization of the pore space 22identified in the petition; authorize the integration of pore 23space of nonconsenting pore space owners in the pore space 24identified; provide for who may unitize the pore space to 25establish a sequestration facility to be permitted by the 26Illinois Environmental Protection Agency; and make provision   SB1697- 22 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1for payment of just compensation to nonconsenting pore space 2owner under the integration order. 3    (h) A petitioner shall provide a copy of any order for 4unitization and integration of pore space to the Illinois 5Environmental Protection Agency.6    (i) If groundwater monitoring required by a Class VI 7permit indicates that the source of drinking water has been 8rendered unsafe to drink or to provide to livestock, the 9sequestration operator shall provide an alternate supply of 10potable drinking water within 24 hours of the monitoring 11results becoming available and an alternate supply of water 12that is safe for other uses necessary within 30 days of the 13monitoring results becoming available. The alternate supplies 14of both potable water and water that is safe for other uses 15shall continue until additional monitoring by the 16sequestration operator shows that the water is safe for 17drinking and other uses.18    (j) After an order for unitization and integration of pore 19space is issued, the petitioner shall request that the 20Department of Natural Resources issue separate orders 21establishing the amount of just compensation to be provided to 22each nonconsenting pore space owner. When submitting this 23request, the petitioner shall provide information 24demonstrating the good faith efforts taken to negotiate an 25agreement with the nonconsenting pore space owner, including, 26but not limited to, the number and extent of the petitioner's   SB1697- 23 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1contacts with the pore space owner, whether the petitioner 2explained the compensation offer to the pore space owner, 3whether the compensation offer was comparable to similarly 4situated pore space owners, what efforts were made to address 5the pore space owner's concerns, and the likelihood that 6further negotiations would be successful. All orders requiring 7the provision of just compensation shall be made after notice 8and hearing in which the Department of Natural Resources shall 9determine the appropriate amount of just compensation to be 10provided to each nonconsenting pore space owner as described 11in this Section. The Department shall adopt reasonable rules 12governing such hearings as may be necessary. In such a 13hearing, the burden shall be on the petitioner to prove the 14appropriate amount of just compensation consistent with this 15Section. Both the petitioner and the pore space owner shall be 16permitted to provide testimony and evidence regarding the 17appropriateness of the amount of just compensation proposed by 18the sequestration operator. An order by the Department of 19Natural Resources establishing the appropriate amount of just 20compensation to be provided to a nonconsenting pore space 21owner shall be a final agency decision subject to judicial 22review under the Administrative Review Law. Such proceedings 23for judicial review may be commenced in the circuit court of 24the county in which any part of the pore space is situated. The 25Department of Natural Resources shall not be required to 26certify any record to the court or file any answer in court or   SB1697- 24 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1otherwise appear in any court in a judicial review proceeding, 2unless there is filed in the court with the complaint a receipt 3from the Department of Natural Resources acknowledging payment 4of the costs of furnishing and certifying the record. Failure 5on the part of the plaintiff to file such receipt in court 6shall be grounds for dismissal of the action. 7(Source: P.A. 103-651, eff. 7-18-24.)

Laura Fine SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 220 ILCS 75/20220 ILCS 75/22 new415 ILCS 185/15    Amends the Carbon Dioxide Transportation and Sequestration Act. Provides that the Illinois Commerce Commission shall not issue any certificate of authority under the Act before July 1, 2026. Removes language providing that if, after July 1, 2026, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has not adopted final revisions to specified pipeline safety rules, the Commission may only approve a certificate of authority if it finds that the applicant has met all of the requirements of the Act, has already acquired all of its other necessary approvals, and is compliant with any requirements or conditions adopted by the Commission. Provides that a nonconsenting pore space owner's compensation shall include just compensation and any operations term or injection term payments made upon or after the initiation of injection provided to consenting pore space owners in consideration of allowing use of their pore space for sequestration of carbon dioxide. Provides that a nonconsenting pore space owner's compensation shall be no less than the average total payment package, considered as a whole with respect to an individual owner, provided in agreements to similarly situated consenting pore space owners for use of their pore space by the same sequestration operator for the same sequestration project (instead of provided in agreements during the previous 365 days to similarly situated consenting pore space owners). Amends the Safety and Aid for the Environment in Carbon Capture and Sequestration Act. Provides that an affected landowner is entitled to reasonable compensation from an applicant that has been granted a certificate of authority under this Act for damages resulting from access to the landowner's property for required activities taken to construct the pipeline, including, but not limited to, compensation for specified damages. Sets forth provisions concerning payment of the compensation; attorney's fees; and an applicant entering into an agreement with the Department of Agriculture that governs the mitigation of agricultural impacts associated with the construction of the proposed pipeline. Makes other changes.LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b  A BILL FOR SB1697LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5.

Notice of the public 26    meeting shall be published in a newspaper of general   SB1697- 3 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    circulation within the affected county once a week for 3 2    consecutive weeks, beginning no earlier than one month 3    prior to the first public meeting. Notice of each public 4    meeting, including a description of the carbon dioxide 5    pipeline, must be provided in writing to the clerk of each 6    county where the project is to be located and to the chief 7    clerk of the Commission. A representative of the 8    Commission shall be invited to each prefiling public 9    meeting. The applicant shall maintain a dedicated public 10    website which provides details regarding the proposed 11    route of the pipeline, plans for construction, status of 12    the application, and the manner in which members of the 13    public may offer their opinions regarding the pipeline;14        (6.3) the applicant has directly contacted the owner 15    of each parcel of land located within 2 miles of the 16    proposed pipeline route by certified mail, or made good 17    faith efforts if the owner of record cannot be located, 18    advising them of the proposed pipeline route and of the 19    date and time of each public meeting to be held in the 20    county in which each landowner's property is located;21        (6.4) the applicant has prepared and submitted a 22    detailed emergency operations plan, which addresses at a 23    minimum, emergency operations plan requirements adopted by 24    the Illinois Emergency Management Agency and Office of 25    Homeland Security under paragraph (4) of subsection (f) of 26    Section 5 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act.   SB1697- 4 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    The submitted emergency operations plan shall also provide 2    for post-emergency analysis and controller actions. In 3    addition, the applicant shall demonstrate that it has 4    communicated with the county emergency services and 5    disaster agency (ESDA), or other relevant mandated ESDA, 6    to coordinate its emergency operations plan for the 7    pipeline with the county ESDA's, or other relevant 8    mandated ESDA's, emergency operations plan; 9        (7) the applicant possesses the financial, managerial, 10    legal, and technical qualifications necessary to construct 11    and operate the proposed carbon dioxide pipeline; and 12        (8) the proposed pipeline is consistent with the 13    public interest, public benefit, and legislative purpose 14    as set forth in this Act. In addition to any other evidence 15    the Commission may consider on this specific finding, the 16    Commission shall consider the following:17            (A) any evidence of the effect of the pipeline 18        upon the economy, infrastructure, and public safety 19        presented by local governmental units that will be 20        affected by the proposed pipeline route;21            (B) any evidence of the effect of the pipeline 22        presented by property owners who will be affected by 23        the proposed pipeline or facility, provided that the 24        Commission need not hear evidence as to the actual 25        valuation of property such as that as would be 26        presented to and determined by the courts under the   SB1697- 5 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1        Eminent Domain Act;2            (C) any evidence presented by the Department of 3        Commerce and Economic Opportunity regarding the 4        current and future local, statewide State-wide, or 5        regional economic effect, direct or indirect, of the 6        proposed pipeline or facility including, but not 7        limited to, ability of the State to attract economic 8        growth, meet future energy requirements, and ensure 9        compliance with environmental requirements and goals;10            (D) any evidence addressing the factors described 11        in items (1) through (8) of this subsection (b) or 12        other relevant factors that is presented by any other 13        State agency, unit of local government, the applicant, 14        a party, or other entity that participates in the 15        proceeding, including evidence presented by the 16        Commission's staff; and17            (E) any evidence presented by any State or federal 18        governmental entity as to how the proposed pipeline 19        will affect the security, stability, and reliability 20        of public infrastructure.21    In its written order, the Commission shall address all of 22the evidence presented, and if the order is contrary to any of 23the evidence, the Commission shall state the reasons for its 24determination with regard to that evidence. 25    (c) When an applicant files its application for a 26certificate of authority with the Commission, it shall provide   SB1697- 6 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1notice to each unit of local government where the proposed 2pipeline will be located and include a map of the proposed 3pipeline route. The applicant shall also publish notice in a 4newspaper of general circulation in each county where the 5proposed pipeline is located.6    (d) An application for a certificate of authority filed 7pursuant to this Section shall request either that the 8Commission review and approve a specific route for a carbon 9dioxide pipeline, or that the Commission review and approve a 10project route width that identifies the areas in which the 11pipeline would be located, with such width ranging from the 12minimum width required for a pipeline right-of-way up to 200 13feet in width. A map of the route or route width shall be 14included in the application. The purpose for allowing the 15option of review and approval of a project route width is to 16provide increased flexibility during the construction process 17to accommodate specific landowner requests, avoid 18environmentally sensitive areas, or address special 19environmental permitting requirements.20    (e) The Commission's rules shall ensure that notice of an 21application for a certificate of authority is provided within 2230 days after filing to the landowners along a proposed 23project route, or to the potentially affected landowners 24within a proposed project route width, using the notification 25procedures set forth in the Commission's rules. If the 26Commission grants approval of a project route width as opposed   SB1697- 7 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1to a specific project route, then the applicant must, as it 2finalizes the actual pipeline alignment within the project 3route width, file its final list of affected landowners with 4the Commission at least 14 days in advance of beginning 5construction on any tract within the project route width and 6also provide the Commission with at least 14 days' notice 7before filing a complaint for eminent domain in the circuit 8court with regard to any tract within the project route width.9    (f) If an applicant has obtained all necessary federal 10licenses, permits, and authority necessary to construct and 11operate a carbon dioxide pipeline before it files an 12application pursuant to this Section, then the Commission 13shall make its determination on any application for a 14certificate of authority and issue its final order within 11 15months after the date that the application is filed. The 16Commission's failure to act within this time period shall not 17be deemed an approval or denial of the application.18    (g) A final order of the Commission granting a certificate 19of authority pursuant to this Act shall be conditioned upon 20the applicant obtaining all required permits or approvals from 21the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of 22the U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Army Corps of 23Engineers, and Illinois Department of Agriculture, in addition 24to all other permits and approvals necessary for the 25construction and operation of the pipeline prior to the start 26of any construction. The final order must specifically   SB1697- 8 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1prohibit the start of any construction until all such permits 2and approvals have been obtained. The Commission shall not 3issue any certificate of authority under this Act before July 41, 2026 and until (i) the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 5Safety Administration has adopted final revisions to its 6pipeline safety rules intended to enhance the safe 7transportation of carbon dioxide by pipelines to accommodate 8an anticipated increase in the number of carbon dioxide 9pipelines and volume of carbon dioxide transported in the 10proposed rulemaking designated Regulatory Information Number 112137-AF60, and (ii) the Commission has verified that the 12submitted application complies with those finalized rules. If, 13after July 1, 2026, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials 14Safety Administration has not adopted final revisions to its 15pipeline safety rules under the proposed rulemaking designated 16Regulatory Information Number 2137-AF60, the Commission may 17only approve a certificate of authority under this Section if 18it finds that the applicant has met all of the requirements of 19this Act, has already acquired all of its other necessary 20approvals, and is compliant with any requirements or 21conditions adopted by the Commission subsection (g-5). 22    (g-5) In granting a certificate under this Act, the 23Commission shall adopt such requirements or impose such 24conditions upon a certificate as in its opinion are necessary 25to preserve public safety, as long as such requirements are 26compatible with the minimum standards prescribed by the   SB1697- 9 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration. 2    (h) Within 6 months after the Commission's entry of an 3order approving either a specific route or a project route 4width under this Section, the owner or operator of the carbon 5dioxide pipeline that receives that order may file 6supplemental applications for minor route deviations outside 7the approved project route width, allowing for additions or 8changes to the approved route to address environmental 9concerns encountered during construction or to accommodate 10landowner requests. The supplemental application shall 11specifically detail the environmental concerns or landowner 12requests prompting the route changes, including the names of 13any landowners or entities involved. Notice of a supplemental 14application shall be provided to any State agency or unit of 15local government that appeared in the original proceeding and 16to any landowner affected by the proposed route deviation at 17the time that supplemental application is filed. The route 18deviations shall be approved by the Commission no sooner than 1990 days after all interested parties receive notice of the 20supplemental application, unless a written objection is filed 21to the supplemental application within 45 days after such 22notice is received. If a written objection is filed, then the 23Commission shall issue an order either granting or denying the 24route deviation within 90 days after the filing of the 25objection. Hearings on any such supplemental application shall 26be limited to the reasonableness of the specific variance   SB1697- 10 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1proposed, and the issues of the public interest and benefit of 2the project or fitness of the applicant shall be considered 3only to the extent that the route deviation has raised new 4concerns with regard to those issues.5    (i) A certificate of authority to construct and operate a 6carbon dioxide pipeline issued by the Commission shall contain 7and include all of the following:8        (1) a grant of authority to construct and operate a 9    carbon dioxide pipeline as requested in the application, 10    subject to the laws of this State; and11        (2) the right to seek eminent domain authority from 12    the Commission under Section 8-509 of the Public Utilities 13    Act.14    (j) All applications under this Act pending before the 15Commission on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 16103rd General Assembly shall be dismissed without prejudice. 17(Source: P.A. 103-651, eff. 7-18-24.) 18    (220 ILCS 75/22 new)19    Sec. 22. Compensation for damages to the surface. 20    (a) An affected landowner is entitled to reasonable 21compensation from an applicant who has been granted a 22certificate of authority under this Act for damages resulting 23from access to the landowner's property for required 24activities taken to construct the pipeline, including, but not 25limited to, the following:  SB1697- 11 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1        (1) compensation for damage to growing crops, trees, 2    shrubs, fences, roads, structures, improvements, personal 3    property, and livestock thereon and compensation for the 4    loss of the value of a commercial crop impacted by 5    pipeline installation; the value of the crop shall be 6    calculated based on local market price by:7            (A) determining the average per acre yield for the 8        same crop on comparable adjacent acreage;9            (B) determining the price received for the sale of 10        the same crop on comparable adjacent acreage;11            (C) determining the acreage of the area impacted 12        by pipeline activities and applying the determined 13        price; and14            (D) making an initial determination of the value 15        of the crop, which shall be determined by the affected 16        landowner and submitted to the applicant who has been 17        granted a certificate of authority under this Act;18        (2) compensation to return the surface estate, 19    including soil conservation practices, such as terraces, 20    grassed waterways, and other conservation practices, to a 21    condition as near as practicable to the condition of the 22    surface prior to accessing the property;23        (3) compensation for damage to the productive 24    capability of the soil resulting from compaction or 25    rutting if the parties are incapable of reaching 26    resolution for such issues under the mitigation agreement   SB1697- 12 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    detailed in paragraph (6) of subsection (b) of Section 20. 2    Such compensation shall include, but is not limited to, 3    compensation for when a pipeline applicant accesses a 4    property where excessively wet soil conditions would not 5    allow normal farming operations due to increased risk of 6    soil erosion, rutting, or compaction; if there is a 7    dispute between the applicant who has been granted a 8    certificate of authority under this Act and the affected 9    landowner regarding the value of the damage to the 10    productive capability of the soil, the applicant who has 11    been granted a certificate of authority under this Act 12    shall consult with a representative of the soil and water 13    conservation district in the respective county where the 14    parcel of property is located for recommendations to 15    restore the productive capability of the soil; and16        (4) compensation for damage to surface and subsurface 17    drainage, including, but not limited to:18            (A) compensation in that the applicant who has 19        been granted a certificate of authority under this Act 20        shall perform immediate and temporary repairs for 21        damage that occurs to subsurface drainage tiles that 22        have water actively flowing through them at the time 23        of damage; and24            (B) compensation such that the applicant who has 25        been granted a certificate of authority under this Act 26        shall compensate the affected landowner to permanently   SB1697- 13 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1        restore drainage to a condition as near as practicable 2        to the condition of the drainage prior to accessing 3        the property.4    (b) The compensation for damages required by subsection 5(a) shall be paid in any manner mutually agreed upon by the 6applicant who has been granted a certificate of authority 7under this Act and the affected landowners. Unless otherwise 8agreed, the applicant who has been granted a certificate of 9authority under this Act shall tender to the landowner payment 10by check or draft no later than 60 days after completing the 11required activities under the application if the occurrence or 12value of damages is not disputed. The landowner's remedy for 13unpaid or disputed compensation shall be an action for damages 14in any court of competent jurisdiction for the parcel of 15property or the greater part thereof on which the activities 16were conducted, and the landowner shall be entitled to recover 17reasonable damages and attorney's fees if the landowner 18prevails.19    (c) If any surface owner prevails in litigation seeking 20compensation for damages under this Section, the applicant who 21has been granted a certificate of authority under this Act 22shall be responsible for such reasonable attorney's fees and 23costs as the court may allow and a judgment may be entered 24therefor in favor of the plaintiff if the attorney's fees and 25costs are not paid as provided by the court.26    (d) Nothing in this Section shall have any impact on an   SB1697- 14 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1applicant's fulfillment of the requirement to enter into an 2agreement with the Department of Agriculture that governs the 3mitigation of agricultural impacts associated with the 4construction of the proposed pipeline as detailed in paragraph 5(6) of subsection (b) of Section 20. 6    Section 10. The Safety and Aid for the Environment in 7Carbon Capture and Sequestration Act is amended by changing 8Section 15 as follows: 9    (415 ILCS 185/15)10    Sec. 15. Integration and unitization of ownership 11interests.12    (a) If at least 2 pore space owners own pore space located 13within a proposed sequestration facility, the owners may agree 14to integrate the owners' interests to develop the pore space 15as a proposed sequestration facility for the underground 16sequestration of carbon dioxide.17    (b) If all of the pore space owners within a proposed or 18permitted sequestration facility do not agree to integrate the 19pore space owners' interests, the sequestration operator may 20petition the Department of Natural Resources to issue an order 21requiring the pore space owners to integrate their interests 22and authorizing the sequestration operator or sequestration 23facility permit holder to develop and use the integrated pore 24space as a sequestration facility for carbon sequestration.   SB1697- 15 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1Such an order for unitization and integration of pore space 2may only be issued if the sequestration operator has obtained 3the rights from pore space owners of pore space underlying at 4least 75% of the surface area above the proposed sequestration 5facility.

Additionally, a nonconsenting pore 18    space owner's such compensation shall be no less than the 19    average total payment package, considered as a whole with 20    respect to an individual owner, provided in agreements 21    during the previous 365 days to similarly situated 22    consenting pore space owners for use of their pore space 23    by the same sequestration operator for the same 24    sequestration project. The nonconsenting pore space 25    owner's compensation shall include just compensation and 26    any operations term or injection term payments made upon   SB1697- 20 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    or after the initiation of injection provided to 2    consenting pore space owners in consideration of allowing 3    use of their pore space for sequestration of carbon 4    dioxide, but Such compensation shall exclude any 5    incentives, such as signing bonuses, provided to 6    consenting pore space owners prior to the initiation of 7    injection. Such compensation shall include any operations 8    term or injection term payments made upon or after the 9    initiation of injection provided to consenting pore space 10    owners in consideration of allowing use of their pore 11    space for sequestration of carbon dioxide.

When evaluating the compensation provided to a 25    similarly situated pore space owner, the Department of 26    Natural Resources shall exclude any compensation provided   SB1697- 21 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    to a pore space owner of a property identified by the 2    applicant in paragraph (3) of subsection (b) and any 3    compensation that was not provided as part of an arm's 4    length transaction.5        Unknown or nonlocatable pore space owners shall also 6    receive just compensation in the same manner as provided 7    to the other nonconsenting pore space owners that must be 8    held in a separate escrow account for 20 years for future 9    payment to the previously unknown or nonlocatable pore 10    space owner upon discovery of that owner. After 20 years, 11    the compensation shall be transferred to the State 12    Treasurer under the Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property 13    Act.14    (f) The Department of Natural Resources' order for 15unitization and integration of pore space under this Section 16is not effective until the petitioner has been issued a Class 17VI well permit from the United States Environmental Protection 18Agency and the carbon sequestration permit from the Illinois 19Environmental Protection Agency.20    (g) An order for integration and unitization under this 21Section shall: provide for the unitization of the pore space 22identified in the petition; authorize the integration of pore 23space of nonconsenting pore space owners in the pore space 24identified; provide for who may unitize the pore space to 25establish a sequestration facility to be permitted by the 26Illinois Environmental Protection Agency; and make provision   SB1697- 22 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1for payment of just compensation to nonconsenting pore space 2owner under the integration order. 3    (h) A petitioner shall provide a copy of any order for 4unitization and integration of pore space to the Illinois 5Environmental Protection Agency.6    (i) If groundwater monitoring required by a Class VI 7permit indicates that the source of drinking water has been 8rendered unsafe to drink or to provide to livestock, the 9sequestration operator shall provide an alternate supply of 10potable drinking water within 24 hours of the monitoring 11results becoming available and an alternate supply of water 12that is safe for other uses necessary within 30 days of the 13monitoring results becoming available. The alternate supplies 14of both potable water and water that is safe for other uses 15shall continue until additional monitoring by the 16sequestration operator shows that the water is safe for 17drinking and other uses.18    (j) After an order for unitization and integration of pore 19space is issued, the petitioner shall request that the 20Department of Natural Resources issue separate orders 21establishing the amount of just compensation to be provided to 22each nonconsenting pore space owner. When submitting this 23request, the petitioner shall provide information 24demonstrating the good faith efforts taken to negotiate an 25agreement with the nonconsenting pore space owner, including, 26but not limited to, the number and extent of the petitioner's   SB1697- 23 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1contacts with the pore space owner, whether the petitioner 2explained the compensation offer to the pore space owner, 3whether the compensation offer was comparable to similarly 4situated pore space owners, what efforts were made to address 5the pore space owner's concerns, and the likelihood that 6further negotiations would be successful. All orders requiring 7the provision of just compensation shall be made after notice 8and hearing in which the Department of Natural Resources shall 9determine the appropriate amount of just compensation to be 10provided to each nonconsenting pore space owner as described 11in this Section. The Department shall adopt reasonable rules 12governing such hearings as may be necessary. In such a 13hearing, the burden shall be on the petitioner to prove the 14appropriate amount of just compensation consistent with this 15Section. Both the petitioner and the pore space owner shall be 16permitted to provide testimony and evidence regarding the 17appropriateness of the amount of just compensation proposed by 18the sequestration operator. An order by the Department of 19Natural Resources establishing the appropriate amount of just 20compensation to be provided to a nonconsenting pore space 21owner shall be a final agency decision subject to judicial 22review under the Administrative Review Law. Such proceedings 23for judicial review may be commenced in the circuit court of 24the county in which any part of the pore space is situated. The 25Department of Natural Resources shall not be required to 26certify any record to the court or file any answer in court or   SB1697- 24 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1otherwise appear in any court in a judicial review proceeding, 2unless there is filed in the court with the complaint a receipt 3from the Department of Natural Resources acknowledging payment 4of the costs of furnishing and certifying the record. Failure 5on the part of the plaintiff to file such receipt in court 6shall be grounds for dismissal of the action. 7(Source: P.A. 103-651, eff. 7-18-24.)
