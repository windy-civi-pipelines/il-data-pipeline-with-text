Additionally, a nonconsenting pore 12    space owner's such compensation shall be no less than the 13    average total payment package, considered as a whole with 14    respect to an individual owner, provided in agreements 15    during the previous 365 days to similarly situated 16    consenting pore space owners for use of their pore space 17    by the same sequestration operator for the same 18    sequestration project. The nonconsenting pore space 19    owner's compensation shall include just compensation and 20    any operations term or injection term payments made upon 21    or after the initiation of injection provided to 22    consenting pore space owners in consideration of allowing 23    use of their pore space for sequestration of carbon 24    dioxide, but Such compensation shall exclude any 25    incentives, such as signing bonuses, provided to 26    consenting pore space owners prior to the initiation of   SB1697 Engrossed- 11 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    injection. Such compensation shall include any operations 2    term or injection term payments made upon or after the 3    initiation of injection provided to consenting pore space 4    owners in consideration of allowing use of their pore 5    space for sequestration of carbon dioxide. In determining 6    if pore space owners are similarly situated, the 7    Department of Natural Resources shall take into account: 8    the size, location, and proximity of the pore space; the 9    geologic characteristics of the pore space; the 10    restrictions on the use of the surface; the actual use of 11    the surface; the relevant law applicable at the time the 12    consenting pore space agreement was signed; title defects 13    and title warranties; the proximity of the pore space 14    owners' property to any carbon sequestration 15    infrastructure on the surface; whether the injection 16    interferes with any known mineral rights; and the fair 17    market value of pore space when entering into a commercial 18    contract. When evaluating the compensation provided to a 19    similarly situated pore space owner, the Department of 20    Natural Resources shall exclude any compensation provided 21    to a pore space owner of a property identified by the 22    applicant in paragraph (3) of subsection (b) and any 23    compensation that was not provided as part of an arm's 24    length transaction.25        Unknown or nonlocatable pore space owners shall also 26    receive just compensation in the same manner as provided   SB1697 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    to the other nonconsenting pore space owners that must be 2    held in a separate escrow account for 20 years for future 3    payment to the previously unknown or nonlocatable pore 4    space owner upon discovery of that owner. After 20 years, 5    the compensation shall be transferred to the State 6    Treasurer under the Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property 7    Act.8    (f) The Department of Natural Resources' order for 9unitization and integration of pore space under this Section 10is not effective until the petitioner has been issued a Class 11VI well permit from the United States Environmental Protection 12Agency and the carbon sequestration permit from the Illinois 13Environmental Protection Agency.14    (g) An order for integration and unitization under this 15Section shall: provide for the unitization of the pore space 16identified in the petition; authorize the integration of pore 17space of nonconsenting pore space owners in the pore space 18identified; provide for who may unitize the pore space to 19establish a sequestration facility to be permitted by the 20Illinois Environmental Protection Agency; and make provision 21for payment of just compensation to nonconsenting pore space 22owner under the integration order. 23    (h) A petitioner shall provide a copy of any order for 24unitization and integration of pore space to the Illinois 25Environmental Protection Agency.26    (i) If groundwater monitoring required by a Class VI   SB1697 Engrossed- 13 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1permit indicates that the source of drinking water has been 2rendered unsafe to drink or to provide to livestock, the 3sequestration operator shall provide an alternate supply of 4potable drinking water within 24 hours of the monitoring 5results becoming available and an alternate supply of water 6that is safe for other uses necessary within 30 days of the 7monitoring results becoming available. The alternate supplies 8of both potable water and water that is safe for other uses 9shall continue until additional monitoring by the 10sequestration operator shows that the water is safe for 11drinking and other uses.12    (j) After an order for unitization and integration of pore 13space is issued, the petitioner shall request that the 14Department of Natural Resources issue separate orders 15establishing the amount of just compensation to be provided to 16each nonconsenting pore space owner. When submitting this 17request, the petitioner shall provide information 18demonstrating the good faith efforts taken to negotiate an 19agreement with the nonconsenting pore space owner, including, 20but not limited to, the number and extent of the petitioner's 21contacts with the pore space owner, whether the petitioner 22explained the compensation offer to the pore space owner, 23whether the compensation offer was comparable to similarly 24situated pore space owners, what efforts were made to address 25the pore space owner's concerns, and the likelihood that 26further negotiations would be successful. All orders requiring   SB1697 Engrossed- 14 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1the provision of just compensation shall be made after notice 2and hearing in which the Department of Natural Resources shall 3determine the appropriate amount of just compensation to be 4provided to each nonconsenting pore space owner as described 5in this Section. The Department shall adopt reasonable rules 6governing such hearings as may be necessary. In such a 7hearing, the burden shall be on the petitioner to prove the 8appropriate amount of just compensation consistent with this 9Section. Both the petitioner and the pore space owner shall be 10permitted to provide testimony and evidence regarding the 11appropriateness of the amount of just compensation proposed by 12the sequestration operator. An order by the Department of 13Natural Resources establishing the appropriate amount of just 14compensation to be provided to a nonconsenting pore space 15owner shall be a final agency decision subject to judicial 16review under the Administrative Review Law. Such proceedings 17for judicial review may be commenced in the circuit court of 18the county in which any part of the pore space is situated. The 19Department of Natural Resources shall not be required to 20certify any record to the court or file any answer in court or 21otherwise appear in any court in a judicial review proceeding, 22unless there is filed in the court with the complaint a receipt 23from the Department of Natural Resources acknowledging payment 24of the costs of furnishing and certifying the record. Failure 25on the part of the plaintiff to file such receipt in court 26shall be grounds for dismissal of the action.   SB1697 Engrossed- 15 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1(Source: P.A. 103-651, eff. 7-18-24.)

Additionally, a nonconsenting pore 12    space owner's such compensation shall be no less than the 13    average total payment package, considered as a whole with 14    respect to an individual owner, provided in agreements 15    during the previous 365 days to similarly situated 16    consenting pore space owners for use of their pore space 17    by the same sequestration operator for the same 18    sequestration project. The nonconsenting pore space 19    owner's compensation shall include just compensation and 20    any operations term or injection term payments made upon 21    or after the initiation of injection provided to 22    consenting pore space owners in consideration of allowing 23    use of their pore space for sequestration of carbon 24    dioxide, but Such compensation shall exclude any 25    incentives, such as signing bonuses, provided to 26    consenting pore space owners prior to the initiation of   SB1697 Engrossed- 11 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    injection. Such compensation shall include any operations 2    term or injection term payments made upon or after the 3    initiation of injection provided to consenting pore space 4    owners in consideration of allowing use of their pore 5    space for sequestration of carbon dioxide. In determining 6    if pore space owners are similarly situated, the 7    Department of Natural Resources shall take into account: 8    the size, location, and proximity of the pore space; the 9    geologic characteristics of the pore space; the 10    restrictions on the use of the surface; the actual use of 11    the surface; the relevant law applicable at the time the 12    consenting pore space agreement was signed; title defects 13    and title warranties; the proximity of the pore space 14    owners' property to any carbon sequestration 15    infrastructure on the surface; whether the injection 16    interferes with any known mineral rights; and the fair 17    market value of pore space when entering into a commercial 18    contract. When evaluating the compensation provided to a 19    similarly situated pore space owner, the Department of 20    Natural Resources shall exclude any compensation provided 21    to a pore space owner of a property identified by the 22    applicant in paragraph (3) of subsection (b) and any 23    compensation that was not provided as part of an arm's 24    length transaction.25        Unknown or nonlocatable pore space owners shall also 26    receive just compensation in the same manner as provided   SB1697 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1    to the other nonconsenting pore space owners that must be 2    held in a separate escrow account for 20 years for future 3    payment to the previously unknown or nonlocatable pore 4    space owner upon discovery of that owner. After 20 years, 5    the compensation shall be transferred to the State 6    Treasurer under the Revised Uniform Unclaimed Property 7    Act.8    (f) The Department of Natural Resources' order for 9unitization and integration of pore space under this Section 10is not effective until the petitioner has been issued a Class 11VI well permit from the United States Environmental Protection 12Agency and the carbon sequestration permit from the Illinois 13Environmental Protection Agency.14    (g) An order for integration and unitization under this 15Section shall: provide for the unitization of the pore space 16identified in the petition; authorize the integration of pore 17space of nonconsenting pore space owners in the pore space 18identified; provide for who may unitize the pore space to 19establish a sequestration facility to be permitted by the 20Illinois Environmental Protection Agency; and make provision 21for payment of just compensation to nonconsenting pore space 22owner under the integration order. 23    (h) A petitioner shall provide a copy of any order for 24unitization and integration of pore space to the Illinois 25Environmental Protection Agency.26    (i) If groundwater monitoring required by a Class VI   SB1697 Engrossed- 13 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1permit indicates that the source of drinking water has been 2rendered unsafe to drink or to provide to livestock, the 3sequestration operator shall provide an alternate supply of 4potable drinking water within 24 hours of the monitoring 5results becoming available and an alternate supply of water 6that is safe for other uses necessary within 30 days of the 7monitoring results becoming available. The alternate supplies 8of both potable water and water that is safe for other uses 9shall continue until additional monitoring by the 10sequestration operator shows that the water is safe for 11drinking and other uses.12    (j) After an order for unitization and integration of pore 13space is issued, the petitioner shall request that the 14Department of Natural Resources issue separate orders 15establishing the amount of just compensation to be provided to 16each nonconsenting pore space owner. When submitting this 17request, the petitioner shall provide information 18demonstrating the good faith efforts taken to negotiate an 19agreement with the nonconsenting pore space owner, including, 20but not limited to, the number and extent of the petitioner's 21contacts with the pore space owner, whether the petitioner 22explained the compensation offer to the pore space owner, 23whether the compensation offer was comparable to similarly 24situated pore space owners, what efforts were made to address 25the pore space owner's concerns, and the likelihood that 26further negotiations would be successful. All orders requiring   SB1697 Engrossed- 14 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1the provision of just compensation shall be made after notice 2and hearing in which the Department of Natural Resources shall 3determine the appropriate amount of just compensation to be 4provided to each nonconsenting pore space owner as described 5in this Section. The Department shall adopt reasonable rules 6governing such hearings as may be necessary. In such a 7hearing, the burden shall be on the petitioner to prove the 8appropriate amount of just compensation consistent with this 9Section. Both the petitioner and the pore space owner shall be 10permitted to provide testimony and evidence regarding the 11appropriateness of the amount of just compensation proposed by 12the sequestration operator. An order by the Department of 13Natural Resources establishing the appropriate amount of just 14compensation to be provided to a nonconsenting pore space 15owner shall be a final agency decision subject to judicial 16review under the Administrative Review Law. Such proceedings 17for judicial review may be commenced in the circuit court of 18the county in which any part of the pore space is situated. The 19Department of Natural Resources shall not be required to 20certify any record to the court or file any answer in court or 21otherwise appear in any court in a judicial review proceeding, 22unless there is filed in the court with the complaint a receipt 23from the Department of Natural Resources acknowledging payment 24of the costs of furnishing and certifying the record. Failure 25on the part of the plaintiff to file such receipt in court 26shall be grounds for dismissal of the action.   SB1697 Engrossed- 15 -LRB104 09225 AAS 19282 b1(Source: P.A. 103-651, eff. 7-18-24.)
