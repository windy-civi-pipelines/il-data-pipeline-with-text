By the 15th of each month of the 17fiscal year, the Board shall voucher to the Comptroller 18one-twelfth of each public university's total distribution. A 19public university shall receive the distribution on behalf of 20each eligible public institution that is part of that public 21university and then distribute funding to each eligible public 22institution.23    The sum of the initial funding amount, as calculated for 24Fiscal Year 2026 by the Board per subsection (b), shall be 25appropriated in Fiscal Year 2026 and in each fiscal year 26thereafter from the State to the board of trustees of each   10400SB0118ham002- 31 -LRB104 08024 LNS 27108 a1public university to meet its operational expenses.2    (e) In each fiscal year in which there is new State formula 3funding, 50% of the new State formula funding shall be 4distributed using the dollar gap formula and the remaining 50% 5shall be distributed using the adequacy gap formula through 6the following calculations:7        (1) The dollar gap formula distribution shall be 8    calculated for each eligible public institution as 9    follows: 10            (A) First, add the total dollar value of the 11        adequacy gap of all eligible public institutions for 12        the fiscal year, which shall be the total adequacy 13        gap. 14            (B) Second, divide the dollar value of the 15        adequacy gap of the eligible public institution by the 16        dollar value of the total adequacy gap, which shall be 17        the gap percentage A. 18            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 19        institution's gap percentage A times the amount 20        available for the dollar gap formula for the fiscal 21        year. 22            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 23        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) 24        shall be the dollar gap formula distribution for the 25        eligible public institution.26        (2) The adequacy gap formula distribution shall be   10400SB0118ham002- 32 -LRB104 08024 LNS 27108 a1    calculated for each eligible public institution as 2    follows: 3            (A) First, add the percentage gaps of all eligible 4        public institutions for the fiscal year, which shall 5        be the total percentage gap. 6            (B) Second, divide the percentage gap of the 7        eligible public institution by the total percentage 8        gap, which shall be the gap percentage B.9            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 10        institution's gap percentage B by the amount available 11        for the adequacy gap formula for the fiscal year. 12            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 13        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (2) 14        shall be the adequacy gap formula distribution for the 15        eligible public institution.16    (f) The reduction formula shall be used in a fiscal year in 17which the State reduces its annual formula funding 18appropriations relative to the previous fiscal year such that 19funds are insufficient to provide each public university with 20its base funding minimum. The reduction formula shall be 21determined as follows:22        (1) By dividing the statewide adequacy gap by each 23    eligible public institution's adequacy gap and multiplying 24    the result by the percentage decrease in the current 25    fiscal year's appropriation compared to the prior fiscal 26    year's appropriation. The resulting percentage for each   10400SB0118ham002- 33 -LRB104 08024 LNS 27108 a1    eligible public institution is then multiplied by its base 2    funding minimum.3        (2) Scale this by calculating the ratio of each 4    institutional ratio cut to the statewide sum of 5    institutional ratio cuts and then multiplying this result 6    for each eligible public institution by the amount of 7    reduction in funds.8        (3) The total cut to each public university shall be 9    the aggregate sum of the cuts to all eligible public 10    institutions that are a part of that public university. 11    Section 40.

Thereafter, the minimum target increase 3in a fiscal year shall be the annual formula funding amount for 4the immediately preceding fiscal year, increased by a 5percentage equal to the percentage increase, if any, in the 6Employment Cost Index (Midwest Economy) published by the 7Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of 8Labor for the 4-quarter period ending on December 31 of the 9immediately preceding fiscal year. 10    (d) In Fiscal Year 2026 and in each fiscal year thereafter 11in which the State appropriates formula funding, each public 12university shall receive a distribution from the Board to meet 13its operational expenses equal to its pro rata share of State 14formula funding for the fiscal year, minus the sum of its base 15funding minimum, as calculated for Fiscal Year 2026 by the 16Board per subsection (b). By the 15th of each month of the 17fiscal year, the Board shall voucher to the Comptroller 18one-twelfth of each public university's total distribution. A 19public university shall receive the distribution on behalf of 20each eligible public institution that is part of that public 21university and then distribute funding to each eligible public 22institution.23    The sum of the initial funding amount, as calculated for 24Fiscal Year 2026 by the Board per subsection (b), shall be 25appropriated in Fiscal Year 2026 and in each fiscal year 26thereafter from the State to the board of trustees of each   10400SB0118ham002- 31 -LRB104 08024 LNS 27108 a1public university to meet its operational expenses.2    (e) In each fiscal year in which there is new State formula 3funding, 50% of the new State formula funding shall be 4distributed using the dollar gap formula and the remaining 50% 5shall be distributed using the adequacy gap formula through 6the following calculations:7        (1) The dollar gap formula distribution shall be 8    calculated for each eligible public institution as 9    follows: 10            (A) First, add the total dollar value of the 11        adequacy gap of all eligible public institutions for 12        the fiscal year, which shall be the total adequacy 13        gap. 14            (B) Second, divide the dollar value of the 15        adequacy gap of the eligible public institution by the 16        dollar value of the total adequacy gap, which shall be 17        the gap percentage A. 18            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 19        institution's gap percentage A times the amount 20        available for the dollar gap formula for the fiscal 21        year. 22            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 23        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) 24        shall be the dollar gap formula distribution for the 25        eligible public institution.26        (2) The adequacy gap formula distribution shall be   10400SB0118ham002- 32 -LRB104 08024 LNS 27108 a1    calculated for each eligible public institution as 2    follows: 3            (A) First, add the percentage gaps of all eligible 4        public institutions for the fiscal year, which shall 5        be the total percentage gap. 6            (B) Second, divide the percentage gap of the 7        eligible public institution by the total percentage 8        gap, which shall be the gap percentage B.9            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 10        institution's gap percentage B by the amount available 11        for the adequacy gap formula for the fiscal year. 12            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 13        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (2) 14        shall be the adequacy gap formula distribution for the 15        eligible public institution.16    (f) The reduction formula shall be used in a fiscal year in 17which the State reduces its annual formula funding 18appropriations relative to the previous fiscal year such that 19funds are insufficient to provide each public university with 20its base funding minimum. The reduction formula shall be 21determined as follows:22        (1) By dividing the statewide adequacy gap by each 23    eligible public institution's adequacy gap and multiplying 24    the result by the percentage decrease in the current 25    fiscal year's appropriation compared to the prior fiscal 26    year's appropriation. The resulting percentage for each   10400SB0118ham002- 33 -LRB104 08024 LNS 27108 a1    eligible public institution is then multiplied by its base 2    funding minimum.3        (2) Scale this by calculating the ratio of each 4    institutional ratio cut to the statewide sum of 5    institutional ratio cuts and then multiplying this result 6    for each eligible public institution by the amount of 7    reduction in funds.8        (3) The total cut to each public university shall be 9    the aggregate sum of the cuts to all eligible public 10    institutions that are a part of that public university. 11    Section 40. Accountability and transparency framework; 12reporting; committee. 13    (a) The Board shall oversee an accountability and 14transparency framework for assessing the distribution, use, 15and student outcomes of funds provided through this Act.
