A postsurgical recovery 11    care center is a designated site which provides 12    postsurgical recovery care for generally healthy patients 13    undergoing surgical procedures that potentially require 14    overnight nursing care, pain control, or observation that 15    would otherwise be provided in an inpatient setting. 16    Patients may be discharged from the postsurgical recovery 17    care center in less than 24 hours if the attending 18    physician or the facility's medical director believes the 19    patient has recovered enough to be discharged. A 20    postsurgical recovery care center is either freestanding 21    or a defined unit of an ambulatory surgical treatment 22    center or hospital. No facility, or portion of a facility, 23    may participate in a demonstration program as a 24    postsurgical recovery care center unless the facility has 25    been licensed as an ambulatory surgical treatment center   10400SB2434sam001- 6 -LRB104 11251 BAB 24936 a1    or hospital for at least 2 years before August 20, 1993 2    (the effective date of Public Act 88-441). The maximum 3    length of stay for patients in a postsurgical recovery 4    care center is not to exceed 48 hours unless the treating 5    physician requests an extension of time from the recovery 6    center's medical director on the basis of medical or 7    clinical documentation that an additional care period is 8    required for the recovery of a patient and the medical 9    director approves the extension of time. In no case, 10    however, shall a patient's length of stay in a 11    postsurgical recovery care center be longer than 72 hours. 12    If a patient requires an additional care period after the 13    expiration of the 72-hour limit, the patient shall be 14    transferred to an appropriate facility. Reports on 15    variances from the 24-hour or 48-hour limit shall be sent 16    to the Department for its evaluation. The reports shall, 17    before submission to the Department, have removed from 18    them all patient and physician identifiers. Blood products 19    may be administered in the postsurgical recovery care 20    center model. In order to handle cases of complications, 21    emergencies, or exigent circumstances, every postsurgical 22    recovery care center as defined in this paragraph shall 23    maintain a contractual relationship, including a transfer 24    agreement, with a general acute care hospital. A 25    postsurgical recovery care center shall be no larger than 26    20 beds.

A postsurgical recovery 11    care center is a designated site which provides 12    postsurgical recovery care for generally healthy patients 13    undergoing surgical procedures that potentially require 14    overnight nursing care, pain control, or observation that 15    would otherwise be provided in an inpatient setting. 16    Patients may be discharged from the postsurgical recovery 17    care center in less than 24 hours if the attending 18    physician or the facility's medical director believes the 19    patient has recovered enough to be discharged. A 20    postsurgical recovery care center is either freestanding 21    or a defined unit of an ambulatory surgical treatment 22    center or hospital. No facility, or portion of a facility, 23    may participate in a demonstration program as a 24    postsurgical recovery care center unless the facility has 25    been licensed as an ambulatory surgical treatment center   10400SB2434sam001- 6 -LRB104 11251 BAB 24936 a1    or hospital for at least 2 years before August 20, 1993 2    (the effective date of Public Act 88-441). The maximum 3    length of stay for patients in a postsurgical recovery 4    care center is not to exceed 48 hours unless the treating 5    physician requests an extension of time from the recovery 6    center's medical director on the basis of medical or 7    clinical documentation that an additional care period is 8    required for the recovery of a patient and the medical 9    director approves the extension of time. In no case, 10    however, shall a patient's length of stay in a 11    postsurgical recovery care center be longer than 72 hours. 12    If a patient requires an additional care period after the 13    expiration of the 72-hour limit, the patient shall be 14    transferred to an appropriate facility. Reports on 15    variances from the 24-hour or 48-hour limit shall be sent 16    to the Department for its evaluation. The reports shall, 17    before submission to the Department, have removed from 18    them all patient and physician identifiers. Blood products 19    may be administered in the postsurgical recovery care 20    center model. In order to handle cases of complications, 21    emergencies, or exigent circumstances, every postsurgical 22    recovery care center as defined in this paragraph shall 23    maintain a contractual relationship, including a transfer 24    agreement, with a general acute care hospital. A 25    postsurgical recovery care center shall be no larger than 26    20 beds.
