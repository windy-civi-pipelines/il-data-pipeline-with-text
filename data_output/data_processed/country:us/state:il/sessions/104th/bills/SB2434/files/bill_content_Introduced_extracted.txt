A 17    postsurgical recovery care center is either freestanding 18    or a defined unit of an ambulatory surgical treatment 19    center or hospital. No facility, or portion of a facility, 20    may participate in a demonstration program as a 21    postsurgical recovery care center unless the facility has 22    been licensed as an ambulatory surgical treatment center 23    or hospital for at least 2 years before August 20, 1993 24    (the effective date of Public Act 88-441). The maximum 25    length of stay for patients in a postsurgical recovery 26    care center is not to exceed 48 hours unless the treating   SB2434- 6 -LRB104 11251 BAB 21334 b1    physician requests an extension of time from the recovery 2    center's medical director on the basis of medical or 3    clinical documentation that an additional care period is 4    required for the recovery of a patient and the medical 5    director approves the extension of time. In no case, 6    however, shall a patient's length of stay in a 7    postsurgical recovery care center be longer than 72 hours. 8    If a patient requires an additional care period after the 9    expiration of the 72-hour limit, the patient shall be 10    transferred to an appropriate facility. Reports on 11    variances from the 24-hour or 48-hour limit shall be sent 12    to the Department for its evaluation. The reports shall, 13    before submission to the Department, have removed from 14    them all patient and physician identifiers.

A postsurgical recovery 8    care center is a designated site which provides 9    postsurgical recovery care for generally healthy patients 10    undergoing surgical procedures that potentially require 11    overnight nursing care, pain control, or observation that 12    would otherwise be provided in an inpatient setting. 13    Patients may be discharged from the postsurgical recovery 14    care center in less than 24 hours if the attending 15    physician or the facility's medical director believes the 16    patient has recovered enough to be discharged. A 17    postsurgical recovery care center is either freestanding 18    or a defined unit of an ambulatory surgical treatment 19    center or hospital. No facility, or portion of a facility, 20    may participate in a demonstration program as a 21    postsurgical recovery care center unless the facility has 22    been licensed as an ambulatory surgical treatment center 23    or hospital for at least 2 years before August 20, 1993 24    (the effective date of Public Act 88-441).

In no case, 6    however, shall a patient's length of stay in a 7    postsurgical recovery care center be longer than 72 hours. 8    If a patient requires an additional care period after the 9    expiration of the 72-hour limit, the patient shall be 10    transferred to an appropriate facility. Reports on 11    variances from the 24-hour or 48-hour limit shall be sent 12    to the Department for its evaluation. The reports shall, 13    before submission to the Department, have removed from 14    them all patient and physician identifiers. Blood products 15    may be administered in the postsurgical recovery care 16    center model. In order to handle cases of complications, 17    emergencies, or exigent circumstances, every postsurgical 18    recovery care center as defined in this paragraph shall 19    maintain a contractual relationship, including a transfer 20    agreement, with a general acute care hospital. A 21    postsurgical recovery care center shall be no larger than 22    20 beds.

This 22    care is to be provided in a home-like environment that 23    serves no more than 12 children at a time, except that a 24    children's community-based health care center in existence 25    on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 100th 26    General Assembly that is located in Chicago on grade level   SB2434- 8 -LRB104 11251 BAB 21334 b1    for Life Safety Code purposes may provide care to no more 2    than 16 children at a time.
