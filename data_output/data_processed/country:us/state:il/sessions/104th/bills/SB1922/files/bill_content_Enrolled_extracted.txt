A restricted driving permit issued 12    under this Section shall be subject to cancellation, 13    revocation, and suspension by the Secretary of State in 14    like manner and for like cause as a driver's license 15    issued under this Code may be cancelled, revoked, or 16    suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more 17    offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the 18    movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for 19    the revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a 20    restricted driving permit. The Secretary of State may, as 21    a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving 22    permit, require the applicant to participate in a 23    designated driver remedial or rehabilitative program.
