The public 17hearing shall develop a record sufficient to form the basis of 18appeal of the decision in accordance with Section 40.1 of this 19Act. The fact that a member of the county board or governing 20body of the municipality has publicly expressed an opinion on 21an issue related to a site review proceeding shall not 22preclude the member from taking part in the proceeding and 23voting on the issue.24    (e) Decisions of the county board or governing body of the 25municipality are to be in writing, confirming a public hearing 26was held with testimony from at least one witness presented by   SB2267- 7 -LRB104 09347 BDA 19405 b1the applicant, specifying the reasons for the decision, such 2reasons to be in conformance with subsection (a) of this 3Section.

Such regulations, insofar as they apply to 17new pollution control facilities authorized to store, treat or 18dispose of any hazardous waste, shall be at least as stringent 19as the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery 20Act and any State or federal regulations adopted pursuant 21thereto.22    (j) Any new pollution control facility which has never 23obtained local siting approval under the provisions of this 24Section shall be required to obtain such approval after a 25final decision on an appeal of a permit denial.26    (k) A county board or governing body of a municipality may   SB2267- 11 -LRB104 09347 BDA 19405 b1charge applicants for siting review under this Section a 2reasonable fee to cover the reasonable and necessary costs 3incurred by such county or municipality in the siting review 4process.5    (l) The governing Authority as determined by subsection 6(c) of Section 39 of this Act may request the Department of 7Transportation to perform traffic impact studies of proposed 8or potential locations for required pollution control 9facilities.10    (m) An applicant may not file a request for local siting 11approval which is substantially the same as a request which 12was disapproved pursuant to a finding against the applicant 13under any of criteria (i) through (ix) of subsection (a) of 14this Section within the preceding 2 years.15    (n) In any review proceeding of a decision of the county 16board or governing body of a municipality made pursuant to the 17local siting review process, the petitioner in the review 18proceeding shall pay to the county or municipality the cost of 19preparing and certifying the record of proceedings. Should the 20petitioner in the review proceeding fail to make payment, the 21provisions of Section 3-109 of the Code of Civil Procedure 22shall apply.23    In the event the petitioner is a citizens' group that 24participated in the siting proceeding and is so located as to 25be affected by the proposed facility, such petitioner shall be 26exempt from paying the costs of preparing and certifying the   SB2267- 12 -LRB104 09347 BDA 19405 b1record.2    (o) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a 3transfer station used exclusively for landscape waste, where 4landscape waste is held no longer than 24 hours from the time 5it was received, is not subject to the requirements of local 6siting approval under this Section, but is subject only to 7local zoning approval.8(Source: P.A. 100-382, eff. 8-25-17.) 9    (415 ILCS 5/40.1)  (from Ch. 111 1/2, par. 1040.1)10    Sec. 40.1.

The public 17hearing shall develop a record sufficient to form the basis of 18appeal of the decision in accordance with Section 40.1 of this 19Act. The fact that a member of the county board or governing 20body of the municipality has publicly expressed an opinion on 21an issue related to a site review proceeding shall not 22preclude the member from taking part in the proceeding and 23voting on the issue.24    (e) Decisions of the county board or governing body of the 25municipality are to be in writing, confirming a public hearing 26was held with testimony from at least one witness presented by   SB2267- 7 -LRB104 09347 BDA 19405 b1the applicant, specifying the reasons for the decision, such 2reasons to be in conformance with subsection (a) of this 3Section.

Such regulations, insofar as they apply to 17new pollution control facilities authorized to store, treat or 18dispose of any hazardous waste, shall be at least as stringent 19as the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery 20Act and any State or federal regulations adopted pursuant 21thereto.22    (j) Any new pollution control facility which has never 23obtained local siting approval under the provisions of this 24Section shall be required to obtain such approval after a 25final decision on an appeal of a permit denial.26    (k) A county board or governing body of a municipality may   SB2267- 11 -LRB104 09347 BDA 19405 b1charge applicants for siting review under this Section a 2reasonable fee to cover the reasonable and necessary costs 3incurred by such county or municipality in the siting review 4process.5    (l) The governing Authority as determined by subsection 6(c) of Section 39 of this Act may request the Department of 7Transportation to perform traffic impact studies of proposed 8or potential locations for required pollution control 9facilities.10    (m) An applicant may not file a request for local siting 11approval which is substantially the same as a request which 12was disapproved pursuant to a finding against the applicant 13under any of criteria (i) through (ix) of subsection (a) of 14this Section within the preceding 2 years.15    (n) In any review proceeding of a decision of the county 16board or governing body of a municipality made pursuant to the 17local siting review process, the petitioner in the review 18proceeding shall pay to the county or municipality the cost of 19preparing and certifying the record of proceedings. Should the 20petitioner in the review proceeding fail to make payment, the 21provisions of Section 3-109 of the Code of Civil Procedure 22shall apply.23    In the event the petitioner is a citizens' group that 24participated in the siting proceeding and is so located as to 25be affected by the proposed facility, such petitioner shall be 26exempt from paying the costs of preparing and certifying the   SB2267- 12 -LRB104 09347 BDA 19405 b1record.2    (o) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a 3transfer station used exclusively for landscape waste, where 4landscape waste is held no longer than 24 hours from the time 5it was received, is not subject to the requirements of local 6siting approval under this Section, but is subject only to 7local zoning approval.8(Source: P.A. 100-382, eff. 8-25-17.) 9    (415 ILCS 5/40.1)  (from Ch. 111 1/2, par. 1040.1)10    Sec. 40.1.
