For 7    purposes of State active duty, a disqualifying discharge 8    or separation will be the State equivalent under the 9    Military Code of Illinois for purposes of ineligibility of 10    reemployment under the Uniformed Services Employment and 11    Reemployment Rights Act as determined by appropriate State 12    military authority. 13        (5) A retroactive upgrade of a disqualifying discharge 14    or release will restore reemployment rights providing the 15    service member employee otherwise meets this Act's 16    eligibility criteria.17        (6) A service member whose employment with an employer 18    is interrupted by a period of active service shall be 19    permitted, upon request of that service member, to use 20    during such period of service any vacation, annual, or 21    similar leave with pay accrued by the service member 22    before the commencement of such period of active service. 23    No employer may require any such service member to use 24    vacation, annual, or similar leave during such period of 25    active service.

For 7    purposes of State active duty, a disqualifying discharge 8    or separation will be the State equivalent under the 9    Military Code of Illinois for purposes of ineligibility of 10    reemployment under the Uniformed Services Employment and 11    Reemployment Rights Act as determined by appropriate State 12    military authority. 13        (5) A retroactive upgrade of a disqualifying discharge 14    or release will restore reemployment rights providing the 15    service member employee otherwise meets this Act's 16    eligibility criteria.17        (6) A service member whose employment with an employer 18    is interrupted by a period of active service shall be 19    permitted, upon request of that service member, to use 20    during such period of service any vacation, annual, or 21    similar leave with pay accrued by the service member 22    before the commencement of such period of active service. 23    No employer may require any such service member to use 24    vacation, annual, or similar leave during such period of 25    active service.
