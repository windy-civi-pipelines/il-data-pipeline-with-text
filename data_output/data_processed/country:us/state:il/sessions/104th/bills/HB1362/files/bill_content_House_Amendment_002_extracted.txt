A service member employee is not 22    required to get permission from his or her employer for 23    military leave. The service member employee is only 24    required to give such employer advance notice of pending 25    service. This advance notice entitles a service member   10400HB1362ham002- 10 -LRB104 04440 KTG 24802 a1    employee to military leave.2        An employer may not impose conditions for military 3    leave, such as work shift replacement, not otherwise 4    imposed by this Act or other applicable law. This 5    paragraph shall not be construed to prevent an employer 6    from providing scheduling options to employees in lieu of 7    paid military leave.8        A service member employee is not required to 9    accommodate his or her employer's needs as to the timing, 10    frequency, or duration of military leave; however, 11    employers are permitted to bring concerns over the timing, 12    frequency, or duration of military leave to the attention 13    of the appropriate military authority. The accommodation 14    of these requests are subject to military law and 15    discretion.16        Military necessity as an exception to advance notice 17    of pending military leave for State active duty will be 18    determined by appropriate State military authority and is 19    not subject to judicial review. 20        For purposes of notice of pending military service 21    under paragraphs (2) or (3) of the definition of "military 22    service" under Section 1-10, an employer may require 23    notice by appropriate military authority on official 24    letterhead.

In 9    computing seniority and service requirements for promotion 10    eligibility or any other benefit of employment, the period 11    of military duty shall be counted as civilian service. 12    This paragraph does not apply to probationary periods.13        (4) State active duty ineligible discharge. For 14    purposes of State active duty, a disqualifying discharge 15    or separation will be the State equivalent under the 16    Military Code of Illinois for purposes of ineligibility of 17    reemployment under the Uniformed Services Employment and 18    Reemployment Rights Act as determined by appropriate State 19    military authority. 20        (5) A retroactive upgrade of a disqualifying discharge 21    or release will restore reemployment rights providing the 22    service member employee otherwise meets this Act's 23    eligibility criteria.24        (6) A service member whose employment with an employer 25    is interrupted by a period of active service shall be 26    permitted, upon request of that service member, to use   10400HB1362ham002- 12 -LRB104 04440 KTG 24802 a1    during such period of service any vacation, annual, or 2    similar leave with pay accrued by the service member 3    before the commencement of such period of active service. 4    No employer may require any such service member to use 5    vacation, annual, or similar leave during such period of 6    active service. This provision expressly applies to both 7    paid and unpaid active service, including, but not limited 8    to: travel to and from military orders, rest periods 9    immediately before or after military orders, and military 10    service during which the service member does not receive 11    pay from the military. 12(Source: P.A. 100-1101, eff. 1-1-19.) 13    (330 ILCS 61/5-10)14    Sec. 5-10.

Upon return to work with his or her employer 17    for more than 90 calendar days, the public employee's 18    right to differential pay shall be reinstated. Nothing in 19    this Section shall entitle a public employee to 20    differential pay in excess of 60 work days per calendar 21    year for voluntary active service. 22        (4) Public employees are not entitled to differential 23    pay under this Section for periods of unpaid active 24    service including, but not limited to: travel to and from 25    military orders, rest periods immediately before or after 26    military orders, and military service in which the public   10400HB1362ham002- 14 -LRB104 04440 KTG 24802 a1    employee does not receive pay from the military.
