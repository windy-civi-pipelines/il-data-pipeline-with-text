Sue Rezin SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 55 ILCS 5/5-12020    Amends the Counties Code. Provides that a county may not approve the siting of a commercial wind energy facility, a commercial solar energy facility, or both in an unincorporated area that is located within a 3-mile radius of a municipality, if: (1) the municipality has not approved the siting of the facility or facilities at that location; (2) the county board or the corporate authorities of the municipality have determined that any portion of the facility or facilities will be located on land with a Soil Productivity Index that is greater than or equal to 90; or (3) the county board or the corporate authorities of the municipality have determined that the owners or operators of the facility or facilities have failed to comply with one or more National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements for the site. Provides that the provisions apply regardless of whether the municipality has adopted zoning ordinances or is regulating wind farms and electric-generating wind devices under specified provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code. Requires each commercial solar energy facility to have the minimum number of fire hydrants required by ordinances governing the servicing fire department or fire protection district or, if there are no requirements by ordinances governing the servicing fire department or fire protection district, then the minimum number required by the county board. Allows a county to require a commercial solar energy facility to be sited at least 500 feet to the nearest point on the property line of the nonparticipating zoned residential.

Sue Rezin SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 55 ILCS 5/5-12020    Amends the Counties Code. Provides that a county may not approve the siting of a commercial wind energy facility, a commercial solar energy facility, or both in an unincorporated area that is located within a 3-mile radius of a municipality, if: (1) the municipality has not approved the siting of the facility or facilities at that location; (2) the county board or the corporate authorities of the municipality have determined that any portion of the facility or facilities will be located on land with a Soil Productivity Index that is greater than or equal to 90; or (3) the county board or the corporate authorities of the municipality have determined that the owners or operators of the facility or facilities have failed to comply with one or more National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requirements for the site. Provides that the provisions apply regardless of whether the municipality has adopted zoning ordinances or is regulating wind farms and electric-generating wind devices under specified provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code. Requires each commercial solar energy facility to have the minimum number of fire hydrants required by ordinances governing the servicing fire department or fire protection district or, if there are no requirements by ordinances governing the servicing fire department or fire protection district, then the minimum number required by the county board. Allows a county to require a commercial solar energy facility to be sited at least 500 feet to the nearest point on the property line of the nonparticipating zoned residential.
