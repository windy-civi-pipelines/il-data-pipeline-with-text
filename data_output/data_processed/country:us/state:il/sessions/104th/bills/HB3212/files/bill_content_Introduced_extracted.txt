Short title. This Act may be cited as the Local 5Government Bankruptcy Neutral Evaluation Act. 6    Section 2. Findings. Filing for Chapter 9 can reduce 7service levels to the taxpayers and residents of a local 8public entity. In some circumstances, it can have major 9short-term and long-term fiscal consequences for the entity, 10the surrounding entities, and the State. Filing for bankruptcy 11protection under Chapter 9 should be considered a last resort, 12to be instituted only after other reasonable efforts have been 13made to avoid a bankruptcy filing or otherwise appropriately 14plan for it. It is in the interest of the State, units of local 15government, and the public that local governmental entities 16have sufficiently sound financial capacity to provide required 17services to the public during any restructuring or financial 18reorganization process. Furthermore, it is in the best 19interest of the public, the State, and local governmental 20entities that employees, trade creditors, bondholders, and 21other interest holders be included in an appropriate 22restructuring process and have an adequate understanding of 23the financial capacity of local governmental entities and   HB3212- 2 -LRB104 10230 RTM 20304 b1their obligations, as a clear understanding of both is 2necessary for any restructuring or reorganization process.3    To the extent financial relief granted through Chapter 9 4can affect debt service payments, the bondholders have a 5direct interest in the Chapter 9 process, particularly prior 6to filing. Therefore, it is important for those parties to be 7able to participate in a prefiling confidential neutral 8evaluation process that could assist parties in reaching a 9settlement and avoiding a bankruptcy filing or otherwise lead 10to a pre-negotiated consensual plan of readjustment as clearly 11contemplated by subsection (c) of Section 109 of Title 11 of 12the United States Code.13    To the extent financial relief granted through Chapter 9 14could affect public employee compensation, employees have a 15direct interest in the Chapter 9 process, particularly prior 16to filing. Therefore, it is important for those parties to be 17able to participate in a prefiling confidential neutral 18evaluation process that could assist parties in reaching a 19settlement or otherwise lead to a pre-negotiated, consensual 20plan of adjustment and avoid a Chapter 9 filing.21    Given the connection between State allocations and local 22budgets, the State has a role in assisting local public 23entities to address potential insolvency with the goal of 24averting bankruptcy filings where possible and providing a 25process designed to make the debt restructuring process in or 26outside of a Chapter 9 bankruptcy as cost effective and   HB3212- 3 -LRB104 10230 RTM 20304 b1efficient as possible for all participants. 2    Illinois taxpayers who rely on public safety, senior, 3recreational, health, library, and other public services, as 4well as those who own and operate businesses in our 5communities, deserve every reasonable and appropriate effort 6that State and local government can make to avoid adverse 7consequences of Chapter 9 bankruptcy filings, particularly 8where a neutral evaluation may lead to the avoidance of 9Chapter 9 filing by an out-of-court resolution of outstanding 10obligations and disputes. 11    Resolving local and State business and financial issues in 12a timely, fair, and cost-effective manner is an integral part 13of a successful government and is in the public interest. It 14has long been recognized that alternative dispute resolution 15proceedings, like a neutral evaluation, offer an economical, 16discreet, and expeditious way to resolve potentially 17devastating situations. 18    Through the neutral evaluation process, the neutral 19evaluator, a specially trained, neutral third party, can 20assist the local public entity and its creditors and 21stakeholders to fully explore alternatives, while allowing the 22interested parties to exchange information in a confidential 23environment with the assistance and supervision of a neutral 24evaluator to determine whether the entity's contractual and 25financial obligations can be renegotiated on a consensual 26basis.    HB3212- 4 -LRB104 10230 RTM 20304 b1    Section 3.

A 10local public entity may invite holders of contingent claims to 11participate as interested parties in the neutral evaluation if 12the local public entity determines that the contingency is 13likely to occur and the claim may represent $5,000,000 or 14comprise more than 5% of the local public entity's debt or 15obligations, whichever is less. 16    "Local public entity" means any county, municipality, 17township, special district, public authority, public agency, 18unit of local government, school district, or any other entity 19that is a political subdivision or public agency or 20instrumentality of the State, or that qualifies as a debtor 21under any other federal bankruptcy law applicable to local 22public entities.23    "Local public entity representative" means the person or 24persons designated by the local public entity with authority 25to make recommendations and to attend the neutral evaluation 26on behalf of the governing body of the local public entity.   HB3212- 6 -LRB104 10230 RTM 20304 b1    "Neutral evaluation" is a form of non-binding alternative 2dispute resolution.  3    Section 5.

If any party to the neutral evaluation 22objects to the neutral evaluator, then that party shall notify 23all other parties to the neutral evaluation, including the 24neutral evaluator, within 15 days after receipt of the notice 25from the neutral evaluator, and the neutral evaluator shall 26withdraw and a new neutral evaluator shall be selected under   HB3212- 9 -LRB104 10230 RTM 20304 b1subsections (c) and (d) of this Section. 2    (g) Prior to the neutral evaluation process, the neutral 3evaluator shall not establish another relationship with any of 4the parties in a manner that would raise questions about the 5integrity of the neutral evaluation, except that the neutral 6evaluator may conduct further neutral evaluations regarding 7other potential local public entities that may involve some of 8the same or similar constituents to a prior mediation.9    (h) The neutral evaluator shall conduct the neutral 10evaluation process in a manner that promotes voluntary, 11uncoerced decision-making in which each party makes free and 12informed choices regarding the process and outcome. 13    (i) The neutral evaluator shall not impose a settlement on 14the parties.

Effective immediately.LRB104 10230 RTM 20304 b  A BILL FOR HB3212LRB104 10230 RTM 20304 b1    AN ACT concerning State government. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the Local 5Government Bankruptcy Neutral Evaluation Act. 6    Section 2. Findings. Filing for Chapter 9 can reduce 7service levels to the taxpayers and residents of a local 8public entity. In some circumstances, it can have major 9short-term and long-term fiscal consequences for the entity, 10the surrounding entities, and the State. Filing for bankruptcy 11protection under Chapter 9 should be considered a last resort, 12to be instituted only after other reasonable efforts have been 13made to avoid a bankruptcy filing or otherwise appropriately 14plan for it. It is in the interest of the State, units of local 15government, and the public that local governmental entities 16have sufficiently sound financial capacity to provide required 17services to the public during any restructuring or financial 18reorganization process. Furthermore, it is in the best 19interest of the public, the State, and local governmental 20entities that employees, trade creditors, bondholders, and 21other interest holders be included in an appropriate 22restructuring process and have an adequate understanding of 23the financial capacity of local governmental entities and   HB3212- 2 -LRB104 10230 RTM 20304 b1their obligations, as a clear understanding of both is 2necessary for any restructuring or reorganization process.3    To the extent financial relief granted through Chapter 9 4can affect debt service payments, the bondholders have a 5direct interest in the Chapter 9 process, particularly prior 6to filing. Therefore, it is important for those parties to be 7able to participate in a prefiling confidential neutral 8evaluation process that could assist parties in reaching a 9settlement and avoiding a bankruptcy filing or otherwise lead 10to a pre-negotiated consensual plan of readjustment as clearly 11contemplated by subsection (c) of Section 109 of Title 11 of 12the United States Code.13    To the extent financial relief granted through Chapter 9 14could affect public employee compensation, employees have a 15direct interest in the Chapter 9 process, particularly prior 16to filing. Therefore, it is important for those parties to be 17able to participate in a prefiling confidential neutral 18evaluation process that could assist parties in reaching a 19settlement or otherwise lead to a pre-negotiated, consensual 20plan of adjustment and avoid a Chapter 9 filing.21    Given the connection between State allocations and local 22budgets, the State has a role in assisting local public 23entities to address potential insolvency with the goal of 24averting bankruptcy filings where possible and providing a 25process designed to make the debt restructuring process in or 26outside of a Chapter 9 bankruptcy as cost effective and   HB3212- 3 -LRB104 10230 RTM 20304 b1efficient as possible for all participants. 2    Illinois taxpayers who rely on public safety, senior, 3recreational, health, library, and other public services, as 4well as those who own and operate businesses in our 5communities, deserve every reasonable and appropriate effort 6that State and local government can make to avoid adverse 7consequences of Chapter 9 bankruptcy filings, particularly 8where a neutral evaluation may lead to the avoidance of 9Chapter 9 filing by an out-of-court resolution of outstanding 10obligations and disputes. 11    Resolving local and State business and financial issues in 12a timely, fair, and cost-effective manner is an integral part 13of a successful government and is in the public interest. It 14has long been recognized that alternative dispute resolution 15proceedings, like a neutral evaluation, offer an economical, 16discreet, and expeditious way to resolve potentially 17devastating situations. 18    Through the neutral evaluation process, the neutral 19evaluator, a specially trained, neutral third party, can 20assist the local public entity and its creditors and 21stakeholders to fully explore alternatives, while allowing the 22interested parties to exchange information in a confidential 23environment with the assistance and supervision of a neutral 24evaluator to determine whether the entity's contractual and 25financial obligations can be renegotiated on a consensual 26basis.    HB3212- 4 -LRB104 10230 RTM 20304 b1    Section 3.
