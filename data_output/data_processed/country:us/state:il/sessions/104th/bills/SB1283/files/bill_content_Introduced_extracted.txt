Coroners in their discretion shall notify 11such physician as is designated in accordance with Section 123-3014 to attempt to ascertain the cause of death, either by 13autopsy or otherwise.14    In cases of accidental death involving a motor vehicle in 15which the decedent was (1) the operator or a suspected 16operator of a motor vehicle, or (2) a pedestrian 16 years of 17age or older, the coroner shall require that a blood specimen 18of at least 30 cc., and if medically possible a urine specimen 19of at least 30 cc. or as much as possible up to 30 cc., be 20withdrawn from the body of the decedent in a timely fashion 21after the crash causing his death, by such physician as has 22been designated in accordance with Section 3-3014, or by the 23coroner or deputy coroner or a qualified person designated by 24such physician, coroner, or deputy coroner.

For proper preservation of 5the specimens, collected blood and buccal specimens shall be 6dried and tissue specimens shall be frozen if available 7equipment exists. As soon as possible, but no later than 30 8days after the collection of the specimens, the coroner or 9medical examiner shall release those specimens to the police 10agency responsible for investigating the death. As soon as 11possible, but no later than 30 days after the receipt from the 12coroner or medical examiner, the police agency shall submit 13the specimens using the agency case number to a National DNA 14Index System (NDIS) participating laboratory within this 15State, such as the Illinois State Police, Division of Forensic 16Services, for analysis and categorizing into genetic marker 17groupings. The results of the analysis and categorizing into 18genetic marker groupings shall be provided to the Illinois 19State Police and shall be maintained by the Illinois State 20Police in the State central repository in the same manner, and 21subject to the same conditions, as provided in Section 5-4-3 22of the Unified Code of Corrections.

The 4summons shall command these persons to present themselves 5personally at such a place and time as the coroner shall 6determine, and may be in any form which the coroner shall 7determine and may incorporate any reasonable form of request 8for acknowledgment which the coroner deems practical and 9provides a reliable proof of service. The summons may be 10served by first class mail. From the 8 persons so summoned, the 11coroner shall select 6 to serve as the jury for the inquest. 12Inquests may be continued from time to time, as the coroner may 13deem necessary. The 6 jurors selected in a given case may view 14the body of the deceased. If at any continuation of an inquest 15one or more of the original jurors shall be unable to continue 16to serve, the coroner shall fill the vacancy or vacancies. A 17juror serving pursuant to this paragraph shall receive 18compensation from the county at the same rate as the rate of 19compensation that is paid to petit or grand jurors in the 20county. The coroner shall furnish to each juror without fee at 21the time of his discharge a certificate of the number of days 22in attendance at an inquest, and, upon being presented with 23such certificate, the county treasurer shall pay to the juror 24the sum provided for his services.25    In counties which have a jury commission, in cases of 26apparent suicide or homicide or of accidental death, the   SB1283- 6 -LRB104 06075 RTM 16108 b1coroner may conduct an inquest. The jury commission shall 2provide at least 8 jurors to the coroner, from whom the coroner 3shall select any 6 to serve as the jury for the inquest. 4Inquests may be continued from time to time as the coroner may 5deem necessary. The 6 jurors originally chosen in a given case 6may view the body of the deceased. If at any continuation of an 7inquest one or more of the 6 jurors originally chosen shall be 8unable to continue to serve, the coroner shall fill the 9vacancy or vacancies. At the coroner's discretion, additional 10jurors to fill such vacancies shall be supplied by the jury 11commission. A juror serving pursuant to this paragraph in such 12county shall receive compensation from the county at the same 13rate as the rate of compensation that is paid to petit or grand 14jurors in the county.15    In every case in which a fire is determined to be a 16contributing factor in a death, the coroner shall report the 17death to the Office of the State Fire Marshal. The coroner 18shall provide a copy of the death certificate (i) within 30 19days after filing the permanent death certificate and (ii) in 20a manner that is agreed upon by the coroner and the State Fire 21Marshal. 22    In every case in which a drug overdose is officially 23determined to be the cause or a contributing factor in the 24death, the coroner or medical examiner shall report the death 25to the Department of Public Health. The Department of Public 26Health shall adopt rules regarding specific information that   SB1283- 7 -LRB104 06075 RTM 16108 b1must be reported in the event of such a death, including, at a 2minimum, the following information, if possible: (i) the cause 3of the overdose; (ii) whether or not fentanyl was part or all 4of the consumed substance; (iii) if fentanyl is part of the 5consumed substance, what other substances were consumed; and 6(iv) if fentanyl is part of the consumed substance, in what 7proportion was fentanyl consumed to other substance or 8substances. The coroner must also communicate whether there 9was a suspicious level of fentanyl in combination with other 10controlled substances present to all law enforcement agencies 11in whose jurisdiction the deceased's body was found in a 12prompt manner. As used in this paragraph, "overdose" has the 13same meaning as it does in Section 414 of the Illinois 14Controlled Substances Act, but it does not include any cause 15of death caused by fentanyl, which shall be considered 16poisoning. In every case in which fentanyl is determined to be 17the cause or a contributing factor in the death, the coroner or 18medical examiner shall report the death to the Department of 19Public Health as "fentanyl poisoning". The Department of 20Public Health shall issue a semiannual report to the General 21Assembly summarizing the reports received. The Department 22shall also provide on its website a monthly report of overdose 23death and fentanyl poisoning death figures organized by 24location, age, and any other factors the Department deems 25appropriate. 26    In addition, in every case in which domestic violence is   SB1283- 8 -LRB104 06075 RTM 16108 b1determined to be a contributing factor in a death, the coroner 2shall report the death to the Illinois State Police.3    All deaths in State institutions and all deaths of wards 4of the State or youth in care as defined in Section 4d of the 5Children and Family Services Act in private care facilities or 6in programs funded by the Department of Human Services under 7its powers relating to mental health and developmental 8disabilities or alcoholism and substance abuse or funded by 9the Department of Children and Family Services shall be 10reported to the coroner of the county in which the facility is 11located. If the coroner has reason to believe that an 12investigation is needed to determine whether the death was 13caused by maltreatment or negligent care of the ward of the 14State or youth in care as defined in Section 4d of the Children 15and Family Services Act, the coroner may conduct a preliminary 16investigation of the circumstances of such death as in cases 17of death under circumstances set forth in subparagraphs (a) 18through (e) of this Section.19(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23; 20103-154, eff. 6-30-23; 103-842, eff. 1-1-25.)
