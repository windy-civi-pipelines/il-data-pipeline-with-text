It shall be the 6responsibility of the lender to proceed with the collecting 7and disposing of collateral on the State Guarantee under this 8Section, Section 830-35, Section 830-45, Section 830-50, 9Section 830-55, or Article 835 within 14 months of the time the 10State Guarantee is declared delinquent; provided, however, 11that the lender shall not collect or dispose of collateral on 12the State Guarantee without the express written prior approval 13of the Authority. If the lender does not dispose of the 14collateral within 14 months, the lender shall be liable to 15repay to the State interest on the State Guarantee equal to the 16same rate which the lender charges on the State Guarantee; 17provided, however, that the Authority may extend the 14-month 18period for a lender in the case of bankruptcy or extenuating 19circumstances. The Fund from which a payment is made shall be 20reimbursed for any amounts paid from that Fund under this 21Section, Section 830-35, Section 830-45, Section 830-50, 22Section 830-55, or Article 835 upon liquidation of the 23collateral.

Money may be borrowed from the Fund by   SB2159- 7 -LRB104 11477 HLH 21566 b1the Authority for the sole purpose of paying certain interest 2costs for farmers associated with selling a loan subject to a 3State Guarantee in a secondary market as may be deemed 4reasonable and necessary by the Authority.5    (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 830-30 6with respect to the farmers and lenders who may obtain State 7Guarantees, the Authority may promulgate rules establishing 8the eligibility of farmers and lenders to participate in the 9State guarantee program and the terms, standards, and 10procedures that will apply, when the Authority finds that 11emergency conditions in Illinois agriculture have created the 12need for State Guarantees pursuant to terms, standards, and 13procedures other than those specified in this Section.14(Source: P.A. 100-919, eff. 8-17-18; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19.) 15    (20 ILCS 3501/830-35)16    Sec. 830-35. State Guarantees for loans to farmers and 17agribusiness; eligibility.18    (a) The Authority is authorized to issue State Guarantees 19to lenders for loans to eligible farmers and agribusinesses 20for purposes set forth in this Section. For purposes of this 21Section, an eligible farmer shall be a resident of Illinois 22(i) who is principal operator of a farm or land, at least 50% 23of whose annual gross income is derived from farming, (ii) 24whose annual total sales of agricultural products, 25commodities, or livestock exceeds $20,000, and (iii) whose net   SB2159- 8 -LRB104 11477 HLH 21566 b1worth does not exceed $500,000. An eligible agribusiness shall 2be that as defined in Section 801-10 of this Act. The Authority 3may approve applications by farmers and agribusinesses that 4promote diversification of the farm economy of this State 5through the growth and development of new crops or livestock 6not customarily grown or produced in this State or that 7emphasize a vertical integration of grain or livestock 8produced or raised in this State into a finished agricultural 9product for consumption or use. "New crops or livestock not 10customarily grown or produced in this State" shall not include 11corn, soybeans, wheat, swine, or beef or dairy cattle. 12"Vertical integration of grain or livestock produced or raised 13in this State" shall include any new or existing grain or 14livestock grown or produced in this State. Lenders shall apply 15for the State Guarantees on forms provided by the Authority, 16certify that the application and any other documents submitted 17are true and correct, and pay an administrative fee as 18determined by the Authority. The applicant shall be 19responsible for paying any fees or charges involved in 20recording mortgages, releases, financing statements, insurance 21for secondary market issues and any other similar fees or 22charges as the Authority may require. The application shall at 23a minimum contain the farmer's or agribusiness' name, address, 24present credit and financial information, including cash flow 25statements, financial statements, balance sheets, and any 26other information pertinent to the application, and the   SB2159- 9 -LRB104 11477 HLH 21566 b1collateral to be used to secure the State Guarantee. In 2addition, the lender must agree to charge an interest rate, 3which may vary, on the loan that the Authority determines to be 4below the market rate of interest generally available to the 5borrower. If both the lender and applicant agree, the interest 6rate on the State Guarantee Loan can be converted to a fixed 7interest rate at any time during the term of the loan. Any 8State Guarantees provided under this Section (i) shall not 9exceed $500,000 per farmer or an amount as determined by the 10Authority on a case-by-case basis for an agribusiness, (ii) 11shall not exceed a term of 15 years, and (iii) shall be subject 12to an annual review and renewal by the lender and the 13Authority; provided that only one such State Guarantee shall 14be made per farmer or agribusiness, except that additional 15State Guarantees may be made for purposes of expansion of 16projects financed in part by a previously issued State 17Guarantee. No State Guarantee shall be revoked by the 18Authority without a 90-day notice, in writing, to all parties. 19The lender shall not call due any loan for any reason except 20for lack of performance, insufficient collateral, or maturity. 21A lender may review and withdraw or continue with a State 22Guarantee on an annual basis after the first 5 years following 23closing of the loan application if the loan contract provides 24for an interest rate that shall not vary. A lender shall not 25withdraw a State Guarantee if the loan contract provides for 26an interest rate that may vary, except for reasons set forth   SB2159- 10 -LRB104 11477 HLH 21566 b1herein.2    (b) The Authority shall provide or renew a State Guarantee 3to a lender if:4        (i) A fee equal to 25 basis points on the loan is paid 5    to the Authority on an annual basis by the lender.6        (ii) The application provides collateral acceptable to 7    the Authority that is at least equal to the State's 8    portion of the Guarantee to be provided.9        (iii) The lender assumes all responsibility and costs 10    for pursuing legal action on collecting any loan that is 11    delinquent or in default.12        (iv) The lender is responsible for the first 15% of 13    the outstanding principal of the note for which the State 14    Guarantee has been applied.15    (c) There is hereby created outside of the State treasury 16a special fund to be known as the Illinois Farmer and 17Agribusiness Loan Guarantee Fund. The State Treasurer shall be 18custodian of this Fund. Any amounts in the Fund not currently 19needed to meet the obligations of the Fund shall be invested as 20provided by law, or used by the Authority to make direct loans 21or originate or purchase loan participations under subsection 22(i) or (r) of Section 801-40, or used by the Authority, acting 23jointly with an appropriate administrative agency of the State 24using appropriations or other available funds with the 25Governor's approval, for the purposes set out in Sections 26850-5, 850-10, or 850-15 of this Act. All interest earned from   SB2159- 11 -LRB104 11477 HLH 21566 b1these investments shall be deposited into the Fund until the 2Fund reaches the maximum amounts authorized in this Act; 3thereafter, interest earned shall be deposited into the 4General Revenue Fund. After September 1, 1989, annual 5investment earnings equal to 1.5% of the Fund shall remain in 6the Fund to be used for the purposes established in Section 7830-40 of this Act. All earnings on direct loans, or loan 8participations made by the Authority under subsection (i) or 9(r) of Section 801-40, or derived from the opportunities set 10out in Sections 850-5, 850-10, or 850-15 of this Act with 11amounts in this Fund shall become funds of the Authority.

Amounts to be paid from the Industrial 19Project Insurance Fund created under Article 805 of this Act 20may be paid by the Authority directly to satisfy claims and 21need not be deposited first into the Illinois Farmer and 22Agribusiness Loan Guarantee Fund. If for any reason the 23General Assembly fails to make an appropriation sufficient to 24meet these obligations, this Act shall constitute an 25irrevocable and continuing appropriation of an amount 26necessary to secure guarantees as defaults occur and the   SB2159- 12 -LRB104 11477 HLH 21566 b1irrevocable and continuing authority for, and direction to, 2the State Treasurer and the Comptroller to make the necessary 3transfers to the Illinois Farmer and Agribusiness Loan 4Guarantee Fund, as directed by the Governor, out of the 5General Revenue Fund.
