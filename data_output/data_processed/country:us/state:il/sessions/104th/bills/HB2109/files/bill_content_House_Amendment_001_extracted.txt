Also included in the selling price is any amount 6received by the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle 7that is not calculated at the time the lease is executed, 8including, but not limited to, excess mileage charges and 9charges for excess wear and tear. For sales that occur in 10Illinois, with respect to any amount received by the lessor 11from the lessee for the leased vehicle that is not calculated 12at the time the lease is executed, the lessor who purchased the 13motor vehicle does not incur the tax imposed by the Use Tax Act 14on those amounts, and the retailer who makes the retail sale of 15the motor vehicle to the lessor is not required to collect the 16tax imposed by this Act or to pay the tax imposed by the 17Retailers' Occupation Tax Act on those amounts. However, the 18lessor who purchased the motor vehicle assumes the liability 19for reporting and paying the tax on those amounts directly to 20the Department in the same form (Illinois Retailers' 21Occupation Tax, and local retailers' occupation taxes, if 22applicable) in which the retailer would have reported and paid 23such tax if the retailer had accounted for the tax to the 24Department. For amounts received by the lessor from the lessee 25that are not calculated at the time the lease is executed, the 26lessor must file the return and pay the tax to the Department   10400HB2109ham001- 9 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1by the due date otherwise required by this Act for returns 2other than transaction returns. If the retailer is entitled 3under this Act to a discount for collecting and remitting the 4tax imposed under this Act to the Department with respect to 5the sale of the motor vehicle to the lessor, then the right to 6the discount provided in this Act shall be transferred to the 7lessor with respect to the tax paid by the lessor for any 8amount received by the lessor from the lessee for the leased 9vehicle that is not calculated at the time the lease is 10executed; provided that the discount is only allowed if the 11return is timely filed and for amounts timely paid.

In the case of a motor 20vehicle that is sold for the purpose of leasing for a defined 21period of longer than one year, the sale occurs at the time of 22the delivery of the vehicle, regardless of the due date of any 23lease payments. A lessor who incurs a Retailers' Occupation 24Tax liability on the sale of a motor vehicle coming off lease 25may not take a credit against that liability for the Use Tax 26the lessor paid upon the purchase of the motor vehicle (or for   10400HB2109ham001- 10 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1any tax the lessor paid with respect to any amount received by 2the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle that was not 3calculated at the time the lease was executed) if the selling 4price of the motor vehicle at the time of purchase was 5calculated using the definition of "selling price" as defined 6in this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 7Act to the contrary, lessors shall file all returns and make 8all payments required under this paragraph to the Department 9by electronic means in the manner and form as required by the 10Department. This paragraph does not apply to leases of motor 11vehicles for which, at the time the lease is entered into, the 12term of the lease is not a defined period, including leases 13with a defined initial period with the option to continue the 14lease on a month-to-month or other basis beyond the initial 15defined period. 16    The phrase "like kind and character" shall be liberally 17construed (including, but not limited to, any form of motor 18vehicle for any form of motor vehicle, or any kind of farm or 19agricultural implement for any other kind of farm or 20agricultural implement), while not including a kind of item 21which, if sold at retail by that retailer, would be exempt from 22retailers' occupation tax and use tax as an isolated or 23occasional sale.24    "Department" means the Department of Revenue.25    "Person" means any natural individual, firm, partnership, 26association, joint stock company, joint adventure, public or   10400HB2109ham001- 11 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1private corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, 2executor, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed 3by order of any court.4    "Retailer" means and includes every person engaged in the 5business of making sales, including, on and after January 1, 62025, leases, at retail as defined in this Section. With 7respect to leases, a "retailer" also means a "lessor", except 8as otherwise provided in this Act. 9    A person who holds himself or herself out as being engaged 10(or who habitually engages) in selling tangible personal 11property at retail is a retailer hereunder with respect to 12such sales (and not primarily in a service occupation) 13notwithstanding the fact that such person designs and produces 14such tangible personal property on special order for the 15purchaser and in such a way as to render the property of value 16only to such purchaser, if such tangible personal property so 17produced on special order serves substantially the same 18function as stock or standard items of tangible personal 19property that are sold at retail.20    A person whose activities are organized and conducted 21primarily as a not-for-profit service enterprise, and who 22engages in selling tangible personal property at retail 23(whether to the public or merely to members and their guests) 24is a retailer with respect to such transactions, excepting 25only a person organized and operated exclusively for 26charitable, religious or educational purposes either (1), to   10400HB2109ham001- 12 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1the extent of sales by such person to its members, students, 2patients, or inmates of tangible personal property to be used 3primarily for the purposes of such person, or (2), to the 4extent of sales by such person of tangible personal property 5which is not sold or offered for sale by persons organized for 6profit. The selling of school books and school supplies by 7schools at retail to students is not "primarily for the 8purposes of" the school which does such selling.

However, any person who is engaged in a business 4which is not subject to the tax imposed by the Retailers' 5Occupation Tax Act because of involving the sale of or a 6contract to sell real estate or a construction contract to 7improve real estate, but who, in the course of conducting such 8business, transfers tangible personal property to users or 9consumers in the finished form in which it was purchased, and 10which does not become real estate, under any provision of a 11construction contract or real estate sale or real estate sales 12agreement entered into with some other person arising out of 13or because of such nontaxable business, is a retailer to the 14extent of the value of the tangible personal property so 15transferred. If, in such transaction, a separate charge is 16made for the tangible personal property so transferred, the 17value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, is the 18amount so separately charged, but not less than the cost of 19such property to the transferor; if no separate charge is 20made, the value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, 21is the cost to the transferor of such tangible personal 22property.23    "Retailer maintaining a place of business in this State", 24or any like term, means and includes any of the following 25retailers:26        (1) A retailer having or maintaining within this   10400HB2109ham001- 14 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1    State, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, 2    distribution house, sales house, warehouse, or other place 3    of business, or any agent or other representative 4    operating within this State under the authority of the 5    retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such 6    place of business or agent or other representative is 7    located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such 8    retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this 9    State. However, the ownership of property that is located 10    at the premises of a printer with which the retailer has 11    contracted for printing and that consists of the final 12    printed product, property that becomes a part of the final 13    printed product, or copy from which the printed product is 14    produced shall not result in the retailer being deemed to 15    have or maintain an office, distribution house, sales 16    house, warehouse, or other place of business within this 17    State.18        (1.1) A retailer having a contract with a person 19    located in this State under which the person, for a 20    commission or other consideration based upon the sale of 21    tangible personal property by the retailer, directly or 22    indirectly refers potential customers to the retailer by 23    providing to the potential customers a promotional code or 24    other mechanism that allows the retailer to track 25    purchases referred by such persons. Examples of mechanisms 26    that allow the retailer to track purchases referred by   10400HB2109ham001- 15 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1    such persons include, but are not limited to, the use of a 2    link on the person's Internet website, promotional codes 3    distributed through the person's hand-delivered or mailed 4    material, and promotional codes distributed by the person 5    through radio or other broadcast media.

A 12    retailer meeting the requirements of this paragraph (1.1) 13    shall be presumed to be maintaining a place of business in 14    this State but may rebut this presumption by submitting 15    proof that the referrals or other activities pursued 16    within this State by such persons were not sufficient to 17    meet the nexus standards of the United States Constitution 18    during the preceding 4 quarterly periods.19        (1.2) Beginning July 1, 2011, a retailer having a 20    contract with a person located in this State under which:21            (A) the retailer sells the same or substantially 22        similar line of products as the person located in this 23        State and does so using an identical or substantially 24        similar name, trade name, or trademark as the person 25        located in this State; and26            (B) the retailer provides a commission or other   10400HB2109ham001- 16 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1        consideration to the person located in this State 2        based upon the sale of tangible personal property by 3        the retailer.4        The provisions of this paragraph (1.2) shall apply 5    only if the cumulative gross receipts from sales of 6    tangible personal property by the retailer to customers in 7    this State under all such contracts exceed $10,000 during 8    the preceding 4 quarterly periods ending on the last day 9    of March, June, September, and December.10        (2) (Blank).11        (3) (Blank).12        (4) (Blank).13        (5) (Blank).14        (6) (Blank).15        (7) (Blank).16        (8) (Blank).17        (9) Beginning October 1, 2018, a retailer making sales 18    of tangible personal property to purchasers in Illinois 19    from outside of Illinois if: 20            (A) the cumulative gross receipts from sales of 21        tangible personal property to purchasers in Illinois 22        are $100,000 or more; or 23            (B) the retailer enters into 200 or more separate 24        transactions for the sale of tangible personal 25        property to purchasers in Illinois. 26        The retailer shall determine on a quarterly basis,   10400HB2109ham001- 17 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1    ending on the last day of March, June, September, and 2    December, whether he or she meets the criteria of either 3    subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph (9) for the 4    preceding 12-month period.

Also included in the selling price is any amount 6received by the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle 7that is not calculated at the time the lease is executed, 8including, but not limited to, excess mileage charges and 9charges for excess wear and tear. For sales that occur in 10Illinois, with respect to any amount received by the lessor 11from the lessee for the leased vehicle that is not calculated 12at the time the lease is executed, the lessor who purchased the 13motor vehicle does not incur the tax imposed by the Use Tax Act 14on those amounts, and the retailer who makes the retail sale of 15the motor vehicle to the lessor is not required to collect the 16tax imposed by this Act or to pay the tax imposed by the 17Retailers' Occupation Tax Act on those amounts. However, the 18lessor who purchased the motor vehicle assumes the liability 19for reporting and paying the tax on those amounts directly to 20the Department in the same form (Illinois Retailers' 21Occupation Tax, and local retailers' occupation taxes, if 22applicable) in which the retailer would have reported and paid 23such tax if the retailer had accounted for the tax to the 24Department. For amounts received by the lessor from the lessee 25that are not calculated at the time the lease is executed, the 26lessor must file the return and pay the tax to the Department   10400HB2109ham001- 9 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1by the due date otherwise required by this Act for returns 2other than transaction returns. If the retailer is entitled 3under this Act to a discount for collecting and remitting the 4tax imposed under this Act to the Department with respect to 5the sale of the motor vehicle to the lessor, then the right to 6the discount provided in this Act shall be transferred to the 7lessor with respect to the tax paid by the lessor for any 8amount received by the lessor from the lessee for the leased 9vehicle that is not calculated at the time the lease is 10executed; provided that the discount is only allowed if the 11return is timely filed and for amounts timely paid.

In the case of a motor 20vehicle that is sold for the purpose of leasing for a defined 21period of longer than one year, the sale occurs at the time of 22the delivery of the vehicle, regardless of the due date of any 23lease payments. A lessor who incurs a Retailers' Occupation 24Tax liability on the sale of a motor vehicle coming off lease 25may not take a credit against that liability for the Use Tax 26the lessor paid upon the purchase of the motor vehicle (or for   10400HB2109ham001- 10 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1any tax the lessor paid with respect to any amount received by 2the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle that was not 3calculated at the time the lease was executed) if the selling 4price of the motor vehicle at the time of purchase was 5calculated using the definition of "selling price" as defined 6in this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 7Act to the contrary, lessors shall file all returns and make 8all payments required under this paragraph to the Department 9by electronic means in the manner and form as required by the 10Department. This paragraph does not apply to leases of motor 11vehicles for which, at the time the lease is entered into, the 12term of the lease is not a defined period, including leases 13with a defined initial period with the option to continue the 14lease on a month-to-month or other basis beyond the initial 15defined period. 16    The phrase "like kind and character" shall be liberally 17construed (including, but not limited to, any form of motor 18vehicle for any form of motor vehicle, or any kind of farm or 19agricultural implement for any other kind of farm or 20agricultural implement), while not including a kind of item 21which, if sold at retail by that retailer, would be exempt from 22retailers' occupation tax and use tax as an isolated or 23occasional sale.24    "Department" means the Department of Revenue.25    "Person" means any natural individual, firm, partnership, 26association, joint stock company, joint adventure, public or   10400HB2109ham001- 11 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1private corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, 2executor, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed 3by order of any court.4    "Retailer" means and includes every person engaged in the 5business of making sales, including, on and after January 1, 62025, leases, at retail as defined in this Section. With 7respect to leases, a "retailer" also means a "lessor", except 8as otherwise provided in this Act. 9    A person who holds himself or herself out as being engaged 10(or who habitually engages) in selling tangible personal 11property at retail is a retailer hereunder with respect to 12such sales (and not primarily in a service occupation) 13notwithstanding the fact that such person designs and produces 14such tangible personal property on special order for the 15purchaser and in such a way as to render the property of value 16only to such purchaser, if such tangible personal property so 17produced on special order serves substantially the same 18function as stock or standard items of tangible personal 19property that are sold at retail.20    A person whose activities are organized and conducted 21primarily as a not-for-profit service enterprise, and who 22engages in selling tangible personal property at retail 23(whether to the public or merely to members and their guests) 24is a retailer with respect to such transactions, excepting 25only a person organized and operated exclusively for 26charitable, religious or educational purposes either (1), to   10400HB2109ham001- 12 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1the extent of sales by such person to its members, students, 2patients, or inmates of tangible personal property to be used 3primarily for the purposes of such person, or (2), to the 4extent of sales by such person of tangible personal property 5which is not sold or offered for sale by persons organized for 6profit. The selling of school books and school supplies by 7schools at retail to students is not "primarily for the 8purposes of" the school which does such selling. This 9paragraph does not apply to nor subject to taxation occasional 10dinners, social, or similar activities of a person organized 11and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, or 12educational purposes, whether or not such activities are open 13to the public.14    A person who is the recipient of a grant or contract under 15Title VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (P.L. 92-258) and 16serves meals to participants in the federal Nutrition Program 17for the Elderly in return for contributions established in 18amount by the individual participant pursuant to a schedule of 19suggested fees as provided for in the federal Act is not a 20retailer under this Act with respect to such transactions.21    Persons who engage in the business of transferring 22tangible personal property upon the redemption of trading 23stamps are retailers hereunder when engaged in such business.24    The isolated or occasional sale of tangible personal 25property at retail by a person who does not hold himself out as 26being engaged (or who does not habitually engage) in selling   10400HB2109ham001- 13 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1such tangible personal property at retail or a sale through a 2bulk vending machine does not make such person a retailer 3hereunder. However, any person who is engaged in a business 4which is not subject to the tax imposed by the Retailers' 5Occupation Tax Act because of involving the sale of or a 6contract to sell real estate or a construction contract to 7improve real estate, but who, in the course of conducting such 8business, transfers tangible personal property to users or 9consumers in the finished form in which it was purchased, and 10which does not become real estate, under any provision of a 11construction contract or real estate sale or real estate sales 12agreement entered into with some other person arising out of 13or because of such nontaxable business, is a retailer to the 14extent of the value of the tangible personal property so 15transferred. If, in such transaction, a separate charge is 16made for the tangible personal property so transferred, the 17value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, is the 18amount so separately charged, but not less than the cost of 19such property to the transferor; if no separate charge is 20made, the value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, 21is the cost to the transferor of such tangible personal 22property.23    "Retailer maintaining a place of business in this State", 24or any like term, means and includes any of the following 25retailers:26        (1) A retailer having or maintaining within this   10400HB2109ham001- 14 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1    State, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, 2    distribution house, sales house, warehouse, or other place 3    of business, or any agent or other representative 4    operating within this State under the authority of the 5    retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such 6    place of business or agent or other representative is 7    located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such 8    retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this 9    State. However, the ownership of property that is located 10    at the premises of a printer with which the retailer has 11    contracted for printing and that consists of the final 12    printed product, property that becomes a part of the final 13    printed product, or copy from which the printed product is 14    produced shall not result in the retailer being deemed to 15    have or maintain an office, distribution house, sales 16    house, warehouse, or other place of business within this 17    State.18        (1.1) A retailer having a contract with a person 19    located in this State under which the person, for a 20    commission or other consideration based upon the sale of 21    tangible personal property by the retailer, directly or 22    indirectly refers potential customers to the retailer by 23    providing to the potential customers a promotional code or 24    other mechanism that allows the retailer to track 25    purchases referred by such persons. Examples of mechanisms 26    that allow the retailer to track purchases referred by   10400HB2109ham001- 15 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1    such persons include, but are not limited to, the use of a 2    link on the person's Internet website, promotional codes 3    distributed through the person's hand-delivered or mailed 4    material, and promotional codes distributed by the person 5    through radio or other broadcast media.

A 12    retailer meeting the requirements of this paragraph (1.1) 13    shall be presumed to be maintaining a place of business in 14    this State but may rebut this presumption by submitting 15    proof that the referrals or other activities pursued 16    within this State by such persons were not sufficient to 17    meet the nexus standards of the United States Constitution 18    during the preceding 4 quarterly periods.19        (1.2) Beginning July 1, 2011, a retailer having a 20    contract with a person located in this State under which:21            (A) the retailer sells the same or substantially 22        similar line of products as the person located in this 23        State and does so using an identical or substantially 24        similar name, trade name, or trademark as the person 25        located in this State; and26            (B) the retailer provides a commission or other   10400HB2109ham001- 16 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1        consideration to the person located in this State 2        based upon the sale of tangible personal property by 3        the retailer.4        The provisions of this paragraph (1.2) shall apply 5    only if the cumulative gross receipts from sales of 6    tangible personal property by the retailer to customers in 7    this State under all such contracts exceed $10,000 during 8    the preceding 4 quarterly periods ending on the last day 9    of March, June, September, and December.10        (2) (Blank).11        (3) (Blank).12        (4) (Blank).13        (5) (Blank).14        (6) (Blank).15        (7) (Blank).16        (8) (Blank).17        (9) Beginning October 1, 2018, a retailer making sales 18    of tangible personal property to purchasers in Illinois 19    from outside of Illinois if: 20            (A) the cumulative gross receipts from sales of 21        tangible personal property to purchasers in Illinois 22        are $100,000 or more; or 23            (B) the retailer enters into 200 or more separate 24        transactions for the sale of tangible personal 25        property to purchasers in Illinois. 26        The retailer shall determine on a quarterly basis,   10400HB2109ham001- 17 -LRB104 11576 HLH 23628 a1    ending on the last day of March, June, September, and 2    December, whether he or she meets the criteria of either 3    subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph (9) for the 4    preceding 12-month period. If the retailer meets the 5    threshold of either subparagraph (A) or (B) for a 12-month 6    period, he or she is considered a retailer maintaining a 7    place of business in this State and is required to collect 8    and remit the tax imposed under this Act and file returns 9    for one year.
