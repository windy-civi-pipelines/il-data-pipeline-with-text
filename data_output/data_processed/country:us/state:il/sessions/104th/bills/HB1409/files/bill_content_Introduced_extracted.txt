Some of these individuals change the locks 12and threaten anyone who asks them to leave.13    (2) Despite the lack of a landlord-tenant relationship, 14existing landlord-tenant law sometimes gives protections to 15these individuals that are similar to the legal protections 16given to holdover tenants and tenants who are involved in 17disputes with their landlords.18    (3) Some of these individuals vandalize the residences 19they occupy. Property owners may have little or no legal 20recourse against these individuals for such damage because 21these individuals may lie about their identity and abscond 22when they find it convenient.23    (4) An expedited legal process is needed to enable owners 24of residential property to remove these individuals and   HB1409- 2 -LRB104 07620 JRC 17664 b1minimize vandalism. 2    Section 5.
