Upon receipt of an Investigative 13Summary Report, the Board shall review the Report and any 14relevant evidence obtained and determine whether there is 15reasonable basis to believe that the law enforcement officer 16committed any conduct that would be deemed a violation of this 17Act.

If the matter is set for hearing, the   SB1195- 18 -LRB104 09293 RTM 19351 b1    Board shall send the law enforcement officer the notice of 2    the date, time and location of the hearing. If the law 3    enforcement officer or counsel for the officer does 4    appear, at the Board's discretion, the hearing may proceed 5    or may be continued to a date and time agreed upon by all 6    parties.

The Board or 5    the law enforcement officer may request to have the 6    hearing suspended for up to 6 additional months for good 7    cause. This request may be renewed. For purposes of this 8    paragraph (4), "good cause" means an incident or 9    occurrence that is beyond the control of the requester and 10    that prevents the hearing from occurring, or holding the 11    hearing would impose an undue hardship or prejudice on the 12    requester. 13        (5) Surrender of certification or waiver.

Upon receipt of an Investigative 13Summary Report, the Board shall review the Report and any 14relevant evidence obtained and determine whether there is 15reasonable basis to believe that the law enforcement officer 16committed any conduct that would be deemed a violation of this 17Act. If after reviewing the Report and any other relevant 18evidence obtained, the Board determines that a reasonable 19basis does exist, the Board shall file a formal complaint with 20the Certification Review Panel.21    (h) Formal Complaint Hearing.22        (1) Upon issuance of a formal complaint, the Panel 23    shall set the matter for an initial hearing in front of an 24    administrative law judge.

The notice shall state that 22    the officer has 30 days to notify the Board in writing of 23    their desire to have the order vacated and to appear 24    before the Board. If the law enforcement officer does not 25    notify the Board within 30 days, the Board may set the 26    matter for hearing. If the matter is set for hearing, the   SB1195- 18 -LRB104 09293 RTM 19351 b1    Board shall send the law enforcement officer the notice of 2    the date, time and location of the hearing. If the law 3    enforcement officer or counsel for the officer does 4    appear, at the Board's discretion, the hearing may proceed 5    or may be continued to a date and time agreed upon by all 6    parties.

If the law   SB1195- 19 -LRB104 09293 RTM 19351 b1    enforcement officer requests to have the hearing 2    suspended, the law enforcement officer's certification 3    shall be deemed inactive until the law enforcement 4    officer's Formal Complaint hearing concludes. The Board or 5    the law enforcement officer may request to have the 6    hearing suspended for up to 6 additional months for good 7    cause. This request may be renewed. For purposes of this 8    paragraph (4), "good cause" means an incident or 9    occurrence that is beyond the control of the requester and 10    that prevents the hearing from occurring, or holding the 11    hearing would impose an undue hardship or prejudice on the 12    requester. 13        (5) Surrender of certification or waiver. Upon the 14    Board's issuance of a complaint, and prior to hearing on 15    the matter, a law enforcement officer may choose to 16    surrender the officer's certification or waiver by 17    notifying the Board in writing of the officer's decision 18    to do so. Upon receipt of such notification from the law 19    enforcement officer, the Board shall immediately decertify 20    the officer, or revoke any waiver previously granted. In 21    the case of a surrender of certification or waiver, the 22    Board's proceeding shall terminate.23        (6) Appointment of administrative law judges.
