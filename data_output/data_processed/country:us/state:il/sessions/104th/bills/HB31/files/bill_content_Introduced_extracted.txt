This fee may 21be charged by the public body even if the requester fails to 22accept or collect records the public body has prepared in 23response to an automated request.  24    (5 ILCS 140/6)  (from Ch. 116, par. 206)25    Sec. 6.

If a request is not an automated request, a 11request for a commercial purpose, or a voluminous request, a 12public body may not charge the requester for the costs of any 13search for and review of the records or other personnel costs 14associated with reproducing the records. Except to the extent 15that the General Assembly expressly provides, statutory fees 16applicable to copies of public records when furnished in a 17paper format shall not be applicable to those records when 18furnished in an electronic format. 19    (a-5) If a voluminous request is for electronic records 20and those records are not in a portable document format (PDF), 21the public body may charge up to $20 for not more than 2 22megabytes of data, up to $40 for more than 2 but not more than 234 megabytes of data, and up to $100 for more than 4 megabytes 24of data.

Waiver or reduction of the fee 10is in the public interest if the principal purpose of the 11request is to access and disseminate information regarding the 12health, safety and welfare or the legal rights of the general 13public and is not for the principal purpose of personal or 14commercial benefit. For purposes of this subsection, 15"commercial benefit" shall not apply to requests made by news 16media when the principal purpose of the request is to access 17and disseminate information regarding the health, safety, and 18welfare or the legal rights of the general public.

The opinion shall be binding upon both the requester 2and the public body, subject to administrative review under 3Section 11.5.4    In responding to any request under this Section 9.5, the 5Attorney General may exercise his or her discretion and choose 6to resolve a request for review by mediation or by a means 7other than the issuance of a binding opinion. The decision not 8to issue a binding opinion shall not be reviewable.9    Upon receipt of a binding opinion concluding that a 10violation of this Act has occurred, the public body shall 11either take necessary action immediately to comply with the 12directive of the opinion or shall initiate administrative 13review under Section 11.5. If the opinion concludes that no 14violation of the Act has occurred, the requester may initiate 15administrative review under Section 11.5.16    A public body that discloses records in accordance with an 17opinion of the Attorney General is immune from all liabilities 18by reason thereof and shall not be liable for penalties under 19this Act. 20    (g) If the requester files suit under Section 11 with 21respect to the same denial that is the subject of a pending 22request for review, the requester shall notify the Public 23Access Counselor, and the Public Access Counselor shall take 24no further action with respect to the request for review and 25shall so notify the public body.26    (h) The Attorney General may also issue advisory opinions   HB0031- 22 -LRB104 03194 BDA 13215 b1to public bodies regarding compliance with this Act. A review 2may be initiated upon receipt of a written request from the 3head of the public body or its attorney, which shall contain 4sufficient accurate facts from which a determination can be 5made. The Public Access Counselor may request additional 6information from the public body in order to assist in the 7review. A public body that relies in good faith on an advisory 8opinion of the Attorney General in responding to a request is 9not liable for penalties under this Act, so long as the facts 10upon which the opinion is based have been fully and fairly 11disclosed to the Public Access Counselor. 12(Source: P.A. 103-69, eff. 1-1-24.)

Before invoking this exemption, the public body   HB0031- 10 -LRB104 03194 BDA 13215 b1shall extend to the person making the request an opportunity 2to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to 3manageable proportions. If any public body responds to a 4categorical request by stating that compliance would unduly 5burden its operation and the conditions described above are 6met, it shall do so in writing, specifying the reasons why it 7would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance 8will so burden the operations of the public body. Such a 9response shall be treated as a denial of the request for 10information. 11    Repeated requests from the same person for the same 12records that are unchanged or identical to records previously 13provided or properly denied under this Act shall be deemed 14unduly burdensome under this provision.15    (h) Each public body may promulgate rules and regulations 16in conformity with the provisions of this Section pertaining 17to the availability of records and procedures to be followed, 18including:19        (i) the times and places where such records will be 20    made available, and21        (ii) the persons from whom such records may be 22    obtained.23    (i) The time periods for compliance or denial of a request 24to inspect or copy records set out in this Section shall not 25apply to automated requests, requests for records made for a 26commercial purpose, requests by a recurrent requester, or   HB0031- 11 -LRB104 03194 BDA 13215 b1voluminous requests. Such requests shall be subject to the 2provisions of Sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.6, and 3.7 of this Act, 3as applicable. 4(Source: P.A. 101-81, eff. 7-12-19.) 5    (5 ILCS 140/3.7 new)6    Sec. 3.7.

The person 11making a request and the public body may agree in writing to 12extend the time for compliance for a period to be determined by 13the parties. If the requester and the public body agree to 14extend the period for compliance, a failure by the public body 15to comply with any previous deadlines shall not be treated as a 16denial of the request for the records.17    (e) If a requester does not pay a fee charged pursuant to 18Section 6 of this Act for an automated request, the debt shall 19be considered a debt due and owing to the public body and may 20be collected in accordance with applicable law. This fee may 21be charged by the public body even if the requester fails to 22accept or collect records the public body has prepared in 23response to an automated request.  24    (5 ILCS 140/6)  (from Ch. 116, par. 206)25    Sec. 6.

If 4it is not feasible to furnish the public records in the 5specified electronic format, then the public body shall 6furnish it in the format in which it is maintained by the 7public body, or in paper format at the option of the requester. 8A public body may charge the requester for the actual cost of 9purchasing the recording medium, whether disc, diskette, tape, 10or other medium. If a request is not an automated request, a 11request for a commercial purpose, or a voluminous request, a 12public body may not charge the requester for the costs of any 13search for and review of the records or other personnel costs 14associated with reproducing the records. Except to the extent 15that the General Assembly expressly provides, statutory fees 16applicable to copies of public records when furnished in a 17paper format shall not be applicable to those records when 18furnished in an electronic format. 19    (a-5) If a voluminous request is for electronic records 20and those records are not in a portable document format (PDF), 21the public body may charge up to $20 for not more than 2 22megabytes of data, up to $40 for more than 2 but not more than 234 megabytes of data, and up to $100 for more than 4 megabytes 24of data.

The cost for certifying 4a record shall not exceed $1. 5    (c) Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a 6reduced charge, as determined by the public body, if the 7person requesting the documents states the specific purpose 8for the request and indicates that a waiver or reduction of the 9fee is in the public interest. Waiver or reduction of the fee 10is in the public interest if the principal purpose of the 11request is to access and disseminate information regarding the 12health, safety and welfare or the legal rights of the general 13public and is not for the principal purpose of personal or 14commercial benefit. For purposes of this subsection, 15"commercial benefit" shall not apply to requests made by news 16media when the principal purpose of the request is to access 17and disseminate information regarding the health, safety, and 18welfare or the legal rights of the general public. In setting 19the amount of the waiver or reduction, the public body may take 20into consideration the amount of materials requested and the 21cost of copying them.22    (d) The imposition of a fee not consistent with 23subsections (6)(a) and (b) of this Act constitutes a denial of 24access to public records for the purposes of judicial review.25    (e) The fee for each abstract of a driver's record shall be 26as provided in Section 6-118 of "The Illinois Vehicle Code",   HB0031- 17 -LRB104 03194 BDA 13215 b1approved September 29, 1969, as amended, whether furnished as 2a paper copy or as an electronic copy.3    (f) A public body may charge up to $10 for each hour spent 4by personnel in searching for and retrieving a requested 5record or examining the record for necessary redactions.
