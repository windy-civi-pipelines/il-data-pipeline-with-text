Lindsey LaPointe SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act    Creates the Hospitals and Homelessness Support Act. Requires the Office to Prevent and End Homelessness within the Department of Human Services to maintain on its publicly accessible website information on how a hospital or healthcare system may connect a patient experiencing homelessness or otherwise in a vulnerable housing situation with shelter and homeless support services for each continuum of care in the State. Requires the Department to ensure that the information required includes, for each continuum of care, any phone number, email address, physical address, primary agencies, or any other information that may be necessary for a person in that continuum of care territory to begin accessing shelter or other homelessness services. Requires the Department to include, where possible, a specific phone number that a hospital or health care facility may call and specific language to use. Requires the Department to also include on its website a way for the hospital or healthcare system to determine which continuum of care applies based on the physical location of the hospital or healthcare system. Requires other information, all of which must be added to the Department's website by October 31, 2025. Contains provisions concerning annual audits.LRB104 11105 KTG 21187 b  A BILL FOR HB3761LRB104 11105 KTG 21187 b1    AN ACT concerning State government. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Hospitals and Homelessness Support Act. 6    Section 5. Legislative findings. 7    (a) The General Assembly finds that there is a significant 8number of people experiencing homelessness in Illinois who are 9discharged or transferred from hospitals without adequate 10support or information pertaining to shelter and homeless 11support services. Too often, these Illinois residents are put 12back on the street with little connection to critical 13transitional care or support, including basic shelter. These 14Illinois residents who are experiencing homelessness 15frequently experience severe adverse health consequences, 16including death. According to a report prepared by the 17University of Illinois at Chicago and published by the 18Department of Public Health in July 2024, there were 19approximately 10,000 people experiencing "literal 20homelessness" in Illinois between 2017 and 2022, meaning that 21they were living in shelters, on the street, or in other places 22not meant for human habitation. Further, research demonstrates 23that people experiencing homelessness are at an increased risk   HB3761- 2 -LRB104 11105 KTG 21187 b1and severity for many acute and chronic health conditions, 2experiencing the effects of these health conditions 10 to 20 3years earlier than the general population, often resulting in 4premature death. 5    (b) The General Assembly further finds that, since the 6start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase of 736.6% in deaths of people experiencing homelessness, compared 8to a 6.1% increase in deaths for the general population over 9the same time period. Between 2017 and 2022, a total of 101,428,984 visits from people experiencing homelessness were 11recorded in statewide hospital records. Approximately 15-20% 12of these visits were due to injuries, 28,860 of these visits 13were related to assaults, and 15,578 of these visits followed 14suicide attempts. The majority of people experiencing 15homelessness were discharged to "home" or "self-care," which 16includes a discharge to the streets, which can result in 17further negative health outcomes. According to the 2024 annual 18Point-in-Time Count and Survey Report conducted by the City of 19Chicago as directed by the United States Department of Housing 20and Urban Development (HUD), 18,836 Chicago residents were 21experiencing homelessness on January 25, 2024. Of this count, 2217,202 were residing in a shelter, while 1,634 were in an 23unsheltered location. According to the Office to Prevent and 24End Homelessness within the Department of Human Services, on 25any given night in Illinois, an estimated 25,806 people are 26experiencing literal homelessness - that is, living in   HB3761- 3 -LRB104 11105 KTG 21187 b1shelters and transitional housing programs, in parks and 2abandoned buildings, in cars and in barns. The 2024-2026 plan 3developed by the Illinois Interagency Task Force on 4Homelessness, led by the Office to Prevent and End 5Homelessness, estimates that 26,004 additional shelter, 6transitional, and permanent housing units are needed to make 7adequate shelter space and homeless support services available 8to every person experiencing homelessness. Accomplishing this 9goal would mean homelessness has been measurably "ended", or 10that homelessness would have reached "functional zero". It is 11clear that more capacity for shelter and housing, both 12transitional and permanent, is needed. It is also clear that 13more efficient and effective connections to existing shelter 14and homeless support services are needed. 15    (c) Research shows that there are persistent adverse 16health effects that individuals often endure after 17experiencing homelessness even for a short period of time. 18Research also shows that there are opportunities to improve 19systems of homelessness care in Illinois, in particular with 20hospitals due to the frequency of hospital visits for people 21experiencing homelessness. The healthcare system, the shelter 22and homeless support services system, housing providers, local 23governments, and the State all have a role to play in crafting 24solutions. Hospitals, homeless shelter and service providers, 25Medicaid managed care organizations, State agencies, and 26others, are all critical partners. It is paramount to ensure   HB3761- 4 -LRB104 11105 KTG 21187 b1that vulnerable populations, like those experiencing 2homelessness, are regularly and reliably connected to the 3services that they need, both in health care settings and 4afterward. 5    Section 10. Centralized information on continuum of care 6access. 7    (a) The Office to Prevent and End Homelessness within the 8Department of Human Services shall maintain on its publicly 9accessible website information on how a hospital or healthcare 10system may connect a patient experiencing homelessness or 11otherwise in a vulnerable housing situation with shelter and 12homeless support services for each continuum of care in the 13State. As used in this Section, "continuum of care" refers to 14the regional or local planning bodies mandated by U.S. 15Department of Housing and Urban Development that coordinate 16housing and services funding for homeless families and 17individuals.18    (b) The Department shall ensure that the information 19required by subsection (a) of this Section includes, for each 20continuum of care, any phone number, email address, physical 21address, primary agencies, or any other information that may 22be necessary for a person in that continuum of care territory 23to begin accessing shelter or other homelessness services. 24Where possible, the Department shall include a specific phone 25number that a hospital or health care facility may call and   HB3761- 5 -LRB104 11105 KTG 21187 b1specific language to use.2    (c) The Department shall also include on its website a way 3for the hospital or healthcare system to determine which 4continuum of care applies based on the physical location of 5the hospital or healthcare system.6    (d) The information required by this Section shall be 7added to the Department's website no later than October 31, 82025. During the month of January 2026, and every January 9thereafter, the information required by this Section shall be 10audited, with any necessary updates made no later than the 1131st of that month. During the month of July 2026, and every 12July thereafter, the information required by this Section 13shall be audited, with any necessary updates made no later 14than the 31st of that month.
