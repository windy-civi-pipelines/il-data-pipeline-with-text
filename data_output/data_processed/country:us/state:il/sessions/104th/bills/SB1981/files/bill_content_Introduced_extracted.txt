Severability. If any clause, sentence, 4section, provision or part of this Act or the application 5thereof to any person or circumstance shall be adjudged to be 6unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act or its application 7to persons or circumstances other than those to which it is 8held invalid, shall not be affected thereby. 9    Section 60.
