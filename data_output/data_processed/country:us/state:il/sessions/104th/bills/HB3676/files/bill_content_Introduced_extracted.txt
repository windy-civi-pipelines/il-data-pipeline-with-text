In the court review provisions, provides that if the court makes findings that the Department of Children and Family Services has failed to make active efforts to provide services as provided in the service plan, the court's order shall specify each party that failure applies to and the applicable time period. Amends the Adoption Act. Provides that a person shall not be considered an unfit person for the sole reason that the Department of Children and Family Services or its assign has been found to have not made active efforts as defined in the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 during any period during the pendency of the case at hand. Provides that a parent shall not be found unfit for failure to make reasonable efforts or reasonable progress for any 9-month period during which a court, hearing a case under the Abused, Neglected or Dependent Minors Article of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, found that the Department failed to make active efforts, as defined in the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 with respect to that parent.

Provided that a ground for unfitness under the 9Adoption Act can be met, it may be appropriate to expedite 10termination of parental rights:11        (a) when active reasonable efforts are inappropriate, 12    or have been provided and were unsuccessful, and there are 13    aggravating circumstances including, but not limited to, 14    those cases in which (i) the child or another child of that 15    child's parent was (A) abandoned, (B) tortured, or (C) 16    chronically abused or (ii) the parent is criminally 17    convicted of (A) first degree murder or second degree 18    murder of any child, (B) attempt or conspiracy to commit 19    first degree murder or second degree murder of any child, 20    (C) solicitation to commit murder, solicitation to commit 21    murder for hire, solicitation to commit second degree 22    murder of any child, or aggravated assault in violation of 23    subdivision (a)(13) of Section 12-2 of the Criminal Code 24    of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, or (D) aggravated 25    criminal sexual assault in violation of Section 26    11-1.40(a)(1) or 12-14.1(a)(1) of the Criminal Code of   HB3676- 3 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012; or2        (b) when the parental rights of a parent with respect 3    to another child of the parent have been involuntarily 4    terminated; or5        (c) in those extreme cases in which the parent's 6    incapacity to care for the child, combined with an 7    extremely poor prognosis for treatment or rehabilitation, 8    justifies expedited termination of parental rights.9    (2) In all proceedings under this Act the court may direct 10the course thereof so as promptly to ascertain the 11jurisdictional facts and fully to gather information bearing 12upon the current condition and future welfare of persons 13subject to this Act. This Act shall be administered in a spirit 14of humane concern, not only for the rights of the parties, but 15also for the fears and the limits of understanding of all who 16appear before the court.17    (3) In all procedures under this Act, the following shall 18apply:19        (a) The procedural rights assured to the minor shall 20    be the rights of adults unless specifically precluded by 21    laws which enhance the protection of such minors.22        (b) Every child has a right to services necessary to 23    the child's safety and proper development, including 24    health, education and social services.25        (c) The parents' right to the custody of their child 26    shall not prevail when the court determines that it is   HB3676- 4 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    contrary to the health, safety, and best interests of the 2    child.3    (4) This Act shall be liberally construed to carry out the 4foregoing purpose and policy.5(Source: P.A. 103-22, eff. 8-8-23.) 6    (705 ILCS 405/1-3)  (from Ch. 37, par. 801-3)7    Sec. 1-3.

The parent-child visiting 16plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency 17of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 18visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 19have telephone and mail communication with the parents.20    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 21Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 22temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 23the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 24the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 25contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 26after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan   HB3676- 19 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and 2if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 3being made to place them together. If the Department has 4determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 5placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 6sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 7determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 8placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for 9visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 10shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 11child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 12addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 13is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 14sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 15placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 16The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date 17for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 18subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 19Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling 20Contact Support Plan is developed. 21    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 22file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 23and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 24Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 25parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 26reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the   HB3676- 20 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, 2request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 3the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 4is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 5refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 6duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 7needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 8Department personnel. Child development principles shall be 9considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 10visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 11take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 12party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 13court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 14reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 15achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 16placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact 17are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 18put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 19and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court 20shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 21to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 22contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 23stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 24to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 25visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 26subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing   HB3676- 21 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from 2granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 3opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 4contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 5subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 6restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 7contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 8plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, 9where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 10is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 11and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 12on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 13viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 14only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 15shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 16amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and 17holidays, of the change of the visitation.18    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 19admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to 20this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 21evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 22the issue is whether the Department has made active reasonable 23efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 24is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 25the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 26writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings   HB3676- 22 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the 2protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 3and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that active 4reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 5removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 6reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 7of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 8custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be 9furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 10custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 11findings in the case record for the child. The order together 12with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 13entered of record in the court.14    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 15urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 16minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not 17be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 18court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 19protection of the minor.20    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 21Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 22protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 23custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 24cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 25comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 26conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk   HB3676- 23 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure, 2by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 3custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 4custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 5provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 6telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 7relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 8siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall 9advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 10relative to inform the Department if additional information 11regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.12    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor 13described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 14is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 15care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 16ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of 17issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 18entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 19the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 20renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 21or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 22efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 23prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and 24shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's 25attorney and to the last known address of the other person or 26persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the   HB3676- 24 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by 2the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and 3the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a 4notice that the parties will not be entitled to further 5written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this 6case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion 7to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme 8Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and 9the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as 10provided in this Section. The notice for a shelter care 11hearing shall be substantially as follows:12NOTICE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN13OF SHELTER CARE HEARING14        On ................ at ........., before the Honorable 15    ................, (address:) ................., the State 16    of Illinois will present evidence (1) that (name of child 17    or children) ....................... are abused, 18    neglected, or dependent for the following reasons:19    .............................................. and (2) 20    whether there is "immediate and urgent necessity" to 21    remove the child or children from the responsible 22    relative.23        YOUR FAILURE TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING MAY RESULT IN 24    PLACEMENT of the child or children in foster care until a 25    trial can be held.

To cross examine witnesses for other parties.4            4. To obtain an explanation of any proceedings and 5        orders of the court.6    (4) If the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 7relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor did not 8have actual notice of or was not present at the shelter care 9hearing, the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 10relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor may file 11an affidavit setting forth these facts, and the clerk shall 12set the matter for rehearing not later than 48 hours, 13excluding Sundays and legal holidays, after the filing of the 14affidavit. At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in the 15same manner as upon the original hearing.16    (5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that 17the minor taken into custody is a person described in 18subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or 19detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This 20Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).21    (6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a 22jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners 23in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept 24separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept 25in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant 26to the criminal law.  HB3676- 28 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    (7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer 2within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor 3must immediately be released from custody.4    (8) If neither the parent, guardian, or custodian appears 5within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon 6request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the 7clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later 8than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons 9directed to the parent, guardian, or custodian to appear. At 10the same time the probation department shall prepare a report 11on the minor. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not 12appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order 13prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place 14designated by the Department of Children and Family Services 15or a licensed child welfare agency.16    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 17any interested party, including the State, the temporary 18custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family 19under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and 20Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their 21representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, 22may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor 23to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the 24following grounds:25        (a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent 26    necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or  HB3676- 29 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1        (b) There is a material change in the circumstances of 2    the natural family from which the minor was removed and 3    the child can be cared for at home without endangering the 4    child's health or safety; or5        (c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect 6    or dependency, including a parent, relative, or legal 7    guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the 8    minor; or9        (d) Services provided by the Department of Children 10    and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other 11    service provider have been successful in eliminating the 12    need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for 13    at home without endangering the child's health or safety.14    In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether 15it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 16of the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If 17the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 18custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 19Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 20may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 21arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 22arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 23and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 24protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 25or 2-25.26    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than   HB3676- 30 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b114 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court 2modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 3vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 4appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 5the minor and the minor's family.6    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 7probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 8described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an 9immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 10placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 11be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 12as the abused minor provided:13        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 14    neglect petition pending before the court; and15        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 16    for such other minor.17    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 18been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 19and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 20shelter care for the other minor.21    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 22apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 23or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 2498-61).25    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 26temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may   HB3676- 31 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary 2custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 3for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 4of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 5(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court 6may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 7evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 8the temporary custodian such authority. In making its 9determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 10addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 11subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 12        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents 13    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 14    those efforts;15        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 16    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf 17    of the minor;18        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 19    and (b) have been ongoing;20        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 21    family members and the minor;22        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 23    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 24    decision-making on the minor; and25        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.26    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the   HB3676- 32 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the 2requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 3of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 4its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 5this subsection. 6(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 7102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 87-1-24.) 9    (705 ILCS 405/2-13)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-13)10    Sec. 2-13. Petition. 11    (1) Any adult person, any agency or association by its 12representative may file, or the court on its own motion, 13consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 14minor may direct the filing through the State's Attorney of a 15petition in respect of a minor under this Act. The petition and 16all subsequent court documents shall be entitled "In the 17interest of ...., a minor".18    (2) The petition shall be verified but the statements may 19be made upon information and belief. It shall allege that the 20minor is abused, neglected, or dependent, with citations to 21the appropriate provisions of this Act, and set forth (a) 22facts sufficient to bring the minor under Section 2-3 or 2-4 23and to inform respondents of the cause of action, including, 24but not limited to, a plain and concise statement of the 25factual allegations that form the basis for the filing of the   HB3676- 33 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1petition; (b) the name, age and residence of the minor; (c) the 2names and residences of the minor's parents; (d) the name and 3residence of the minor's legal guardian or the person or 4persons having custody or control of the minor, or of the 5nearest known relative if no parent or guardian can be found; 6and (e) if the minor upon whose behalf the petition is brought 7is sheltered in custody, the date on which such temporary 8custody was ordered by the court or the date set for a 9temporary custody hearing. If any of the facts herein required 10are not known by the petitioner, the petition shall so state.11    (3) The petition must allege that it is in the best 12interests of the minor and of the public that the minor be 13adjudged a ward of the court and may pray generally for relief 14available under this Act. The petition need not specify any 15proposed disposition following adjudication of wardship. The 16petition may request that the minor remain in the custody of 17the parent, guardian, or custodian under an Order of 18Protection. 19    (4) If termination of parental rights and appointment of a 20guardian of the person with power to consent to adoption of the 21minor under Section 2-29 is sought, the petition shall so 22state. If the petition includes this request, the prayer for 23relief shall clearly and obviously state that the parents 24could permanently lose their rights as a parent at this 25hearing.26    In addition to the foregoing, the petitioner, by motion,   HB3676- 34 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1may request the termination of parental rights and appointment 2of a guardian of the person with power to consent to adoption 3of the minor under Section 2-29 at any time after the entry of 4a dispositional order under Section 2-22.5    (4.5) (a) Unless good cause exists that filing a petition 6to terminate parental rights is contrary to the child's best 7interests, with respect to any minors committed to its care 8pursuant to this Act, the Department of Children and Family 9Services shall request the State's Attorney to file a petition 10or motion for termination of parental rights and appointment 11of guardian of the person with power to consent to adoption of 12the minor under Section 2-29 if:13        (i) a minor has been in foster care, as described in 14    subsection (b), for 15 months of the most recent 22 15    months; or16        (ii) a minor under the age of 2 years has been 17    previously determined to be abandoned at an adjudicatory 18    hearing; or19        (iii) the parent is criminally convicted of: 20            (A) first degree murder or second degree murder of 21        any child; 22            (B) attempt or conspiracy to commit first degree 23        murder or second degree murder of any child; 24            (C) solicitation to commit murder of any child, 25        solicitation to commit murder for hire of any child, 26        or solicitation to commit second degree murder of any   HB3676- 35 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1        child; 2            (D) aggravated battery, aggravated battery of a 3        child, or felony domestic battery, any of which has 4        resulted in serious injury to the minor or a sibling of 5        the minor; 6            (E) predatory criminal sexual assault of a child;7            (E-5) aggravated criminal sexual assault;8            (E-10) criminal sexual abuse in violation of 9        subsection (a) of Section 11-1.50 of the Criminal Code 10        of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012;11            (E-15) sexual exploitation of a child;12            (E-20) permitting sexual abuse of a child; 13            (E-25) criminal sexual assault; or 14            (F) an offense in any other state the elements of 15        which are similar and bear a substantial relationship 16        to any of the foregoing offenses. 17    (a-1) For purposes of this subsection (4.5), good cause 18exists in the following circumstances: 19        (i) the child is being cared for by a relative,20        (ii) the Department has documented in the case plan a 21    compelling reason for determining that filing such 22    petition would not be in the best interests of the child,23        (iii) the court has found within the preceding 12 24    months that the Department has failed to make active 25    reasonable efforts to reunify the child and family, or26        (iv) the parent is incarcerated, or the parent's prior   HB3676- 36 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    incarceration is a significant factor in why the child has 2    been in foster care for 15 months out of any 22-month 3    period, the parent maintains a meaningful role in the 4    child's life, and the Department has not documented 5    another reason why it would otherwise be appropriate to 6    file a petition to terminate parental rights pursuant to 7    this Section and the Adoption Act. The assessment of 8    whether an incarcerated parent maintains a meaningful role 9    in the child's life may include consideration of the 10    following:11            (A) the child's best interest;12            (B) the parent's expressions or acts of 13        manifesting concern for the child, such as letters, 14        telephone calls, visits, and other forms of 15        communication with the child and the impact of the 16        communication on the child;17            (C) the parent's efforts to communicate with and 18        work with the Department for the purpose of complying 19        with the service plan and repairing, maintaining, or 20        building the parent-child relationship; or21            (D) limitations in the parent's access to family 22        support programs, therapeutic services, visiting 23        opportunities, telephone and mail services, and 24        meaningful participation in court proceedings. 25    (b) For purposes of this subsection, the date of entering 26foster care is defined as the earlier of:  HB3676- 37 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1        (1) The date of a judicial finding at an adjudicatory 2    hearing that the child is an abused, neglected, or 3    dependent minor; or4        (2) 60 days after the date on which the child is 5    removed from the child's parent, guardian, or legal 6    custodian.7    (c) (Blank).8    (d) (Blank).9    (5) The court shall liberally allow the petitioner to 10amend the petition to set forth a cause of action or to add, 11amend, or supplement factual allegations that form the basis 12for a cause of action up until 14 days before the adjudicatory 13hearing. The petitioner may amend the petition after that date 14and prior to the adjudicatory hearing if the court grants 15leave to amend upon a showing of good cause. The court may 16allow amendment of the petition to conform with the evidence 17at any time prior to ruling. In all cases in which the court 18has granted leave to amend based on new evidence or new 19allegations, the court shall permit the respondent an adequate 20opportunity to prepare a defense to the amended petition.21    (6) At any time before dismissal of the petition or before 22final closing and discharge under Section 2-31, one or more 23motions in the best interests of the minor may be filed. The 24motion shall specify sufficient facts in support of the relief 25requested.26(Source: P.A. 103-22, eff. 8-8-23.)   HB3676- 38 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    (705 ILCS 405/2-13.1)2    Sec. 2-13.1. Early termination of active reasonable 3efforts. 4    (1) (a) In conjunction with, or at any time subsequent to, 5the filing of a petition on behalf of a minor in accordance 6with Section 2-13 of this Act, the State's Attorney, the 7guardian ad litem, or the Department of Children and Family 8Services may file a motion requesting a finding that active 9reasonable efforts to reunify that minor with the minor's 10parent or parents are no longer required and are to cease.11    (b) The court shall grant this motion with respect to a 12parent of the minor if the court finds after a hearing that the 13parent has:14        (i) had parental rights to another child of the parent 15    involuntarily terminated; or16        (ii) been convicted of:17            (A) first degree or second degree murder of 18        another child of the parent;19            (B) attempt or conspiracy to commit first degree 20        or second degree murder of another child of the 21        parent;22            (C) solicitation to commit murder of another child 23        of the parent, solicitation to commit murder for hire 24        of another child of the parent, or solicitation to 25        commit second degree murder of another child of the   HB3676- 39 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1        parent;2            (D) aggravated battery, aggravated battery of a 3        child, or felony domestic battery, any of which has 4        resulted in serious bodily injury to the minor or 5        another child of the parent; or6            (E) an offense in any other state the elements of 7        which are similar and bear substantial relationship to 8        any of the foregoing offenses9unless the court sets forth in writing a compelling reason why 10terminating active reasonable efforts to reunify the minor 11with the parent would not be in the best interests of that 12minor.13    (c) The court shall also grant this motion with respect to 14a parent of the minor if:15        (i) after a hearing it determines that further 16    reunification services would no longer be appropriate, and17        (ii) a dispositional hearing has already taken place.18    (2) (a) The court shall hold a permanency hearing within 1930 days of granting a motion pursuant to this subsection. If an 20adjudicatory or a dispositional hearing, or both, has not 21taken place when the court grants a motion pursuant to this 22Section, then either or both hearings shall be held as needed 23so that both take place on or before the date a permanency 24hearing is held pursuant to this subsection.25    (b) Following a permanency hearing held pursuant to 26paragraph (a) of this subsection, the appointed custodian or   HB3676- 40 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1guardian of the minor shall make reasonable efforts to place 2the child in accordance with the permanency plan and goal set 3by the court, and to complete the necessary steps to locate and 4finalize a permanent placement.5(Source: P.A. 103-22, eff. 8-8-23.) 6    (705 ILCS 405/2-21)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-21)7    Sec. 2-21. Findings and adjudication. 8    (1) The court shall state for the record the manner in 9which the parties received service of process and shall note 10whether the return or returns of service, postal return 11receipt or receipts for notice by certified mail, or 12certificate or certificates of publication have been filed in 13the court record. The court shall enter any appropriate orders 14of default against any parent who has been properly served in 15any manner and fails to appear.16    No further service of process as defined in Sections 2-15 17and 2-16 is required in any subsequent proceeding for a parent 18who was properly served in any manner, except as required by 19Supreme Court Rule 11.20    The caseworker shall testify about the diligent search 21conducted for the parent.22    After hearing the evidence the court shall determine 23whether or not the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent. 24If it finds that the minor is not such a person, the court 25shall order the petition dismissed and the minor discharged.   HB3676- 41 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1The court's determination of whether the minor is abused, 2neglected, or dependent shall be stated in writing with the 3factual basis supporting that determination.4    If the court finds that the minor is abused, neglected, or 5dependent, the court shall then determine and put in writing 6the factual basis supporting that determination, and specify, 7to the extent possible, the acts or omissions or both of each 8parent, guardian, or legal custodian that form the basis of 9the court's findings. That finding shall appear in the order 10of the court.11    If the court finds that the child has been abused, 12neglected or dependent, the court shall admonish the parents 13that they must cooperate with the Department of Children and 14Family Services, comply with the terms of the service plan, 15and correct the conditions that require the child to be in 16care, or risk termination of parental rights.17    If the court determines that a person has inflicted 18physical or sexual abuse upon a minor, the court shall report 19that determination to the Illinois State Police, which shall 20include that information in its report to the President of the 21school board for a school district that requests a criminal 22history records check of that person, or the regional 23superintendent of schools who requests a check of that person, 24as required under Section 10-21.9 or 34-18.5 of the School 25Code.26    (2) If, pursuant to subsection (1) of this Section, the   HB3676- 42 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1court determines and puts in writing the factual basis 2supporting the determination that the minor is either abused 3or neglected or dependent, the court shall then set a time not 4later than 30 days after the entry of the finding for a 5dispositional hearing (unless an earlier date is required 6pursuant to Section 2-13.1) to be conducted under Section 2-22 7at which hearing the court shall determine whether it is 8consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 9minor and the public that he be made a ward of the court. To 10assist the court in making this and other determinations at 11the dispositional hearing, the court may order that an 12investigation be conducted and a dispositional report be 13prepared concerning the minor's physical and mental history 14and condition, family situation and background, economic 15status, education, occupation, history of delinquency or 16criminality, personal habits, and any other information that 17may be helpful to the court. The dispositional hearing may be 18continued once for a period not to exceed 30 days if the court 19finds that such continuance is necessary to complete the 20dispositional report.21    (3) The time limits of this Section may be waived only by 22consent of all parties and approval by the court, as 23determined to be consistent with the health, safety and best 24interests of the minor.25    (4) For all cases adjudicated prior to July 1, 1991, for 26which no dispositional hearing has been held prior to that   HB3676- 43 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1date, a dispositional hearing under Section 2-22 shall be held 2within 90 days of July 1, 1991.3    (5) The court may terminate the parental rights of a 4parent at the initial dispositional hearing if all of the 5following conditions are met: 6        (i) the original or amended petition contains a 7    request for termination of parental rights and appointment 8    of a guardian with power to consent to adoption; and 9        (ii) the court has found by a preponderance of 10    evidence, introduced or stipulated to at an adjudicatory 11    hearing, that the child comes under the jurisdiction of 12    the court as an abused, neglected, or dependent minor 13    under Section 2-18; and 14        (iii) the court finds, on the basis of clear and 15    convincing evidence admitted at the adjudicatory hearing 16    that the parent is an unfit person under subdivision D of 17    Section 1 of the Adoption Act; and 18        (iv) the court determines in accordance with the rules 19    of evidence for dispositional proceedings, that: 20            (A) it is in the best interest of the minor and 21        public that the child be made a ward of the court; 22            (A-5) active reasonable efforts under subsection 23        (l-1) of Section 5 of the Children and Family Services 24        Act are inappropriate or such efforts were made and 25        were unsuccessful; and 26            (B) termination of parental rights and appointment   HB3676- 44 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1        of a guardian with power to consent to adoption is in 2        the best interest of the child pursuant to Section 3        2-29.4(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21.) 5    (705 ILCS 405/2-28)6    Sec. 2-28. Court review. 7    (1) The court may require any legal custodian or guardian 8of the person appointed under this Act to report periodically 9to the court or may cite the legal custodian or guardian into 10court and require the legal custodian, guardian, or the legal 11custodian's or guardian's agency to make a full and accurate 12report of the doings of the legal custodian, guardian, or 13agency on behalf of the minor. The custodian or guardian, 14within 10 days after such citation, or earlier if the court 15determines it to be necessary to protect the health, safety, 16or welfare of the minor, shall make the report, either in 17writing verified by affidavit or orally under oath in open 18court, or otherwise as the court directs. Upon the hearing of 19the report the court may remove the custodian or guardian and 20appoint another in the custodian's or guardian's stead or 21restore the minor to the custody of the minor's parents or 22former guardian or custodian. However, custody of the minor 23shall not be restored to any parent, guardian, or legal 24custodian in any case in which the minor is found to be 25neglected or abused under Section 2-3 or dependent under   HB3676- 45 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1Section 2-4 of this Act, unless the minor can be cared for at 2home without endangering the minor's health or safety and it 3is in the best interests of the minor, and if such neglect, 4abuse, or dependency is found by the court under paragraph (1) 5of Section 2-21 of this Act to have come about due to the acts 6or omissions or both of such parent, guardian, or legal 7custodian, until such time as an investigation is made as 8provided in paragraph (5) and a hearing is held on the issue of 9the fitness of such parent, guardian, or legal custodian to 10care for the minor and the court enters an order that such 11parent, guardian, or legal custodian is fit to care for the 12minor.13    (1.5) The public agency that is the custodian or guardian 14of the minor shall file a written report with the court no 15later than 15 days after a minor in the agency's care remains:16        (1) in a shelter placement beyond 30 days;17        (2) in a psychiatric hospital past the time when the 18    minor is clinically ready for discharge or beyond medical 19    necessity for the minor's health; or20        (3) in a detention center or Department of Juvenile 21    Justice facility solely because the public agency cannot 22    find an appropriate placement for the minor.23    The report shall explain the steps the agency is taking to 24ensure the minor is placed appropriately, how the minor's 25needs are being met in the minor's shelter placement, and if a 26future placement has been identified by the Department, why   HB3676- 46 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1the anticipated placement is appropriate for the needs of the 2minor and the anticipated placement date. 3    (1.6) Within 30 days after placing a child in its care in a 4qualified residential treatment program, as defined by the 5federal Social Security Act, the Department of Children and 6Family Services shall prepare a written report for filing with 7the court and send copies of the report to all parties. Within 820 days of the filing of the report, or as soon thereafter as 9the court's schedule allows but not more than 60 days from the 10date of placement, the court shall hold a hearing to consider 11the Department's report and determine whether placement of the 12child in a qualified residential treatment program provides 13the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child 14in the least restrictive environment and if the placement is 15consistent with the short-term and long-term goals for the 16child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child. The 17court shall approve or disapprove the placement. If 18applicable, the requirements of Sections 2-27.1 and 2-27.2 19must also be met. The Department's written report and the 20court's written determination shall be included in and made 21part of the case plan for the child. If the child remains 22placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the 23Department shall submit evidence at each status and permanency 24hearing: 25        (1) demonstrating that on-going assessment of the 26    strengths and needs of the child continues to support the   HB3676- 47 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    determination that the child's needs cannot be met through 2    placement in a foster family home, that the placement 3    provides the most effective and appropriate level of care 4    for the child in the least restrictive, appropriate 5    environment, and that the placement is consistent with the 6    short-term and long-term permanency goal for the child, as 7    specified in the permanency plan for the child; 8        (2) documenting the specific treatment or service 9    needs that should be met for the child in the placement and 10    the length of time the child is expected to need the 11    treatment or services; and 12        (3) the efforts made by the agency to prepare the 13    child to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing 14    relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a 15    foster family home. 16    (2) The first permanency hearing shall be conducted by the 17judge. Subsequent permanency hearings may be heard by a judge 18or by hearing officers appointed or approved by the court in 19the manner set forth in Section 2-28.1 of this Act. The initial 20hearing shall be held (a) within 12 months from the date 21temporary custody was taken, regardless of whether an 22adjudication or dispositional hearing has been completed 23within that time frame, (b) if the parental rights of both 24parents have been terminated in accordance with the procedure 25described in subsection (5) of Section 2-21, within 30 days of 26the order for termination of parental rights and appointment   HB3676- 48 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1of a guardian with power to consent to adoption, or (c) in 2accordance with subsection (2) of Section 2-13.1. Subsequent 3permanency hearings shall be held every 6 months or more 4frequently if necessary in the court's determination following 5the initial permanency hearing, in accordance with the 6standards set forth in this Section, until the court 7determines that the plan and goal have been achieved. Once the 8plan and goal have been achieved, if the minor remains in 9substitute care, the case shall be reviewed at least every 6 10months thereafter, subject to the provisions of this Section, 11unless the minor is placed in the guardianship of a suitable 12relative or other person and the court determines that further 13monitoring by the court does not further the health, safety, 14or best interest of the child and that this is a stable 15permanent placement. The permanency hearings must occur within 16the time frames set forth in this subsection and may not be 17delayed in anticipation of a report from any source or due to 18the agency's failure to timely file its written report (this 19written report means the one required under the next paragraph 20and does not mean the service plan also referred to in that 21paragraph).22    The public agency that is the custodian or guardian of the 23minor, or another agency responsible for the minor's care, 24shall ensure that all parties to the permanency hearings are 25provided a copy of the most recent service plan prepared 26within the prior 6 months at least 14 days in advance of the   HB3676- 49 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1hearing. If not contained in the agency's service plan, the 2agency shall also include a report setting forth (i) any 3special physical, psychological, educational, medical, 4emotional, or other needs of the minor or the minor's family 5that are relevant to a permanency or placement determination 6and (ii) for any minor age 16 or over, a written description of 7the programs and services that will enable the minor to 8prepare for independent living. If not contained in the 9agency's service plan, the agency's report shall specify if a 10minor is placed in a licensed child care facility under a 11corrective plan by the Department due to concerns impacting 12the minor's safety and well-being. The report shall explain 13the steps the Department is taking to ensure the safety and 14well-being of the minor and that the minor's needs are met in 15the facility. The agency's written report must detail what 16progress or lack of progress the parent has made in correcting 17the conditions requiring the child to be in care; whether the 18child can be returned home without jeopardizing the child's 19health, safety, and welfare, and, if not, what permanency goal 20is recommended to be in the best interests of the child, and 21why the other permanency goals are not appropriate. The 22caseworker must appear and testify at the permanency hearing. 23If a permanency hearing has not previously been scheduled by 24the court, the moving party shall move for the setting of a 25permanency hearing and the entry of an order within the time 26frames set forth in this subsection.  HB3676- 50 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine the 2future status of the child. The court shall set one of the 3following permanency goals:4        (A) The minor will be returned home by a specific date 5    within 5 months.6        (B) The minor will be in short-term care with a 7    continued goal to return home within a period not to 8    exceed one year, where the progress of the parent or 9    parents is substantial giving particular consideration to 10    the age and individual needs of the minor.11        (B-1) The minor will be in short-term care with a 12    continued goal to return home pending a status hearing. 13    When the court finds that a parent has not made reasonable 14    efforts or reasonable progress to date, the court shall 15    identify what actions the parent and the Department must 16    take in order to justify a finding of reasonable efforts 17    or reasonable progress and shall set a status hearing to 18    be held not earlier than 9 months from the date of 19    adjudication nor later than 11 months from the date of 20    adjudication during which the parent's progress will again 21    be reviewed.22        (C) The minor will be in substitute care pending court 23    determination on termination of parental rights.24        (D) Adoption, provided that parental rights have been 25    terminated or relinquished.26        (E) The guardianship of the minor will be transferred   HB3676- 51 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    to an individual or couple on a permanent basis provided 2    that goals (A) through (D) have been deemed inappropriate 3    and not in the child's best interests. The court shall 4    confirm that the Department has discussed adoption, if 5    appropriate, and guardianship with the caregiver prior to 6    changing a goal to guardianship.7        (F) The minor over age 15 will be in substitute care 8    pending independence. In selecting this permanency goal, 9    the Department of Children and Family Services may provide 10    services to enable reunification and to strengthen the 11    minor's connections with family, fictive kin, and other 12    responsible adults, provided the services are in the 13    minor's best interest. The services shall be documented in 14    the service plan. 15        (G) The minor will be in substitute care because the 16    minor cannot be provided for in a home environment due to 17    developmental disabilities or mental illness or because 18    the minor is a danger to self or others, provided that 19    goals (A) through (D) have been deemed inappropriate and 20    not in the child's best interests.21    In selecting any permanency goal, the court shall indicate 22in writing the reasons the goal was selected and why the 23preceding goals were deemed inappropriate and not in the 24child's best interest. Where the court has selected a 25permanency goal other than (A), (B), or (B-1), the Department 26of Children and Family Services shall not provide further   HB3676- 52 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1reunification services, except as provided in paragraph (F) of 2this subsection (2), but shall provide services consistent 3with the goal selected.4        (H) Notwithstanding any other provision in this 5    Section, the court may select the goal of continuing 6    foster care as a permanency goal if: 7            (1) The Department of Children and Family Services 8        has custody and guardianship of the minor; 9            (2) The court has deemed all other permanency 10        goals inappropriate based on the child's best 11        interest; 12            (3) The court has found compelling reasons, based 13        on written documentation reviewed by the court, to 14        place the minor in continuing foster care. Compelling 15        reasons include: 16                (a) the child does not wish to be adopted or to 17            be placed in the guardianship of the minor's 18            relative or foster care placement; 19                (b) the child exhibits an extreme level of 20            need such that the removal of the child from the 21            minor's placement would be detrimental to the 22            child; or 23                (c) the child who is the subject of the 24            permanency hearing has existing close and strong 25            bonds with a sibling, and achievement of another 26            permanency goal would substantially interfere with   HB3676- 53 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1            the subject child's sibling relationship, taking 2            into consideration the nature and extent of the 3            relationship, and whether ongoing contact is in 4            the subject child's best interest, including 5            long-term emotional interest, as compared with the 6            legal and emotional benefit of permanence; 7            (4) The child has lived with the relative or 8        foster parent for at least one year; and 9            (5) The relative or foster parent currently caring 10        for the child is willing and capable of providing the 11        child with a stable and permanent environment. 12    The court shall set a permanency goal that is in the best 13interest of the child. In determining that goal, the court 14shall consult with the minor in an age-appropriate manner 15regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan for the 16minor. The court's determination shall include the following 17factors:18        (1) Age of the child.19        (2) Options available for permanence, including both 20    out-of-state and in-state placement options.21        (3) Current placement of the child and the intent of 22    the family regarding adoption.23        (4) Emotional, physical, and mental status or 24    condition of the child.25        (5) Types of services previously offered and whether 26    or not the services were successful and, if not   HB3676- 54 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    successful, the reasons the services failed.2        (6) Availability of services currently needed and 3    whether the services exist.4        (7) Status of siblings of the minor.5    The court shall consider (i) the permanency goal contained 6in the service plan, (ii) the appropriateness of the services 7contained in the plan and whether those services have been 8provided, (iii) whether reasonable efforts have been made by 9all the parties to the service plan to achieve the goal, and 10(iv) whether the plan and goal have been achieved. All 11evidence relevant to determining these questions, including 12oral and written reports, may be admitted and may be relied on 13to the extent of their probative value. If the court makes 14findings that the Department has failed to make active efforts 15to provide services as provided in the service plan, the 16court's order shall specify each party that failure applies to 17and the applicable time period.18    The court shall make findings as to whether, in violation 19of Section 8.2 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting 20Act, any portion of the service plan compels a child or parent 21to engage in any activity or refrain from any activity that is 22not reasonably related to remedying a condition or conditions 23that gave rise or which could give rise to any finding of child 24abuse or neglect. The services contained in the service plan 25shall include services reasonably related to remedy the 26conditions that gave rise to removal of the child from the home   HB3676- 55 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1of the child's parents, guardian, or legal custodian or that 2the court has found must be remedied prior to returning the 3child home. Any tasks the court requires of the parents, 4guardian, or legal custodian or child prior to returning the 5child home must be reasonably related to remedying a condition 6or conditions that gave rise to or which could give rise to any 7finding of child abuse or neglect. 8    If the permanency goal is to return home, the court shall 9make findings that identify any problems that are causing 10continued placement of the children away from the home and 11identify what outcomes would be considered a resolution to 12these problems. The court shall explain to the parents that 13these findings are based on the information that the court has 14at that time and may be revised, should additional evidence be 15presented to the court. 16    The court shall review the Sibling Contact Support Plan 17developed or modified under subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of 18the Children and Family Services Act, if applicable. If the 19Department has not convened a meeting to develop or modify a 20Sibling Contact Support Plan, or if the court finds that the 21existing Plan is not in the child's best interest, the court 22may enter an order requiring the Department to develop, 23modify, or implement a Sibling Contact Support Plan, or order 24mediation. 25    If the goal has been achieved, the court shall enter 26orders that are necessary to conform the minor's legal custody   HB3676- 56 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1and status to those findings.2    If, after receiving evidence, the court determines that 3the services contained in the plan are not reasonably 4calculated to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, 5the court shall put in writing the factual basis supporting 6the determination and enter specific findings based on the 7evidence. The court also shall enter an order for the 8Department to develop and implement a new service plan or to 9implement changes to the current service plan consistent with 10the court's findings. The new service plan shall be filed with 11the court and served on all parties within 45 days of the date 12of the order. The court shall continue the matter until the new 13service plan is filed. Except as authorized by subsection 14(2.5) of this Section and as otherwise specifically authorized 15by law, the court is not empowered under this Section to order 16specific placements, specific services, or specific service 17providers to be included in the service plan.18    A guardian or custodian appointed by the court pursuant to 19this Act shall file updated case plans with the court every 6 20months.21    Rights of wards of the court under this Act are 22enforceable against any public agency by complaints for relief 23by mandamus filed in any proceedings brought under this Act.24    (2.5) If, after reviewing the evidence, including evidence 25from the Department, the court determines that the minor's 26current or planned placement is not necessary or appropriate   HB3676- 57 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court 2shall put in writing the factual basis supporting its 3determination and enter specific findings based on the 4evidence. If the court finds that the minor's current or 5planned placement is not necessary or appropriate, the court 6may enter an order directing the Department to implement a 7recommendation by the minor's treating clinician or a 8clinician contracted by the Department to evaluate the minor 9or a recommendation made by the Department.

No legal custodian or guardian of the person may be 15removed without the legal custodian's or guardian's consent 16until given notice and an opportunity to be heard by the court.17    When the court orders a child restored to the custody of 18the parent or parents, the court shall order the parent or 19parents to cooperate with the Department of Children and 20Family Services and comply with the terms of an after-care 21plan, or risk the loss of custody of the child and possible 22termination of their parental rights.

Temporary custody hearing. At the appearance of 19the minor before the court at the temporary custody hearing, 20all witnesses present shall be examined before the court in 21relation to any matter connected with the allegations made in 22the petition.23    (1) If the court finds that there is not probable cause to 24believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent it 25shall release the minor and dismiss the petition.  HB3676- 15 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    (2) If the court finds that there is probable cause to 2believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent, the 3court shall state in writing the factual basis supporting its 4finding and the minor, the minor's parent, guardian, or 5custodian, and other persons able to give relevant testimony 6shall be examined before the court. The Department of Children 7and Family Services shall give testimony concerning indicated 8reports of abuse and neglect, of which they are aware through 9the central registry, involving the minor's parent, guardian, 10or custodian. After such testimony, the court may, consistent 11with the health, safety, and best interests of the minor, 12enter an order that the minor shall be released upon the 13request of parent, guardian, or custodian if the parent, 14guardian, or custodian appears to take custody. If it is 15determined that a parent's, guardian's, or custodian's 16compliance with critical services mitigates the necessity for 17removal of the minor from the minor's home, the court may enter 18an Order of Protection setting forth reasonable conditions of 19behavior that a parent, guardian, or custodian must observe 20for a specified period of time, not to exceed 12 months, 21without a violation; provided, however, that the 12-month 22period shall begin anew after any violation.

If 26it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests   HB3676- 16 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1of the minor, the court may also prescribe shelter care and 2order that the minor be kept in a suitable place designated by 3the court or in a shelter care facility designated by the 4Department of Children and Family Services or a licensed child 5welfare agency; however, on and after January 1, 2015 (the 6effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 72017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 8Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 9adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 10or committed to the Department of Children and Family Services 11by any court, except a minor less than 16 years of age and 12committed to the Department of Children and Family Services 13under Section 5-710 of this Act or a minor for whom an 14independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists; and 15on and after January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a criminal 16offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 172012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the 18custody of or committed to the Department of Children and 19Family Services by any court, except a minor less than 15 years 20of age and committed to the Department of Children and Family 21Services under Section 5-710 of this Act or a minor for whom an 22independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists. An 23independent basis exists when the allegations or adjudication 24of abuse, neglect, or dependency do not arise from the same 25facts, incident, or circumstances which give rise to a charge 26or adjudication of delinquency.   HB3676- 17 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    In placing the minor, the Department or other agency 2shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply 3with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In 4determining the health, safety, and best interests of the 5minor to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is 6a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety, and 7protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 8that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that the 9minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and must 10further find that active reasonable efforts have been made or 11that, consistent with the health, safety and best interests of 12the minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to prevent or 13eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from the 14minor's home. The court shall require documentation from the 15Department of Children and Family Services as to the active 16reasonable efforts that were made to prevent or eliminate the 17necessity of removal of the minor from the minor's home or the 18reasons why no efforts reasonably could be made to prevent or 19eliminate the necessity of removal. When a minor is placed in 20the home of a relative, the Department of Children and Family 21Services shall complete a preliminary background review of the 22members of the minor's custodian's household in accordance 23with Section 4.3 of the Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days 24of that placement. If the minor is ordered placed in a shelter 25care facility of the Department of Children and Family 26Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall,   HB3676- 18 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1upon request of the appropriate Department or other agency, 2appoint the Department of Children and Family Services 3Guardianship Administrator or other appropriate agency 4executive temporary custodian of the minor and the court may 5enter such other orders related to the temporary custody as it 6deems fit and proper, including the provision of services to 7the minor or the minor's family to ameliorate the causes 8contributing to the finding of probable cause or to the 9finding of the existence of immediate and urgent necessity.10    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 11Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 12temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family 13Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a 14parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends 15and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting 16plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency 17of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 18visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 19have telephone and mail communication with the parents.20    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 21Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 22temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 23the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 24the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 25contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 26after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan   HB3676- 19 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and 2if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 3being made to place them together. If the Department has 4determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 5placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 6sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 7determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 8placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for 9visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 10shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 11child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 12addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 13is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 14sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 15placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 16The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date 17for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 18subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 19Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling 20Contact Support Plan is developed. 21    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 22file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 23and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 24Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 25parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 26reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the   HB3676- 20 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, 2request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 3the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 4is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 5refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 6duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 7needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 8Department personnel. Child development principles shall be 9considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 10visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 11take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 12party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 13court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 14reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 15achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 16placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact 17are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 18put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 19and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court 20shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 21to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 22contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 23stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 24to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 25visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 26subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing   HB3676- 21 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from 2granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 3opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 4contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 5subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 6restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 7contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 8plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, 9where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 10is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 11and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 12on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 13viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 14only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 15shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 16amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and 17holidays, of the change of the visitation.18    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 19admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to 20this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 21evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 22the issue is whether the Department has made active reasonable 23efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 24is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 25the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 26writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings   HB3676- 22 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the 2protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 3and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that active 4reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 5removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 6reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 7of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 8custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be 9furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 10custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 11findings in the case record for the child. The order together 12with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 13entered of record in the court.14    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 15urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 16minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not 17be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 18court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 19protection of the minor.20    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 21Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 22protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 23custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 24cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 25comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 26conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk   HB3676- 23 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure, 2by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 3custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 4custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 5provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 6telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 7relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 8siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall 9advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 10relative to inform the Department if additional information 11regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.12    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor 13described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 14is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 15care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 16ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of 17issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 18entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 19the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 20renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 21or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 22efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 23prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and 24shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's 25attorney and to the last known address of the other person or 26persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the   HB3676- 24 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by 2the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and 3the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a 4notice that the parties will not be entitled to further 5written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this 6case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion 7to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme 8Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and 9the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as 10provided in this Section.

If 17the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 18custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 19Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 20may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 21arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 22arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 23and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 24protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 25or 2-25.26    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than   HB3676- 30 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b114 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court 2modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 3vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 4appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 5the minor and the minor's family.6    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 7probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 8described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an 9immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 10placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 11be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 12as the abused minor provided:13        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 14    neglect petition pending before the court; and15        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 16    for such other minor.17    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 18been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 19and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 20shelter care for the other minor.21    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 22apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 23or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 2498-61).25    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 26temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may   HB3676- 31 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary 2custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 3for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 4of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 5(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court 6may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 7evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 8the temporary custodian such authority. In making its 9determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 10addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 11subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 12        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents 13    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 14    those efforts;15        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 16    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf 17    of the minor;18        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 19    and (b) have been ongoing;20        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 21    family members and the minor;22        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 23    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 24    decision-making on the minor; and25        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.26    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the   HB3676- 32 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the 2requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 3of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 4its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 5this subsection. 6(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 7102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 87-1-24.) 9    (705 ILCS 405/2-13)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-13)10    Sec. 2-13.

Findings and adjudication. 8    (1) The court shall state for the record the manner in 9which the parties received service of process and shall note 10whether the return or returns of service, postal return 11receipt or receipts for notice by certified mail, or 12certificate or certificates of publication have been filed in 13the court record. The court shall enter any appropriate orders 14of default against any parent who has been properly served in 15any manner and fails to appear.16    No further service of process as defined in Sections 2-15 17and 2-16 is required in any subsequent proceeding for a parent 18who was properly served in any manner, except as required by 19Supreme Court Rule 11.20    The caseworker shall testify about the diligent search 21conducted for the parent.22    After hearing the evidence the court shall determine 23whether or not the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent. 24If it finds that the minor is not such a person, the court 25shall order the petition dismissed and the minor discharged.   HB3676- 41 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1The court's determination of whether the minor is abused, 2neglected, or dependent shall be stated in writing with the 3factual basis supporting that determination.4    If the court finds that the minor is abused, neglected, or 5dependent, the court shall then determine and put in writing 6the factual basis supporting that determination, and specify, 7to the extent possible, the acts or omissions or both of each 8parent, guardian, or legal custodian that form the basis of 9the court's findings. That finding shall appear in the order 10of the court.11    If the court finds that the child has been abused, 12neglected or dependent, the court shall admonish the parents 13that they must cooperate with the Department of Children and 14Family Services, comply with the terms of the service plan, 15and correct the conditions that require the child to be in 16care, or risk termination of parental rights.17    If the court determines that a person has inflicted 18physical or sexual abuse upon a minor, the court shall report 19that determination to the Illinois State Police, which shall 20include that information in its report to the President of the 21school board for a school district that requests a criminal 22history records check of that person, or the regional 23superintendent of schools who requests a check of that person, 24as required under Section 10-21.9 or 34-18.5 of the School 25Code.26    (2) If, pursuant to subsection (1) of this Section, the   HB3676- 42 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1court determines and puts in writing the factual basis 2supporting the determination that the minor is either abused 3or neglected or dependent, the court shall then set a time not 4later than 30 days after the entry of the finding for a 5dispositional hearing (unless an earlier date is required 6pursuant to Section 2-13.1) to be conducted under Section 2-22 7at which hearing the court shall determine whether it is 8consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 9minor and the public that he be made a ward of the court. To 10assist the court in making this and other determinations at 11the dispositional hearing, the court may order that an 12investigation be conducted and a dispositional report be 13prepared concerning the minor's physical and mental history 14and condition, family situation and background, economic 15status, education, occupation, history of delinquency or 16criminality, personal habits, and any other information that 17may be helpful to the court. The dispositional hearing may be 18continued once for a period not to exceed 30 days if the court 19finds that such continuance is necessary to complete the 20dispositional report.21    (3) The time limits of this Section may be waived only by 22consent of all parties and approval by the court, as 23determined to be consistent with the health, safety and best 24interests of the minor.25    (4) For all cases adjudicated prior to July 1, 1991, for 26which no dispositional hearing has been held prior to that   HB3676- 43 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1date, a dispositional hearing under Section 2-22 shall be held 2within 90 days of July 1, 1991.3    (5) The court may terminate the parental rights of a 4parent at the initial dispositional hearing if all of the 5following conditions are met: 6        (i) the original or amended petition contains a 7    request for termination of parental rights and appointment 8    of a guardian with power to consent to adoption; and 9        (ii) the court has found by a preponderance of 10    evidence, introduced or stipulated to at an adjudicatory 11    hearing, that the child comes under the jurisdiction of 12    the court as an abused, neglected, or dependent minor 13    under Section 2-18; and 14        (iii) the court finds, on the basis of clear and 15    convincing evidence admitted at the adjudicatory hearing 16    that the parent is an unfit person under subdivision D of 17    Section 1 of the Adoption Act; and 18        (iv) the court determines in accordance with the rules 19    of evidence for dispositional proceedings, that: 20            (A) it is in the best interest of the minor and 21        public that the child be made a ward of the court; 22            (A-5) active reasonable efforts under subsection 23        (l-1) of Section 5 of the Children and Family Services 24        Act are inappropriate or such efforts were made and 25        were unsuccessful; and 26            (B) termination of parental rights and appointment   HB3676- 44 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1        of a guardian with power to consent to adoption is in 2        the best interest of the child pursuant to Section 3        2-29.4(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21.) 5    (705 ILCS 405/2-28)6    Sec. 2-28. Court review. 7    (1) The court may require any legal custodian or guardian 8of the person appointed under this Act to report periodically 9to the court or may cite the legal custodian or guardian into 10court and require the legal custodian, guardian, or the legal 11custodian's or guardian's agency to make a full and accurate 12report of the doings of the legal custodian, guardian, or 13agency on behalf of the minor. The custodian or guardian, 14within 10 days after such citation, or earlier if the court 15determines it to be necessary to protect the health, safety, 16or welfare of the minor, shall make the report, either in 17writing verified by affidavit or orally under oath in open 18court, or otherwise as the court directs. Upon the hearing of 19the report the court may remove the custodian or guardian and 20appoint another in the custodian's or guardian's stead or 21restore the minor to the custody of the minor's parents or 22former guardian or custodian. However, custody of the minor 23shall not be restored to any parent, guardian, or legal 24custodian in any case in which the minor is found to be 25neglected or abused under Section 2-3 or dependent under   HB3676- 45 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1Section 2-4 of this Act, unless the minor can be cared for at 2home without endangering the minor's health or safety and it 3is in the best interests of the minor, and if such neglect, 4abuse, or dependency is found by the court under paragraph (1) 5of Section 2-21 of this Act to have come about due to the acts 6or omissions or both of such parent, guardian, or legal 7custodian, until such time as an investigation is made as 8provided in paragraph (5) and a hearing is held on the issue of 9the fitness of such parent, guardian, or legal custodian to 10care for the minor and the court enters an order that such 11parent, guardian, or legal custodian is fit to care for the 12minor.13    (1.5) The public agency that is the custodian or guardian 14of the minor shall file a written report with the court no 15later than 15 days after a minor in the agency's care remains:16        (1) in a shelter placement beyond 30 days;17        (2) in a psychiatric hospital past the time when the 18    minor is clinically ready for discharge or beyond medical 19    necessity for the minor's health; or20        (3) in a detention center or Department of Juvenile 21    Justice facility solely because the public agency cannot 22    find an appropriate placement for the minor.23    The report shall explain the steps the agency is taking to 24ensure the minor is placed appropriately, how the minor's 25needs are being met in the minor's shelter placement, and if a 26future placement has been identified by the Department, why   HB3676- 46 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1the anticipated placement is appropriate for the needs of the 2minor and the anticipated placement date. 3    (1.6) Within 30 days after placing a child in its care in a 4qualified residential treatment program, as defined by the 5federal Social Security Act, the Department of Children and 6Family Services shall prepare a written report for filing with 7the court and send copies of the report to all parties. Within 820 days of the filing of the report, or as soon thereafter as 9the court's schedule allows but not more than 60 days from the 10date of placement, the court shall hold a hearing to consider 11the Department's report and determine whether placement of the 12child in a qualified residential treatment program provides 13the most effective and appropriate level of care for the child 14in the least restrictive environment and if the placement is 15consistent with the short-term and long-term goals for the 16child, as specified in the permanency plan for the child. The 17court shall approve or disapprove the placement. If 18applicable, the requirements of Sections 2-27.1 and 2-27.2 19must also be met. The Department's written report and the 20court's written determination shall be included in and made 21part of the case plan for the child. If the child remains 22placed in a qualified residential treatment program, the 23Department shall submit evidence at each status and permanency 24hearing: 25        (1) demonstrating that on-going assessment of the 26    strengths and needs of the child continues to support the   HB3676- 47 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    determination that the child's needs cannot be met through 2    placement in a foster family home, that the placement 3    provides the most effective and appropriate level of care 4    for the child in the least restrictive, appropriate 5    environment, and that the placement is consistent with the 6    short-term and long-term permanency goal for the child, as 7    specified in the permanency plan for the child; 8        (2) documenting the specific treatment or service 9    needs that should be met for the child in the placement and 10    the length of time the child is expected to need the 11    treatment or services; and 12        (3) the efforts made by the agency to prepare the 13    child to return home or to be placed with a fit and willing 14    relative, a legal guardian, or an adoptive parent, or in a 15    foster family home. 16    (2) The first permanency hearing shall be conducted by the 17judge. Subsequent permanency hearings may be heard by a judge 18or by hearing officers appointed or approved by the court in 19the manner set forth in Section 2-28.1 of this Act. The initial 20hearing shall be held (a) within 12 months from the date 21temporary custody was taken, regardless of whether an 22adjudication or dispositional hearing has been completed 23within that time frame, (b) if the parental rights of both 24parents have been terminated in accordance with the procedure 25described in subsection (5) of Section 2-21, within 30 days of 26the order for termination of parental rights and appointment   HB3676- 48 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1of a guardian with power to consent to adoption, or (c) in 2accordance with subsection (2) of Section 2-13.1. Subsequent 3permanency hearings shall be held every 6 months or more 4frequently if necessary in the court's determination following 5the initial permanency hearing, in accordance with the 6standards set forth in this Section, until the court 7determines that the plan and goal have been achieved. Once the 8plan and goal have been achieved, if the minor remains in 9substitute care, the case shall be reviewed at least every 6 10months thereafter, subject to the provisions of this Section, 11unless the minor is placed in the guardianship of a suitable 12relative or other person and the court determines that further 13monitoring by the court does not further the health, safety, 14or best interest of the child and that this is a stable 15permanent placement. The permanency hearings must occur within 16the time frames set forth in this subsection and may not be 17delayed in anticipation of a report from any source or due to 18the agency's failure to timely file its written report (this 19written report means the one required under the next paragraph 20and does not mean the service plan also referred to in that 21paragraph).22    The public agency that is the custodian or guardian of the 23minor, or another agency responsible for the minor's care, 24shall ensure that all parties to the permanency hearings are 25provided a copy of the most recent service plan prepared 26within the prior 6 months at least 14 days in advance of the   HB3676- 49 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1hearing. If not contained in the agency's service plan, the 2agency shall also include a report setting forth (i) any 3special physical, psychological, educational, medical, 4emotional, or other needs of the minor or the minor's family 5that are relevant to a permanency or placement determination 6and (ii) for any minor age 16 or over, a written description of 7the programs and services that will enable the minor to 8prepare for independent living. If not contained in the 9agency's service plan, the agency's report shall specify if a 10minor is placed in a licensed child care facility under a 11corrective plan by the Department due to concerns impacting 12the minor's safety and well-being. The report shall explain 13the steps the Department is taking to ensure the safety and 14well-being of the minor and that the minor's needs are met in 15the facility. The agency's written report must detail what 16progress or lack of progress the parent has made in correcting 17the conditions requiring the child to be in care; whether the 18child can be returned home without jeopardizing the child's 19health, safety, and welfare, and, if not, what permanency goal 20is recommended to be in the best interests of the child, and 21why the other permanency goals are not appropriate. The 22caseworker must appear and testify at the permanency hearing. 23If a permanency hearing has not previously been scheduled by 24the court, the moving party shall move for the setting of a 25permanency hearing and the entry of an order within the time 26frames set forth in this subsection.  HB3676- 50 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine the 2future status of the child. The court shall set one of the 3following permanency goals:4        (A) The minor will be returned home by a specific date 5    within 5 months.6        (B) The minor will be in short-term care with a 7    continued goal to return home within a period not to 8    exceed one year, where the progress of the parent or 9    parents is substantial giving particular consideration to 10    the age and individual needs of the minor.11        (B-1) The minor will be in short-term care with a 12    continued goal to return home pending a status hearing. 13    When the court finds that a parent has not made reasonable 14    efforts or reasonable progress to date, the court shall 15    identify what actions the parent and the Department must 16    take in order to justify a finding of reasonable efforts 17    or reasonable progress and shall set a status hearing to 18    be held not earlier than 9 months from the date of 19    adjudication nor later than 11 months from the date of 20    adjudication during which the parent's progress will again 21    be reviewed.22        (C) The minor will be in substitute care pending court 23    determination on termination of parental rights.24        (D) Adoption, provided that parental rights have been 25    terminated or relinquished.26        (E) The guardianship of the minor will be transferred   HB3676- 51 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    to an individual or couple on a permanent basis provided 2    that goals (A) through (D) have been deemed inappropriate 3    and not in the child's best interests. The court shall 4    confirm that the Department has discussed adoption, if 5    appropriate, and guardianship with the caregiver prior to 6    changing a goal to guardianship.7        (F) The minor over age 15 will be in substitute care 8    pending independence. In selecting this permanency goal, 9    the Department of Children and Family Services may provide 10    services to enable reunification and to strengthen the 11    minor's connections with family, fictive kin, and other 12    responsible adults, provided the services are in the 13    minor's best interest. The services shall be documented in 14    the service plan. 15        (G) The minor will be in substitute care because the 16    minor cannot be provided for in a home environment due to 17    developmental disabilities or mental illness or because 18    the minor is a danger to self or others, provided that 19    goals (A) through (D) have been deemed inappropriate and 20    not in the child's best interests.21    In selecting any permanency goal, the court shall indicate 22in writing the reasons the goal was selected and why the 23preceding goals were deemed inappropriate and not in the 24child's best interest. Where the court has selected a 25permanency goal other than (A), (B), or (B-1), the Department 26of Children and Family Services shall not provide further   HB3676- 52 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1reunification services, except as provided in paragraph (F) of 2this subsection (2), but shall provide services consistent 3with the goal selected.4        (H) Notwithstanding any other provision in this 5    Section, the court may select the goal of continuing 6    foster care as a permanency goal if: 7            (1) The Department of Children and Family Services 8        has custody and guardianship of the minor; 9            (2) The court has deemed all other permanency 10        goals inappropriate based on the child's best 11        interest; 12            (3) The court has found compelling reasons, based 13        on written documentation reviewed by the court, to 14        place the minor in continuing foster care. Compelling 15        reasons include: 16                (a) the child does not wish to be adopted or to 17            be placed in the guardianship of the minor's 18            relative or foster care placement; 19                (b) the child exhibits an extreme level of 20            need such that the removal of the child from the 21            minor's placement would be detrimental to the 22            child; or 23                (c) the child who is the subject of the 24            permanency hearing has existing close and strong 25            bonds with a sibling, and achievement of another 26            permanency goal would substantially interfere with   HB3676- 53 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1            the subject child's sibling relationship, taking 2            into consideration the nature and extent of the 3            relationship, and whether ongoing contact is in 4            the subject child's best interest, including 5            long-term emotional interest, as compared with the 6            legal and emotional benefit of permanence; 7            (4) The child has lived with the relative or 8        foster parent for at least one year; and 9            (5) The relative or foster parent currently caring 10        for the child is willing and capable of providing the 11        child with a stable and permanent environment. 12    The court shall set a permanency goal that is in the best 13interest of the child. In determining that goal, the court 14shall consult with the minor in an age-appropriate manner 15regarding the proposed permanency or transition plan for the 16minor. The court's determination shall include the following 17factors:18        (1) Age of the child.19        (2) Options available for permanence, including both 20    out-of-state and in-state placement options.21        (3) Current placement of the child and the intent of 22    the family regarding adoption.23        (4) Emotional, physical, and mental status or 24    condition of the child.25        (5) Types of services previously offered and whether 26    or not the services were successful and, if not   HB3676- 54 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    successful, the reasons the services failed.2        (6) Availability of services currently needed and 3    whether the services exist.4        (7) Status of siblings of the minor.5    The court shall consider (i) the permanency goal contained 6in the service plan, (ii) the appropriateness of the services 7contained in the plan and whether those services have been 8provided, (iii) whether reasonable efforts have been made by 9all the parties to the service plan to achieve the goal, and 10(iv) whether the plan and goal have been achieved. All 11evidence relevant to determining these questions, including 12oral and written reports, may be admitted and may be relied on 13to the extent of their probative value. If the court makes 14findings that the Department has failed to make active efforts 15to provide services as provided in the service plan, the 16court's order shall specify each party that failure applies to 17and the applicable time period.18    The court shall make findings as to whether, in violation 19of Section 8.2 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting 20Act, any portion of the service plan compels a child or parent 21to engage in any activity or refrain from any activity that is 22not reasonably related to remedying a condition or conditions 23that gave rise or which could give rise to any finding of child 24abuse or neglect. The services contained in the service plan 25shall include services reasonably related to remedy the 26conditions that gave rise to removal of the child from the home   HB3676- 55 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1of the child's parents, guardian, or legal custodian or that 2the court has found must be remedied prior to returning the 3child home. Any tasks the court requires of the parents, 4guardian, or legal custodian or child prior to returning the 5child home must be reasonably related to remedying a condition 6or conditions that gave rise to or which could give rise to any 7finding of child abuse or neglect. 8    If the permanency goal is to return home, the court shall 9make findings that identify any problems that are causing 10continued placement of the children away from the home and 11identify what outcomes would be considered a resolution to 12these problems. The court shall explain to the parents that 13these findings are based on the information that the court has 14at that time and may be revised, should additional evidence be 15presented to the court. 16    The court shall review the Sibling Contact Support Plan 17developed or modified under subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of 18the Children and Family Services Act, if applicable. If the 19Department has not convened a meeting to develop or modify a 20Sibling Contact Support Plan, or if the court finds that the 21existing Plan is not in the child's best interest, the court 22may enter an order requiring the Department to develop, 23modify, or implement a Sibling Contact Support Plan, or order 24mediation. 25    If the goal has been achieved, the court shall enter 26orders that are necessary to conform the minor's legal custody   HB3676- 56 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1and status to those findings.2    If, after receiving evidence, the court determines that 3the services contained in the plan are not reasonably 4calculated to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, 5the court shall put in writing the factual basis supporting 6the determination and enter specific findings based on the 7evidence. The court also shall enter an order for the 8Department to develop and implement a new service plan or to 9implement changes to the current service plan consistent with 10the court's findings. The new service plan shall be filed with 11the court and served on all parties within 45 days of the date 12of the order. The court shall continue the matter until the new 13service plan is filed. Except as authorized by subsection 14(2.5) of this Section and as otherwise specifically authorized 15by law, the court is not empowered under this Section to order 16specific placements, specific services, or specific service 17providers to be included in the service plan.18    A guardian or custodian appointed by the court pursuant to 19this Act shall file updated case plans with the court every 6 20months.21    Rights of wards of the court under this Act are 22enforceable against any public agency by complaints for relief 23by mandamus filed in any proceedings brought under this Act.24    (2.5) If, after reviewing the evidence, including evidence 25from the Department, the court determines that the minor's 26current or planned placement is not necessary or appropriate   HB3676- 57 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1to facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court 2shall put in writing the factual basis supporting its 3determination and enter specific findings based on the 4evidence. If the court finds that the minor's current or 5planned placement is not necessary or appropriate, the court 6may enter an order directing the Department to implement a 7recommendation by the minor's treating clinician or a 8clinician contracted by the Department to evaluate the minor 9or a recommendation made by the Department. If the Department 10places a minor in a placement under an order entered under this 11subsection (2.5), the Department has the authority to remove 12the minor from that placement when a change in circumstances 13necessitates the removal to protect the minor's health, 14safety, and best interest. If the Department determines 15removal is necessary, the Department shall notify the parties 16of the planned placement change in writing no later than 10 17days prior to the implementation of its determination unless 18remaining in the placement poses an imminent risk of harm to 19the minor, in which case the Department shall notify the 20parties of the placement change in writing immediately 21following the implementation of its decision. The Department 22shall notify others of the decision to change the minor's 23placement as required by Department rule. 24    (3) Following the permanency hearing, the court shall 25enter a written order that includes the determinations 26required under subsection (2) of this Section and sets forth   HB3676- 58 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1the following:2        (a) The future status of the minor, including the 3    permanency goal, and any order necessary to conform the 4    minor's legal custody and status to such determination; or5        (b) If the permanency goal of the minor cannot be 6    achieved immediately, the specific reasons for continuing 7    the minor in the care of the Department of Children and 8    Family Services or other agency for short-term placement, 9    and the following determinations:10            (i) (Blank).11            (ii) Whether the services required by the court 12        and by any service plan prepared within the prior 6 13        months have been provided and (A) if so, whether the 14        services were reasonably calculated to facilitate the 15        achievement of the permanency goal or (B) if not 16        provided, why the services were not provided.17            (iii) Whether the minor's current or planned 18        placement is necessary, and appropriate to the plan 19        and goal, recognizing the right of minors to the least 20        restrictive (most family-like) setting available and 21        in close proximity to the parents' home consistent 22        with the health, safety, best interest, and special 23        needs of the minor and, if the minor is placed 24        out-of-state, whether the out-of-state placement 25        continues to be appropriate and consistent with the 26        health, safety, and best interest of the minor.  HB3676- 59 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1            (iv) (Blank).2            (v) (Blank).3    (4) The minor or any person interested in the minor may 4apply to the court for a change in custody of the minor and the 5appointment of a new custodian or guardian of the person or for 6the restoration of the minor to the custody of the minor's 7parents or former guardian or custodian.8    When return home is not selected as the permanency goal:9        (a) The Department, the minor, or the current foster 10    parent or relative caregiver seeking private guardianship 11    may file a motion for private guardianship of the minor. 12    Appointment of a guardian under this Section requires 13    approval of the court.14        (b) The State's Attorney may file a motion to 15    terminate parental rights of any parent who has failed to 16    make active reasonable efforts to correct the conditions 17    which led to the removal of the child or reasonable 18    progress toward the return of the child, as defined in 19    subdivision (D)(m) of Section 1 of the Adoption Act or for 20    whom any other unfitness ground for terminating parental 21    rights as defined in subdivision (D) of Section 1 of the 22    Adoption Act exists.23        When parental rights have been terminated for a 24    minimum of 3 years and the child who is the subject of the 25    permanency hearing is 13 years old or older and is not 26    currently placed in a placement likely to achieve   HB3676- 60 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    permanency, the Department of Children and Family Services 2    shall make reasonable efforts to locate parents whose 3    rights have been terminated, except when the Court 4    determines that those efforts would be futile or 5    inconsistent with the subject child's best interests. The 6    Department of Children and Family Services shall assess 7    the appropriateness of the parent whose rights have been 8    terminated, and shall, as appropriate, foster and support 9    connections between the parent whose rights have been 10    terminated and the youth. The Department of Children and 11    Family Services shall document its determinations and 12    efforts to foster connections in the child's case plan. 13    Custody of the minor shall not be restored to any parent, 14guardian, or legal custodian in any case in which the minor is 15found to be neglected or abused under Section 2-3 or dependent 16under Section 2-4 of this Act, unless the minor can be cared 17for at home without endangering the minor's health or safety 18and it is in the best interest of the minor, and if such 19neglect, abuse, or dependency is found by the court under 20paragraph (1) of Section 2-21 of this Act to have come about 21due to the acts or omissions or both of such parent, guardian, 22or legal custodian, until such time as an investigation is 23made as provided in paragraph (5) and a hearing is held on the 24issue of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor and 25the fitness of such parent, guardian, or legal custodian to 26care for the minor and the court enters an order that such   HB3676- 61 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1parent, guardian, or legal custodian is fit to care for the 2minor. If a motion is filed to modify or vacate a private 3guardianship order and return the child to a parent, guardian, 4or legal custodian, the court may order the Department of 5Children and Family Services to assess the minor's current and 6proposed living arrangements and to provide ongoing monitoring 7of the health, safety, and best interest of the minor during 8the pendency of the motion to assist the court in making that 9determination. In the event that the minor has attained 18 10years of age and the guardian or custodian petitions the court 11for an order terminating the minor's guardianship or custody, 12guardianship or custody shall terminate automatically 30 days 13after the receipt of the petition unless the court orders 14otherwise. No legal custodian or guardian of the person may be 15removed without the legal custodian's or guardian's consent 16until given notice and an opportunity to be heard by the court.17    When the court orders a child restored to the custody of 18the parent or parents, the court shall order the parent or 19parents to cooperate with the Department of Children and 20Family Services and comply with the terms of an after-care 21plan, or risk the loss of custody of the child and possible 22termination of their parental rights. The court may also enter 23an order of protective supervision in accordance with Section 242-24.25    If the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, 26legal custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois,   HB3676- 62 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1and an Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the 2court may order the Department of Children and Family Services 3to arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 4arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 5and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 6protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 72-24. 8    (5) Whenever a parent, guardian, or legal custodian files 9a motion for restoration of custody of the minor, and the minor 10was adjudicated neglected, abused, or dependent as a result of 11physical abuse, the court shall cause to be made an 12investigation as to whether the movant has ever been charged 13with or convicted of any criminal offense which would indicate 14the likelihood of any further physical abuse to the minor. 15Evidence of such criminal convictions shall be taken into 16account in determining whether the minor can be cared for at 17home without endangering the minor's health or safety and 18fitness of the parent, guardian, or legal custodian.19        (a) Any agency of this State or any subdivision 20    thereof shall cooperate with the agent of the court in 21    providing any information sought in the investigation.22        (b) The information derived from the investigation and 23    any conclusions or recommendations derived from the 24    information shall be provided to the parent, guardian, or 25    legal custodian seeking restoration of custody prior to 26    the hearing on fitness and the movant shall have an   HB3676- 63 -LRB104 08478 RLC 18530 b1    opportunity at the hearing to refute the information or 2    contest its significance.3        (c) All information obtained from any investigation 4    shall be confidential as provided in Section 5-150 of this 5    Act.6(Source: P.A. 102-193, eff. 7-30-21; 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 7102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-154, eff. 86-30-23; 103-171, eff. 1-1-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24.) 9    Section 10.
