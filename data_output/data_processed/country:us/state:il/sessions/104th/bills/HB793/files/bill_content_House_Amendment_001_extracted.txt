For purposes of this subparagraph, 25        the taxpayer's separate taxable income shall be 26        determined as if the election provided by Section   10400HB0793ham001- 103 -LRB104 04692 HLH 23079 a1        243(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code had been in 2        effect for all such years;3            (F) Cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative 4        corporation or association, the taxable income of such 5        organization determined in accordance with the 6        provisions of Section 1381 through 1388 of the 7        Internal Revenue Code, but without regard to the 8        prohibition against offsetting losses from patronage 9        activities against income from nonpatronage 10        activities; except that a cooperative corporation or 11        association may make an election to follow its federal 12        income tax treatment of patronage losses and 13        nonpatronage losses. In the event such election is 14        made, such losses shall be computed and carried over 15        in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of Section 16        207 of this Act and apportioned by the apportionment 17        factor reported by the cooperative on its Illinois 18        income tax return filed for the taxable year in which 19        the losses are incurred. The election shall be 20        effective for all taxable years with original returns 21        due on or after the date of the election. In addition, 22        the cooperative may file an amended return or returns, 23        as allowed under this Act, to provide that the 24        election shall be effective for losses incurred or 25        carried forward for taxable years occurring prior to 26        the date of the election. Once made, the election may   10400HB0793ham001- 104 -LRB104 04692 HLH 23079 a1        only be revoked upon approval of the Director. The 2        Department shall adopt rules setting forth 3        requirements for documenting the elections and any 4        resulting Illinois net loss and the standards to be 5        used by the Director in evaluating requests to revoke 6        elections. Public Act 96-932 is declaratory of 7        existing law; 8            (G) Subchapter S corporations. In the case of: (i) 9        a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 10        effect an election for the taxable year under Section 11        1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxable income 12        of such corporation determined in accordance with 13        Section 1363(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, except 14        that taxable income shall take into account those 15        items which are required by Section 1363(b)(1) of the 16        Internal Revenue Code to be separately stated; and 17        (ii) a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 18        effect a federal election to opt out of the provisions 19        of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 and have 20        applied instead the prior federal Subchapter S rules 21        as in effect on July 1, 1982, the taxable income of 22        such corporation determined in accordance with the 23        federal Subchapter S rules as in effect on July 1, 24        1982; and25            (H) Partnerships. In the case of a partnership, 26        taxable income determined in accordance with Section   10400HB0793ham001- 105 -LRB104 04692 HLH 23079 a1        703 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that taxable 2        income shall take into account those items which are 3        required by Section 703(a)(1) to be separately stated 4        but which would be taken into account by an individual 5        in calculating his taxable income.6        (3) Recapture of business expenses on disposition of 7    asset or business. Notwithstanding any other law to the 8    contrary, if in prior years income from an asset or 9    business has been classified as business income and in a 10    later year is demonstrated to be non-business income, then 11    all expenses, without limitation, deducted in such later 12    year and in the 2 immediately preceding taxable years 13    related to that asset or business that generated the 14    non-business income shall be added back and recaptured as 15    business income in the year of the disposition of the 16    asset or business. Such amount shall be apportioned to 17    Illinois using the greater of the apportionment fraction 18    computed for the business under Section 304 of this Act 19    for the taxable year or the average of the apportionment 20    fractions computed for the business under Section 304 of 21    this Act for the taxable year and for the 2 immediately 22    preceding taxable years.  23    (f) Valuation limitation amount.24        (1) In general. The valuation limitation amount 25    referred to in subsections (a)(2)(G), (c)(2)(I) and   10400HB0793ham001- 106 -LRB104 04692 HLH 23079 a1    (d)(2)(E) is an amount equal to:2            (A) The sum of the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 3        amounts (to the extent consisting of gain reportable 4        under the provisions of Section 1245 or 1250 of the 5        Internal Revenue Code) for all property in respect of 6        which such gain was reported for the taxable year; 7        plus8            (B) The lesser of (i) the sum of the pre-August 1, 9        1969 appreciation amounts (to the extent consisting of 10        capital gain) for all property in respect of which 11        such gain was reported for federal income tax purposes 12        for the taxable year, or (ii) the net capital gain for 13        the taxable year, reduced in either case by any amount 14        of such gain included in the amount determined under 15        subsection (a)(2)(F) or (c)(2)(H).16        (2) Pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation amount.17            (A) If the fair market value of property referred 18        to in paragraph (1) was readily ascertainable on 19        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 20        amount for such property is the lesser of (i) the 21        excess of such fair market value over the taxpayer's 22        basis (for determining gain) for such property on that 23        date (determined under the Internal Revenue Code as in 24        effect on that date), or (ii) the total gain realized 25        and reportable for federal income tax purposes in 26        respect of the sale, exchange or other disposition of   10400HB0793ham001- 107 -LRB104 04692 HLH 23079 a1        such property.2            (B) If the fair market value of property referred 3        to in paragraph (1) was not readily ascertainable on 4        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 5        amount for such property is that amount which bears 6        the same ratio to the total gain reported in respect of 7        the property for federal income tax purposes for the 8        taxable year, as the number of full calendar months in 9        that part of the taxpayer's holding period for the 10        property ending July 31, 1969 bears to the number of 11        full calendar months in the taxpayer's entire holding 12        period for the property.13            (C) The Department shall prescribe such 14        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the 15        purposes of this paragraph. 16    (g) Double deductions. Unless specifically provided 17otherwise, nothing in this Section shall permit the same item 18to be deducted more than once. 19    (h) Legislative intention. Except as expressly provided by 20this Section there shall be no modifications or limitations on 21the amounts of income, gain, loss or deduction taken into 22account in determining gross income, adjusted gross income or 23taxable income for federal income tax purposes for the taxable 24year, or in the amount of such items entering into the   10400HB0793ham001- 108 -LRB104 04692 HLH 23079 a1computation of base income and net income under this Act for 2such taxable year, whether in respect of property values as of 3August 1, 1969 or otherwise.4(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 5102-658, eff. 8-27-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-1112, eff. 612-21-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23; 103-478, eff. 1-1-24; 103-592, 7Article 10, Section 10-900, eff. 6-7-24; 103-592, Article 170, 8Section 170-90, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24; 103-647, 9eff. 7-1-24; revised 8-20-24.) 10    Section 99.
