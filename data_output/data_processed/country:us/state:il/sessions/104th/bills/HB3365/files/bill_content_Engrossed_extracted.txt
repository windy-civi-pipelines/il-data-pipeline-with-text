Whether the minor was left without regard for the 7    mental or physical health, safety, or welfare of that 8    minor or the period of time was unreasonable shall be 9    determined by considering factors including, but not 10    limited to, the following:11            (1) the age of the minor;12            (2) the number of minors left at the location;13            (3) the special needs of the minor, including 14        whether the minor is a person with a physical or mental 15        disability or is otherwise in need of ongoing 16        prescribed medical treatment, such as periodic doses 17        of insulin or other medications;

2            (8) the location of the parent or guardian at the 3        time the minor was left without supervision and the 4        physical distance the minor was from the parent or 5        guardian at the time the minor was without 6        supervision; 7            (9) whether the minor's movement was restricted or 8        the minor was otherwise locked within a room or other 9        structure; 10            (10) whether the minor was given a phone number of 11        a person or location to call in the event of an 12        emergency and whether the minor was capable of making 13        an emergency call; 14            (11) whether there was food and other provision 15        left for the minor; 16            (12) whether any of the conduct is attributable to 17        economic hardship or illness and the parent, guardian, 18        or other person having physical custody or control of 19        the child made a good faith effort to provide for the 20        health and safety of the minor; 21            (13) the age and physical and mental capabilities 22        of the person or persons who provided supervision for 23        the minor;24            (14) whether the minor was left under the 25        supervision of another person; 26            (15) any other factor that would endanger the   HB3365 Engrossed- 24 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1        health and safety of that particular minor; or 2        (e) who has been provided with interim crisis 3    intervention services under Section 3-5 of this Act and 4    whose parent, guardian, or custodian refuses to permit the 5    minor to return home unless the minor is an immediate 6    physical danger to the minor or others living in the home. 7    A minor shall not be considered neglected for the sole 8reason that the minor has been relinquished in accordance with 9the Abandoned Newborn Infant Protection Act.10    (1.5) A minor shall not be considered neglected for the 11sole reason that the minor's parent or other person 12responsible for the minor's welfare permits the minor to 13engage in independent activities unless the minor was 14permitted to engage in independent activities under 15circumstances presenting unreasonable risk of harm to the 16minor's mental or physical health, safety, or well-being. 17"Independent activities" includes, but is not limited to:18        (a) traveling to and from school, including by 19    walking, running, or bicycling;20        (b) traveling to and from nearby commercial or 21    recreational facilities;22        (c) engaging in outdoor play;23        (d) remaining in a vehicle unattended, except as 24    otherwise provided by law;25        (e) remaining at home or at a similarly appropriate 26    location unattended; or  HB3365 Engrossed- 25 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1        (f) engaging in a similar independent activity alone 2    or with other children.3    In determining whether an independent activity presented 4unreasonable risk of harm, the court shall consider:5        (1) whether the activity is accepted as suitable for 6    minors of the same age, maturity level, and developmental 7    capacity as the involved minor;8        (2) the factors listed in items (1) through (15) of 9    paragraph (d) of subsection (1); and10        (3) any other factor the court deems relevant.11    (2) Those who are abused include any minor under 18 years 12of age or a minor 18 years of age or older for whom the court 13has made a finding of probable cause to believe that the minor 14is abused, neglected, or dependent under subsection (1) of 15Section 2-10 prior to the minor's 18th birthday whose parent 16or immediate family member, or any person responsible for the 17minor's welfare, or any person who is in the same family or 18household as the minor, or any individual residing in the same 19home as the minor, or a paramour of the minor's parent:20        (i) inflicts, causes to be inflicted, or allows to be 21    inflicted upon such minor physical injury, by other than 22    accidental means, which causes death, disfigurement, 23    impairment of physical or emotional health, or loss or 24    impairment of any bodily function;25        (ii) creates a substantial risk of physical injury to 26    such minor by other than accidental means which would be   HB3365 Engrossed- 26 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    likely to cause death, disfigurement, impairment of 2    emotional health, or loss or impairment of any bodily 3    function;4        (iii) commits or allows to be committed any sex 5    offense against such minor, as such sex offenses are 6    defined in the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code 7    of 2012, or in the Wrongs to Children Act, and extending 8    those definitions of sex offenses to include minors under 9    18 years of age;10        (iv) commits or allows to be committed an act or acts 11    of torture upon such minor;12        (v) inflicts excessive corporal punishment;13        (vi) commits or allows to be committed the offense of 14    involuntary servitude, involuntary sexual servitude of a 15    minor, or trafficking in persons as defined in Section 16    10-9 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 17    2012, upon such minor; or18        (vii) allows, encourages, or requires a minor to 19    commit any act of prostitution, as defined in the Criminal 20    Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, and extending 21    those definitions to include minors under 18 years of age. 22    A minor shall not be considered abused for the sole reason 23that the minor has been relinquished in accordance with the 24Abandoned Newborn Infant Protection Act.25    (3) This Section does not apply to a minor who would be 26included herein solely for the purpose of qualifying for   HB3365 Engrossed- 27 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1financial assistance for the minor or the minor's parents, 2guardian, or custodian.3    (4) The changes made by Public Act 101-79 apply to a case 4that is pending on or after July 12, 2019 (the effective date 5of Public Act 101-79). 6(Source: P.A. 103-22, eff. 8-8-23;

Temporary custody hearing. At the appearance of 11the minor before the court at the temporary custody hearing, 12all witnesses present shall be examined before the court in 13relation to any matter connected with the allegations made in 14the petition.15    (1) If the court finds that there is not probable cause to 16believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent it 17shall release the minor and dismiss the petition.18    (2) If the court finds that there is probable cause to 19believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent, the 20court shall state in writing the factual basis supporting its 21finding and the minor, the minor's parent, guardian, or 22custodian, and other persons able to give relevant testimony 23shall be examined before the court. The Department of Children 24and Family Services shall give testimony concerning indicated 25reports of abuse and neglect, of which they are aware through   HB3365 Engrossed- 28 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1the central registry, involving the minor's parent, guardian, 2or custodian. After such testimony, the court may, consistent 3with the health, safety, and best interests of the minor, 4enter an order that the minor shall be released upon the 5request of parent, guardian, or custodian if the parent, 6guardian, or custodian appears to take custody. If it is 7determined that a parent's, guardian's, or custodian's 8compliance with critical services mitigates the necessity for 9removal of the minor from the minor's home, the court may enter 10an Order of Protection setting forth reasonable conditions of 11behavior that a parent, guardian, or custodian must observe 12for a specified period of time, not to exceed 12 months, 13without a violation; provided, however, that the 12-month 14period shall begin anew after any violation. "Custodian" 15includes the Department of Children and Family Services, if it 16has been given custody of the child, or any other agency of the 17State which has been given custody or wardship of the child. If 18it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 19of the minor, the court may also prescribe shelter care and 20order that the minor be kept in a suitable place designated by 21the court or in a shelter care facility designated by the 22Department of Children and Family Services or a licensed child 23welfare agency; however, on and after January 1, 2015 (the 24effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 252017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 26Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or   HB3365 Engrossed- 29 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 2or committed to the Department of Children and Family Services 3by any court, except a minor less than 16 years of age and 4committed to the Department of Children and Family Services 5under Section 5-710 of this Act or a minor for whom an 6independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists; and 7on and after January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a criminal 8offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 92012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the 10custody of or committed to the Department of Children and 11Family Services by any court, except a minor less than 15 years 12of age and committed to the Department of Children and Family 13Services under Section 5-710 of this Act or a minor for whom an 14independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists. An 15independent basis exists when the allegations or adjudication 16of abuse, neglect, or dependency do not arise from the same 17facts, incident, or circumstances which give rise to a charge 18or adjudication of delinquency. 19    In placing the minor, the Department or other agency 20shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply 21with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In 22determining the health, safety, and best interests of the 23minor to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is 24a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety, and 25protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 26that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that the   HB3365 Engrossed- 30 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and must 2further find that reasonable efforts have been made or that, 3consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 4minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to prevent or 5eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from the 6minor's home. The court shall require documentation from the 7Department of Children and Family Services as to the 8reasonable efforts that were made to prevent or eliminate the 9necessity of removal of the minor from the minor's home or the 10reasons why no efforts reasonably could be made to prevent or 11eliminate the necessity of removal. When a minor is placed in 12the home of a relative, the Department of Children and Family 13Services shall complete a preliminary background review of the 14members of the minor's custodian's household in accordance 15with Section 4.3 of the Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days 16of that placement. If the minor is ordered placed in a shelter 17care facility of the Department of Children and Family 18Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall, 19upon request of the appropriate Department or other agency, 20appoint the Department of Children and Family Services 21Guardianship Administrator or other appropriate agency 22executive temporary custodian of the minor and the court may 23enter such other orders related to the temporary custody as it 24deems fit and proper, including the provision of services to 25the minor or the minor's family to ameliorate the causes 26contributing to the finding of probable cause or to the   HB3365 Engrossed- 31 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1finding of the existence of immediate and urgent necessity.2    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 3Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 4temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family 5Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a 6parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends 7and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting 8plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency 9of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 10visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 11have telephone and mail communication with the parents.12    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 13Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 14temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 15the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 16the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 17contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 18after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan 19shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and 20if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 21being made to place them together. If the Department has 22determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 23placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 24sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 25determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 26placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for   HB3365 Engrossed- 32 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 2shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 3child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 4addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 5is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 6sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 7placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 8The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date 9for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 10subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 11Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling 12Contact Support Plan is developed. 13    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 14file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 15and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 16Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 17parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 18reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 19achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, 20request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 21the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 22is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 23refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 24duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 25needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 26Department personnel. Child development principles shall be   HB3365 Engrossed- 33 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 2visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 3take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 4party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 5court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 6reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 7achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 8placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact 9are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 10put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 11and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court 12shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 13to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 14contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 15stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 16to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 17visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 18subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing 19under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from 20granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 21opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 22contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 23subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 24restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 25contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 26plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order,   HB3365 Engrossed- 34 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 2is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 3and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 4on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 5viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 6only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 7shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 8amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and 9holidays, of the change of the visitation.10    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 11admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to 12this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 13evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 14the issue is whether the Department has made reasonable 15efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 16is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 17the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 18writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings 19concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the 20protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 21and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that 22reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 23removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 24reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 25of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 26custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be   HB3365 Engrossed- 35 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 2custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 3findings in the case record for the child. The order together 4with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 5entered of record in the court.6    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 7urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 8minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not 9be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 10court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 11protection of the minor.12    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 13Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 14protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 15custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 16cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 17comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 18conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk 19termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure, 20by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 21custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 22custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 23provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 24telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 25relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 26siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall   HB3365 Engrossed- 36 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 2relative to inform the Department if additional information 3regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.4    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor 5described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 6is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 7care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 8ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of 9issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 10entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 11the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 12renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 13or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 14efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 15prescribed.

At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in the 7same manner as upon the original hearing.8    (5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that 9the minor taken into custody is a person described in 10subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or 11detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This 12Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).13    (6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a 14jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners 15in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept 16separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept 17in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant 18to the criminal law.19    (7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer 20within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor 21must immediately be released from custody.22    (8) If neither the parent, guardian, or custodian appears 23within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon 24request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the 25clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later 26than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons   HB3365 Engrossed- 41 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1directed to the parent, guardian, or custodian to appear. At 2the same time the probation department shall prepare a report 3on the minor. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not 4appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order 5prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place 6designated by the Department of Children and Family Services 7or a licensed child welfare agency.8    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 9any interested party, including the State, the temporary 10custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family 11under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and 12Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their 13representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, 14may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor 15to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the 16following grounds:17        (a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent 18    necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or19        (b) There is a material change in the circumstances of 20    the natural family from which the minor was removed and 21    the child can be cared for at home without endangering the 22    child's health or safety; or23        (c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect 24    or dependency, including a parent, relative, or legal 25    guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the 26    minor; or  HB3365 Engrossed- 42 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1        (d) Services provided by the Department of Children 2    and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other 3    service provider have been successful in eliminating the 4    need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for 5    at home without endangering the child's health or safety.6    In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether 7it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 8of the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If 9the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 10custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 11Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 12may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 13arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 14arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 15and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 16protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 17or 2-25.18    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than 1914 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court 20modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 21vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 22appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 23the minor and the minor's family.24    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 25probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 26described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an   HB3365 Engrossed- 43 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 2placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 3be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 4as the abused minor provided:5        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 6    neglect petition pending before the court; and7        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 8    for such other minor.9    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 10been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 11and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 12shelter care for the other minor.13    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 14apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 15or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1698-61).17    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 18temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may 19file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary 20custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 21for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 22of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 23(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court 24may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 25evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 26the temporary custodian such authority. In making its   HB3365 Engrossed- 44 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 2addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 3subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 4        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents 5    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 6    those efforts;7        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 8    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf 9    of the minor;10        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 11    and (b) have been ongoing;12        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 13    family members and the minor;14        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 15    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 16    decision-making on the minor; and17        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.18    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the 19temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the 20requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 21of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 22its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 23this subsection. 24(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 25102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 267-1-24.)   HB3365 Engrossed- 45 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 103-1061)2    Sec. 2-10. Temporary custody hearing. At the appearance of 3the minor before the court at the temporary custody hearing, 4all witnesses present shall be examined before the court in 5relation to any matter connected with the allegations made in 6the petition.7    (1) If the court finds that there is not probable cause to 8believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent it 9shall release the minor and dismiss the petition.10    (2) If the court finds that there is probable cause to 11believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent, the 12court shall state in writing the factual basis supporting its 13finding and the minor, the minor's parent, guardian, or 14custodian, and other persons able to give relevant testimony 15shall be examined before the court. Findings of probable cause 16must be based on reasons sufficient and independent from 17exposure to domestic violence that is perpetrated against 18someone other than the minor where there is no demonstrated 19likelihood of imminent bodily harm to the minor. The 20Department of Children and Family Services shall give 21testimony concerning indicated reports of abuse and neglect, 22of which they are aware through the central registry, 23involving the minor's parent, guardian, or custodian. After 24such testimony, the court may, consistent with the health, 25safety, and best interests of the minor, enter an order that   HB3365 Engrossed- 46 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1the minor shall be released upon the request of parent, 2guardian, or custodian if the parent, guardian, or custodian 3appears to take custody. If it is determined that a parent's, 4guardian's, or custodian's compliance with critical services 5mitigates the necessity for removal of the minor from the 6minor's home, the court may enter an Order of Protection 7setting forth reasonable conditions of behavior that a parent, 8guardian, or custodian must observe for a specified period of 9time, not to exceed 12 months, without a violation; provided, 10however, that the 12-month period shall begin anew after any 11violation. "Custodian" includes the Department of Children and 12Family Services, if it has been given custody of the child, or 13any other agency of the State which has been given custody or 14wardship of the child. If it is consistent with the health, 15safety, and best interests of the minor, the court may also 16prescribe shelter care and order that the minor be kept in a 17suitable place designated by the court or in a shelter care 18facility designated by the Department of Children and Family 19Services or a licensed child welfare agency; however, on and 20after January 1, 2015 (the effective date of Public Act 2198-803) and before January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a 22criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 23Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be 24placed in the custody of or committed to the Department of 25Children and Family Services by any court, except a minor less 26than 16 years of age and committed to the Department of   HB3365 Engrossed- 47 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act 2or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or 3dependency exists; and on and after January 1, 2017, a minor 4charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 51961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent 6shall not be placed in the custody of or committed to the 7Department of Children and Family Services by any court, 8except a minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the 9Department of Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 10of this Act or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, 11neglect, or dependency exists. An independent basis exists 12when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, or 13dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 14circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 15delinquency. 16    In placing the minor, the Department or other agency 17shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply 18with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In 19determining the health, safety, and best interests of the 20minor to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is 21a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety, and 22protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 23that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that the 24minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and must 25further find that reasonable efforts have been made or that, 26consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the   HB3365 Engrossed- 48 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to prevent or 2eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from the 3minor's home. Domestic violence that is perpetrated against 4someone other than the minor where there is no demonstrated 5likelihood of present and imminent bodily harm to the minor is 6not sufficient to determine that an urgent and immediate 7necessity exists to remove a minor from a parent who is not the 8perpetrator of that domestic violence. The court shall require 9documentation from the Department of Children and Family 10Services as to the reasonable efforts that were made to 11prevent or eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor 12from the minor's home or the reasons why no efforts reasonably 13could be made to prevent or eliminate the necessity of 14removal. When a minor is placed in the home of a relative, the 15Department of Children and Family Services shall complete a 16preliminary background review of the members of the minor's 17custodian's household in accordance with Section 3.4 or 4.3 of 18the Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days of that placement. If 19the minor is not placed in the home of a relative, the court 20shall require evidence from the Department as to the efforts 21that were made to place the minor in the home of a relative or 22the reasons why no efforts reasonably could be made to place 23the minor in the home of a relative, consistent with the best 24interests of the minor. If the minor is ordered placed in a 25shelter care facility of the Department of Children and Family 26Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall,   HB3365 Engrossed- 49 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1upon request of the appropriate Department or other agency, 2appoint the Department of Children and Family Services 3Guardianship Administrator or other appropriate agency 4executive temporary custodian of the minor and the court may 5enter such other orders related to the temporary custody as it 6deems fit and proper, including the provision of services to 7the minor or the minor's family to ameliorate the causes 8contributing to the finding of probable cause or to the 9finding of the existence of immediate and urgent necessity.10    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 11Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 12temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family 13Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a 14parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends 15and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting 16plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency 17of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 18visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 19have telephone and mail communication with the parents.20    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 21Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 22temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 23the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 24the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 25contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 26after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan   HB3365 Engrossed- 50 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and 2if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 3being made to place them together. If the Department has 4determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 5placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 6sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 7determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 8placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for 9visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 10shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 11child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 12addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 13is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 14sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 15placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 16The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date 17for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 18subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 19Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling 20Contact Support Plan is developed. 21    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 22file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 23and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 24Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 25parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 26reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the   HB3365 Engrossed- 51 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, 2request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 3the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 4is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 5refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 6duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 7needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 8Department personnel. Child development principles shall be 9considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 10visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 11take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 12party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 13court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 14reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 15achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 16placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact 17are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 18put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 19and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court 20shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 21to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 22contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 23stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 24to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 25visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 26subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing   HB3365 Engrossed- 52 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from 2granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 3opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 4contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 5subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 6restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 7contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 8plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, 9where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 10is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 11and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 12on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 13viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 14only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 15shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 16amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and 17holidays, of the change of the visitation.18    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 19admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to 20this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 21evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 22the issue is whether the Department has made reasonable 23efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 24is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 25the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 26writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings   HB3365 Engrossed- 53 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the 2protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 3and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that 4reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 5removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 6reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 7of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 8custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be 9furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 10custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 11findings in the case record for the child. The order together 12with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 13entered of record in the court.14    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 15urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 16minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not 17be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 18court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 19protection of the minor.20    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 21Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 22protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 23custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 24cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 25comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 26conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk   HB3365 Engrossed- 54 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure, 2by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 3custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 4custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 5provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 6telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 7relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 8siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall 9advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 10relative to inform the Department if additional information 11regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.12    (2.5) When the court places the minor in the temporary 13custody of the Department, the court shall inquire of the 14Department's initial family finding and relative engagement 15efforts, as described in Section 7 of the Children and Family 16Services Act, and the Department shall complete any remaining 17family finding and relative engagement efforts required under 18Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act within 30 19days of the minor being taken into temporary custody. The 20Department shall complete new family finding and relative 21engagement efforts in accordance with Section 7 of the 22Children and Family Services Act for relatives of the minor 23within 30 days of an unknown parent's identity being 24determined or a parent whose whereabouts were unknown being 25located. 26    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor   HB3365 Engrossed- 55 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 2is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 3care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 4ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of 5issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 6entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 7the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 8renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 9or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 10efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 11prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and 12shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's 13attorney and to the last known address of the other person or 14persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the 15nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by 16the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and 17the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a 18notice that the parties will not be entitled to further 19written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this 20case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion 21to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme 22Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and 23the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as 24provided in this Section. The notice for a shelter care 25hearing shall be substantially as follows:26NOTICE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN  HB3365 Engrossed- 56 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1OF SHELTER CARE HEARING2        On ................ at ........., before the Honorable 3    ................, (address:) ................., the State 4    of Illinois will present evidence (1) that (name of child 5    or children) ....................... are abused, 6    neglected, or dependent for the following reasons:7    .............................................. and (2) 8    whether there is "immediate and urgent necessity" to 9    remove the child or children from the responsible 10    relative.11        YOUR FAILURE TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING MAY RESULT IN 12    PLACEMENT of the child or children in foster care until a 13    trial can be held.

At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in the 3same manner as upon the original hearing.4    (5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that 5the minor taken into custody is a person described in 6subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or 7detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This 8Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).9    (6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a 10jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners 11in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept 12separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept 13in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant 14to the criminal law.15    (7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer 16within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor 17must immediately be released from custody.18    (8) If neither the parent, guardian, or custodian appears 19within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon 20request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the 21clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later 22than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons 23directed to the parent, guardian, or custodian to appear. At 24the same time the probation department shall prepare a report 25on the minor. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not 26appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order   HB3365 Engrossed- 60 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place 2designated by the Department of Children and Family Services 3or a licensed child welfare agency.4    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5any interested party, including the State, the temporary 6custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family 7under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and 8Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their 9representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, 10may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor 11to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the 12following grounds:13        (a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent 14    necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or15        (b) There is a material change in the circumstances of 16    the natural family from which the minor was removed and 17    the child can be cared for at home without endangering the 18    child's health or safety; or19        (c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect 20    or dependency, including a parent, relative, or legal 21    guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the 22    minor; or23        (d) Services provided by the Department of Children 24    and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other 25    service provider have been successful in eliminating the 26    need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for   HB3365 Engrossed- 61 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    at home without endangering the child's health or safety.2    In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether 3it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 4of the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If 5the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 6custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 7Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 8may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 9arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 10arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 11and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 12protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 13or 2-25.14    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than 1514 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court 16modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 17vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 18appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 19the minor and the minor's family.20    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 21probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 22described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an 23immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 24placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 25be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 26as the abused minor provided:  HB3365 Engrossed- 62 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 2    neglect petition pending before the court; and3        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 4    for such other minor.5    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 6been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 7and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 8shelter care for the other minor.9    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 10apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 11or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1298-61).13    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 14temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may 15file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary 16custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 17for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 18of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 19(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court 20may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 21evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 22the temporary custodian such authority. In making its 23determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 24addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 25subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 26        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents   HB3365 Engrossed- 63 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 2    those efforts;3        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 4    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf 5    of the minor;6        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 7    and (b) have been ongoing;8        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 9    family members and the minor;10        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 11    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 12    decision-making on the minor; and13        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.14    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the 15temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the 16requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 17of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 18its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 19this subsection. 20(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 21102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 227-1-24; 103-1061, eff. 7-1-25.) 23    (705 ILCS 405/2-21)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-21)24    Sec. 2-21. Findings and adjudication. 25    (1) The court shall state for the record the manner in   HB3365 Engrossed- 64 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1which the parties received service of process and shall note 2whether the return or returns of service, postal return 3receipt or receipts for notice by certified mail, or 4certificate or certificates of publication have been filed in 5the court record. The court shall enter any appropriate orders 6of default against any parent who has been properly served in 7any manner and fails to appear.8    No further service of process as defined in Sections 2-15 9and 2-16 is required in any subsequent proceeding for a parent 10who was properly served in any manner, except as required by 11Supreme Court Rule 11.12    The caseworker shall testify about the diligent search 13conducted for the parent.14    After hearing the evidence the court shall determine 15whether or not the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent. 16If it finds that the minor is not such a person, the court 17shall order the petition dismissed and the minor discharged. 18The court's determination of whether the minor is abused, 19neglected, or dependent shall be stated in writing with the 20factual basis supporting that determination.21    If the court finds that the minor is abused, neglected, or 22dependent, the court shall then determine and put in writing 23the factual basis supporting that determination, and specify, 24to the extent possible, the acts or omissions or both of each 25parent, guardian, or legal custodian that form the basis of 26the court's findings. In making such findings, the factual   HB3365 Engrossed- 65 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1basis supporting a determination that the child has been 2abused, neglected, or dependent must be sufficient and 3independent of exposure to domestic violence that is 4perpetrated against someone other than the child where there 5is no demonstrated likelihood of imminent bodily harm to the 6child. That finding shall appear in the order of the court.7    If the court finds that the child has been abused, 8neglected or dependent, the court shall admonish the parents 9that they must cooperate with the Department of Children and 10Family Services, comply with the terms of the service plan, 11and correct the conditions that require the child to be in 12care, or risk termination of parental rights.13    If the court determines that a person has inflicted 14physical or sexual abuse upon a minor, the court shall report 15that determination to the Illinois State Police, which shall 16include that information in its report to the President of the 17school board for a school district that requests a criminal 18history records check of that person, or the regional 19superintendent of schools who requests a check of that person, 20as required under Section 10-21.9 or 34-18.5 of the School 21Code.22    (2) If, pursuant to subsection (1) of this Section, the 23court determines and puts in writing the factual basis 24supporting the determination that the minor is either abused 25or neglected or dependent, the court shall then set a time not 26later than 30 days after the entry of the finding for a   HB3365 Engrossed- 66 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1dispositional hearing (unless an earlier date is required 2pursuant to Section 2-13.1) to be conducted under Section 2-22 3at which hearing the court shall determine whether it is 4consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 5minor and the public that the minor be made a ward of the 6court. To assist the court in making this and other 7determinations at the dispositional hearing, the court may 8order that an investigation be conducted and a dispositional 9report be prepared concerning the minor's physical and mental 10history and condition, family situation and background, 11economic status, education, occupation, history of delinquency 12or criminality, personal habits, and any other information 13that may be helpful to the court. The dispositional hearing 14may be continued once for a period not to exceed 30 days if the 15court finds that such continuance is necessary to complete the 16dispositional report.17    (3) The time limits of this Section may be waived only by 18consent of all parties and approval by the court, as 19determined to be consistent with the health, safety and best 20interests of the minor.21    (4) For all cases adjudicated prior to July 1, 1991, for 22which no dispositional hearing has been held prior to that 23date, a dispositional hearing under Section 2-22 shall be held 24within 90 days of July 1, 1991.25    (5) The court may terminate the parental rights of a 26parent at the initial dispositional hearing if all of the   HB3365 Engrossed- 67 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1following conditions are met: 2        (i) the original or amended petition contains a 3    request for termination of parental rights and appointment 4    of a guardian with power to consent to adoption; and 5        (ii) the court has found by a preponderance of 6    evidence, introduced or stipulated to at an adjudicatory 7    hearing, that the child comes under the jurisdiction of 8    the court as an abused, neglected, or dependent minor 9    under Section 2-18; and 10        (iii) the court finds, on the basis of clear and 11    convincing evidence admitted at the adjudicatory hearing 12    that the parent is an unfit person under subdivision D of 13    Section 1 of the Adoption Act; and 14        (iv) the court determines in accordance with the rules 15    of evidence for dispositional proceedings, that: 16            (A) it is in the best interest of the minor and 17        public that the child be made a ward of the court;18            (A-1) the petitioner has demonstrated that the 19        Department has discussed the permanency options of 20        guardianship and adoption with the caregiver and the 21        Department has informed the court of the caregiver's 22        wishes as to the permanency goal; 23            (A-5) reasonable efforts under subsection (l-1) of 24        Section 5 of the Children and Family Services Act are 25        inappropriate or such efforts were made and were 26        unsuccessful; and   HB3365 Engrossed- 68 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1            (B) termination of parental rights and appointment 2        of a guardian with power to consent to adoption is in 3        the best interest of the child pursuant to Section 4        2-29.5(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 103-1061, eff. 2-5-25.) 6    (705 ILCS 405/2-27)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-27)7    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 103-1061)8    Sec. 2-27. Placement; legal custody or guardianship. 9    (1) If the court determines and puts in writing the 10factual basis supporting the determination of whether the 11parents, guardian, or legal custodian of a minor adjudged a 12ward of the court are unfit or are unable, for some reason 13other than financial circumstances alone, to care for, 14protect, train or discipline the minor or are unwilling to do 15so, and that the health, safety, and best interest of the minor 16will be jeopardized if the minor remains in the custody of the 17minor's parents, guardian or custodian, the court may at this 18hearing and at any later point:19        (a) place the minor in the custody of a suitable 20    relative or other person as legal custodian or guardian;21        (a-5) with the approval of the Department of Children 22    and Family Services, place the minor in the subsidized 23    guardianship of a suitable relative or other person as 24    legal guardian; "subsidized guardianship" means a private 25    guardianship arrangement for children for whom the   HB3365 Engrossed- 69 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    permanency goals of return home and adoption have been 2    ruled out and who meet the qualifications for subsidized 3    guardianship as defined by the Department of Children and 4    Family Services in administrative rules;5        (b) place the minor under the guardianship of a 6    probation officer;7        (c) commit the minor to an agency for care or 8    placement, except an institution under the authority of 9    the Department of Corrections or of the Department of 10    Children and Family Services;11        (d) on and after the effective date of this amendatory 12    Act of the 98th General Assembly and before January 1, 13    2017, commit the minor to the Department of Children and 14    Family Services for care and service; however, a minor 15    charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 16    1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated 17    delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of or 18    committed to the Department of Children and Family 19    Services by any court, except (i) a minor less than 16 20    years of age and committed to the Department of Children 21    and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act, (ii) 22    a minor under the age of 18 for whom an independent basis 23    of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists, or (iii) a minor 24    for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition to 25    reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 26    2-33 of this Act. On and after January 1, 2017, commit the   HB3365 Engrossed- 70 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    minor to the Department of Children and Family Services 2    for care and service; however, a minor charged with a 3    criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 4    Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not 5    be placed in the custody of or committed to the Department 6    of Children and Family Services by any court, except (i) a 7    minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the 8    Department of Children and Family Services under Section 9    5-710 of this Act, (ii) a minor under the age of 18 for 10    whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 11    exists, or (iii) a minor for whom the court has granted a 12    supplemental petition to reinstate wardship pursuant to 13    subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of this Act. An independent 14    basis exists when the allegations or adjudication of 15    abuse, neglect, or dependency do not arise from the same 16    facts, incident, or circumstances which give rise to a 17    charge or adjudication of delinquency. The Department 18    shall be given due notice of the pendency of the action and 19    the Guardianship Administrator of the Department of 20    Children and Family Services shall be appointed guardian 21    of the person of the minor. Whenever the Department seeks 22    to discharge a minor from its care and service, the 23    Guardianship Administrator shall petition the court for an 24    order terminating guardianship. The Guardianship 25    Administrator may designate one or more other officers of 26    the Department, appointed as Department officers by   HB3365 Engrossed- 71 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    administrative order of the Department Director, 2    authorized to affix the signature of the Guardianship 3    Administrator to documents affecting the guardian-ward 4    relationship of children for whom the Guardianship 5    Administrator has been appointed guardian at such times as 6    the Guardianship Administrator is unable to perform the 7    duties of the Guardianship Administrator office. The 8    signature authorization shall include but not be limited 9    to matters of consent of marriage, enlistment in the armed 10    forces, legal proceedings, adoption, major medical and 11    surgical treatment and application for driver's license. 12    Signature authorizations made pursuant to the provisions 13    of this paragraph shall be filed with the Secretary of 14    State and the Secretary of State shall provide upon 15    payment of the customary fee, certified copies of the 16    authorization to any court or individual who requests a 17    copy.18    (1.5) In making a determination under this Section, the 19court shall also consider whether, based on health, safety, 20and the best interests of the minor,21        (a) appropriate services aimed at family preservation 22    and family reunification have been unsuccessful in 23    rectifying the conditions that have led to a finding of 24    unfitness or inability to care for, protect, train, or 25    discipline the minor, or26        (b) no family preservation or family reunification   HB3365 Engrossed- 72 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    services would be appropriate,2and if the petition or amended petition contained an 3allegation that the parent is an unfit person as defined in 4subdivision (D) of Section 1 of the Adoption Act, and the order 5of adjudication recites that parental unfitness was 6established by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall, 7when appropriate and in the best interest of the minor, enter 8an order terminating parental rights and appointing a guardian 9with power to consent to adoption in accordance with Section 102-29.11    When making a placement, the court, wherever possible, 12shall require the Department of Children and Family Services 13to select a person holding the same religious belief as that of 14the minor or a private agency controlled by persons of like 15religious faith of the minor and shall require the Department 16to otherwise comply with Section 7 of the Children and Family 17Services Act in placing the child. In addition, whenever 18alternative plans for placement are available, the court shall 19ascertain and consider, to the extent appropriate in the 20particular case, the views and preferences of the minor.21    (2) When a minor is placed with a suitable relative or 22other person pursuant to item (a) of subsection (1), the court 23shall appoint the suitable relative or other person the legal 24custodian or guardian of the person of the minor. When a minor 25is committed to any agency, the court shall appoint the proper 26officer or representative thereof as legal custodian or   HB3365 Engrossed- 73 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1guardian of the person of the minor. Legal custodians and 2guardians of the person of the minor have the respective 3rights and duties set forth in subsection (9) of Section 1-3 4except as otherwise provided by order of court; but no 5guardian of the person may consent to adoption of the minor 6unless that authority is conferred upon the guardian in 7accordance with Section 2-29. An agency whose representative 8is appointed guardian of the person or legal custodian of the 9minor may place the minor in any child care facility, but the 10facility must be licensed under the Child Care Act of 1969 or 11have been approved by the Department of Children and Family 12Services as meeting the standards established for such 13licensing. No agency may place a minor adjudicated under 14Sections 2-3 or 2-4 in a child care facility unless the 15placement is in compliance with the rules and regulations for 16placement under this Section promulgated by the Department of 17Children and Family Services under Section 5 of the Children 18and Family Services Act. Like authority and restrictions shall 19be conferred by the court upon any probation officer who has 20been appointed guardian of the person of a minor.21    (3) No placement by any probation officer or agency whose 22representative is appointed guardian of the person or legal 23custodian of a minor may be made in any out of State child care 24facility unless it complies with the Interstate Compact on the 25Placement of Children. Placement with a parent, however, is 26not subject to that Interstate Compact.  HB3365 Engrossed- 74 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    (4) The clerk of the court shall issue to the legal 2custodian or guardian of the person a certified copy of the 3order of court, as proof of the legal custodian's or 4guardian's authority.

If 18it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 19of the minor, the court may also prescribe shelter care and 20order that the minor be kept in a suitable place designated by 21the court or in a shelter care facility designated by the 22Department of Children and Family Services or a licensed child 23welfare agency; however, on and after January 1, 2015 (the 24effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 252017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 26Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or   HB3365 Engrossed- 29 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 2or committed to the Department of Children and Family Services 3by any court, except a minor less than 16 years of age and 4committed to the Department of Children and Family Services 5under Section 5-710 of this Act or a minor for whom an 6independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists; and 7on and after January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a criminal 8offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 92012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the 10custody of or committed to the Department of Children and 11Family Services by any court, except a minor less than 15 years 12of age and committed to the Department of Children and Family 13Services under Section 5-710 of this Act or a minor for whom an 14independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists. An 15independent basis exists when the allegations or adjudication 16of abuse, neglect, or dependency do not arise from the same 17facts, incident, or circumstances which give rise to a charge 18or adjudication of delinquency. 19    In placing the minor, the Department or other agency 20shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply 21with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In 22determining the health, safety, and best interests of the 23minor to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is 24a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety, and 25protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 26that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that the   HB3365 Engrossed- 30 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and must 2further find that reasonable efforts have been made or that, 3consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 4minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to prevent or 5eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from the 6minor's home. The court shall require documentation from the 7Department of Children and Family Services as to the 8reasonable efforts that were made to prevent or eliminate the 9necessity of removal of the minor from the minor's home or the 10reasons why no efforts reasonably could be made to prevent or 11eliminate the necessity of removal. When a minor is placed in 12the home of a relative, the Department of Children and Family 13Services shall complete a preliminary background review of the 14members of the minor's custodian's household in accordance 15with Section 4.3 of the Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days 16of that placement. If the minor is ordered placed in a shelter 17care facility of the Department of Children and Family 18Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall, 19upon request of the appropriate Department or other agency, 20appoint the Department of Children and Family Services 21Guardianship Administrator or other appropriate agency 22executive temporary custodian of the minor and the court may 23enter such other orders related to the temporary custody as it 24deems fit and proper, including the provision of services to 25the minor or the minor's family to ameliorate the causes 26contributing to the finding of probable cause or to the   HB3365 Engrossed- 31 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1finding of the existence of immediate and urgent necessity.2    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 3Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 4temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family 5Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a 6parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends 7and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting 8plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency 9of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 10visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 11have telephone and mail communication with the parents.12    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 13Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 14temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 15the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 16the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 17contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 18after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan 19shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and 20if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 21being made to place them together. If the Department has 22determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 23placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 24sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 25determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 26placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for   HB3365 Engrossed- 32 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 2shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 3child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 4addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 5is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 6sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 7placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 8The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date 9for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 10subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 11Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling 12Contact Support Plan is developed. 13    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 14file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 15and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 16Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 17parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 18reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 19achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, 20request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 21the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 22is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 23refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 24duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 25needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 26Department personnel. Child development principles shall be   HB3365 Engrossed- 33 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 2visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 3take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 4party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 5court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 6reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 7achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 8placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact 9are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 10put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 11and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court 12shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 13to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 14contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 15stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 16to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 17visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 18subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing 19under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from 20granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 21opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 22contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 23subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 24restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 25contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 26plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order,   HB3365 Engrossed- 34 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 2is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 3and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 4on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 5viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 6only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 7shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 8amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and 9holidays, of the change of the visitation.10    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 11admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to 12this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 13evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 14the issue is whether the Department has made reasonable 15efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 16is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 17the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 18writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings 19concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the 20protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 21and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that 22reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 23removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 24reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 25of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 26custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be   HB3365 Engrossed- 35 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 2custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 3findings in the case record for the child. The order together 4with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 5entered of record in the court.6    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 7urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 8minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not 9be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 10court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 11protection of the minor.12    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 13Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 14protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 15custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 16cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 17comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 18conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk 19termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure, 20by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 21custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 22custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 23provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 24telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 25relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 26siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall   HB3365 Engrossed- 36 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 2relative to inform the Department if additional information 3regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.4    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor 5described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 6is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 7care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 8ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of 9issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 10entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 11the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 12renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 13or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 14efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 15prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and 16shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's 17attorney and to the last known address of the other person or 18persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the 19nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by 20the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and 21the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a 22notice that the parties will not be entitled to further 23written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this 24case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion 25to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme 26Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and   HB3365 Engrossed- 37 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as 2provided in this Section. The notice for a shelter care 3hearing shall be substantially as follows:4NOTICE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN5OF SHELTER CARE HEARING6        On ................ at ........., before the Honorable 7    ................, (address:) ................., the State 8    of Illinois will present evidence (1) that (name of child 9    or children) ....................... are abused, 10    neglected, or dependent for the following reasons:11    .............................................. and (2) 12    whether there is "immediate and urgent necessity" to 13    remove the child or children from the responsible 14    relative.15        YOUR FAILURE TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING MAY RESULT IN 16    PLACEMENT of the child or children in foster care until a 17    trial can be held. A trial may not be held for up to 90 18    days.

The best interests of the child.10            4. To cross examine the State's witnesses. 11    The Notice for rehearings shall be substantially as 12follows:13NOTICE OF PARENT'S AND CHILDREN'S RIGHTS14TO REHEARING ON TEMPORARY CUSTODY15        If you were not present at and did not have adequate 16    notice of the Shelter Care Hearing at which temporary 17    custody of ............... was awarded to 18    ................, you have the right to request a full 19    rehearing on whether the State should have temporary 20    custody of ................. To request this rehearing, 21    you must file with the Clerk of the Juvenile Court 22    (address): ........................, in person or by 23    mailing a statement (affidavit) setting forth the 24    following:25            1. That you were not present at the shelter care   HB3365 Engrossed- 39 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1        hearing.2            2.

Signature must be notarized.6        The rehearing should be scheduled within 48 hours of 7    your filing this affidavit.8        At the rehearing, your rights are the same as at the 9    initial shelter care hearing. The enclosed notice explains 10    those rights.11        At the Shelter Care Hearing, children have the 12    following rights:13            1. To have a guardian ad litem appointed.14            2. To be declared competent as a witness and to 15        present testimony concerning:16                a. Whether they are abused, neglected or 17            dependent.18                b.

To cross examine witnesses for other parties.22            4. To obtain an explanation of any proceedings and 23        orders of the court.24    (4) If the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 25relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor did not 26have actual notice of or was not present at the shelter care   HB3365 Engrossed- 40 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1hearing, the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 2relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor may file 3an affidavit setting forth these facts, and the clerk shall 4set the matter for rehearing not later than 48 hours, 5excluding Sundays and legal holidays, after the filing of the 6affidavit. At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in the 7same manner as upon the original hearing.8    (5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that 9the minor taken into custody is a person described in 10subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or 11detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This 12Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).13    (6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a 14jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners 15in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept 16separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept 17in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant 18to the criminal law.19    (7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer 20within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor 21must immediately be released from custody.22    (8) If neither the parent, guardian, or custodian appears 23within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon 24request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the 25clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later 26than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons   HB3365 Engrossed- 41 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1directed to the parent, guardian, or custodian to appear. At 2the same time the probation department shall prepare a report 3on the minor. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not 4appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order 5prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place 6designated by the Department of Children and Family Services 7or a licensed child welfare agency.8    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 9any interested party, including the State, the temporary 10custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family 11under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and 12Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their 13representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, 14may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor 15to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the 16following grounds:17        (a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent 18    necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or19        (b) There is a material change in the circumstances of 20    the natural family from which the minor was removed and 21    the child can be cared for at home without endangering the 22    child's health or safety; or23        (c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect 24    or dependency, including a parent, relative, or legal 25    guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the 26    minor; or  HB3365 Engrossed- 42 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1        (d) Services provided by the Department of Children 2    and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other 3    service provider have been successful in eliminating the 4    need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for 5    at home without endangering the child's health or safety.6    In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether 7it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 8of the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If 9the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 10custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 11Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 12may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 13arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 14arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 15and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 16protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 17or 2-25.18    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than 1914 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court 20modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 21vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 22appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 23the minor and the minor's family.24    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 25probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 26described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an   HB3365 Engrossed- 43 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 2placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 3be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 4as the abused minor provided:5        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 6    neglect petition pending before the court; and7        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 8    for such other minor.9    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 10been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 11and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 12shelter care for the other minor.13    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 14apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 15or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1698-61).17    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 18temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may 19file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary 20custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 21for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 22of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 23(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court 24may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 25evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 26the temporary custodian such authority. In making its   HB3365 Engrossed- 44 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 2addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 3subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 4        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents 5    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 6    those efforts;7        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 8    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf 9    of the minor;10        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 11    and (b) have been ongoing;12        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 13    family members and the minor;14        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 15    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 16    decision-making on the minor; and17        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.18    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the 19temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the 20requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 21of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 22its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 23this subsection. 24(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 25102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 267-1-24.)   HB3365 Engrossed- 45 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 103-1061)2    Sec. 2-10. Temporary custody hearing. At the appearance of 3the minor before the court at the temporary custody hearing, 4all witnesses present shall be examined before the court in 5relation to any matter connected with the allegations made in 6the petition.7    (1) If the court finds that there is not probable cause to 8believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent it 9shall release the minor and dismiss the petition.10    (2) If the court finds that there is probable cause to 11believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent, the 12court shall state in writing the factual basis supporting its 13finding and the minor, the minor's parent, guardian, or 14custodian, and other persons able to give relevant testimony 15shall be examined before the court. Findings of probable cause 16must be based on reasons sufficient and independent from 17exposure to domestic violence that is perpetrated against 18someone other than the minor where there is no demonstrated 19likelihood of imminent bodily harm to the minor. The 20Department of Children and Family Services shall give 21testimony concerning indicated reports of abuse and neglect, 22of which they are aware through the central registry, 23involving the minor's parent, guardian, or custodian. After 24such testimony, the court may, consistent with the health, 25safety, and best interests of the minor, enter an order that   HB3365 Engrossed- 46 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1the minor shall be released upon the request of parent, 2guardian, or custodian if the parent, guardian, or custodian 3appears to take custody. If it is determined that a parent's, 4guardian's, or custodian's compliance with critical services 5mitigates the necessity for removal of the minor from the 6minor's home, the court may enter an Order of Protection 7setting forth reasonable conditions of behavior that a parent, 8guardian, or custodian must observe for a specified period of 9time, not to exceed 12 months, without a violation; provided, 10however, that the 12-month period shall begin anew after any 11violation. "Custodian" includes the Department of Children and 12Family Services, if it has been given custody of the child, or 13any other agency of the State which has been given custody or 14wardship of the child. If it is consistent with the health, 15safety, and best interests of the minor, the court may also 16prescribe shelter care and order that the minor be kept in a 17suitable place designated by the court or in a shelter care 18facility designated by the Department of Children and Family 19Services or a licensed child welfare agency; however, on and 20after January 1, 2015 (the effective date of Public Act 2198-803) and before January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a 22criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 23Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be 24placed in the custody of or committed to the Department of 25Children and Family Services by any court, except a minor less 26than 16 years of age and committed to the Department of   HB3365 Engrossed- 47 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act 2or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or 3dependency exists; and on and after January 1, 2017, a minor 4charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 51961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent 6shall not be placed in the custody of or committed to the 7Department of Children and Family Services by any court, 8except a minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the 9Department of Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 10of this Act or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, 11neglect, or dependency exists. An independent basis exists 12when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, or 13dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 14circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 15delinquency. 16    In placing the minor, the Department or other agency 17shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply 18with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In 19determining the health, safety, and best interests of the 20minor to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is 21a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety, and 22protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 23that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that the 24minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and must 25further find that reasonable efforts have been made or that, 26consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the   HB3365 Engrossed- 48 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to prevent or 2eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from the 3minor's home. Domestic violence that is perpetrated against 4someone other than the minor where there is no demonstrated 5likelihood of present and imminent bodily harm to the minor is 6not sufficient to determine that an urgent and immediate 7necessity exists to remove a minor from a parent who is not the 8perpetrator of that domestic violence. The court shall require 9documentation from the Department of Children and Family 10Services as to the reasonable efforts that were made to 11prevent or eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor 12from the minor's home or the reasons why no efforts reasonably 13could be made to prevent or eliminate the necessity of 14removal. When a minor is placed in the home of a relative, the 15Department of Children and Family Services shall complete a 16preliminary background review of the members of the minor's 17custodian's household in accordance with Section 3.4 or 4.3 of 18the Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days of that placement. If 19the minor is not placed in the home of a relative, the court 20shall require evidence from the Department as to the efforts 21that were made to place the minor in the home of a relative or 22the reasons why no efforts reasonably could be made to place 23the minor in the home of a relative, consistent with the best 24interests of the minor. If the minor is ordered placed in a 25shelter care facility of the Department of Children and Family 26Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall,   HB3365 Engrossed- 49 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1upon request of the appropriate Department or other agency, 2appoint the Department of Children and Family Services 3Guardianship Administrator or other appropriate agency 4executive temporary custodian of the minor and the court may 5enter such other orders related to the temporary custody as it 6deems fit and proper, including the provision of services to 7the minor or the minor's family to ameliorate the causes 8contributing to the finding of probable cause or to the 9finding of the existence of immediate and urgent necessity.10    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 11Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 12temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family 13Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a 14parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends 15and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting 16plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency 17of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 18visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 19have telephone and mail communication with the parents.20    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 21Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 22temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 23the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 24the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 25contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 26after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan   HB3365 Engrossed- 50 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and 2if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 3being made to place them together. If the Department has 4determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 5placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 6sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 7determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 8placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for 9visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 10shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 11child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 12addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 13is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 14sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 15placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 16The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date 17for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 18subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 19Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling 20Contact Support Plan is developed. 21    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 22file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 23and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 24Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 25parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 26reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the   HB3365 Engrossed- 51 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, 2request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 3the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 4is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 5refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 6duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 7needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 8Department personnel. Child development principles shall be 9considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 10visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 11take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 12party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 13court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 14reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 15achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 16placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact 17are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 18put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 19and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court 20shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 21to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 22contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 23stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 24to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 25visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 26subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing   HB3365 Engrossed- 52 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from 2granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 3opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 4contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 5subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 6restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 7contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 8plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, 9where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 10is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 11and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 12on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 13viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 14only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 15shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 16amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and 17holidays, of the change of the visitation.18    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 19admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to 20this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 21evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 22the issue is whether the Department has made reasonable 23efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 24is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 25the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 26writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings   HB3365 Engrossed- 53 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the 2protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 3and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that 4reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 5removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 6reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 7of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 8custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be 9furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 10custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 11findings in the case record for the child. The order together 12with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 13entered of record in the court.14    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 15urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 16minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not 17be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 18court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 19protection of the minor.20    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 21Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 22protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 23custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 24cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 25comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 26conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk   HB3365 Engrossed- 54 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure, 2by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 3custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 4custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 5provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 6telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 7relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 8siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall 9advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 10relative to inform the Department if additional information 11regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.12    (2.5) When the court places the minor in the temporary 13custody of the Department, the court shall inquire of the 14Department's initial family finding and relative engagement 15efforts, as described in Section 7 of the Children and Family 16Services Act, and the Department shall complete any remaining 17family finding and relative engagement efforts required under 18Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act within 30 19days of the minor being taken into temporary custody. The 20Department shall complete new family finding and relative 21engagement efforts in accordance with Section 7 of the 22Children and Family Services Act for relatives of the minor 23within 30 days of an unknown parent's identity being 24determined or a parent whose whereabouts were unknown being 25located. 26    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor   HB3365 Engrossed- 55 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 2is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 3care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 4ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of 5issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 6entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 7the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 8renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 9or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 10efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 11prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and 12shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's 13attorney and to the last known address of the other person or 14persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the 15nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by 16the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and 17the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a 18notice that the parties will not be entitled to further 19written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this 20case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion 21to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme 22Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and 23the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as 24provided in this Section. The notice for a shelter care 25hearing shall be substantially as follows:26NOTICE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN  HB3365 Engrossed- 56 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1OF SHELTER CARE HEARING2        On ................ at ........., before the Honorable 3    ................, (address:) ................., the State 4    of Illinois will present evidence (1) that (name of child 5    or children) ....................... are abused, 6    neglected, or dependent for the following reasons:7    .............................................. and (2) 8    whether there is "immediate and urgent necessity" to 9    remove the child or children from the responsible 10    relative.11        YOUR FAILURE TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING MAY RESULT IN 12    PLACEMENT of the child or children in foster care until a 13    trial can be held.

To obtain an explanation of any proceedings and 19        orders of the court.20    (4) If the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 21relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor did not 22have actual notice of or was not present at the shelter care 23hearing, the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 24relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor may file 25an affidavit setting forth these facts, and the clerk shall 26set the matter for rehearing not later than 48 hours,   HB3365 Engrossed- 59 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1excluding Sundays and legal holidays, after the filing of the 2affidavit. At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in the 3same manner as upon the original hearing.4    (5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that 5the minor taken into custody is a person described in 6subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or 7detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This 8Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).9    (6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a 10jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners 11in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept 12separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept 13in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant 14to the criminal law.15    (7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer 16within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor 17must immediately be released from custody.18    (8) If neither the parent, guardian, or custodian appears 19within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon 20request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the 21clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later 22than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons 23directed to the parent, guardian, or custodian to appear. At 24the same time the probation department shall prepare a report 25on the minor. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not 26appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order   HB3365 Engrossed- 60 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place 2designated by the Department of Children and Family Services 3or a licensed child welfare agency.4    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5any interested party, including the State, the temporary 6custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family 7under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and 8Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their 9representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, 10may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor 11to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the 12following grounds:13        (a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent 14    necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or15        (b) There is a material change in the circumstances of 16    the natural family from which the minor was removed and 17    the child can be cared for at home without endangering the 18    child's health or safety; or19        (c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect 20    or dependency, including a parent, relative, or legal 21    guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the 22    minor; or23        (d) Services provided by the Department of Children 24    and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other 25    service provider have been successful in eliminating the 26    need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for   HB3365 Engrossed- 61 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    at home without endangering the child's health or safety.2    In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether 3it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 4of the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If 5the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 6custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 7Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 8may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 9arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 10arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 11and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 12protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 13or 2-25.14    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than 1514 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court 16modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 17vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 18appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 19the minor and the minor's family.20    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 21probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 22described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an 23immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 24placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 25be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 26as the abused minor provided:  HB3365 Engrossed- 62 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 2    neglect petition pending before the court; and3        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 4    for such other minor.5    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 6been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 7and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 8shelter care for the other minor.9    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 10apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 11or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1298-61).13    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 14temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may 15file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary 16custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 17for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 18of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 19(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court 20may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 21evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 22the temporary custodian such authority. In making its 23determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 24addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 25subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 26        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents   HB3365 Engrossed- 63 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 2    those efforts;3        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 4    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf 5    of the minor;6        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 7    and (b) have been ongoing;8        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 9    family members and the minor;10        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 11    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 12    decision-making on the minor; and13        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.14    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the 15temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the 16requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 17of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 18its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 19this subsection. 20(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 21102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 227-1-24; 103-1061, eff. 7-1-25.) 23    (705 ILCS 405/2-21)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-21)24    Sec. 2-21. Findings and adjudication. 25    (1) The court shall state for the record the manner in   HB3365 Engrossed- 64 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1which the parties received service of process and shall note 2whether the return or returns of service, postal return 3receipt or receipts for notice by certified mail, or 4certificate or certificates of publication have been filed in 5the court record. The court shall enter any appropriate orders 6of default against any parent who has been properly served in 7any manner and fails to appear.8    No further service of process as defined in Sections 2-15 9and 2-16 is required in any subsequent proceeding for a parent 10who was properly served in any manner, except as required by 11Supreme Court Rule 11.12    The caseworker shall testify about the diligent search 13conducted for the parent.14    After hearing the evidence the court shall determine 15whether or not the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent. 16If it finds that the minor is not such a person, the court 17shall order the petition dismissed and the minor discharged. 18The court's determination of whether the minor is abused, 19neglected, or dependent shall be stated in writing with the 20factual basis supporting that determination.21    If the court finds that the minor is abused, neglected, or 22dependent, the court shall then determine and put in writing 23the factual basis supporting that determination, and specify, 24to the extent possible, the acts or omissions or both of each 25parent, guardian, or legal custodian that form the basis of 26the court's findings. In making such findings, the factual   HB3365 Engrossed- 65 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1basis supporting a determination that the child has been 2abused, neglected, or dependent must be sufficient and 3independent of exposure to domestic violence that is 4perpetrated against someone other than the child where there 5is no demonstrated likelihood of imminent bodily harm to the 6child.
