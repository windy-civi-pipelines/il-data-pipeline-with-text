At the appearance of 20the minor before the court at the temporary custody hearing, 21all witnesses present shall be examined before the court in 22relation to any matter connected with the allegations made in 23the petition.24    (1) If the court finds that there is not probable cause to 25believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent it   HB3365- 19 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1shall release the minor and dismiss the petition.2    (2) If the court finds that there is probable cause to 3believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent, the 4court shall state in writing the factual basis supporting its 5finding and the minor, the minor's parent, guardian, or 6custodian, and other persons able to give relevant testimony 7shall be examined before the court. The Department of Children 8and Family Services shall give testimony concerning indicated 9reports of abuse and neglect, of which they are aware through 10the central registry, involving the minor's parent, guardian, 11or custodian. After such testimony, the court may, consistent 12with the health, safety, and best interests of the minor, 13enter an order that the minor shall be released upon the 14request of parent, guardian, or custodian if the parent, 15guardian, or custodian appears to take custody. It shall be 16presumed to be consistent with the health, safety, and best 17interest of the minor to be released to a parent, guardian, or 18custodian who experienced domestic violence unless the court 19has determined that this parent, guardian, or custodian who 20experienced domestic violence has committed acts or omissions 21unrelated to incidents of domestic violence against the 22parent, guardian, or custodian that is sufficient to 23independently support a determination of abuse or neglect 24under this Act. If it is determined that a parent's, 25guardian's, or custodian's compliance with critical services 26mitigates the necessity for removal of the minor from the   HB3365- 20 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1minor's home, the court may enter an Order of Protection 2setting forth reasonable conditions of behavior that a parent, 3guardian, or custodian must observe for a specified period of 4time, not to exceed 12 months, without a violation; provided, 5however, that the 12-month period shall begin anew after any 6violation. "Custodian" includes the Department of Children and 7Family Services, if it has been given custody of the child, or 8any other agency of the State which has been given custody or 9wardship of the child. If it is consistent with the health, 10safety, and best interests of the minor, the court may also 11prescribe shelter care and order that the minor be kept in a 12suitable place designated by the court or in a shelter care 13facility designated by the Department of Children and Family 14Services or a licensed child welfare agency; however, on and 15after January 1, 2015 (the effective date of Public Act 1698-803) and before January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a 17criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 18Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be 19placed in the custody of or committed to the Department of 20Children and Family Services by any court, except a minor less 21than 16 years of age and committed to the Department of 22Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act 23or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or 24dependency exists; and on and after January 1, 2017, a minor 25charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 261961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent   HB3365- 21 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1shall not be placed in the custody of or committed to the 2Department of Children and Family Services by any court, 3except a minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the 4Department of Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 5of this Act or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, 6neglect, or dependency exists. An independent basis exists 7when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, or 8dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 9circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 10delinquency. 11    In placing the minor, the Department or other agency 12shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply 13with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In 14determining the health, safety, and best interests of the 15minor to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is 16a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety, and 17protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 18that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that the 19minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and must 20further find that reasonable efforts have been made or that, 21consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 22minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to prevent or 23eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from the 24minor's home. The court shall require documentation from the 25Department of Children and Family Services as to the 26reasonable efforts that were made to prevent or eliminate the   HB3365- 22 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1necessity of removal of the minor from the minor's home or the 2reasons why no efforts reasonably could be made to prevent or 3eliminate the necessity of removal. When a minor is placed in 4the home of a relative, the Department of Children and Family 5Services shall complete a preliminary background review of the 6members of the minor's custodian's household in accordance 7with Section 4.3 of the Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days 8of that placement. If the minor is ordered placed in a shelter 9care facility of the Department of Children and Family 10Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall, 11upon request of the appropriate Department or other agency, 12appoint the Department of Children and Family Services 13Guardianship Administrator or other appropriate agency 14executive temporary custodian of the minor and the court may 15enter such other orders related to the temporary custody as it 16deems fit and proper, including the provision of services to 17the minor or the minor's family to ameliorate the causes 18contributing to the finding of probable cause or to the 19finding of the existence of immediate and urgent necessity.20    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 21Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 22temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family 23Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a 24parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends 25and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting 26plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency   HB3365- 23 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 2visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 3have telephone and mail communication with the parents.4    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 5Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 6temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 7the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 8the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 9contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 10after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan 11shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and 12if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 13being made to place them together. If the Department has 14determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 15placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 16sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 17determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 18placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for 19visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 20shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 21child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 22addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 23is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 24sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 25placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 26The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date   HB3365- 24 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 2subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 3Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling 4Contact Support Plan is developed. 5    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 6file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 7and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 8Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 9parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 10reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 11achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, 12request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 13the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 14is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 15refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 16duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 17needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 18Department personnel. Child development principles shall be 19considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 20visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 21take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 22party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 23court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 24reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 25achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 26placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact   HB3365- 25 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 2put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 3and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court 4shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 5to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 6contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 7stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 8to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 9visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 10subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing 11under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from 12granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 13opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 14contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 15subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 16restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 17contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 18plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, 19where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 20is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 21and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 22on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 23viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 24only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 25shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 26amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and   HB3365- 26 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1holidays, of the change of the visitation.2    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 3admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to 4this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 5evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 6the issue is whether the Department has made reasonable 7efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 8is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 9the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 10writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings 11concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the 12protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 13and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that 14reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 15removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 16reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 17of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 18custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be 19furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 20custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 21findings in the case record for the child. The order together 22with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 23entered of record in the court.24    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 25urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 26minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not   HB3365- 27 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 2court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 3protection of the minor.4    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 5Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 6protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 7custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 8cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 9comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 10conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk 11termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure, 12by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 13custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 14custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 15provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 16telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 17relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 18siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall 19advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 20relative to inform the Department if additional information 21regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.22    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor 23described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 24is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 25care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 26ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of   HB3365- 28 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 2entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 3the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 4renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 5or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 6efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 7prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and 8shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's 9attorney and to the last known address of the other person or 10persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the 11nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by 12the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and 13the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a 14notice that the parties will not be entitled to further 15written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this 16case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion 17to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme 18Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and 19the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as 20provided in this Section. The notice for a shelter care 21hearing shall be substantially as follows:22NOTICE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN23OF SHELTER CARE HEARING24        On ................ at ........., before the Honorable 25    ................, (address:) ................., the State 26    of Illinois will present evidence (1) that (name of child   HB3365- 29 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    or children) ....................... are abused, 2    neglected, or dependent for the following reasons:3    .............................................. and (2) 4    whether there is "immediate and urgent necessity" to 5    remove the child or children from the responsible 6    relative.7        YOUR FAILURE TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING MAY RESULT IN 8    PLACEMENT of the child or children in foster care until a 9    trial can be held.

The enclosed notice explains 2    those rights.3        At the Shelter Care Hearing, children have the 4    following rights:5            1. To have a guardian ad litem appointed.6            2. To be declared competent as a witness and to 7        present testimony concerning:8                a. Whether they are abused, neglected or 9            dependent.10                b.

At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in the 25same manner as upon the original hearing.26    (5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that   HB3365- 32 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1the minor taken into custody is a person described in 2subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or 3detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This 4Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).5    (6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a 6jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners 7in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept 8separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept 9in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant 10to the criminal law.11    (7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer 12within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor 13must immediately be released from custody.14    (8) If neither the parent, guardian, or custodian appears 15within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon 16request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the 17clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later 18than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons 19directed to the parent, guardian, or custodian to appear. At 20the same time the probation department shall prepare a report 21on the minor. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not 22appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order 23prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place 24designated by the Department of Children and Family Services 25or a licensed child welfare agency.26    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section   HB3365- 33 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1any interested party, including the State, the temporary 2custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family 3under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and 4Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their 5representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, 6may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor 7to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the 8following grounds:9        (a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent 10    necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or11        (b) There is a material change in the circumstances of 12    the natural family from which the minor was removed and 13    the child can be cared for at home without endangering the 14    child's health or safety; or15        (c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect 16    or dependency, including a parent, relative, or legal 17    guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the 18    minor; or19        (d) Services provided by the Department of Children 20    and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other 21    service provider have been successful in eliminating the 22    need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for 23    at home without endangering the child's health or safety.24    In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether 25it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 26of the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If   HB3365- 34 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 2custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 3Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 4may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 5arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 6arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 7and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 8protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 9or 2-25.10    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than 1114 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court 12modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 13vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 14appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 15the minor and the minor's family.16    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 17probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 18described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an 19immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 20placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 21be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 22as the abused minor provided:23        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 24    neglect petition pending before the court; and25        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 26    for such other minor.  HB3365- 35 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 2been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 3and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 4shelter care for the other minor.5    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 6apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 7or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 898-61).9    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 10temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may 11file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary 12custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 13for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 14of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 15(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court 16may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 17evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 18the temporary custodian such authority. In making its 19determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 20addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 21subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 22        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents 23    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 24    those efforts;25        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 26    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf   HB3365- 36 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    of the minor;2        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 3    and (b) have been ongoing;4        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 5    family members and the minor;6        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 7    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 8    decision-making on the minor; and9        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.10    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the 11temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the 12requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 13of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 14its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 15this subsection. 16(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 17102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 187-1-24.) 19    (705 ILCS 405/2-18)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-18)20    Sec. 2-18.

All other circumstances of 16the making of the memorandum, record, photograph or x-ray, 17including lack of personal knowledge of the maker, may be 18proved to affect the weight to be accorded such evidence, but 19shall not affect its admissibility.20    (b) Any indicated report filed pursuant to the Abused and 21Neglected Child Reporting Act shall be admissible in evidence.22    (c) Previous statements made by the minor relating to any 23allegations of abuse or neglect shall be admissible in 24evidence.

This subsection (5) shall not apply 7in counties with 2,000,000 or more inhabitants.8    (6) In any hearing under this Act, the court may take 9judicial notice of prior sworn testimony or evidence admitted 10in prior proceedings involving the same minor if (a) the 11parties were either represented by counsel at such prior 12proceedings or the right to counsel was knowingly waived and 13(b) the taking of judicial notice would not result in 14admitting hearsay evidence at a hearing where it would 15otherwise be prohibited.16(Source: P.A. 103-124, eff. 1-1-24.) 17    (705 ILCS 405/2-21)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-21)18    Sec. 2-21. Findings and adjudication. 19    (1) The court shall state for the record the manner in 20which the parties received service of process and shall note 21whether the return or returns of service, postal return 22receipt or receipts for notice by certified mail, or 23certificate or certificates of publication have been filed in 24the court record. The court shall enter any appropriate orders 25of default against any parent who has been properly served in   HB3365- 43 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1any manner and fails to appear.2    No further service of process as defined in Sections 2-15 3and 2-16 is required in any subsequent proceeding for a parent 4who was properly served in any manner, except as required by 5Supreme Court Rule 11.6    The caseworker shall testify about the diligent search 7conducted for the parent.8    After hearing the evidence the court shall determine 9whether or not the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent. 10If it finds that the minor is not such a person, the court 11shall order the petition dismissed and the minor discharged. 12The court's determination of whether the minor is abused, 13neglected, or dependent shall be stated in writing with the 14factual basis supporting that determination.15    If the court finds that the minor is abused, neglected, or 16dependent, the court shall then determine and put in writing 17the factual basis supporting that determination, and specify, 18to the extent possible, the acts or omissions or both of each 19parent, guardian, or legal custodian that form the basis of 20the court's findings. In making such findings, domestic 21violence against a parent, guardian, or custodian even in the 22presence of the minor shall not be construed as the acts or 23omissions of the parent, guardian, or custodian who 24experienced domestic violence and any findings must be based 25upon acts or omissions of that parent, guardian, or custodian 26unrelated to incidents of domestic violence against the   HB3365- 44 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1parent, guardian, or custodian that are sufficient to 2independently support a determination of abuse or neglect 3under this Act. That finding shall appear in the order of the 4court.5    If the court finds that the child has been abused, 6neglected or dependent, the court shall admonish the parents 7that they must cooperate with the Department of Children and 8Family Services, comply with the terms of the service plan, 9and correct the conditions that require the child to be in 10care, or risk termination of parental rights.11    If the court determines that a person has inflicted 12physical or sexual abuse upon a minor, the court shall report 13that determination to the Illinois State Police, which shall 14include that information in its report to the President of the 15school board for a school district that requests a criminal 16history records check of that person, or the regional 17superintendent of schools who requests a check of that person, 18as required under Section 10-21.9 or 34-18.5 of the School 19Code.20    (2) If, pursuant to subsection (1) of this Section, the 21court determines and puts in writing the factual basis 22supporting the determination that the minor is either abused 23or neglected or dependent, the court shall then set a time not 24later than 30 days after the entry of the finding for a 25dispositional hearing (unless an earlier date is required 26pursuant to Section 2-13.1) to be conducted under Section 2-22   HB3365- 45 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1at which hearing the court shall determine whether it is 2consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 3minor and the public that he be made a ward of the court. To 4assist the court in making this and other determinations at 5the dispositional hearing, the court may order that an 6investigation be conducted and a dispositional report be 7prepared concerning the minor's physical and mental history 8and condition, family situation and background, economic 9status, education, occupation, history of delinquency or 10criminality, personal habits, and any other information that 11may be helpful to the court. The dispositional hearing may be 12continued once for a period not to exceed 30 days if the court 13finds that such continuance is necessary to complete the 14dispositional report.15    (3) The time limits of this Section may be waived only by 16consent of all parties and approval by the court, as 17determined to be consistent with the health, safety and best 18interests of the minor.19    (4) For all cases adjudicated prior to July 1, 1991, for 20which no dispositional hearing has been held prior to that 21date, a dispositional hearing under Section 2-22 shall be held 22within 90 days of July 1, 1991.23    (5) The court may terminate the parental rights of a 24parent at the initial dispositional hearing if all of the 25following conditions are met: 26        (i) the original or amended petition contains a   HB3365- 46 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    request for termination of parental rights and appointment 2    of a guardian with power to consent to adoption; and 3        (ii) the court has found by a preponderance of 4    evidence, introduced or stipulated to at an adjudicatory 5    hearing, that the child comes under the jurisdiction of 6    the court as an abused, neglected, or dependent minor 7    under Section 2-18; and 8        (iii) the court finds, on the basis of clear and 9    convincing evidence admitted at the adjudicatory hearing 10    that the parent is an unfit person under subdivision D of 11    Section 1 of the Adoption Act; and 12        (iv) the court determines in accordance with the rules 13    of evidence for dispositional proceedings, that: 14            (A) it is in the best interest of the minor and 15        public that the child be made a ward of the court; 16            (A-5) reasonable efforts under subsection (l-1) of 17        Section 5 of the Children and Family Services Act are 18        inappropriate or such efforts were made and were 19        unsuccessful; and 20            (B) termination of parental rights and appointment 21        of a guardian with power to consent to adoption is in 22        the best interest of the child pursuant to Section 23        2-29.24(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21.) 25    (705 ILCS 405/2-27)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-27)  HB3365- 47 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    Sec. 2-27. Placement; legal custody or guardianship. 2    (1) If the court determines and puts in writing the 3factual basis supporting the determination of whether a parent 4the parents, guardian, or legal custodian of a minor adjudged 5a ward of the court is are unfit or is are unable, for a reason 6sufficient and independent from financial circumstances or 7domestic violence against a parent, guardian, or custodian who 8experienced domestic violence, for some reason other than 9financial circumstances alone, to care for, protect, train or 10discipline the minor or are unwilling to do so, and that the 11health, safety, and best interest of the minor will be 12jeopardized if the minor remains in the custody of the minor's 13parents, guardian or custodian, the court may at this hearing 14and at any later point:15        (a) place the minor in the custody of a suitable 16    relative or other person as legal custodian or guardian;17        (a-5) with the approval of the Department of Children 18    and Family Services, place the minor in the subsidized 19    guardianship of a suitable relative or other person as 20    legal guardian; "subsidized guardianship" means a private 21    guardianship arrangement for children for whom the 22    permanency goals of return home and adoption have been 23    ruled out and who meet the qualifications for subsidized 24    guardianship as defined by the Department of Children and 25    Family Services in administrative rules;26        (b) place the minor under the guardianship of a   HB3365- 48 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    probation officer;2        (c) commit the minor to an agency for care or 3    placement, except an institution under the authority of 4    the Department of Corrections or of the Department of 5    Children and Family Services;6        (d) on and after the effective date of this amendatory 7    Act of the 98th General Assembly and before January 1, 8    2017, commit the minor to the Department of Children and 9    Family Services for care and service; however, a minor 10    charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 11    1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated 12    delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of or 13    committed to the Department of Children and Family 14    Services by any court, except (i) a minor less than 16 15    years of age and committed to the Department of Children 16    and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act, (ii) 17    a minor under the age of 18 for whom an independent basis 18    of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists, or (iii) a minor 19    for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition to 20    reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 21    2-33 of this Act. On and after January 1, 2017, commit the 22    minor to the Department of Children and Family Services 23    for care and service; however, a minor charged with a 24    criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 25    Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not 26    be placed in the custody of or committed to the Department   HB3365- 49 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    of Children and Family Services by any court, except (i) a 2    minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the 3    Department of Children and Family Services under Section 4    5-710 of this Act, (ii) a minor under the age of 18 for 5    whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 6    exists, or (iii) a minor for whom the court has granted a 7    supplemental petition to reinstate wardship pursuant to 8    subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of this Act. An independent 9    basis exists when the allegations or adjudication of 10    abuse, neglect, or dependency do not arise from the same 11    facts, incident, or circumstances which give rise to a 12    charge or adjudication of delinquency. The Department 13    shall be given due notice of the pendency of the action and 14    the Guardianship Administrator of the Department of 15    Children and Family Services shall be appointed guardian 16    of the person of the minor. Whenever the Department seeks 17    to discharge a minor from its care and service, the 18    Guardianship Administrator shall petition the court for an 19    order terminating guardianship. The Guardianship 20    Administrator may designate one or more other officers of 21    the Department, appointed as Department officers by 22    administrative order of the Department Director, 23    authorized to affix the signature of the Guardianship 24    Administrator to documents affecting the guardian-ward 25    relationship of children for whom the Guardianship 26    Administrator has been appointed guardian at such times as   HB3365- 50 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    the Guardianship Administrator is unable to perform the 2    duties of the Guardianship Administrator office. The 3    signature authorization shall include but not be limited 4    to matters of consent of marriage, enlistment in the armed 5    forces, legal proceedings, adoption, major medical and 6    surgical treatment and application for driver's license. 7    Signature authorizations made pursuant to the provisions 8    of this paragraph shall be filed with the Secretary of 9    State and the Secretary of State shall provide upon 10    payment of the customary fee, certified copies of the 11    authorization to any court or individual who requests a 12    copy.13    (1.5) In making a determination under this Section, the 14court shall also consider whether, based on health, safety, 15and the best interests of the minor,16        (a) appropriate services aimed at family preservation 17    and family reunification have been unsuccessful in 18    rectifying the conditions that have led to a finding of 19    unfitness or inability to care for, protect, train, or 20    discipline the minor, or21        (b) no family preservation or family reunification 22    services would be appropriate,23and if the petition or amended petition contained an 24allegation that the parent is an unfit person as defined in 25subdivision (D) of Section 1 of the Adoption Act, and the order 26of adjudication recites that parental unfitness was   HB3365- 51 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1established by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall, 2when appropriate and in the best interest of the minor, enter 3an order terminating parental rights and appointing a guardian 4with power to consent to adoption in accordance with Section 52-29.6    (1.7) In making a determination under this Section, the 7court shall presume that it is consistent with the health, 8safety, and best interests of the minor to remain in the 9custody of a parent, guardian, or custodian who experienced 10domestic violence, unless the court has determined that the 11parent, guardian, or custodian who experienced domestic 12violence has committed acts or omissions unrelated to domestic 13violence against that parent, guardian, or custodian that is 14sufficient to independently support a determination of abuse 15or neglect under this Act. 16    When making a placement, the court, wherever possible, 17shall require the Department of Children and Family Services 18to select a person holding the same religious belief as that of 19the minor or a private agency controlled by persons of like 20religious faith of the minor and shall require the Department 21to otherwise comply with Section 7 of the Children and Family 22Services Act in placing the child. In addition, whenever 23alternative plans for placement are available, the court shall 24ascertain and consider, to the extent appropriate in the 25particular case, the views and preferences of the minor.26    (2) When a minor is placed with a suitable relative or   HB3365- 52 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1other person pursuant to item (a) of subsection (1), the court 2shall appoint the suitable relative or other person the legal 3custodian or guardian of the person of the minor. When a minor 4is committed to any agency, the court shall appoint the proper 5officer or representative thereof as legal custodian or 6guardian of the person of the minor. Legal custodians and 7guardians of the person of the minor have the respective 8rights and duties set forth in subsection (9) of Section 1-3 9except as otherwise provided by order of court; but no 10guardian of the person may consent to adoption of the minor 11unless that authority is conferred upon the guardian in 12accordance with Section 2-29. An agency whose representative 13is appointed guardian of the person or legal custodian of the 14minor may place the minor in any child care facility, but the 15facility must be licensed under the Child Care Act of 1969 or 16have been approved by the Department of Children and Family 17Services as meeting the standards established for such 18licensing. No agency may place a minor adjudicated under 19Sections 2-3 or 2-4 in a child care facility unless the 20placement is in compliance with the rules and regulations for 21placement under this Section promulgated by the Department of 22Children and Family Services under Section 5 of the Children 23and Family Services Act. Like authority and restrictions shall 24be conferred by the court upon any probation officer who has 25been appointed guardian of the person of a minor.26    (3) No placement by any probation officer or agency whose   HB3365- 53 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1representative is appointed guardian of the person or legal 2custodian of a minor may be made in any out of State child care 3facility unless it complies with the Interstate Compact on the 4Placement of Children. Placement with a parent, however, is 5not subject to that Interstate Compact.6    (4) The clerk of the court shall issue to the legal 7custodian or guardian of the person a certified copy of the 8order of court, as proof of the legal custodian's or 9guardian's authority. No other process is necessary as 10authority for the keeping of the minor.11    (5) Custody or guardianship granted under this Section 12continues until the court otherwise directs, but not after the 13minor reaches the age of 19 years except as set forth in 14Section 2-31, or if the minor was previously committed to the 15Department of Children and Family Services for care and 16service and the court has granted a supplemental petition to 17reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 2-33.18    (6) (Blank).19(Source: P.A. 103-22, eff. 8-8-23.)

If it is consistent with the health, 10safety, and best interests of the minor, the court may also 11prescribe shelter care and order that the minor be kept in a 12suitable place designated by the court or in a shelter care 13facility designated by the Department of Children and Family 14Services or a licensed child welfare agency; however, on and 15after January 1, 2015 (the effective date of Public Act 1698-803) and before January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a 17criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 18Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be 19placed in the custody of or committed to the Department of 20Children and Family Services by any court, except a minor less 21than 16 years of age and committed to the Department of 22Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act 23or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or 24dependency exists; and on and after January 1, 2017, a minor 25charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 261961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent   HB3365- 21 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1shall not be placed in the custody of or committed to the 2Department of Children and Family Services by any court, 3except a minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the 4Department of Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 5of this Act or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, 6neglect, or dependency exists. An independent basis exists 7when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, or 8dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 9circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 10delinquency. 11    In placing the minor, the Department or other agency 12shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply 13with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In 14determining the health, safety, and best interests of the 15minor to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is 16a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety, and 17protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 18that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that the 19minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and must 20further find that reasonable efforts have been made or that, 21consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 22minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to prevent or 23eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from the 24minor's home. The court shall require documentation from the 25Department of Children and Family Services as to the 26reasonable efforts that were made to prevent or eliminate the   HB3365- 22 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1necessity of removal of the minor from the minor's home or the 2reasons why no efforts reasonably could be made to prevent or 3eliminate the necessity of removal. When a minor is placed in 4the home of a relative, the Department of Children and Family 5Services shall complete a preliminary background review of the 6members of the minor's custodian's household in accordance 7with Section 4.3 of the Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days 8of that placement. If the minor is ordered placed in a shelter 9care facility of the Department of Children and Family 10Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall, 11upon request of the appropriate Department or other agency, 12appoint the Department of Children and Family Services 13Guardianship Administrator or other appropriate agency 14executive temporary custodian of the minor and the court may 15enter such other orders related to the temporary custody as it 16deems fit and proper, including the provision of services to 17the minor or the minor's family to ameliorate the causes 18contributing to the finding of probable cause or to the 19finding of the existence of immediate and urgent necessity.20    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 21Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 22temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family 23Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a 24parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends 25and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting 26plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency   HB3365- 23 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 2visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 3have telephone and mail communication with the parents.4    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 5Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 6temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 7the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 8the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 9contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 10after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan 11shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and 12if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 13being made to place them together. If the Department has 14determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 15placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 16sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 17determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 18placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for 19visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 20shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 21child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 22addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 23is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 24sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 25placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 26The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date   HB3365- 24 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 2subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 3Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling 4Contact Support Plan is developed. 5    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 6file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 7and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 8Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 9parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 10reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 11achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, 12request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 13the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 14is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 15refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 16duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 17needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 18Department personnel. Child development principles shall be 19considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 20visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 21take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 22party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 23court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 24reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 25achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 26placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact   HB3365- 25 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 2put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 3and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court 4shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 5to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 6contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 7stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 8to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 9visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 10subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing 11under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from 12granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 13opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 14contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 15subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 16restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 17contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 18plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, 19where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 20is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 21and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 22on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 23viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 24only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 25shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 26amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and   HB3365- 26 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1holidays, of the change of the visitation.2    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 3admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to 4this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 5evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 6the issue is whether the Department has made reasonable 7efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 8is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 9the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 10writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings 11concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the 12protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 13and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that 14reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 15removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 16reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 17of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 18custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be 19furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 20custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 21findings in the case record for the child. The order together 22with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 23entered of record in the court.24    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 25urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 26minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not   HB3365- 27 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 2court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 3protection of the minor.4    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 5Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 6protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 7custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 8cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 9comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 10conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk 11termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure, 12by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 13custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 14custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 15provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 16telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 17relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 18siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall 19advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 20relative to inform the Department if additional information 21regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.22    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor 23described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 24is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 25care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 26ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of   HB3365- 28 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 2entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 3the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 4renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 5or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 6efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 7prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and 8shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's 9attorney and to the last known address of the other person or 10persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the 11nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by 12the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and 13the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a 14notice that the parties will not be entitled to further 15written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this 16case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion 17to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme 18Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and 19the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as 20provided in this Section. The notice for a shelter care 21hearing shall be substantially as follows:22NOTICE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN23OF SHELTER CARE HEARING24        On ................ at ........., before the Honorable 25    ................, (address:) ................., the State 26    of Illinois will present evidence (1) that (name of child   HB3365- 29 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    or children) ....................... are abused, 2    neglected, or dependent for the following reasons:3    .............................................. and (2) 4    whether there is "immediate and urgent necessity" to 5    remove the child or children from the responsible 6    relative.7        YOUR FAILURE TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING MAY RESULT IN 8    PLACEMENT of the child or children in foster care until a 9    trial can be held.

Your signature.22            4. Signature must be notarized.23        The rehearing should be scheduled within 48 hours of 24    your filing this affidavit.25        At the rehearing, your rights are the same as at the   HB3365- 31 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    initial shelter care hearing. The enclosed notice explains 2    those rights.3        At the Shelter Care Hearing, children have the 4    following rights:5            1. To have a guardian ad litem appointed.6            2. To be declared competent as a witness and to 7        present testimony concerning:8                a. Whether they are abused, neglected or 9            dependent.10                b.

To cross examine witnesses for other parties.14            4. To obtain an explanation of any proceedings and 15        orders of the court.16    (4) If the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 17relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor did not 18have actual notice of or was not present at the shelter care 19hearing, the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 20relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor may file 21an affidavit setting forth these facts, and the clerk shall 22set the matter for rehearing not later than 48 hours, 23excluding Sundays and legal holidays, after the filing of the 24affidavit. At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in the 25same manner as upon the original hearing.26    (5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that   HB3365- 32 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1the minor taken into custody is a person described in 2subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or 3detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This 4Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).5    (6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a 6jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners 7in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept 8separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept 9in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant 10to the criminal law.11    (7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer 12within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor 13must immediately be released from custody.14    (8) If neither the parent, guardian, or custodian appears 15within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon 16request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the 17clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later 18than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons 19directed to the parent, guardian, or custodian to appear. At 20the same time the probation department shall prepare a report 21on the minor. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not 22appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order 23prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place 24designated by the Department of Children and Family Services 25or a licensed child welfare agency.26    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section   HB3365- 33 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1any interested party, including the State, the temporary 2custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family 3under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and 4Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their 5representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, 6may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor 7to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the 8following grounds:9        (a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent 10    necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or11        (b) There is a material change in the circumstances of 12    the natural family from which the minor was removed and 13    the child can be cared for at home without endangering the 14    child's health or safety; or15        (c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect 16    or dependency, including a parent, relative, or legal 17    guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the 18    minor; or19        (d) Services provided by the Department of Children 20    and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other 21    service provider have been successful in eliminating the 22    need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for 23    at home without endangering the child's health or safety.24    In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether 25it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 26of the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If   HB3365- 34 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 2custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 3Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 4may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 5arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 6arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 7and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 8protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 9or 2-25.10    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than 1114 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court 12modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 13vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 14appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 15the minor and the minor's family.16    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 17probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 18described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an 19immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 20placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 21be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 22as the abused minor provided:23        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 24    neglect petition pending before the court; and25        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 26    for such other minor.  HB3365- 35 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 2been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 3and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 4shelter care for the other minor.5    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 6apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 7or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 898-61).9    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 10temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may 11file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary 12custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 13for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 14of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 15(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court 16may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 17evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 18the temporary custodian such authority. In making its 19determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 20addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 21subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 22        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents 23    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 24    those efforts;25        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 26    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf   HB3365- 36 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    of the minor;2        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 3    and (b) have been ongoing;4        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 5    family members and the minor;6        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 7    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 8    decision-making on the minor; and9        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.10    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the 11temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the 12requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 13of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 14its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 15this subsection. 16(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 17102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 187-1-24.) 19    (705 ILCS 405/2-18)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-18)20    Sec. 2-18. Evidence. 21    (1) At the adjudicatory hearing, the court shall first 22consider only the question whether the minor is abused, 23neglected or dependent.

All other circumstances of 16the making of the memorandum, record, photograph or x-ray, 17including lack of personal knowledge of the maker, may be 18proved to affect the weight to be accorded such evidence, but 19shall not affect its admissibility.20    (b) Any indicated report filed pursuant to the Abused and 21Neglected Child Reporting Act shall be admissible in evidence.22    (c) Previous statements made by the minor relating to any 23allegations of abuse or neglect shall be admissible in 24evidence.

This subsection (5) shall not apply 7in counties with 2,000,000 or more inhabitants.8    (6) In any hearing under this Act, the court may take 9judicial notice of prior sworn testimony or evidence admitted 10in prior proceedings involving the same minor if (a) the 11parties were either represented by counsel at such prior 12proceedings or the right to counsel was knowingly waived and 13(b) the taking of judicial notice would not result in 14admitting hearsay evidence at a hearing where it would 15otherwise be prohibited.16(Source: P.A. 103-124, eff. 1-1-24.) 17    (705 ILCS 405/2-21)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-21)18    Sec. 2-21. Findings and adjudication. 19    (1) The court shall state for the record the manner in 20which the parties received service of process and shall note 21whether the return or returns of service, postal return 22receipt or receipts for notice by certified mail, or 23certificate or certificates of publication have been filed in 24the court record. The court shall enter any appropriate orders 25of default against any parent who has been properly served in   HB3365- 43 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1any manner and fails to appear.2    No further service of process as defined in Sections 2-15 3and 2-16 is required in any subsequent proceeding for a parent 4who was properly served in any manner, except as required by 5Supreme Court Rule 11.6    The caseworker shall testify about the diligent search 7conducted for the parent.8    After hearing the evidence the court shall determine 9whether or not the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent. 10If it finds that the minor is not such a person, the court 11shall order the petition dismissed and the minor discharged. 12The court's determination of whether the minor is abused, 13neglected, or dependent shall be stated in writing with the 14factual basis supporting that determination.15    If the court finds that the minor is abused, neglected, or 16dependent, the court shall then determine and put in writing 17the factual basis supporting that determination, and specify, 18to the extent possible, the acts or omissions or both of each 19parent, guardian, or legal custodian that form the basis of 20the court's findings. In making such findings, domestic 21violence against a parent, guardian, or custodian even in the 22presence of the minor shall not be construed as the acts or 23omissions of the parent, guardian, or custodian who 24experienced domestic violence and any findings must be based 25upon acts or omissions of that parent, guardian, or custodian 26unrelated to incidents of domestic violence against the   HB3365- 44 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1parent, guardian, or custodian that are sufficient to 2independently support a determination of abuse or neglect 3under this Act. That finding shall appear in the order of the 4court.5    If the court finds that the child has been abused, 6neglected or dependent, the court shall admonish the parents 7that they must cooperate with the Department of Children and 8Family Services, comply with the terms of the service plan, 9and correct the conditions that require the child to be in 10care, or risk termination of parental rights.11    If the court determines that a person has inflicted 12physical or sexual abuse upon a minor, the court shall report 13that determination to the Illinois State Police, which shall 14include that information in its report to the President of the 15school board for a school district that requests a criminal 16history records check of that person, or the regional 17superintendent of schools who requests a check of that person, 18as required under Section 10-21.9 or 34-18.5 of the School 19Code.20    (2) If, pursuant to subsection (1) of this Section, the 21court determines and puts in writing the factual basis 22supporting the determination that the minor is either abused 23or neglected or dependent, the court shall then set a time not 24later than 30 days after the entry of the finding for a 25dispositional hearing (unless an earlier date is required 26pursuant to Section 2-13.1) to be conducted under Section 2-22   HB3365- 45 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1at which hearing the court shall determine whether it is 2consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 3minor and the public that he be made a ward of the court. To 4assist the court in making this and other determinations at 5the dispositional hearing, the court may order that an 6investigation be conducted and a dispositional report be 7prepared concerning the minor's physical and mental history 8and condition, family situation and background, economic 9status, education, occupation, history of delinquency or 10criminality, personal habits, and any other information that 11may be helpful to the court. The dispositional hearing may be 12continued once for a period not to exceed 30 days if the court 13finds that such continuance is necessary to complete the 14dispositional report.15    (3) The time limits of this Section may be waived only by 16consent of all parties and approval by the court, as 17determined to be consistent with the health, safety and best 18interests of the minor.19    (4) For all cases adjudicated prior to July 1, 1991, for 20which no dispositional hearing has been held prior to that 21date, a dispositional hearing under Section 2-22 shall be held 22within 90 days of July 1, 1991.23    (5) The court may terminate the parental rights of a 24parent at the initial dispositional hearing if all of the 25following conditions are met: 26        (i) the original or amended petition contains a   HB3365- 46 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    request for termination of parental rights and appointment 2    of a guardian with power to consent to adoption; and 3        (ii) the court has found by a preponderance of 4    evidence, introduced or stipulated to at an adjudicatory 5    hearing, that the child comes under the jurisdiction of 6    the court as an abused, neglected, or dependent minor 7    under Section 2-18; and 8        (iii) the court finds, on the basis of clear and 9    convincing evidence admitted at the adjudicatory hearing 10    that the parent is an unfit person under subdivision D of 11    Section 1 of the Adoption Act; and 12        (iv) the court determines in accordance with the rules 13    of evidence for dispositional proceedings, that: 14            (A) it is in the best interest of the minor and 15        public that the child be made a ward of the court; 16            (A-5) reasonable efforts under subsection (l-1) of 17        Section 5 of the Children and Family Services Act are 18        inappropriate or such efforts were made and were 19        unsuccessful; and 20            (B) termination of parental rights and appointment 21        of a guardian with power to consent to adoption is in 22        the best interest of the child pursuant to Section 23        2-29.24(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21.) 25    (705 ILCS 405/2-27)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-27)  HB3365- 47 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    Sec. 2-27. Placement; legal custody or guardianship. 2    (1) If the court determines and puts in writing the 3factual basis supporting the determination of whether a parent 4the parents, guardian, or legal custodian of a minor adjudged 5a ward of the court is are unfit or is are unable, for a reason 6sufficient and independent from financial circumstances or 7domestic violence against a parent, guardian, or custodian who 8experienced domestic violence, for some reason other than 9financial circumstances alone, to care for, protect, train or 10discipline the minor or are unwilling to do so, and that the 11health, safety, and best interest of the minor will be 12jeopardized if the minor remains in the custody of the minor's 13parents, guardian or custodian, the court may at this hearing 14and at any later point:15        (a) place the minor in the custody of a suitable 16    relative or other person as legal custodian or guardian;17        (a-5) with the approval of the Department of Children 18    and Family Services, place the minor in the subsidized 19    guardianship of a suitable relative or other person as 20    legal guardian; "subsidized guardianship" means a private 21    guardianship arrangement for children for whom the 22    permanency goals of return home and adoption have been 23    ruled out and who meet the qualifications for subsidized 24    guardianship as defined by the Department of Children and 25    Family Services in administrative rules;26        (b) place the minor under the guardianship of a   HB3365- 48 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    probation officer;2        (c) commit the minor to an agency for care or 3    placement, except an institution under the authority of 4    the Department of Corrections or of the Department of 5    Children and Family Services;6        (d) on and after the effective date of this amendatory 7    Act of the 98th General Assembly and before January 1, 8    2017, commit the minor to the Department of Children and 9    Family Services for care and service; however, a minor 10    charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 11    1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated 12    delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of or 13    committed to the Department of Children and Family 14    Services by any court, except (i) a minor less than 16 15    years of age and committed to the Department of Children 16    and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act, (ii) 17    a minor under the age of 18 for whom an independent basis 18    of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists, or (iii) a minor 19    for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition to 20    reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 21    2-33 of this Act. On and after January 1, 2017, commit the 22    minor to the Department of Children and Family Services 23    for care and service; however, a minor charged with a 24    criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 25    Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not 26    be placed in the custody of or committed to the Department   HB3365- 49 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    of Children and Family Services by any court, except (i) a 2    minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the 3    Department of Children and Family Services under Section 4    5-710 of this Act, (ii) a minor under the age of 18 for 5    whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 6    exists, or (iii) a minor for whom the court has granted a 7    supplemental petition to reinstate wardship pursuant to 8    subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of this Act. An independent 9    basis exists when the allegations or adjudication of 10    abuse, neglect, or dependency do not arise from the same 11    facts, incident, or circumstances which give rise to a 12    charge or adjudication of delinquency. The Department 13    shall be given due notice of the pendency of the action and 14    the Guardianship Administrator of the Department of 15    Children and Family Services shall be appointed guardian 16    of the person of the minor. Whenever the Department seeks 17    to discharge a minor from its care and service, the 18    Guardianship Administrator shall petition the court for an 19    order terminating guardianship. The Guardianship 20    Administrator may designate one or more other officers of 21    the Department, appointed as Department officers by 22    administrative order of the Department Director, 23    authorized to affix the signature of the Guardianship 24    Administrator to documents affecting the guardian-ward 25    relationship of children for whom the Guardianship 26    Administrator has been appointed guardian at such times as   HB3365- 50 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1    the Guardianship Administrator is unable to perform the 2    duties of the Guardianship Administrator office. The 3    signature authorization shall include but not be limited 4    to matters of consent of marriage, enlistment in the armed 5    forces, legal proceedings, adoption, major medical and 6    surgical treatment and application for driver's license. 7    Signature authorizations made pursuant to the provisions 8    of this paragraph shall be filed with the Secretary of 9    State and the Secretary of State shall provide upon 10    payment of the customary fee, certified copies of the 11    authorization to any court or individual who requests a 12    copy.13    (1.5) In making a determination under this Section, the 14court shall also consider whether, based on health, safety, 15and the best interests of the minor,16        (a) appropriate services aimed at family preservation 17    and family reunification have been unsuccessful in 18    rectifying the conditions that have led to a finding of 19    unfitness or inability to care for, protect, train, or 20    discipline the minor, or21        (b) no family preservation or family reunification 22    services would be appropriate,23and if the petition or amended petition contained an 24allegation that the parent is an unfit person as defined in 25subdivision (D) of Section 1 of the Adoption Act, and the order 26of adjudication recites that parental unfitness was   HB3365- 51 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1established by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall, 2when appropriate and in the best interest of the minor, enter 3an order terminating parental rights and appointing a guardian 4with power to consent to adoption in accordance with Section 52-29.6    (1.7) In making a determination under this Section, the 7court shall presume that it is consistent with the health, 8safety, and best interests of the minor to remain in the 9custody of a parent, guardian, or custodian who experienced 10domestic violence, unless the court has determined that the 11parent, guardian, or custodian who experienced domestic 12violence has committed acts or omissions unrelated to domestic 13violence against that parent, guardian, or custodian that is 14sufficient to independently support a determination of abuse 15or neglect under this Act. 16    When making a placement, the court, wherever possible, 17shall require the Department of Children and Family Services 18to select a person holding the same religious belief as that of 19the minor or a private agency controlled by persons of like 20religious faith of the minor and shall require the Department 21to otherwise comply with Section 7 of the Children and Family 22Services Act in placing the child. In addition, whenever 23alternative plans for placement are available, the court shall 24ascertain and consider, to the extent appropriate in the 25particular case, the views and preferences of the minor.26    (2) When a minor is placed with a suitable relative or   HB3365- 52 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1other person pursuant to item (a) of subsection (1), the court 2shall appoint the suitable relative or other person the legal 3custodian or guardian of the person of the minor. When a minor 4is committed to any agency, the court shall appoint the proper 5officer or representative thereof as legal custodian or 6guardian of the person of the minor. Legal custodians and 7guardians of the person of the minor have the respective 8rights and duties set forth in subsection (9) of Section 1-3 9except as otherwise provided by order of court; but no 10guardian of the person may consent to adoption of the minor 11unless that authority is conferred upon the guardian in 12accordance with Section 2-29. An agency whose representative 13is appointed guardian of the person or legal custodian of the 14minor may place the minor in any child care facility, but the 15facility must be licensed under the Child Care Act of 1969 or 16have been approved by the Department of Children and Family 17Services as meeting the standards established for such 18licensing. No agency may place a minor adjudicated under 19Sections 2-3 or 2-4 in a child care facility unless the 20placement is in compliance with the rules and regulations for 21placement under this Section promulgated by the Department of 22Children and Family Services under Section 5 of the Children 23and Family Services Act. Like authority and restrictions shall 24be conferred by the court upon any probation officer who has 25been appointed guardian of the person of a minor.26    (3) No placement by any probation officer or agency whose   HB3365- 53 -LRB104 10403 RLC 20478 b1representative is appointed guardian of the person or legal 2custodian of a minor may be made in any out of State child care 3facility unless it complies with the Interstate Compact on the 4Placement of Children. Placement with a parent, however, is 5not subject to that Interstate Compact.6    (4) The clerk of the court shall issue to the legal 7custodian or guardian of the person a certified copy of the 8order of court, as proof of the legal custodian's or 9guardian's authority. No other process is necessary as 10authority for the keeping of the minor.11    (5) Custody or guardianship granted under this Section 12continues until the court otherwise directs, but not after the 13minor reaches the age of 19 years except as set forth in 14Section 2-31, or if the minor was previously committed to the 15Department of Children and Family Services for care and 16service and the court has granted a supplemental petition to 17reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 2-33.18    (6) (Blank).19(Source: P.A. 103-22, eff. 8-8-23.)
