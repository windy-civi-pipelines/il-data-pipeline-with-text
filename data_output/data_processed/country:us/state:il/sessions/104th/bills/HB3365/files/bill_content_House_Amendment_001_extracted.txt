Temporary custody hearing. At the appearance of 18the minor before the court at the temporary custody hearing, 19all witnesses present shall be examined before the court in 20relation to any matter connected with the allegations made in 21the petition.22    (1) If the court finds that there is not probable cause to 23believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent it 24shall release the minor and dismiss the petition.25    (2) If the court finds that there is probable cause to   10400HB3365ham001- 28 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent, the 2court shall state in writing the factual basis supporting its 3finding and the minor, the minor's parent, guardian, or 4custodian, and other persons able to give relevant testimony 5shall be examined before the court. The Department of Children 6and Family Services shall give testimony concerning indicated 7reports of abuse and neglect, of which they are aware through 8the central registry, involving the minor's parent, guardian, 9or custodian. After such testimony, the court may, consistent 10with the health, safety, and best interests of the minor, 11enter an order that the minor shall be released upon the 12request of parent, guardian, or custodian if the parent, 13guardian, or custodian appears to take custody. If it is 14determined that a parent's, guardian's, or custodian's 15compliance with critical services mitigates the necessity for 16removal of the minor from the minor's home, the court may enter 17an Order of Protection setting forth reasonable conditions of 18behavior that a parent, guardian, or custodian must observe 19for a specified period of time, not to exceed 12 months, 20without a violation; provided, however, that the 12-month 21period shall begin anew after any violation. "Custodian" 22includes the Department of Children and Family Services, if it 23has been given custody of the child, or any other agency of the 24State which has been given custody or wardship of the child. If 25it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 26of the minor, the court may also prescribe shelter care and   10400HB3365ham001- 29 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1order that the minor be kept in a suitable place designated by 2the court or in a shelter care facility designated by the 3Department of Children and Family Services or a licensed child 4welfare agency; however, on and after January 1, 2015 (the 5effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 62017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 7Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 8adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 9or committed to the Department of Children and Family Services 10by any court, except a minor less than 16 years of age and 11committed to the Department of Children and Family Services 12under Section 5-710 of this Act or a minor for whom an 13independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists; and 14on and after January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a criminal 15offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 162012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the 17custody of or committed to the Department of Children and 18Family Services by any court, except a minor less than 15 years 19of age and committed to the Department of Children and Family 20Services under Section 5-710 of this Act or a minor for whom an 21independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists. An 22independent basis exists when the allegations or adjudication 23of abuse, neglect, or dependency do not arise from the same 24facts, incident, or circumstances which give rise to a charge 25or adjudication of delinquency. 26    In placing the minor, the Department or other agency   10400HB3365ham001- 30 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply 2with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In 3determining the health, safety, and best interests of the 4minor to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is 5a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety, and 6protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 7that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that the 8minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and must 9further find that reasonable efforts have been made or that, 10consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 11minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to prevent or 12eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from the 13minor's home. The court shall require documentation from the 14Department of Children and Family Services as to the 15reasonable efforts that were made to prevent or eliminate the 16necessity of removal of the minor from the minor's home or the 17reasons why no efforts reasonably could be made to prevent or 18eliminate the necessity of removal. When a minor is placed in 19the home of a relative, the Department of Children and Family 20Services shall complete a preliminary background review of the 21members of the minor's custodian's household in accordance 22with Section 4.3 of the Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days 23of that placement. If the minor is ordered placed in a shelter 24care facility of the Department of Children and Family 25Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall, 26upon request of the appropriate Department or other agency,   10400HB3365ham001- 31 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1appoint the Department of Children and Family Services 2Guardianship Administrator or other appropriate agency 3executive temporary custodian of the minor and the court may 4enter such other orders related to the temporary custody as it 5deems fit and proper, including the provision of services to 6the minor or the minor's family to ameliorate the causes 7contributing to the finding of probable cause or to the 8finding of the existence of immediate and urgent necessity.9    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 10Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 11temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family 12Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a 13parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends 14and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting 15plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency 16of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 17visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 18have telephone and mail communication with the parents.19    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 20Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 21temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 22the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 23the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 24contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 25after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan 26shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and   10400HB3365ham001- 32 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 2being made to place them together. If the Department has 3determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 4placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 5sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 6determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 7placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for 8visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 9shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 10child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 11addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 12is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 13sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 14placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 15The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date 16for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 17subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 18Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling 19Contact Support Plan is developed. 20    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 21file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 22and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 23Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 24parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 25reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 26achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion,   10400HB3365ham001- 33 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 2the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 3is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 4refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 5duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 6needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 7Department personnel. Child development principles shall be 8considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 9visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 10take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 11party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 12court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 13reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 14achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 15placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact 16are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 17put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 18and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court 19shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 20to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 21contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 22stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 23to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 24visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 25subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing 26under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from   10400HB3365ham001- 34 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 2opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 3contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 4subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 5restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 6contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 7plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, 8where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 9is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 10and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 11on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 12viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 13only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 14shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 15amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and 16holidays, of the change of the visitation.17    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 18admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to 19this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 20evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 21the issue is whether the Department has made reasonable 22efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 23is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 24the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 25writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings 26concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the   10400HB3365ham001- 35 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 2and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that 3reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 4removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 5reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 6of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 7custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be 8furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 9custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 10findings in the case record for the child. The order together 11with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 12entered of record in the court.13    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 14urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 15minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not 16be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 17court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 18protection of the minor.19    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 20Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 21protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 22custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 23cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 24comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 25conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk 26termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure,   10400HB3365ham001- 36 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 2custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 3custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 4provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 5telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 6relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 7siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall 8advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 9relative to inform the Department if additional information 10regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.11    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor 12described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 13is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 14care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 15ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of 16issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 17entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 18the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 19renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 20or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 21efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 22prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and 23shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's 24attorney and to the last known address of the other person or 25persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the 26nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by   10400HB3365ham001- 37 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and 2the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a 3notice that the parties will not be entitled to further 4written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this 5case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion 6to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme 7Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and 8the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as 9provided in this Section. The notice for a shelter care 10hearing shall be substantially as follows:11NOTICE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN12OF SHELTER CARE HEARING13        On ................ at ........., before the Honorable 14    ................, (address:) ................., the State 15    of Illinois will present evidence (1) that (name of child 16    or children) ....................... are abused, 17    neglected, or dependent for the following reasons:18    .............................................. and (2) 19    whether there is "immediate and urgent necessity" to 20    remove the child or children from the responsible 21    relative.22        YOUR FAILURE TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING MAY RESULT IN 23    PLACEMENT of the child or children in foster care until a 24    trial can be held.

To cross examine witnesses for other parties.3            4. To obtain an explanation of any proceedings and 4        orders of the court.5    (4) If the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 6relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor did not 7have actual notice of or was not present at the shelter care 8hearing, the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 9relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor may file 10an affidavit setting forth these facts, and the clerk shall 11set the matter for rehearing not later than 48 hours, 12excluding Sundays and legal holidays, after the filing of the 13affidavit. At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in the 14same manner as upon the original hearing.15    (5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that 16the minor taken into custody is a person described in 17subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or 18detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This 19Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).20    (6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a 21jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners 22in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept 23separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept 24in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant 25to the criminal law.26    (7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer   10400HB3365ham001- 41 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor 2must immediately be released from custody.3    (8) If neither the parent, guardian, or custodian appears 4within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon 5request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the 6clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later 7than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons 8directed to the parent, guardian, or custodian to appear. At 9the same time the probation department shall prepare a report 10on the minor. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not 11appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order 12prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place 13designated by the Department of Children and Family Services 14or a licensed child welfare agency.15    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 16any interested party, including the State, the temporary 17custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family 18under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and 19Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their 20representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, 21may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor 22to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the 23following grounds:24        (a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent 25    necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or26        (b) There is a material change in the circumstances of   10400HB3365ham001- 42 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    the natural family from which the minor was removed and 2    the child can be cared for at home without endangering the 3    child's health or safety; or4        (c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect 5    or dependency, including a parent, relative, or legal 6    guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the 7    minor; or8        (d) Services provided by the Department of Children 9    and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other 10    service provider have been successful in eliminating the 11    need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for 12    at home without endangering the child's health or safety.13    In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether 14it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 15of the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If 16the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 17custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 18Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 19may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 20arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 21arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 22and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 23protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 24or 2-25.25    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than 2614 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court   10400HB3365ham001- 43 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 2vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 3appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 4the minor and the minor's family.5    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 6probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 7described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an 8immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 9placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 10be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 11as the abused minor provided:12        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 13    neglect petition pending before the court; and14        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 15    for such other minor.16    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 17been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 18and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 19shelter care for the other minor.20    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 21apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 22or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 2398-61).24    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 25temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may 26file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary   10400HB3365ham001- 44 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 2for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 3of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 4(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court 5may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 6evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 7the temporary custodian such authority. In making its 8determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 9addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 10subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 11        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents 12    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 13    those efforts;14        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 15    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf 16    of the minor;17        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 18    and (b) have been ongoing;19        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 20    family members and the minor;21        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 22    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 23    decision-making on the minor; and24        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.25    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the 26temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the   10400HB3365ham001- 45 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 2of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 3its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 4this subsection. 5(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 6102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 77-1-24.) 8    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 103-1061)9    Sec. 2-10. Temporary custody hearing. At the appearance of 10the minor before the court at the temporary custody hearing, 11all witnesses present shall be examined before the court in 12relation to any matter connected with the allegations made in 13the petition.14    (1) If the court finds that there is not probable cause to 15believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent it 16shall release the minor and dismiss the petition.17    (2) If the court finds that there is probable cause to 18believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent, the 19court shall state in writing the factual basis supporting its 20finding and the minor, the minor's parent, guardian, or 21custodian, and other persons able to give relevant testimony 22shall be examined before the court. Findings of probable cause 23must be based on reasons sufficient and independent from 24exposure to domestic violence that is perpetrated against 25someone other than the minor where there is no demonstrated   10400HB3365ham001- 46 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1likelihood of imminent bodily harm to the minor. The 2Department of Children and Family Services shall give 3testimony concerning indicated reports of abuse and neglect, 4of which they are aware through the central registry, 5involving the minor's parent, guardian, or custodian. After 6such testimony, the court may, consistent with the health, 7safety, and best interests of the minor, enter an order that 8the minor shall be released upon the request of parent, 9guardian, or custodian if the parent, guardian, or custodian 10appears to take custody. If it is determined that a parent's, 11guardian's, or custodian's compliance with critical services 12mitigates the necessity for removal of the minor from the 13minor's home, the court may enter an Order of Protection 14setting forth reasonable conditions of behavior that a parent, 15guardian, or custodian must observe for a specified period of 16time, not to exceed 12 months, without a violation; provided, 17however, that the 12-month period shall begin anew after any 18violation. "Custodian" includes the Department of Children and 19Family Services, if it has been given custody of the child, or 20any other agency of the State which has been given custody or 21wardship of the child. If it is consistent with the health, 22safety, and best interests of the minor, the court may also 23prescribe shelter care and order that the minor be kept in a 24suitable place designated by the court or in a shelter care 25facility designated by the Department of Children and Family 26Services or a licensed child welfare agency; however, on and   10400HB3365ham001- 47 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1after January 1, 2015 (the effective date of Public Act 298-803) and before January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a 3criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 4Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be 5placed in the custody of or committed to the Department of 6Children and Family Services by any court, except a minor less 7than 16 years of age and committed to the Department of 8Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act 9or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or 10dependency exists; and on and after January 1, 2017, a minor 11charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 121961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent 13shall not be placed in the custody of or committed to the 14Department of Children and Family Services by any court, 15except a minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the 16Department of Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 17of this Act or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, 18neglect, or dependency exists. An independent basis exists 19when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, or 20dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 21circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 22delinquency. 23    In placing the minor, the Department or other agency 24shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply 25with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In 26determining the health, safety, and best interests of the   10400HB3365ham001- 48 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1minor to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is 2a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety, and 3protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 4that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that the 5minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and must 6further find that reasonable efforts have been made or that, 7consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 8minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to prevent or 9eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from the 10minor's home. Domestic violence that is perpetrated against 11someone other than the minor where there is no demonstrated 12likelihood of present and imminent bodily harm to the minor is 13not sufficient to determine that an urgent and immediate 14necessity exists to remove a minor from a parent who is not the 15perpetrator of that domestic violence. The court shall require 16documentation from the Department of Children and Family 17Services as to the reasonable efforts that were made to 18prevent or eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor 19from the minor's home or the reasons why no efforts reasonably 20could be made to prevent or eliminate the necessity of 21removal. When a minor is placed in the home of a relative, the 22Department of Children and Family Services shall complete a 23preliminary background review of the members of the minor's 24custodian's household in accordance with Section 3.4 or 4.3 of 25the Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days of that placement. If 26the minor is not placed in the home of a relative, the court   10400HB3365ham001- 49 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1shall require evidence from the Department as to the efforts 2that were made to place the minor in the home of a relative or 3the reasons why no efforts reasonably could be made to place 4the minor in the home of a relative, consistent with the best 5interests of the minor. If the minor is ordered placed in a 6shelter care facility of the Department of Children and Family 7Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall, 8upon request of the appropriate Department or other agency, 9appoint the Department of Children and Family Services 10Guardianship Administrator or other appropriate agency 11executive temporary custodian of the minor and the court may 12enter such other orders related to the temporary custody as it 13deems fit and proper, including the provision of services to 14the minor or the minor's family to ameliorate the causes 15contributing to the finding of probable cause or to the 16finding of the existence of immediate and urgent necessity.17    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 18Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 19temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family 20Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a 21parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends 22and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting 23plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency 24of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 25visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 26have telephone and mail communication with the parents.  10400HB3365ham001- 50 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 2Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 3temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 4the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 5the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 6contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 7after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan 8shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and 9if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 10being made to place them together. If the Department has 11determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 12placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 13sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 14determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 15placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for 16visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 17shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 18child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 19addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 20is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 21sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 22placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 23The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date 24for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 25subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 26Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling   10400HB3365ham001- 51 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1Contact Support Plan is developed. 2    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 3file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 4and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 5Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 6parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 7reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 8achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, 9request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 10the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 11is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 12refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 13duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 14needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 15Department personnel. Child development principles shall be 16considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 17visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 18take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 19party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 20court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 21reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 22achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 23placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact 24are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 25put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 26and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court   10400HB3365ham001- 52 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 2to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 3contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 4stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 5to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 6visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 7subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing 8under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from 9granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 10opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 11contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 12subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 13restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 14contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 15plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, 16where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 17is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 18and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 19on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 20viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 21only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 22shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 23amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and 24holidays, of the change of the visitation.25    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 26admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to   10400HB3365ham001- 53 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 2evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 3the issue is whether the Department has made reasonable 4efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 5is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 6the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 7writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings 8concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the 9protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 10and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that 11reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 12removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 13reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 14of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 15custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be 16furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 17custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 18findings in the case record for the child. The order together 19with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 20entered of record in the court.21    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 22urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 23minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not 24be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 25court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 26protection of the minor.  10400HB3365ham001- 54 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 2Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 3protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 4custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 5cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 6comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 7conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk 8termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure, 9by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 10custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 11custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 12provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 13telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 14relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 15siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall 16advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 17relative to inform the Department if additional information 18regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.19    (2.5) When the court places the minor in the temporary 20custody of the Department, the court shall inquire of the 21Department's initial family finding and relative engagement 22efforts, as described in Section 7 of the Children and Family 23Services Act, and the Department shall complete any remaining 24family finding and relative engagement efforts required under 25Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act within 30 26days of the minor being taken into temporary custody. The   10400HB3365ham001- 55 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1Department shall complete new family finding and relative 2engagement efforts in accordance with Section 7 of the 3Children and Family Services Act for relatives of the minor 4within 30 days of an unknown parent's identity being 5determined or a parent whose whereabouts were unknown being 6located. 7    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor 8described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 9is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 10care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 11ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of 12issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 13entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 14the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 15renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 16or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 17efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 18prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and 19shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's 20attorney and to the last known address of the other person or 21persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the 22nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by 23the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and 24the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a 25notice that the parties will not be entitled to further 26written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this   10400HB3365ham001- 56 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion 2to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme 3Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and 4the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as 5provided in this Section.

At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in the 10same manner as upon the original hearing.11    (5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that 12the minor taken into custody is a person described in 13subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or 14detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This 15Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).16    (6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a 17jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners 18in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept 19separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept 20in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant 21to the criminal law.22    (7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer 23within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor 24must immediately be released from custody.25    (8) If neither the parent, guardian, or custodian appears 26within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon   10400HB3365ham001- 60 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the 2clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later 3than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons 4directed to the parent, guardian, or custodian to appear. At 5the same time the probation department shall prepare a report 6on the minor. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not 7appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order 8prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place 9designated by the Department of Children and Family Services 10or a licensed child welfare agency.11    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 12any interested party, including the State, the temporary 13custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family 14under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and 15Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their 16representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, 17may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor 18to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the 19following grounds:20        (a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent 21    necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or22        (b) There is a material change in the circumstances of 23    the natural family from which the minor was removed and 24    the child can be cared for at home without endangering the 25    child's health or safety; or26        (c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect   10400HB3365ham001- 61 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    or dependency, including a parent, relative, or legal 2    guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the 3    minor; or4        (d) Services provided by the Department of Children 5    and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other 6    service provider have been successful in eliminating the 7    need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for 8    at home without endangering the child's health or safety.9    In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether 10it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 11of the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If 12the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 13custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 14Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 15may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 16arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 17arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 18and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 19protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 20or 2-25.21    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than 2214 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court 23modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 24vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 25appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 26the minor and the minor's family.  10400HB3365ham001- 62 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 2probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 3described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an 4immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 5placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 6be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 7as the abused minor provided:8        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 9    neglect petition pending before the court; and10        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 11    for such other minor.12    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 13been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 14and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 15shelter care for the other minor.16    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 17apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 18or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1998-61).20    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 21temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may 22file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary 23custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 24for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 25of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 26(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court   10400HB3365ham001- 63 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 2evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 3the temporary custodian such authority. In making its 4determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 5addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 6subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 7        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents 8    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 9    those efforts;10        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 11    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf 12    of the minor;13        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 14    and (b) have been ongoing;15        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 16    family members and the minor;17        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 18    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 19    decision-making on the minor; and20        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.21    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the 22temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the 23requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 24of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 25its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 26this subsection.   10400HB3365ham001- 64 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 2102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 37-1-24; 103-1061, eff. 7-1-25.) 4    (705 ILCS 405/2-21)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-21)5    Sec. 2-21. Findings and adjudication. 6    (1) The court shall state for the record the manner in 7which the parties received service of process and shall note 8whether the return or returns of service, postal return 9receipt or receipts for notice by certified mail, or 10certificate or certificates of publication have been filed in 11the court record. The court shall enter any appropriate orders 12of default against any parent who has been properly served in 13any manner and fails to appear.14    No further service of process as defined in Sections 2-15 15and 2-16 is required in any subsequent proceeding for a parent 16who was properly served in any manner, except as required by 17Supreme Court Rule 11.18    The caseworker shall testify about the diligent search 19conducted for the parent.20    After hearing the evidence the court shall determine 21whether or not the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent. 22If it finds that the minor is not such a person, the court 23shall order the petition dismissed and the minor discharged. 24The court's determination of whether the minor is abused, 25neglected, or dependent shall be stated in writing with the   10400HB3365ham001- 65 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1factual basis supporting that determination.2    If the court finds that the minor is abused, neglected, or 3dependent, the court shall then determine and put in writing 4the factual basis supporting that determination, and specify, 5to the extent possible, the acts or omissions or both of each 6parent, guardian, or legal custodian that form the basis of 7the court's findings. In making such findings, the factual 8basis supporting a determination that the child has been 9abused, neglected, or dependent must be sufficient and 10independent of exposure to domestic violence that is 11perpetrated against someone other than the child where there 12is no demonstrated likelihood of imminent bodily harm to the 13child. That finding shall appear in the order of the court.14    If the court finds that the child has been abused, 15neglected or dependent, the court shall admonish the parents 16that they must cooperate with the Department of Children and 17Family Services, comply with the terms of the service plan, 18and correct the conditions that require the child to be in 19care, or risk termination of parental rights.20    If the court determines that a person has inflicted 21physical or sexual abuse upon a minor, the court shall report 22that determination to the Illinois State Police, which shall 23include that information in its report to the President of the 24school board for a school district that requests a criminal 25history records check of that person, or the regional 26superintendent of schools who requests a check of that person,   10400HB3365ham001- 66 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1as required under Section 10-21.9 or 34-18.5 of the School 2Code.3    (2) If, pursuant to subsection (1) of this Section, the 4court determines and puts in writing the factual basis 5supporting the determination that the minor is either abused 6or neglected or dependent, the court shall then set a time not 7later than 30 days after the entry of the finding for a 8dispositional hearing (unless an earlier date is required 9pursuant to Section 2-13.1) to be conducted under Section 2-22 10at which hearing the court shall determine whether it is 11consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 12minor and the public that the minor be made a ward of the 13court. To assist the court in making this and other 14determinations at the dispositional hearing, the court may 15order that an investigation be conducted and a dispositional 16report be prepared concerning the minor's physical and mental 17history and condition, family situation and background, 18economic status, education, occupation, history of delinquency 19or criminality, personal habits, and any other information 20that may be helpful to the court. The dispositional hearing 21may be continued once for a period not to exceed 30 days if the 22court finds that such continuance is necessary to complete the 23dispositional report.24    (3) The time limits of this Section may be waived only by 25consent of all parties and approval by the court, as 26determined to be consistent with the health, safety and best   10400HB3365ham001- 67 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1interests of the minor.2    (4) For all cases adjudicated prior to July 1, 1991, for 3which no dispositional hearing has been held prior to that 4date, a dispositional hearing under Section 2-22 shall be held 5within 90 days of July 1, 1991.6    (5) The court may terminate the parental rights of a 7parent at the initial dispositional hearing if all of the 8following conditions are met: 9        (i) the original or amended petition contains a 10    request for termination of parental rights and appointment 11    of a guardian with power to consent to adoption; and 12        (ii) the court has found by a preponderance of 13    evidence, introduced or stipulated to at an adjudicatory 14    hearing, that the child comes under the jurisdiction of 15    the court as an abused, neglected, or dependent minor 16    under Section 2-18; and 17        (iii) the court finds, on the basis of clear and 18    convincing evidence admitted at the adjudicatory hearing 19    that the parent is an unfit person under subdivision D of 20    Section 1 of the Adoption Act; and 21        (iv) the court determines in accordance with the rules 22    of evidence for dispositional proceedings, that: 23            (A) it is in the best interest of the minor and 24        public that the child be made a ward of the court;25            (A-1) the petitioner has demonstrated that the 26        Department has discussed the permanency options of   10400HB3365ham001- 68 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1        guardianship and adoption with the caregiver and the 2        Department has informed the court of the caregiver's 3        wishes as to the permanency goal; 4            (A-5) reasonable efforts under subsection (l-1) of 5        Section 5 of the Children and Family Services Act are 6        inappropriate or such efforts were made and were 7        unsuccessful; and 8            (B) termination of parental rights and appointment 9        of a guardian with power to consent to adoption is in 10        the best interest of the child pursuant to Section 11        2-29.12(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 103-1061, eff. 2-5-25.) 13    (705 ILCS 405/2-27)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-27)14    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 103-1061)15    Sec. 2-27. Placement; legal custody or guardianship. 16    (1) If the court determines and puts in writing the 17factual basis supporting the determination of whether the 18parents, guardian, or legal custodian of a minor adjudged a 19ward of the court are unfit or are unable, for some reason 20other than financial circumstances alone, to care for, 21protect, train or discipline the minor or are unwilling to do 22so, and that the health, safety, and best interest of the minor 23will be jeopardized if the minor remains in the custody of the 24minor's parents, guardian or custodian, the court may at this 25hearing and at any later point:  10400HB3365ham001- 69 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1        (a) place the minor in the custody of a suitable 2    relative or other person as legal custodian or guardian;3        (a-5) with the approval of the Department of Children 4    and Family Services, place the minor in the subsidized 5    guardianship of a suitable relative or other person as 6    legal guardian; "subsidized guardianship" means a private 7    guardianship arrangement for children for whom the 8    permanency goals of return home and adoption have been 9    ruled out and who meet the qualifications for subsidized 10    guardianship as defined by the Department of Children and 11    Family Services in administrative rules;12        (b) place the minor under the guardianship of a 13    probation officer;14        (c) commit the minor to an agency for care or 15    placement, except an institution under the authority of 16    the Department of Corrections or of the Department of 17    Children and Family Services;18        (d) on and after the effective date of this amendatory 19    Act of the 98th General Assembly and before January 1, 20    2017, commit the minor to the Department of Children and 21    Family Services for care and service; however, a minor 22    charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 23    1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated 24    delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of or 25    committed to the Department of Children and Family 26    Services by any court, except (i) a minor less than 16   10400HB3365ham001- 70 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    years of age and committed to the Department of Children 2    and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act, (ii) 3    a minor under the age of 18 for whom an independent basis 4    of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists, or (iii) a minor 5    for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition to 6    reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 7    2-33 of this Act. On and after January 1, 2017, commit the 8    minor to the Department of Children and Family Services 9    for care and service; however, a minor charged with a 10    criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 11    Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not 12    be placed in the custody of or committed to the Department 13    of Children and Family Services by any court, except (i) a 14    minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the 15    Department of Children and Family Services under Section 16    5-710 of this Act, (ii) a minor under the age of 18 for 17    whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 18    exists, or (iii) a minor for whom the court has granted a 19    supplemental petition to reinstate wardship pursuant to 20    subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of this Act. An independent 21    basis exists when the allegations or adjudication of 22    abuse, neglect, or dependency do not arise from the same 23    facts, incident, or circumstances which give rise to a 24    charge or adjudication of delinquency. The Department 25    shall be given due notice of the pendency of the action and 26    the Guardianship Administrator of the Department of   10400HB3365ham001- 71 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    Children and Family Services shall be appointed guardian 2    of the person of the minor. Whenever the Department seeks 3    to discharge a minor from its care and service, the 4    Guardianship Administrator shall petition the court for an 5    order terminating guardianship. The Guardianship 6    Administrator may designate one or more other officers of 7    the Department, appointed as Department officers by 8    administrative order of the Department Director, 9    authorized to affix the signature of the Guardianship 10    Administrator to documents affecting the guardian-ward 11    relationship of children for whom the Guardianship 12    Administrator has been appointed guardian at such times as 13    the Guardianship Administrator is unable to perform the 14    duties of the Guardianship Administrator office. The 15    signature authorization shall include but not be limited 16    to matters of consent of marriage, enlistment in the armed 17    forces, legal proceedings, adoption, major medical and 18    surgical treatment and application for driver's license. 19    Signature authorizations made pursuant to the provisions 20    of this paragraph shall be filed with the Secretary of 21    State and the Secretary of State shall provide upon 22    payment of the customary fee, certified copies of the 23    authorization to any court or individual who requests a 24    copy.25    (1.5) In making a determination under this Section, the 26court shall also consider whether, based on health, safety,   10400HB3365ham001- 72 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1and the best interests of the minor,2        (a) appropriate services aimed at family preservation 3    and family reunification have been unsuccessful in 4    rectifying the conditions that have led to a finding of 5    unfitness or inability to care for, protect, train, or 6    discipline the minor, or7        (b) no family preservation or family reunification 8    services would be appropriate,9and if the petition or amended petition contained an 10allegation that the parent is an unfit person as defined in 11subdivision (D) of Section 1 of the Adoption Act, and the order 12of adjudication recites that parental unfitness was 13established by clear and convincing evidence, the court shall, 14when appropriate and in the best interest of the minor, enter 15an order terminating parental rights and appointing a guardian 16with power to consent to adoption in accordance with Section 172-29.18    When making a placement, the court, wherever possible, 19shall require the Department of Children and Family Services 20to select a person holding the same religious belief as that of 21the minor or a private agency controlled by persons of like 22religious faith of the minor and shall require the Department 23to otherwise comply with Section 7 of the Children and Family 24Services Act in placing the child.

If 25it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 26of the minor, the court may also prescribe shelter care and   10400HB3365ham001- 29 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1order that the minor be kept in a suitable place designated by 2the court or in a shelter care facility designated by the 3Department of Children and Family Services or a licensed child 4welfare agency; however, on and after January 1, 2015 (the 5effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 62017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 7Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 8adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 9or committed to the Department of Children and Family Services 10by any court, except a minor less than 16 years of age and 11committed to the Department of Children and Family Services 12under Section 5-710 of this Act or a minor for whom an 13independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists; and 14on and after January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a criminal 15offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 162012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the 17custody of or committed to the Department of Children and 18Family Services by any court, except a minor less than 15 years 19of age and committed to the Department of Children and Family 20Services under Section 5-710 of this Act or a minor for whom an 21independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists. An 22independent basis exists when the allegations or adjudication 23of abuse, neglect, or dependency do not arise from the same 24facts, incident, or circumstances which give rise to a charge 25or adjudication of delinquency. 26    In placing the minor, the Department or other agency   10400HB3365ham001- 30 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply 2with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In 3determining the health, safety, and best interests of the 4minor to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is 5a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety, and 6protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 7that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that the 8minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and must 9further find that reasonable efforts have been made or that, 10consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 11minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to prevent or 12eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from the 13minor's home. The court shall require documentation from the 14Department of Children and Family Services as to the 15reasonable efforts that were made to prevent or eliminate the 16necessity of removal of the minor from the minor's home or the 17reasons why no efforts reasonably could be made to prevent or 18eliminate the necessity of removal. When a minor is placed in 19the home of a relative, the Department of Children and Family 20Services shall complete a preliminary background review of the 21members of the minor's custodian's household in accordance 22with Section 4.3 of the Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days 23of that placement. If the minor is ordered placed in a shelter 24care facility of the Department of Children and Family 25Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall, 26upon request of the appropriate Department or other agency,   10400HB3365ham001- 31 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1appoint the Department of Children and Family Services 2Guardianship Administrator or other appropriate agency 3executive temporary custodian of the minor and the court may 4enter such other orders related to the temporary custody as it 5deems fit and proper, including the provision of services to 6the minor or the minor's family to ameliorate the causes 7contributing to the finding of probable cause or to the 8finding of the existence of immediate and urgent necessity.9    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 10Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 11temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family 12Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a 13parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends 14and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting 15plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency 16of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 17visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 18have telephone and mail communication with the parents.19    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 20Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 21temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 22the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 23the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 24contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 25after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan 26shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and   10400HB3365ham001- 32 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 2being made to place them together. If the Department has 3determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 4placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 5sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 6determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 7placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for 8visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 9shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 10child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 11addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 12is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 13sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 14placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 15The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date 16for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 17subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 18Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling 19Contact Support Plan is developed. 20    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 21file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 22and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 23Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 24parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 25reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 26achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion,   10400HB3365ham001- 33 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 2the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 3is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 4refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 5duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 6needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 7Department personnel. Child development principles shall be 8considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 9visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 10take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 11party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 12court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 13reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 14achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 15placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact 16are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 17put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 18and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court 19shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 20to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 21contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 22stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 23to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 24visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 25subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing 26under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from   10400HB3365ham001- 34 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 2opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 3contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 4subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 5restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 6contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 7plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, 8where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 9is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 10and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 11on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 12viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 13only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 14shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 15amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and 16holidays, of the change of the visitation.17    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 18admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to 19this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 20evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 21the issue is whether the Department has made reasonable 22efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 23is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 24the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 25writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings 26concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the   10400HB3365ham001- 35 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 2and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that 3reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 4removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 5reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 6of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 7custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be 8furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 9custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 10findings in the case record for the child. The order together 11with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 12entered of record in the court.13    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 14urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 15minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not 16be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 17court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 18protection of the minor.19    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 20Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 21protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 22custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 23cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 24comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 25conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk 26termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure,   10400HB3365ham001- 36 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 2custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 3custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 4provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 5telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 6relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 7siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall 8advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 9relative to inform the Department if additional information 10regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.11    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor 12described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 13is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 14care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 15ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of 16issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 17entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 18the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 19renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 20or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 21efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 22prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and 23shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's 24attorney and to the last known address of the other person or 25persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the 26nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by   10400HB3365ham001- 37 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and 2the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a 3notice that the parties will not be entitled to further 4written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this 5case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion 6to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme 7Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and 8the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as 9provided in this Section. The notice for a shelter care 10hearing shall be substantially as follows:11NOTICE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN12OF SHELTER CARE HEARING13        On ................ at ........., before the Honorable 14    ................, (address:) ................., the State 15    of Illinois will present evidence (1) that (name of child 16    or children) ....................... are abused, 17    neglected, or dependent for the following reasons:18    .............................................. and (2) 19    whether there is "immediate and urgent necessity" to 20    remove the child or children from the responsible 21    relative.22        YOUR FAILURE TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING MAY RESULT IN 23    PLACEMENT of the child or children in foster care until a 24    trial can be held.

To cross examine witnesses for other parties.3            4. To obtain an explanation of any proceedings and 4        orders of the court.5    (4) If the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 6relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor did not 7have actual notice of or was not present at the shelter care 8hearing, the parent, guardian, legal custodian, responsible 9relative, minor age 8 or over, or counsel of the minor may file 10an affidavit setting forth these facts, and the clerk shall 11set the matter for rehearing not later than 48 hours, 12excluding Sundays and legal holidays, after the filing of the 13affidavit. At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in the 14same manner as upon the original hearing.15    (5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that 16the minor taken into custody is a person described in 17subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or 18detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This 19Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).20    (6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a 21jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners 22in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept 23separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept 24in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant 25to the criminal law.26    (7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer   10400HB3365ham001- 41 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor 2must immediately be released from custody.3    (8) If neither the parent, guardian, or custodian appears 4within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon 5request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the 6clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later 7than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons 8directed to the parent, guardian, or custodian to appear. At 9the same time the probation department shall prepare a report 10on the minor. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not 11appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order 12prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place 13designated by the Department of Children and Family Services 14or a licensed child welfare agency.15    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 16any interested party, including the State, the temporary 17custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family 18under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and 19Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their 20representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, 21may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor 22to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the 23following grounds:24        (a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent 25    necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or26        (b) There is a material change in the circumstances of   10400HB3365ham001- 42 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    the natural family from which the minor was removed and 2    the child can be cared for at home without endangering the 3    child's health or safety; or4        (c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect 5    or dependency, including a parent, relative, or legal 6    guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the 7    minor; or8        (d) Services provided by the Department of Children 9    and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other 10    service provider have been successful in eliminating the 11    need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for 12    at home without endangering the child's health or safety.13    In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether 14it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 15of the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If 16the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 17custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 18Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 19may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 20arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 21arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 22and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 23protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 24or 2-25.25    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than 2614 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court   10400HB3365ham001- 43 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 2vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 3appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 4the minor and the minor's family.5    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 6probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 7described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an 8immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 9placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 10be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 11as the abused minor provided:12        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 13    neglect petition pending before the court; and14        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 15    for such other minor.16    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 17been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 18and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 19shelter care for the other minor.20    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 21apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 22or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 2398-61).24    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 25temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may 26file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary   10400HB3365ham001- 44 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 2for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 3of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 4(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court 5may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 6evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 7the temporary custodian such authority. In making its 8determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 9addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 10subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 11        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents 12    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 13    those efforts;14        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 15    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf 16    of the minor;17        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 18    and (b) have been ongoing;19        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 20    family members and the minor;21        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 22    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 23    decision-making on the minor; and24        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.25    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the 26temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the   10400HB3365ham001- 45 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 2of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 3its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 4this subsection. 5(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 6102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 77-1-24.) 8    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 103-1061)9    Sec. 2-10. Temporary custody hearing. At the appearance of 10the minor before the court at the temporary custody hearing, 11all witnesses present shall be examined before the court in 12relation to any matter connected with the allegations made in 13the petition.14    (1) If the court finds that there is not probable cause to 15believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent it 16shall release the minor and dismiss the petition.17    (2) If the court finds that there is probable cause to 18believe that the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent, the 19court shall state in writing the factual basis supporting its 20finding and the minor, the minor's parent, guardian, or 21custodian, and other persons able to give relevant testimony 22shall be examined before the court. Findings of probable cause 23must be based on reasons sufficient and independent from 24exposure to domestic violence that is perpetrated against 25someone other than the minor where there is no demonstrated   10400HB3365ham001- 46 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1likelihood of imminent bodily harm to the minor. The 2Department of Children and Family Services shall give 3testimony concerning indicated reports of abuse and neglect, 4of which they are aware through the central registry, 5involving the minor's parent, guardian, or custodian. After 6such testimony, the court may, consistent with the health, 7safety, and best interests of the minor, enter an order that 8the minor shall be released upon the request of parent, 9guardian, or custodian if the parent, guardian, or custodian 10appears to take custody. If it is determined that a parent's, 11guardian's, or custodian's compliance with critical services 12mitigates the necessity for removal of the minor from the 13minor's home, the court may enter an Order of Protection 14setting forth reasonable conditions of behavior that a parent, 15guardian, or custodian must observe for a specified period of 16time, not to exceed 12 months, without a violation; provided, 17however, that the 12-month period shall begin anew after any 18violation. "Custodian" includes the Department of Children and 19Family Services, if it has been given custody of the child, or 20any other agency of the State which has been given custody or 21wardship of the child. If it is consistent with the health, 22safety, and best interests of the minor, the court may also 23prescribe shelter care and order that the minor be kept in a 24suitable place designated by the court or in a shelter care 25facility designated by the Department of Children and Family 26Services or a licensed child welfare agency; however, on and   10400HB3365ham001- 47 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1after January 1, 2015 (the effective date of Public Act 298-803) and before January 1, 2017, a minor charged with a 3criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 4Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not be 5placed in the custody of or committed to the Department of 6Children and Family Services by any court, except a minor less 7than 16 years of age and committed to the Department of 8Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act 9or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or 10dependency exists; and on and after January 1, 2017, a minor 11charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 121961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent 13shall not be placed in the custody of or committed to the 14Department of Children and Family Services by any court, 15except a minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the 16Department of Children and Family Services under Section 5-710 17of this Act or a minor for whom an independent basis of abuse, 18neglect, or dependency exists. An independent basis exists 19when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, or 20dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 21circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 22delinquency. 23    In placing the minor, the Department or other agency 24shall, to the extent compatible with the court's order, comply 25with Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act. In 26determining the health, safety, and best interests of the   10400HB3365ham001- 48 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1minor to prescribe shelter care, the court must find that it is 2a matter of immediate and urgent necessity for the safety, and 3protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 4that the minor be placed in a shelter care facility or that the 5minor is likely to flee the jurisdiction of the court, and must 6further find that reasonable efforts have been made or that, 7consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 8minor, no efforts reasonably can be made to prevent or 9eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor from the 10minor's home. Domestic violence that is perpetrated against 11someone other than the minor where there is no demonstrated 12likelihood of present and imminent bodily harm to the minor is 13not sufficient to determine that an urgent and immediate 14necessity exists to remove a minor from a parent who is not the 15perpetrator of that domestic violence. The court shall require 16documentation from the Department of Children and Family 17Services as to the reasonable efforts that were made to 18prevent or eliminate the necessity of removal of the minor 19from the minor's home or the reasons why no efforts reasonably 20could be made to prevent or eliminate the necessity of 21removal. When a minor is placed in the home of a relative, the 22Department of Children and Family Services shall complete a 23preliminary background review of the members of the minor's 24custodian's household in accordance with Section 3.4 or 4.3 of 25the Child Care Act of 1969 within 90 days of that placement. If 26the minor is not placed in the home of a relative, the court   10400HB3365ham001- 49 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1shall require evidence from the Department as to the efforts 2that were made to place the minor in the home of a relative or 3the reasons why no efforts reasonably could be made to place 4the minor in the home of a relative, consistent with the best 5interests of the minor. If the minor is ordered placed in a 6shelter care facility of the Department of Children and Family 7Services or a licensed child welfare agency, the court shall, 8upon request of the appropriate Department or other agency, 9appoint the Department of Children and Family Services 10Guardianship Administrator or other appropriate agency 11executive temporary custodian of the minor and the court may 12enter such other orders related to the temporary custody as it 13deems fit and proper, including the provision of services to 14the minor or the minor's family to ameliorate the causes 15contributing to the finding of probable cause or to the 16finding of the existence of immediate and urgent necessity.17    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 18Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 19temporary custodian, the Department of Children and Family 20Services shall file with the court and serve on the parties a 21parent-child visiting plan, within 10 days, excluding weekends 22and holidays, after the appointment. The parent-child visiting 23plan shall set out the time and place of visits, the frequency 24of visits, the length of visits, who shall be present at the 25visits, and where appropriate, the minor's opportunities to 26have telephone and mail communication with the parents.  10400HB3365ham001- 50 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    Where the Department of Children and Family Services 2Guardianship Administrator is appointed as the executive 3temporary custodian, and when the child has siblings in care, 4the Department of Children and Family Services shall file with 5the court and serve on the parties a sibling placement and 6contact plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and holidays, 7after the appointment. The sibling placement and contact plan 8shall set forth whether the siblings are placed together, and 9if they are not placed together, what, if any, efforts are 10being made to place them together. If the Department has 11determined that it is not in a child's best interest to be 12placed with a sibling, the Department shall document in the 13sibling placement and contact plan the basis for its 14determination. For siblings placed separately, the sibling 15placement and contact plan shall set the time and place for 16visits, the frequency of the visits, the length of visits, who 17shall be present for the visits, and where appropriate, the 18child's opportunities to have contact with their siblings in 19addition to in person contact. If the Department determines it 20is not in the best interest of a sibling to have contact with a 21sibling, the Department shall document in the sibling 22placement and contact plan the basis for its determination. 23The sibling placement and contact plan shall specify a date 24for development of the Sibling Contact Support Plan, under 25subsection (f) of Section 7.4 of the Children and Family 26Services Act, and shall remain in effect until the Sibling   10400HB3365ham001- 51 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1Contact Support Plan is developed. 2    For good cause, the court may waive the requirement to 3file the parent-child visiting plan or the sibling placement 4and contact plan, or extend the time for filing either plan. 5Any party may, by motion, request the court to review the 6parent-child visiting plan to determine whether it is 7reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 8achievement of the permanency goal. A party may, by motion, 9request the court to review the parent-child visiting plan or 10the sibling placement and contact plan to determine whether it 11is consistent with the minor's best interest. The court may 12refer the parties to mediation where available. The frequency, 13duration, and locations of visitation shall be measured by the 14needs of the child and family, and not by the convenience of 15Department personnel. Child development principles shall be 16considered by the court in its analysis of how frequent 17visitation should be, how long it should last, where it should 18take place, and who should be present. If upon motion of the 19party to review either plan and after receiving evidence, the 20court determines that the parent-child visiting plan is not 21reasonably calculated to expeditiously facilitate the 22achievement of the permanency goal or that the restrictions 23placed on parent-child contact or sibling placement or contact 24are contrary to the child's best interests, the court shall 25put in writing the factual basis supporting the determination 26and enter specific findings based on the evidence. The court   10400HB3365ham001- 52 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1shall enter an order for the Department to implement changes 2to the parent-child visiting plan or sibling placement or 3contact plan, consistent with the court's findings. At any 4stage of proceeding, any party may by motion request the court 5to enter any orders necessary to implement the parent-child 6visiting plan, sibling placement or contact plan, or 7subsequently developed Sibling Contact Support Plan. Nothing 8under this subsection (2) shall restrict the court from 9granting discretionary authority to the Department to increase 10opportunities for additional parent-child contacts or sibling 11contacts, without further court orders. Nothing in this 12subsection (2) shall restrict the Department from immediately 13restricting or terminating parent-child contact or sibling 14contacts, without either amending the parent-child visiting 15plan or the sibling contact plan or obtaining a court order, 16where the Department or its assigns reasonably believe there 17is an immediate need to protect the child's health, safety, 18and welfare. Such restrictions or terminations must be based 19on available facts to the Department and its assigns when 20viewed in light of the surrounding circumstances and shall 21only occur on an individual case-by-case basis. The Department 22shall file with the court and serve on the parties any 23amendments to the plan within 10 days, excluding weekends and 24holidays, of the change of the visitation.25    Acceptance of services shall not be considered an 26admission of any allegation in a petition made pursuant to   10400HB3365ham001- 53 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1this Act, nor may a referral of services be considered as 2evidence in any proceeding pursuant to this Act, except where 3the issue is whether the Department has made reasonable 4efforts to reunite the family. In making its findings that it 5is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests of 6the minor to prescribe shelter care, the court shall state in 7writing (i) the factual basis supporting its findings 8concerning the immediate and urgent necessity for the 9protection of the minor or of the person or property of another 10and (ii) the factual basis supporting its findings that 11reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the 12removal of the minor from the minor's home or that no efforts 13reasonably could be made to prevent or eliminate the removal 14of the minor from the minor's home. The parents, guardian, 15custodian, temporary custodian, and minor shall each be 16furnished a copy of such written findings. The temporary 17custodian shall maintain a copy of the court order and written 18findings in the case record for the child. The order together 19with the court's findings of fact in support thereof shall be 20entered of record in the court.21    Once the court finds that it is a matter of immediate and 22urgent necessity for the protection of the minor that the 23minor be placed in a shelter care facility, the minor shall not 24be returned to the parent, custodian, or guardian until the 25court finds that such placement is no longer necessary for the 26protection of the minor.  10400HB3365ham001- 54 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    If the child is placed in the temporary custody of the 2Department of Children and Family Services for the minor's 3protection, the court shall admonish the parents, guardian, 4custodian, or responsible relative that the parents must 5cooperate with the Department of Children and Family Services, 6comply with the terms of the service plans, and correct the 7conditions which require the child to be in care, or risk 8termination of their parental rights. The court shall ensure, 9by inquiring in open court of each parent, guardian, 10custodian, or responsible relative, that the parent, guardian, 11custodian, or responsible relative has had the opportunity to 12provide the Department with all known names, addresses, and 13telephone numbers of each of the minor's living adult 14relatives, including, but not limited to, grandparents, 15siblings of the minor's parents, and siblings. The court shall 16advise the parents, guardian, custodian, or responsible 17relative to inform the Department if additional information 18regarding the minor's adult relatives becomes available.19    (2.5) When the court places the minor in the temporary 20custody of the Department, the court shall inquire of the 21Department's initial family finding and relative engagement 22efforts, as described in Section 7 of the Children and Family 23Services Act, and the Department shall complete any remaining 24family finding and relative engagement efforts required under 25Section 7 of the Children and Family Services Act within 30 26days of the minor being taken into temporary custody. The   10400HB3365ham001- 55 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1Department shall complete new family finding and relative 2engagement efforts in accordance with Section 7 of the 3Children and Family Services Act for relatives of the minor 4within 30 days of an unknown parent's identity being 5determined or a parent whose whereabouts were unknown being 6located. 7    (3) If prior to the shelter care hearing for a minor 8described in Sections 2-3, 2-4, 3-3, and 4-3 the moving party 9is unable to serve notice on the party respondent, the shelter 10care hearing may proceed ex parte. A shelter care order from an 11ex parte hearing shall be endorsed with the date and hour of 12issuance and shall be filed with the clerk's office and 13entered of record. The order shall expire after 10 days from 14the time it is issued unless before its expiration it is 15renewed, at a hearing upon appearance of the party respondent, 16or upon an affidavit of the moving party as to all diligent 17efforts to notify the party respondent by notice as herein 18prescribed. The notice prescribed shall be in writing and 19shall be personally delivered to the minor or the minor's 20attorney and to the last known address of the other person or 21persons entitled to notice. The notice shall also state the 22nature of the allegations, the nature of the order sought by 23the State, including whether temporary custody is sought, and 24the consequences of failure to appear and shall contain a 25notice that the parties will not be entitled to further 26written notices or publication notices of proceedings in this   10400HB3365ham001- 56 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1case, including the filing of an amended petition or a motion 2to terminate parental rights, except as required by Supreme 3Court Rule 11; and shall explain the right of the parties and 4the procedures to vacate or modify a shelter care order as 5provided in this Section.

At the rehearing, the court shall proceed in the 10same manner as upon the original hearing.11    (5) Only when there is reasonable cause to believe that 12the minor taken into custody is a person described in 13subsection (3) of Section 5-105 may the minor be kept or 14detained in a detention home or county or municipal jail. This 15Section shall in no way be construed to limit subsection (6).16    (6) No minor under 16 years of age may be confined in a 17jail or place ordinarily used for the confinement of prisoners 18in a police station. Minors under 18 years of age must be kept 19separate from confined adults and may not at any time be kept 20in the same cell, room, or yard with adults confined pursuant 21to the criminal law.22    (7) If the minor is not brought before a judicial officer 23within the time period as specified in Section 2-9, the minor 24must immediately be released from custody.25    (8) If neither the parent, guardian, or custodian appears 26within 24 hours to take custody of a minor released upon   10400HB3365ham001- 60 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1request pursuant to subsection (2) of this Section, then the 2clerk of the court shall set the matter for rehearing not later 3than 7 days after the original order and shall issue a summons 4directed to the parent, guardian, or custodian to appear. At 5the same time the probation department shall prepare a report 6on the minor. If a parent, guardian, or custodian does not 7appear at such rehearing, the judge may enter an order 8prescribing that the minor be kept in a suitable place 9designated by the Department of Children and Family Services 10or a licensed child welfare agency.11    (9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 12any interested party, including the State, the temporary 13custodian, an agency providing services to the minor or family 14under a service plan pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Abused and 15Neglected Child Reporting Act, foster parent, or any of their 16representatives, on notice to all parties entitled to notice, 17may file a motion that it is in the best interests of the minor 18to modify or vacate a temporary custody order on any of the 19following grounds:20        (a) It is no longer a matter of immediate and urgent 21    necessity that the minor remain in shelter care; or22        (b) There is a material change in the circumstances of 23    the natural family from which the minor was removed and 24    the child can be cared for at home without endangering the 25    child's health or safety; or26        (c) A person not a party to the alleged abuse, neglect   10400HB3365ham001- 61 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    or dependency, including a parent, relative, or legal 2    guardian, is capable of assuming temporary custody of the 3    minor; or4        (d) Services provided by the Department of Children 5    and Family Services or a child welfare agency or other 6    service provider have been successful in eliminating the 7    need for temporary custody and the child can be cared for 8    at home without endangering the child's health or safety.9    In ruling on the motion, the court shall determine whether 10it is consistent with the health, safety, and best interests 11of the minor to modify or vacate a temporary custody order. If 12the minor is being restored to the custody of a parent, legal 13custodian, or guardian who lives outside of Illinois, and an 14Interstate Compact has been requested and refused, the court 15may order the Department of Children and Family Services to 16arrange for an assessment of the minor's proposed living 17arrangement and for ongoing monitoring of the health, safety, 18and best interest of the minor and compliance with any order of 19protective supervision entered in accordance with Section 2-20 20or 2-25.21    The clerk shall set the matter for hearing not later than 2214 days after such motion is filed. In the event that the court 23modifies or vacates a temporary custody order but does not 24vacate its finding of probable cause, the court may order that 25appropriate services be continued or initiated in behalf of 26the minor and the minor's family.  10400HB3365ham001- 62 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    (10) When the court finds or has found that there is 2probable cause to believe a minor is an abused minor as 3described in subsection (2) of Section 2-3 and that there is an 4immediate and urgent necessity for the abused minor to be 5placed in shelter care, immediate and urgent necessity shall 6be presumed for any other minor residing in the same household 7as the abused minor provided:8        (a) Such other minor is the subject of an abuse or 9    neglect petition pending before the court; and10        (b) A party to the petition is seeking shelter care 11    for such other minor.12    Once the presumption of immediate and urgent necessity has 13been raised, the burden of demonstrating the lack of immediate 14and urgent necessity shall be on any party that is opposing 15shelter care for the other minor.16    (11) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 17apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 18or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1998-61).20    (12) After the court has placed a minor in the care of a 21temporary custodian pursuant to this Section, any party may 22file a motion requesting the court to grant the temporary 23custodian the authority to serve as a surrogate decision maker 24for the minor under the Health Care Surrogate Act for purposes 25of making decisions pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection 26(b) of Section 20 of the Health Care Surrogate Act. The court   10400HB3365ham001- 63 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1may grant the motion if it determines by clear and convincing 2evidence that it is in the best interests of the minor to grant 3the temporary custodian such authority. In making its 4determination, the court shall weigh the following factors in 5addition to considering the best interests factors listed in 6subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 of this Act: 7        (a) the efforts to identify and locate the respondents 8    and adult family members of the minor and the results of 9    those efforts;10        (b) the efforts to engage the respondents and adult 11    family members of the minor in decision making on behalf 12    of the minor;13        (c) the length of time the efforts in paragraphs (a) 14    and (b) have been ongoing;15        (d) the relationship between the respondents and adult 16    family members and the minor;17        (e) medical testimony regarding the extent to which 18    the minor is suffering and the impact of a delay in 19    decision-making on the minor; and20        (f) any other factor the court deems relevant.21    If the Department of Children and Family Services is the 22temporary custodian of the minor, in addition to the 23requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 20 24of the Health Care Surrogate Act, the Department shall follow 25its rules and procedures in exercising authority granted under 26this subsection.   10400HB3365ham001- 64 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1(Source: P.A. 102-489, eff. 8-20-21; 102-502, eff. 1-1-22; 2102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 37-1-24; 103-1061, eff. 7-1-25.) 4    (705 ILCS 405/2-21)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-21)5    Sec. 2-21. Findings and adjudication. 6    (1) The court shall state for the record the manner in 7which the parties received service of process and shall note 8whether the return or returns of service, postal return 9receipt or receipts for notice by certified mail, or 10certificate or certificates of publication have been filed in 11the court record. The court shall enter any appropriate orders 12of default against any parent who has been properly served in 13any manner and fails to appear.14    No further service of process as defined in Sections 2-15 15and 2-16 is required in any subsequent proceeding for a parent 16who was properly served in any manner, except as required by 17Supreme Court Rule 11.18    The caseworker shall testify about the diligent search 19conducted for the parent.20    After hearing the evidence the court shall determine 21whether or not the minor is abused, neglected, or dependent. 22If it finds that the minor is not such a person, the court 23shall order the petition dismissed and the minor discharged. 24The court's determination of whether the minor is abused, 25neglected, or dependent shall be stated in writing with the   10400HB3365ham001- 65 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1factual basis supporting that determination.2    If the court finds that the minor is abused, neglected, or 3dependent, the court shall then determine and put in writing 4the factual basis supporting that determination, and specify, 5to the extent possible, the acts or omissions or both of each 6parent, guardian, or legal custodian that form the basis of 7the court's findings. In making such findings, the factual 8basis supporting a determination that the child has been 9abused, neglected, or dependent must be sufficient and 10independent of exposure to domestic violence that is 11perpetrated against someone other than the child where there 12is no demonstrated likelihood of imminent bodily harm to the 13child. That finding shall appear in the order of the court.14    If the court finds that the child has been abused, 15neglected or dependent, the court shall admonish the parents 16that they must cooperate with the Department of Children and 17Family Services, comply with the terms of the service plan, 18and correct the conditions that require the child to be in 19care, or risk termination of parental rights.20    If the court determines that a person has inflicted 21physical or sexual abuse upon a minor, the court shall report 22that determination to the Illinois State Police, which shall 23include that information in its report to the President of the 24school board for a school district that requests a criminal 25history records check of that person, or the regional 26superintendent of schools who requests a check of that person,   10400HB3365ham001- 66 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1as required under Section 10-21.9 or 34-18.5 of the School 2Code.3    (2) If, pursuant to subsection (1) of this Section, the 4court determines and puts in writing the factual basis 5supporting the determination that the minor is either abused 6or neglected or dependent, the court shall then set a time not 7later than 30 days after the entry of the finding for a 8dispositional hearing (unless an earlier date is required 9pursuant to Section 2-13.1) to be conducted under Section 2-22 10at which hearing the court shall determine whether it is 11consistent with the health, safety and best interests of the 12minor and the public that the minor be made a ward of the 13court. To assist the court in making this and other 14determinations at the dispositional hearing, the court may 15order that an investigation be conducted and a dispositional 16report be prepared concerning the minor's physical and mental 17history and condition, family situation and background, 18economic status, education, occupation, history of delinquency 19or criminality, personal habits, and any other information 20that may be helpful to the court. The dispositional hearing 21may be continued once for a period not to exceed 30 days if the 22court finds that such continuance is necessary to complete the 23dispositional report.24    (3) The time limits of this Section may be waived only by 25consent of all parties and approval by the court, as 26determined to be consistent with the health, safety and best   10400HB3365ham001- 67 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1interests of the minor.2    (4) For all cases adjudicated prior to July 1, 1991, for 3which no dispositional hearing has been held prior to that 4date, a dispositional hearing under Section 2-22 shall be held 5within 90 days of July 1, 1991.6    (5) The court may terminate the parental rights of a 7parent at the initial dispositional hearing if all of the 8following conditions are met: 9        (i) the original or amended petition contains a 10    request for termination of parental rights and appointment 11    of a guardian with power to consent to adoption; and 12        (ii) the court has found by a preponderance of 13    evidence, introduced or stipulated to at an adjudicatory 14    hearing, that the child comes under the jurisdiction of 15    the court as an abused, neglected, or dependent minor 16    under Section 2-18; and 17        (iii) the court finds, on the basis of clear and 18    convincing evidence admitted at the adjudicatory hearing 19    that the parent is an unfit person under subdivision D of 20    Section 1 of the Adoption Act; and 21        (iv) the court determines in accordance with the rules 22    of evidence for dispositional proceedings, that: 23            (A) it is in the best interest of the minor and 24        public that the child be made a ward of the court;25            (A-1) the petitioner has demonstrated that the 26        Department has discussed the permanency options of   10400HB3365ham001- 68 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1        guardianship and adoption with the caregiver and the 2        Department has informed the court of the caregiver's 3        wishes as to the permanency goal; 4            (A-5) reasonable efforts under subsection (l-1) of 5        Section 5 of the Children and Family Services Act are 6        inappropriate or such efforts were made and were 7        unsuccessful; and 8            (B) termination of parental rights and appointment 9        of a guardian with power to consent to adoption is in 10        the best interest of the child pursuant to Section 11        2-29.12(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 103-1061, eff. 2-5-25.) 13    (705 ILCS 405/2-27)  (from Ch. 37, par. 802-27)14    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 103-1061)15    Sec. 2-27. Placement; legal custody or guardianship. 16    (1) If the court determines and puts in writing the 17factual basis supporting the determination of whether the 18parents, guardian, or legal custodian of a minor adjudged a 19ward of the court are unfit or are unable, for some reason 20other than financial circumstances alone, to care for, 21protect, train or discipline the minor or are unwilling to do 22so, and that the health, safety, and best interest of the minor 23will be jeopardized if the minor remains in the custody of the 24minor's parents, guardian or custodian, the court may at this 25hearing and at any later point:  10400HB3365ham001- 69 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1        (a) place the minor in the custody of a suitable 2    relative or other person as legal custodian or guardian;3        (a-5) with the approval of the Department of Children 4    and Family Services, place the minor in the subsidized 5    guardianship of a suitable relative or other person as 6    legal guardian; "subsidized guardianship" means a private 7    guardianship arrangement for children for whom the 8    permanency goals of return home and adoption have been 9    ruled out and who meet the qualifications for subsidized 10    guardianship as defined by the Department of Children and 11    Family Services in administrative rules;12        (b) place the minor under the guardianship of a 13    probation officer;14        (c) commit the minor to an agency for care or 15    placement, except an institution under the authority of 16    the Department of Corrections or of the Department of 17    Children and Family Services;18        (d) on and after the effective date of this amendatory 19    Act of the 98th General Assembly and before January 1, 20    2017, commit the minor to the Department of Children and 21    Family Services for care and service; however, a minor 22    charged with a criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 23    1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated 24    delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of or 25    committed to the Department of Children and Family 26    Services by any court, except (i) a minor less than 16   10400HB3365ham001- 70 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    years of age and committed to the Department of Children 2    and Family Services under Section 5-710 of this Act, (ii) 3    a minor under the age of 18 for whom an independent basis 4    of abuse, neglect, or dependency exists, or (iii) a minor 5    for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition to 6    reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 7    2-33 of this Act. On and after January 1, 2017, commit the 8    minor to the Department of Children and Family Services 9    for care and service; however, a minor charged with a 10    criminal offense under the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 11    Criminal Code of 2012 or adjudicated delinquent shall not 12    be placed in the custody of or committed to the Department 13    of Children and Family Services by any court, except (i) a 14    minor less than 15 years of age and committed to the 15    Department of Children and Family Services under Section 16    5-710 of this Act, (ii) a minor under the age of 18 for 17    whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 18    exists, or (iii) a minor for whom the court has granted a 19    supplemental petition to reinstate wardship pursuant to 20    subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of this Act. An independent 21    basis exists when the allegations or adjudication of 22    abuse, neglect, or dependency do not arise from the same 23    facts, incident, or circumstances which give rise to a 24    charge or adjudication of delinquency. The Department 25    shall be given due notice of the pendency of the action and 26    the Guardianship Administrator of the Department of   10400HB3365ham001- 71 -LRB104 10403 RLC 25062 a1    Children and Family Services shall be appointed guardian 2    of the person of the minor. Whenever the Department seeks 3    to discharge a minor from its care and service, the 4    Guardianship Administrator shall petition the court for an 5    order terminating guardianship.
