The Director shall provide at least 30 days' 14        advance notice of the date of the pre-examination 15        conference unless circumstances warrant that the 16        examination proceed more quickly.17            (C) The Director may coordinate a market conduct 18        action and findings of this State with market conduct 19        actions and findings of other states. 20        (3) Nothing in this Section requires the Director to 21    undertake market analysis before initiating any market 22    conduct action.23        (4) Nothing in this Section restricts the Director to 24    the type of market conduct action he or she initially 25    selected.26        (5) A regulated person is required to respond to a   HB3799 Engrossed- 7 -LRB104 11270 BAB 21355 b1    market analysis data call or to an information request in 2    a market conduct action on the terms and conditions 3    established by the Director. The Department shall 4    establish reasonable timelines that are commensurate with 5    the volume and nature of the data required to be collected 6    in the information request.7        (6) Without limiting the contents of any examination 8    report, market conduct actions taken as a result of a 9    market analysis shall focus primarily on the general 10    business practices and compliance activities of companies 11    or persons rather than identifying infrequent or 12    unintentional random errors that do not cause significant 13    consumer harm. The Director may give a company or person 14    an opportunity to resolve matters that are identified as a 15    result of a market analysis to the Director's satisfaction 16    before undertaking a market conduct action against the 17    company or person. 18    (d) Access to books and records. Every examinee and its 19officers, directors, and agents must provide to the Director 20convenient and free access at all reasonable hours at its 21office or location to all books, records, and documents and 22any or all papers relating to the business, performance, 23operations, and affairs of the examinee or its affiliates. The 24officers, directors, and agents of the examinee must 25facilitate the market conduct action and aid in the action so 26far as it is in their power to do so. The Director and any   HB3799 Engrossed- 8 -LRB104 11270 BAB 21355 b1authorized market conduct surveillance personnel have the 2power to administer oaths and examine under oath any person 3relevant to the business of the examinee.

The report of examination must be 19verified by the oath of the examiner in charge thereof, and 20when so verified is prima facie evidence in any action or 21proceeding in the name of the State against the examinee, its 22officers, directors, or agents upon the facts stated therein.23    (f) Examinee response to examination report. The 24Department and the examinee shall comply with the following 25timeline, unless a mutual agreement is reached to modify the 26timeline:  HB3799 Engrossed- 9 -LRB104 11270 BAB 21355 b1        (1) The Department shall deliver a draft report to the 2    examinee as soon as reasonably practicable.

Whenever the Department has made 13    substantive changes to a previously shared draft report, 14    unless those changes remove part or all of an alleged 15    violation or were proposed by the examinee, the Department 16    shall deliver the revised version to the examinee as a new 17    draft and shall allow the examinee 30 days to respond 18    before the Department issues a final report.19        (4) The examinee shall, within 10 days after the 20    issuance of the final report, accept the final report or 21    request a hearing in writing, unless granted an extension 22    by mutual agreement. Failure to take either action within 23    10 days or the mutually agreed extension shall be deemed 24    an acceptance of the final report. If the examinee accepts 25    the examination report, the Director shall continue to 26    hold the content of the examination report as private and   HB3799 Engrossed- 10 -LRB104 11270 BAB 21355 b1    confidential for a period of 30 days.

The Illinois Insurance Code is amended by 5changing Sections 132, 132.3, 143.15, and 143.17 and by adding 6Article XLVIII as follows: 7    (215 ILCS 5/132)  (from Ch. 73, par. 744)8    Sec. 132. Market conduct actions and market analysis. 9    (a) Definitions. As used in this Section:10    "Data call" means a written solicitation by the Director 11to 2 or more regulated companies or persons seeking existing 12data or other existing information to be provided within a 13reasonable time period for a narrow and targeted regulatory 14oversight purpose for market analysis. "Data call" does not 15include an information request in a market conduct action or 16any data or information that the Director shall or may 17specifically require under any other law, except as provided 18by the other law. 19    "Desk examination" means an examination that is conducted 20by market conduct surveillance personnel at a location other 21than the regulated company's or person's premises. "Desk 22examination" includes an examination performed at the 23Department's offices with the company or person providing   HB3799 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 11270 BAB 21355 b1requested documents by hard copy, microfiche, or discs or 2other electronic media for review without an on-site 3examination.4    "Market analysis" means a process whereby market conduct 5surveillance personnel collect and analyze information from 6filed schedules, surveys, required reports, data calls, and 7other sources to develop a baseline understanding of the 8marketplace and to identify patterns or practices of regulated 9persons that deviate significantly from the norm or that may 10pose a potential risk to insurance consumers.11    "Market conduct action" means any activity, other than 12market analysis, that the Director may initiate to assess and 13address the market and nonfinancial practices of regulated 14persons, including market conduct examinations. The 15Department's consumer complaint process outlined in 50 Ill. 16Adm. Code 926 is not a market conduct action for purposes of 17this Section; however, the Department may initiate market 18conduct actions based on information gathered during that 19process.

"Market conduct 7examination" includes comprehensive examinations, targeted 8examinations, and follow-up examinations, which may be 9conducted as desk examinations, on-site examinations, or a 10combination of those 2 methods.11    "Market conduct surveillance" means market analysis or a 12market conduct action.13    "Market conduct surveillance personnel" means those 14individuals employed or retained by the Department and 15designated by the Director to collect, analyze, review, or act 16on information in the insurance marketplace that identifies 17patterns or practices of persons subject to the Director's 18jurisdiction. "Market conduct surveillance personnel" includes 19all persons identified as an examiner in the insurance laws or 20rules of this State if the Director has designated them to 21assist her or him in ascertaining the nonfinancial business 22practices, performance, and operations of a company or person 23subject to the Director's jurisdiction.24    "On-site examination" means an examination conducted at 25the company's or person's home office or the location where 26the records under review are stored.  HB3799 Engrossed- 4 -LRB104 11270 BAB 21355 b1    "SOFR rate" means the Secured Overnight Financing Rate 2published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York every 3business day.4    (b) Companies and persons subject to surveillance.

The Director shall use the most 16    recent NAIC Market Regulation Handbook as a guide in 17    performing market analysis. The Director may also employ 18    other guidelines or procedures as the Director may deem 19    appropriate.20        (2) The Director may initiate a market conduct action 21    subject to the following:22            (A) If the Director determines that further 23        inquiry into a particular person or practice is 24        needed, then the Director may consider undertaking a 25        market conduct action.

The Director may also employ 4        other guidelines or procedures as the Director may 5        deem appropriate.6            (B) For an examination, the Director shall conduct 7        a pre-examination conference with the examinee to 8        clarify expectations before commencement of the 9        examination. At the pre-examination conference, the 10        Director or the market conduct surveillance personnel 11        shall disclose the basis of the examination, including 12        the statutes, regulations, or business practices at 13        issue. The Director shall provide at least 30 days' 14        advance notice of the date of the pre-examination 15        conference unless circumstances warrant that the 16        examination proceed more quickly.17            (C) The Director may coordinate a market conduct 18        action and findings of this State with market conduct 19        actions and findings of other states. 20        (3) Nothing in this Section requires the Director to 21    undertake market analysis before initiating any market 22    conduct action.23        (4) Nothing in this Section restricts the Director to 24    the type of market conduct action he or she initially 25    selected.26        (5) A regulated person is required to respond to a   HB3799 Engrossed- 7 -LRB104 11270 BAB 21355 b1    market analysis data call or to an information request in 2    a market conduct action on the terms and conditions 3    established by the Director. The Department shall 4    establish reasonable timelines that are commensurate with 5    the volume and nature of the data required to be collected 6    in the information request.7        (6) Without limiting the contents of any examination 8    report, market conduct actions taken as a result of a 9    market analysis shall focus primarily on the general 10    business practices and compliance activities of companies 11    or persons rather than identifying infrequent or 12    unintentional random errors that do not cause significant 13    consumer harm. The Director may give a company or person 14    an opportunity to resolve matters that are identified as a 15    result of a market analysis to the Director's satisfaction 16    before undertaking a market conduct action against the 17    company or person. 18    (d) Access to books and records. Every examinee and its 19officers, directors, and agents must provide to the Director 20convenient and free access at all reasonable hours at its 21office or location to all books, records, and documents and 22any or all papers relating to the business, performance, 23operations, and affairs of the examinee or its affiliates. The 24officers, directors, and agents of the examinee must 25facilitate the market conduct action and aid in the action so 26far as it is in their power to do so. The Director and any   HB3799 Engrossed- 8 -LRB104 11270 BAB 21355 b1authorized market conduct surveillance personnel have the 2power to administer oaths and examine under oath any person 3relevant to the business of the examinee. A failure to produce 4requested books, records, or documents by the deadline shall 5not be a violation until after the later of:6        (1) 5 business days after the initial response 7    deadline set by the Director or authorized personnel; or8        (2) an extended deadline granted by the Director or 9    authorized personnel.10    (e) Examination report. The market conduct surveillance 11personnel designated by the Director under Section 402 must 12make a full and true report of every examination made by them 13that contains only facts ascertained from the books, papers, 14records, documents, and other evidence obtained by 15investigation and examined by them or ascertained from the 16testimony of officers, agents, or other persons examined under 17oath concerning the business, affairs, conduct, and 18performance of the examinee. The report of examination must be 19verified by the oath of the examiner in charge thereof, and 20when so verified is prima facie evidence in any action or 21proceeding in the name of the State against the examinee, its 22officers, directors, or agents upon the facts stated therein.23    (f) Examinee response to examination report. The 24Department and the examinee shall comply with the following 25timeline, unless a mutual agreement is reached to modify the 26timeline:  HB3799 Engrossed- 9 -LRB104 11270 BAB 21355 b1        (1) The Department shall deliver a draft report to the 2    examinee as soon as reasonably practicable. Nothing in 3    this Section prevents the Department from sharing an 4    earlier draft of the report with the examinee before 5    confirming that the examination is completed.6        (2) If the examinee chooses to respond with written 7    submissions or rebuttals, then the examinee must do so 8    within 30 days after receipt of any draft report delivered 9    after the completion of the examination.10        (3) As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of 11    any written submissions or rebuttals, the Department shall 12    issue a final report. Whenever the Department has made 13    substantive changes to a previously shared draft report, 14    unless those changes remove part or all of an alleged 15    violation or were proposed by the examinee, the Department 16    shall deliver the revised version to the examinee as a new 17    draft and shall allow the examinee 30 days to respond 18    before the Department issues a final report.19        (4) The examinee shall, within 10 days after the 20    issuance of the final report, accept the final report or 21    request a hearing in writing, unless granted an extension 22    by mutual agreement. Failure to take either action within 23    10 days or the mutually agreed extension shall be deemed 24    an acceptance of the final report. If the examinee accepts 25    the examination report, the Director shall continue to 26    hold the content of the examination report as private and   HB3799 Engrossed- 10 -LRB104 11270 BAB 21355 b1    confidential for a period of 30 days.
