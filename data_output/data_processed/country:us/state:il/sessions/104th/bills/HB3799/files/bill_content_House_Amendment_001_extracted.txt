Market conduct actions and market analysis. 9    (a) Definitions. As used in this Section:10    "Data call" means a written solicitation by the Director 11to 2 or more regulated companies or persons seeking existing 12data or other existing information to be provided within a 13reasonable time period for a narrow and targeted regulatory 14oversight purpose for market analysis. "Data call" does not 15include an information request in a market conduct action or 16any data or information that the Director shall or may   10400HB3799ham001- 2 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1specifically require under any other law, except as provided 2by the other law. 3    "Desk examination" means an examination that is conducted 4by market conduct surveillance personnel at a location other 5than the regulated company's or person's premises. "Desk 6examination" includes an examination performed at the 7Department's offices with the company or person providing 8requested documents by hard copy, microfiche, or discs or 9other electronic media for review without an on-site 10examination.11    "Market analysis" means a process whereby market conduct 12surveillance personnel collect and analyze information from 13filed schedules, surveys, required reports, data calls, and 14other sources to develop a baseline understanding of the 15marketplace and to identify patterns or practices of regulated 16persons that deviate significantly from the norm or that may 17pose a potential risk to insurance consumers.18    "Market conduct action" means any activity, other than 19market analysis, that the Director may initiate to assess and 20address the market and nonfinancial practices of regulated 21persons, including market conduct examinations. The 22Department's consumer complaint process outlined in 50 Ill. 23Adm. Code 926 is not a market conduct action for purposes of 24this Section; however, the Department may initiate market 25conduct actions based on information gathered during that 26process.

The Director shall use the most 23    recent NAIC Market Regulation Handbook as a guide in 24    performing market analysis. The Director may also employ 25    other guidelines or procedures as the Director may deem 26    appropriate.  10400HB3799ham001- 6 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1        (2) The Director may initiate a market conduct action 2    subject to the following:3            (A) If the Director determines that further 4        inquiry into a particular person or practice is 5        needed, then the Director may consider undertaking a 6        market conduct action. The Director shall inform the 7        examinee of the initiation of the market conduct 8        action and shall use the most recent NAIC Market 9        Regulation Handbook as a guide in performing the 10        market conduct action. The Director may also employ 11        other guidelines or procedures as the Director may 12        deem appropriate.13            (B) For an examination, the Director shall conduct 14        a pre-examination conference with the examinee to 15        clarify expectations before commencement of the 16        examination. At the pre-examination conference, the 17        Director or the market conduct surveillance personnel 18        shall disclose the basis of the examination, including 19        the statutes, regulations, or business practices at 20        issue. The Director shall provide at least 30 days' 21        advance notice of the date of the pre-examination 22        conference unless circumstances warrant that the 23        examination proceed more quickly.24            (C) The Director may coordinate a market conduct 25        action and findings of this State with market conduct 26        actions and findings of other states.   10400HB3799ham001- 7 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1        (3) Nothing in this Section requires the Director to 2    undertake market analysis before initiating any market 3    conduct action.4        (4) Nothing in this Section restricts the Director to 5    the type of market conduct action he or she initially 6    selected.7        (5) A regulated person is required to respond to a 8    market analysis data call or to an information request in 9    a market conduct action on the terms and conditions 10    established by the Director. The Department shall 11    establish reasonable timelines that are commensurate with 12    the volume and nature of the data required to be collected 13    in the information request.14        (6) Without limiting the contents of any examination 15    report, market conduct actions taken as a result of a 16    market analysis shall focus primarily on the general 17    business practices and compliance activities of companies 18    or persons rather than identifying infrequent or 19    unintentional random errors that do not cause significant 20    consumer harm. The Director may give a company or person 21    an opportunity to resolve matters that are identified as a 22    result of a market analysis to the Director's satisfaction 23    before undertaking a market conduct action against the 24    company or person. 25    (d) Access to books and records. Every examinee and its 26officers, directors, and agents must provide to the Director   10400HB3799ham001- 8 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1convenient and free access at all reasonable hours at its 2office or location to all books, records, and documents and 3any or all papers relating to the business, performance, 4operations, and affairs of the examinee or its affiliates. The 5officers, directors, and agents of the examinee must 6facilitate the market conduct action and aid in the action so 7far as it is in their power to do so. The Director and any 8authorized market conduct surveillance personnel have the 9power to administer oaths and examine under oath any person 10relevant to the business of the examinee. A failure to produce 11requested books, records, or documents by the deadline shall 12not be a violation until after the later of:13        (1) 5 business days after the initial response 14    deadline set by the Director or authorized personnel; or15        (2) an extended deadline granted by the Director or 16    authorized personnel.17    (e) Examination report.

The report of examination must be 26verified by the oath of the examiner in charge thereof, and   10400HB3799ham001- 9 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1when so verified is prima facie evidence in any action or 2proceeding in the name of the State against the examinee, its 3officers, directors, or agents upon the facts stated therein.4    (f) Examinee response to examination report. The 5Department and the examinee shall comply with the following 6timeline, unless a mutual agreement is reached to modify the 7timeline:8        (1) The Department shall deliver a draft report to the 9    examinee as soon as reasonably practicable. Nothing in 10    this Section prevents the Department from sharing an 11    earlier draft of the report with the examinee before 12    confirming that the examination is completed.13        (2) If the examinee chooses to respond with written 14    submissions or rebuttals, then the examinee must do so 15    within 30 days after receipt of any draft report delivered 16    after the completion of the examination.17        (3) As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of 18    any written submissions or rebuttals, the Department shall 19    issue a final report. Whenever the Department has made 20    substantive changes to a previously shared draft report, 21    unless those changes remove part or all of an alleged 22    violation or were proposed by the examinee, the Department 23    shall deliver the revised version to the examinee as a new 24    draft and shall allow the examinee 30 days to respond 25    before the Department issues a final report.26        (4) The examinee shall, within 10 days after the   10400HB3799ham001- 10 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1    issuance of the final report, accept the final report or 2    request a hearing in writing, unless granted an extension 3    by mutual agreement. Failure to take either action within 4    10 days or the mutually agreed extension shall be deemed 5    an acceptance of the final report. If the examinee accepts 6    the examination report, the Director shall continue to 7    hold the content of the examination report as private and 8    confidential for a period of 30 days.

If the examinee does not sign the order or request a 19    hearing on the proposed actions or the final report within 20    10 days, the Director may issue a final order imposing the 21    sanctions or corrective actions. Nothing in this Section 22    prevents the Department from sharing an earlier draft of 23    the proposed order with the examinee before issuing the 24    final report.25        (6) If the examinee accepts the order and the final 26    report, the Director shall hold the content of the order   10400HB3799ham001- 20 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1    and report as private and confidential for a period of 30 2    days.

Amend House Bill 3799 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 5. The Illinois Insurance Code is amended by 5changing Sections 132, 132.3, 143.15, and 143.17 and by adding 6Article XLVIII as follows: 7    (215 ILCS 5/132)  (from Ch. 73, par. 744)8    Sec. 132.

"Data call" does not 15include an information request in a market conduct action or 16any data or information that the Director shall or may   10400HB3799ham001- 2 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1specifically require under any other law, except as provided 2by the other law. 3    "Desk examination" means an examination that is conducted 4by market conduct surveillance personnel at a location other 5than the regulated company's or person's premises.

The 22Department's consumer complaint process outlined in 50 Ill. 23Adm. Code 926 is not a market conduct action for purposes of 24this Section; however, the Department may initiate market 25conduct actions based on information gathered during that 26process.

The Director shall use the most 23    recent NAIC Market Regulation Handbook as a guide in 24    performing market analysis. The Director may also employ 25    other guidelines or procedures as the Director may deem 26    appropriate.  10400HB3799ham001- 6 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1        (2) The Director may initiate a market conduct action 2    subject to the following:3            (A) If the Director determines that further 4        inquiry into a particular person or practice is 5        needed, then the Director may consider undertaking a 6        market conduct action. The Director shall inform the 7        examinee of the initiation of the market conduct 8        action and shall use the most recent NAIC Market 9        Regulation Handbook as a guide in performing the 10        market conduct action. The Director may also employ 11        other guidelines or procedures as the Director may 12        deem appropriate.13            (B) For an examination, the Director shall conduct 14        a pre-examination conference with the examinee to 15        clarify expectations before commencement of the 16        examination. At the pre-examination conference, the 17        Director or the market conduct surveillance personnel 18        shall disclose the basis of the examination, including 19        the statutes, regulations, or business practices at 20        issue. The Director shall provide at least 30 days' 21        advance notice of the date of the pre-examination 22        conference unless circumstances warrant that the 23        examination proceed more quickly.24            (C) The Director may coordinate a market conduct 25        action and findings of this State with market conduct 26        actions and findings of other states.   10400HB3799ham001- 7 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1        (3) Nothing in this Section requires the Director to 2    undertake market analysis before initiating any market 3    conduct action.4        (4) Nothing in this Section restricts the Director to 5    the type of market conduct action he or she initially 6    selected.7        (5) A regulated person is required to respond to a 8    market analysis data call or to an information request in 9    a market conduct action on the terms and conditions 10    established by the Director. The Department shall 11    establish reasonable timelines that are commensurate with 12    the volume and nature of the data required to be collected 13    in the information request.14        (6) Without limiting the contents of any examination 15    report, market conduct actions taken as a result of a 16    market analysis shall focus primarily on the general 17    business practices and compliance activities of companies 18    or persons rather than identifying infrequent or 19    unintentional random errors that do not cause significant 20    consumer harm. The Director may give a company or person 21    an opportunity to resolve matters that are identified as a 22    result of a market analysis to the Director's satisfaction 23    before undertaking a market conduct action against the 24    company or person. 25    (d) Access to books and records. Every examinee and its 26officers, directors, and agents must provide to the Director   10400HB3799ham001- 8 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1convenient and free access at all reasonable hours at its 2office or location to all books, records, and documents and 3any or all papers relating to the business, performance, 4operations, and affairs of the examinee or its affiliates. The 5officers, directors, and agents of the examinee must 6facilitate the market conduct action and aid in the action so 7far as it is in their power to do so. The Director and any 8authorized market conduct surveillance personnel have the 9power to administer oaths and examine under oath any person 10relevant to the business of the examinee. A failure to produce 11requested books, records, or documents by the deadline shall 12not be a violation until after the later of:13        (1) 5 business days after the initial response 14    deadline set by the Director or authorized personnel; or15        (2) an extended deadline granted by the Director or 16    authorized personnel.17    (e) Examination report.

The report of examination must be 26verified by the oath of the examiner in charge thereof, and   10400HB3799ham001- 9 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1when so verified is prima facie evidence in any action or 2proceeding in the name of the State against the examinee, its 3officers, directors, or agents upon the facts stated therein.4    (f) Examinee response to examination report. The 5Department and the examinee shall comply with the following 6timeline, unless a mutual agreement is reached to modify the 7timeline:8        (1) The Department shall deliver a draft report to the 9    examinee as soon as reasonably practicable. Nothing in 10    this Section prevents the Department from sharing an 11    earlier draft of the report with the examinee before 12    confirming that the examination is completed.13        (2) If the examinee chooses to respond with written 14    submissions or rebuttals, then the examinee must do so 15    within 30 days after receipt of any draft report delivered 16    after the completion of the examination.17        (3) As soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of 18    any written submissions or rebuttals, the Department shall 19    issue a final report. Whenever the Department has made 20    substantive changes to a previously shared draft report, 21    unless those changes remove part or all of an alleged 22    violation or were proposed by the examinee, the Department 23    shall deliver the revised version to the examinee as a new 24    draft and shall allow the examinee 30 days to respond 25    before the Department issues a final report.26        (4) The examinee shall, within 10 days after the   10400HB3799ham001- 10 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1    issuance of the final report, accept the final report or 2    request a hearing in writing, unless granted an extension 3    by mutual agreement. Failure to take either action within 4    10 days or the mutually agreed extension shall be deemed 5    an acceptance of the final report. If the examinee accepts 6    the examination report, the Director shall continue to 7    hold the content of the examination report as private and 8    confidential for a period of 30 days.

No 13    corrective action, including a penalty, shall be ordered 14    with respect to violations in transactions with consumers 15    or other entities that are isolated occurrences or that 16    occur with such low frequency as to fall below a 17    reasonable margin of error. Such actions include, but are 18    not limited to:19            (A) requiring the regulated person to undertake 20        corrective actions to cease and desist an identified 21        violation or institute processes and practices to 22        comply with applicable standards;23            (B) requiring reimbursement or restitution of any 24        actual losses or damages to persons harmed by the 25        regulated person's violation with interest from the 26        date that the actual loss or damage was incurred,   10400HB3799ham001- 18 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1        which shall be calculated at the SOFR rate applicable 2        on the date that the actual loss or damage was incurred 3        plus 2%; and4            (C) imposing civil penalties as provided in this 5        subsection (j).6        (2) The Director may order a penalty of up to $2,000 7    for each violation of any law, rule, or prior lawful order 8    of the Director.

If the examinee does not sign the order or request a 19    hearing on the proposed actions or the final report within 20    10 days, the Director may issue a final order imposing the 21    sanctions or corrective actions. Nothing in this Section 22    prevents the Department from sharing an earlier draft of 23    the proposed order with the examinee before issuing the 24    final report.25        (6) If the examinee accepts the order and the final 26    report, the Director shall hold the content of the order   10400HB3799ham001- 20 -LRB104 11270 BAB 22933 a1    and report as private and confidential for a period of 30 2    days.

The Director's order is a final administrative 21    decision and shall be served upon the examinee together 22    with a copy of the final report within 90 days after the 23    conclusion of the hearing or within 10 days after the 24    examinee's acceptance of the proposed order and final 25    report, as applicable.
