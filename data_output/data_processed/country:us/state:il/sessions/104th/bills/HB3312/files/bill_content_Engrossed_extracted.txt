The General 11Assembly further finds the following:12        (1) implementing building energy and water use data 13    access legislation catalyzes the development of a strong 14    market for building energy services which will positively 15    impact the State's economy through significant job growth;16        (2) improving the energy and water use efficiency of 17    the existing building stock is a key strategy to help 18    preserve the affordability of rental housing;19        (3) energy and water use reductions stemming from data 20    access can result in direct cost savings to customers and 21    in peak load reductions that benefit all ratepayers;22        (4) data access programs allow utilities to maximize 23    the value of their energy and water use efficiency   HB3312 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 08506 AAS 18558 b1    portfolio by engaging customers and directing them to 2    energy and water efficiency programs and by enabling 3    utilities to target low-performing buildings;4        (5) implementing building data access enables building 5    owners in the State to qualify for certain federal and 6    other incentives to help them improve their assets;7        (6) energy and water use data access is the foundation 8    of a successful efficiency strategy and enables building 9    owners to track energy and water use performance over 10    time, set performance goals, and justify cost-effective 11    energy and water use upgrades; and12        (7) absent whole-building energy and water use data 13    access legislation, building owners lack an efficient, 14    defined process to obtain energy and water performance of 15    their buildings in a manner that protects consumer 16    confidentiality. 17    Section 10.
