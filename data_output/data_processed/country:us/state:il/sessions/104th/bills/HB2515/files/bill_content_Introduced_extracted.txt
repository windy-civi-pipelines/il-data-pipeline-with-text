The allotment shall be apportioned among the 8several counties in the State in the proportion which the 9total mileage of township or district roads in the respective 10counties bears to the total mileage of all township and 11district roads in the State. Funds allotted to the respective 12counties for the use of road districts therein shall be 13allocated to the several road districts in the county in the 14proportion which the total mileage of such township or 15district roads in the respective road districts bears to the 16total mileage of all such township or district roads in the 17county. After July 1 of any year prior to 2011, no allocation 18shall be made for any road district unless it levied a tax for 19road and bridge purposes in an amount which will require the 20extension of such tax against the taxable property in any such 21road district at a rate of not less than either .08% of the 22value thereof, based upon the assessment for the year 23immediately prior to the year in which such tax was levied and 24as equalized by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage 25County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of 26road under the jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is   HB2515- 11 -LRB104 11984 RTM 22078 b1less. Beginning July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, an 2allocation shall be made for any road district if it levied a 3tax for road and bridge purposes. In counties other than 4DuPage County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the 5extension of the tax against the taxable property in the road 6district at a rate that is less than 0.08% of the value 7thereof, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 8prior to the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 9by the Department of Revenue, then the amount of the 10allocation for that road district shall be a percentage of the 11maximum allocation equal to the percentage obtained by 12dividing the rate extended by the district by 0.08%. In DuPage 13County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the extension of 14the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 15rate that is less than the lesser of (i) 0.08% of the value of 16the taxable property in the road district, based upon the 17assessment for the year immediately prior to the year in which 18such tax was levied and as equalized by the Department of 19Revenue, or (ii) a rate that will yield an amount equal to 20$12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road 21district, then the amount of the allocation for the road 22district shall be a percentage of the maximum allocation equal 23to the percentage obtained by dividing the rate extended by 24the district by the lesser of (i) 0.08% or (ii) the rate that 25will yield an amount equal to $12,000 per mile of road under 26the jurisdiction of the road district.   HB2515- 12 -LRB104 11984 RTM 22078 b1    Prior to 2011, if any road district has levied a special 2tax for road purposes pursuant to Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 36-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and such tax was levied in 4an amount which would require extension at a rate of not less 5than .08% of the value of the taxable property thereof, as 6equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue, or, in 7DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 8mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 9whichever is less, such levy shall, however, be deemed a 10proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 11road district for an allotment under this Section. Beginning 12in 2011 and thereafter, if any road district has levied a 13special tax for road purposes under Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 146-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and the tax was levied in 15an amount that would require extension at a rate of not less 16than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property of that road 17district, as equalized or assessed by the Department of 18Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater 19than $12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the 20road district, whichever is less, that levy shall be deemed a 21proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 22road district for a full, rather than proportionate, allotment 23under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is less 24than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property, or, in DuPage 25County if the levy for the special tax is less than the lesser 26of (i) 0.08% or (ii) $12,000 per mile of road under the   HB2515- 13 -LRB104 11984 RTM 22078 b1jurisdiction of the road district, and if the levy for the 2special tax is more than any other levy for road and bridge 3purposes, then the levy for the special tax qualifies the road 4district for a proportionate, rather than full, allotment 5under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is equal to 6or less than any other levy for road and bridge purposes, then 7any allotment under this Section shall be determined by the 8other levy for road and bridge purposes.9    Prior to 2011, if a township has transferred to the road 10and bridge fund money which, when added to the amount of any 11tax levy of the road district would be the equivalent of a tax 12levy requiring extension at a rate of at least .08%, or, in 13DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 14mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 15whichever is less, such transfer, together with any such tax 16levy, shall be deemed a proper compliance with this Section 17and shall qualify the road district for an allotment under 18this Section.19    In counties in which a property tax extension limitation 20is imposed under the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, 21road districts may retain their entitlement to a motor fuel 22tax allotment or, beginning in 2011, their entitlement to a 23full allotment if, at the time the property tax extension 24limitation was imposed, the road district was levying a road 25and bridge tax at a rate sufficient to entitle it to a motor 26fuel tax allotment and continues to levy the maximum allowable   HB2515- 14 -LRB104 11984 RTM 22078 b1amount after the imposition of the property tax extension 2limitation. Any road district may in all circumstances retain 3its entitlement to a motor fuel tax allotment or, beginning in 42011, its entitlement to a full allotment if it levied a road 5and bridge tax in an amount that will require the extension of 6the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 7rate of not less than 0.08% of the assessed value of the 8property, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 9preceding the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 10by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount 11equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of road under the 12jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is less.13    As used in this Section, the term "road district" means 14any road district, including a county unit road district, 15provided for by the Illinois Highway Code; and the term 16"township or district road" means any road in the township and 17district road system as defined in the Illinois Highway Code. 18For the purposes of this Section, "township or district road" 19also includes such roads as are maintained by park districts, 20forest preserve districts and conservation districts. The 21Department of Transportation shall determine the mileage of 22all township and district roads for the purposes of making 23allotments and allocations of motor fuel tax funds for use in 24road districts.25    Payment of motor fuel tax moneys to municipalities and 26counties shall be made as soon as possible after the allotment   HB2515- 15 -LRB104 11984 RTM 22078 b1is made. The treasurer of the municipality or county may 2invest these funds until their use is required and the 3interest earned by these investments shall be limited to the 4same uses as the principal funds.5(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 6102-699, eff. 4-19-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23.) 7    Section 10.

The allotment shall be apportioned among the 8several counties in the State in the proportion which the 9total mileage of township or district roads in the respective 10counties bears to the total mileage of all township and 11district roads in the State.

After July 1 of any year prior to 2011, no allocation 18shall be made for any road district unless it levied a tax for 19road and bridge purposes in an amount which will require the 20extension of such tax against the taxable property in any such 21road district at a rate of not less than either .08% of the 22value thereof, based upon the assessment for the year 23immediately prior to the year in which such tax was levied and 24as equalized by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage 25County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of 26road under the jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is   HB2515- 11 -LRB104 11984 RTM 22078 b1less. Beginning July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, an 2allocation shall be made for any road district if it levied a 3tax for road and bridge purposes. In counties other than 4DuPage County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the 5extension of the tax against the taxable property in the road 6district at a rate that is less than 0.08% of the value 7thereof, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 8prior to the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 9by the Department of Revenue, then the amount of the 10allocation for that road district shall be a percentage of the 11maximum allocation equal to the percentage obtained by 12dividing the rate extended by the district by 0.08%. In DuPage 13County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the extension of 14the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 15rate that is less than the lesser of (i) 0.08% of the value of 16the taxable property in the road district, based upon the 17assessment for the year immediately prior to the year in which 18such tax was levied and as equalized by the Department of 19Revenue, or (ii) a rate that will yield an amount equal to 20$12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road 21district, then the amount of the allocation for the road 22district shall be a percentage of the maximum allocation equal 23to the percentage obtained by dividing the rate extended by 24the district by the lesser of (i) 0.08% or (ii) the rate that 25will yield an amount equal to $12,000 per mile of road under 26the jurisdiction of the road district.   HB2515- 12 -LRB104 11984 RTM 22078 b1    Prior to 2011, if any road district has levied a special 2tax for road purposes pursuant to Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 36-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and such tax was levied in 4an amount which would require extension at a rate of not less 5than .08% of the value of the taxable property thereof, as 6equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue, or, in 7DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 8mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 9whichever is less, such levy shall, however, be deemed a 10proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 11road district for an allotment under this Section. Beginning 12in 2011 and thereafter, if any road district has levied a 13special tax for road purposes under Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 146-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and the tax was levied in 15an amount that would require extension at a rate of not less 16than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property of that road 17district, as equalized or assessed by the Department of 18Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater 19than $12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the 20road district, whichever is less, that levy shall be deemed a 21proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 22road district for a full, rather than proportionate, allotment 23under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is less 24than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property, or, in DuPage 25County if the levy for the special tax is less than the lesser 26of (i) 0.08% or (ii) $12,000 per mile of road under the   HB2515- 13 -LRB104 11984 RTM 22078 b1jurisdiction of the road district, and if the levy for the 2special tax is more than any other levy for road and bridge 3purposes, then the levy for the special tax qualifies the road 4district for a proportionate, rather than full, allotment 5under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is equal to 6or less than any other levy for road and bridge purposes, then 7any allotment under this Section shall be determined by the 8other levy for road and bridge purposes.9    Prior to 2011, if a township has transferred to the road 10and bridge fund money which, when added to the amount of any 11tax levy of the road district would be the equivalent of a tax 12levy requiring extension at a rate of at least .08%, or, in 13DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 14mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 15whichever is less, such transfer, together with any such tax 16levy, shall be deemed a proper compliance with this Section 17and shall qualify the road district for an allotment under 18this Section.19    In counties in which a property tax extension limitation 20is imposed under the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, 21road districts may retain their entitlement to a motor fuel 22tax allotment or, beginning in 2011, their entitlement to a 23full allotment if, at the time the property tax extension 24limitation was imposed, the road district was levying a road 25and bridge tax at a rate sufficient to entitle it to a motor 26fuel tax allotment and continues to levy the maximum allowable   HB2515- 14 -LRB104 11984 RTM 22078 b1amount after the imposition of the property tax extension 2limitation. Any road district may in all circumstances retain 3its entitlement to a motor fuel tax allotment or, beginning in 42011, its entitlement to a full allotment if it levied a road 5and bridge tax in an amount that will require the extension of 6the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 7rate of not less than 0.08% of the assessed value of the 8property, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 9preceding the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 10by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount 11equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of road under the 12jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is less.13    As used in this Section, the term "road district" means 14any road district, including a county unit road district, 15provided for by the Illinois Highway Code; and the term 16"township or district road" means any road in the township and 17district road system as defined in the Illinois Highway Code. 18For the purposes of this Section, "township or district road" 19also includes such roads as are maintained by park districts, 20forest preserve districts and conservation districts. The 21Department of Transportation shall determine the mileage of 22all township and district roads for the purposes of making 23allotments and allocations of motor fuel tax funds for use in 24road districts.25    Payment of motor fuel tax moneys to municipalities and 26counties shall be made as soon as possible after the allotment   HB2515- 15 -LRB104 11984 RTM 22078 b1is made. The treasurer of the municipality or county may 2invest these funds until their use is required and the 3interest earned by these investments shall be limited to the 4same uses as the principal funds.5(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 6102-699, eff. 4-19-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23.) 7    Section 10.
