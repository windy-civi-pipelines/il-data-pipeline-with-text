Each 7application shall contain or be verified by a written 8declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury. A 9taxpayer's signing a fraudulent application under this Act is 10perjury, as defined in Section 32-2 of the Criminal Code of 112012. The applications shall be clearly marked as applications 12for the Low-Income Senior Citizens Assessment Freeze Homestead 13Exemption and must contain a notice that any taxpayer who 14receives the exemption is subject to an audit by the Chief 15County Assessment Officer.16    Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, in 17counties having fewer than 3,000,000 inhabitants, if an 18applicant fails to file the application required by this 19Section in a timely manner and this failure to file is due to a 20mental or physical condition sufficiently severe so as to 21render the applicant incapable of filing the application in a 22timely manner, the Chief County Assessment Officer may extend 23the filing deadline for a period of 30 days after the applicant 24regains the capability to file the application, but in no case 25may the filing deadline be extended beyond 3 months of the 26original filing deadline.

In addition, in taxable year 1997, the applicant's 9exemption shall also include an amount equal to (i) the amount 10of any exemption denied to the applicant in taxable year 1995 11as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, as the base year, 12(ii) the amount of any exemption denied to the applicant in 13taxable year 1996 as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, 14as the base year, and (iii) the amount of the exemption 15erroneously denied for taxable year 1994.16    For purposes of this Section, a person who will be 65 years 17of age during the current taxable year shall be eligible to 18apply for the homestead exemption during that taxable year. 19Application shall be made during the application period in 20effect for the county of his or her residence. 21    The Chief County Assessment Officer may determine the 22eligibility of a life care facility that qualifies as a 23cooperative to receive the benefits provided by this Section 24by use of an affidavit, application, visual inspection, 25questionnaire, or other reasonable method in order to insure 26that the tax savings resulting from the exemption are credited   SB1643- 14 -LRB104 03826 HLH 13850 b1by the management firm to the apportioned tax liability of 2each qualifying resident. The Chief County Assessment Officer 3may request reasonable proof that the management firm has so 4credited that exemption.5    Except as provided in this Section, all information 6received by the chief county assessment officer or the 7Department from applications filed under this Section, or from 8any investigation conducted under the provisions of this 9Section, shall be confidential, except for official purposes 10or pursuant to official procedures for collection of any State 11or local tax or enforcement of any civil or criminal penalty or 12sanction imposed by this Act or by any statute or ordinance 13imposing a State or local tax. Any person who divulges any such 14information in any manner, except in accordance with a proper 15judicial order, is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.16    Nothing contained in this Section shall prevent the 17Director or chief county assessment officer from publishing or 18making available reasonable statistics concerning the 19operation of the exemption contained in this Section in which 20the contents of claims are grouped into aggregates in such a 21way that information contained in any individual claim shall 22not be disclosed.23    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for taxable 24year 2017 and thereafter, in counties of 3,000,000 or more 25inhabitants, the amount of the exemption shall be the greater 26of (i) the amount of the exemption otherwise calculated under   SB1643- 15 -LRB104 03826 HLH 13850 b1this Section or (ii) $2,000. 2    (c-5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each 3chief county assessment officer may approve this exemption for 4the 2020 taxable year, without application, for any property 5that was approved for this exemption for the 2019 taxable 6year, provided that: 7        (1) the county board has declared a local disaster as 8    provided in the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act 9    related to the COVID-19 public health emergency; 10        (2) the owner of record of the property as of January 11    1, 2020 is the same as the owner of record of the property 12    as of January 1, 2019; 13        (3) the exemption for the 2019 taxable year has not 14    been determined to be an erroneous exemption as defined by 15    this Code; and 16        (4) the applicant for the 2019 taxable year has not 17    asked for the exemption to be removed for the 2019 or 2020 18    taxable years. 19    Nothing in this subsection shall preclude or impair the 20authority of a chief county assessment officer to conduct 21audits of any taxpayer claiming an exemption under this 22Section to verify that the taxpayer is eligible to receive the 23exemption as provided elsewhere in this Section. 24    (c-10) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each 25chief county assessment officer may approve this exemption for 26the 2021 taxable year, without application, for any property   SB1643- 16 -LRB104 03826 HLH 13850 b1that was approved for this exemption for the 2020 taxable 2year, if:3        (1) the county board has declared a local disaster as 4    provided in the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act 5    related to the COVID-19 public health emergency;6        (2) the owner of record of the property as of January 7    1, 2021 is the same as the owner of record of the property 8    as of January 1, 2020;9        (3) the exemption for the 2020 taxable year has not 10    been determined to be an erroneous exemption as defined by 11    this Code; and12        (4) the taxpayer for the 2020 taxable year has not 13    asked for the exemption to be removed for the 2020 or 2021 14    taxable years.15    Nothing in this subsection shall preclude or impair the 16authority of a chief county assessment officer to conduct 17audits of any taxpayer claiming an exemption under this 18Section to verify that the taxpayer is eligible to receive the 19exemption as provided elsewhere in this Section. 20    (d) Each Chief County Assessment Officer shall annually 21publish a notice of availability of the exemption provided 22under this Section.
