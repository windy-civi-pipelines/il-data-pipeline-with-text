Amend House Bill 3762 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Workplace Extreme Temperature Safety Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds and 7declares:8    (a) As the frequency of extreme weather events continues 9to grow, workers are at an increased risk of serious injury or 10death. Heat stress or cold stress can occur at temperatures as 11low as 40 degrees Fahrenheit or as high as 78 degrees 12Fahrenheit, depending on the working conditions. Unaddressed, 13heat stress and cold stress can cause a range of serious 14conditions, including stroke and death if not treated 15properly. Heat-related injuries and fatalities may be 16underreported as heat stress exacerbates existing health   10400HB3762ham001- 2 -LRB104 12261 SPS 23953 a1problems, such as asthma, kidney failure, and heart disease, 2leading to potential comorbidities being reported. Workers in 3agriculture and construction are at the highest risk of 4weather-related injuries, but the problem affects all workers 5exposed to extreme temperatures, including indoor workers 6without adequately climate-controlled environments or 7appropriate personal protective equipment.8    (b) From 1979 to 2022, more than 14,000 Americans have 9died directly from heat-related causes, according to the 10United States Environmental Protection Agency.11    (c) In the absence of a temperature stress standard 12adopted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 13the Department of Labor should adopt a heat stress standard 14for the protection of employees against temperature-related 15hazards, illnesses, and injuries that affect employers and 16employees in this State in private and public employment. 17    Section 10. Definitions.18    "Acclimatization" means the body's temporary adaptation to 19work in heat that occurs as a person is exposed to extreme 20temperature over a period of 7 to 14 days depending on the 21amount of recent work in excessive heat and other factors. 22Acclimatization may be lost after 7 consecutive days away from 23working in the heat.24    "Cold-related illness" means a medical condition resulting 25from the body losing heat faster than it can produce heat   10400HB3762ham001- 3 -LRB104 12261 SPS 23953 a1creating a risk of severe injury, illness, or death.2    "Cold stress" means the net load to which a worker is 3exposed from the combined contributions of metabolic heat, 4environmental factors, including temperature, wind chill, and 5moisture, and personal protective equipment worn that results 6in a loss of heat to the body, causing body temperature to 7drop.8    "Director" means the Director of Labor or the Director's 9designee.10    "Department" means the Department of Labor.11    "Engineering controls" means the use of devices to reduce 12exposure to extreme temperatures. "Engineering controls" 13includes fans, heating stations, misting stations, and air 14conditioning. "Engineering controls" does not include wearable 15items. 16    "Employ" means to suffer or to permit to work.17    "Employee" means any individual employed by an employer.18    "Employer" means any individual, partnership, association, 19corporation, and the State and any county and municipality, 20and school district, agency, authority, department, bureau, or 21instrumentality thereof, acting directly or indirectly in the 22interest of an employer in relation to an employee.23    "Excessive cold" means levels of outdoor or indoor 24exposure to cold that exceed the capacities of the human body 25to maintain normal body functions.26    "Excessive heat" means levels of outdoor or indoor   10400HB3762ham001- 4 -LRB104 12261 SPS 23953 a1exposure to heat that exceed the capacities of the human body 2to maintain normal body functions.3    "Heat-related illness" means a medical condition resulting 4from the inability of the body to manage excess heat, 5including heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat 6syncope, and heat stroke.7    "Heat stress" means the net load to which a worker is 8exposed from the combined contributions of metabolic heat, 9environmental factors, and clothing worn which result in an 10increase in heat storage in the body, causing body temperature 11to rise to sometimes dangerous levels.12    "Interested party" means an organization that monitors or 13is attentive to compliance with public or worker safety or 14other statutory requirements."15    "Occupation" means any occupation, service, trade, 16business, industry or branch or group of industries, or 17employment or class of employment, in which employees are 18employed.19    "Occupational safety and health standard" means a rule 20that requires the following: a condition that is reasonably 21appropriate or necessary to make employment and places of 22employment safe and healthful; or the adoption or use of a 23means, method, operation, practice, or process that is 24reasonably appropriate or necessary to make employment and 25places of employment safe and healthful.   10400HB3762ham001- 5 -LRB104 12261 SPS 23953 a1    Section 15.

Amend House Bill 3762 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Workplace Extreme Temperature Safety Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds and 7declares:8    (a) As the frequency of extreme weather events continues 9to grow, workers are at an increased risk of serious injury or 10death. Heat stress or cold stress can occur at temperatures as 11low as 40 degrees Fahrenheit or as high as 78 degrees 12Fahrenheit, depending on the working conditions. Unaddressed, 13heat stress and cold stress can cause a range of serious 14conditions, including stroke and death if not treated 15properly. Heat-related injuries and fatalities may be 16underreported as heat stress exacerbates existing health   10400HB3762ham001- 2 -LRB104 12261 SPS 23953 a1problems, such as asthma, kidney failure, and heart disease, 2leading to potential comorbidities being reported. Workers in 3agriculture and construction are at the highest risk of 4weather-related injuries, but the problem affects all workers 5exposed to extreme temperatures, including indoor workers 6without adequately climate-controlled environments or 7appropriate personal protective equipment.8    (b) From 1979 to 2022, more than 14,000 Americans have 9died directly from heat-related causes, according to the 10United States Environmental Protection Agency.11    (c) In the absence of a temperature stress standard 12adopted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 13the Department of Labor should adopt a heat stress standard 14for the protection of employees against temperature-related 15hazards, illnesses, and injuries that affect employers and 16employees in this State in private and public employment. 17    Section 10. Definitions.18    "Acclimatization" means the body's temporary adaptation to 19work in heat that occurs as a person is exposed to extreme 20temperature over a period of 7 to 14 days depending on the 21amount of recent work in excessive heat and other factors. 22Acclimatization may be lost after 7 consecutive days away from 23working in the heat.24    "Cold-related illness" means a medical condition resulting 25from the body losing heat faster than it can produce heat   10400HB3762ham001- 3 -LRB104 12261 SPS 23953 a1creating a risk of severe injury, illness, or death.2    "Cold stress" means the net load to which a worker is 3exposed from the combined contributions of metabolic heat, 4environmental factors, including temperature, wind chill, and 5moisture, and personal protective equipment worn that results 6in a loss of heat to the body, causing body temperature to 7drop.8    "Director" means the Director of Labor or the Director's 9designee.10    "Department" means the Department of Labor.11    "Engineering controls" means the use of devices to reduce 12exposure to extreme temperatures. "Engineering controls" 13includes fans, heating stations, misting stations, and air 14conditioning. "Engineering controls" does not include wearable 15items. 16    "Employ" means to suffer or to permit to work.17    "Employee" means any individual employed by an employer.18    "Employer" means any individual, partnership, association, 19corporation, and the State and any county and municipality, 20and school district, agency, authority, department, bureau, or 21instrumentality thereof, acting directly or indirectly in the 22interest of an employer in relation to an employee.23    "Excessive cold" means levels of outdoor or indoor 24exposure to cold that exceed the capacities of the human body 25to maintain normal body functions.26    "Excessive heat" means levels of outdoor or indoor   10400HB3762ham001- 4 -LRB104 12261 SPS 23953 a1exposure to heat that exceed the capacities of the human body 2to maintain normal body functions.3    "Heat-related illness" means a medical condition resulting 4from the inability of the body to manage excess heat, 5including heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat 6syncope, and heat stroke.7    "Heat stress" means the net load to which a worker is 8exposed from the combined contributions of metabolic heat, 9environmental factors, and clothing worn which result in an 10increase in heat storage in the body, causing body temperature 11to rise to sometimes dangerous levels.12    "Interested party" means an organization that monitors or 13is attentive to compliance with public or worker safety or 14other statutory requirements."15    "Occupation" means any occupation, service, trade, 16business, industry or branch or group of industries, or 17employment or class of employment, in which employees are 18employed.19    "Occupational safety and health standard" means a rule 20that requires the following: a condition that is reasonably 21appropriate or necessary to make employment and places of 22employment safe and healthful; or the adoption or use of a 23means, method, operation, practice, or process that is 24reasonably appropriate or necessary to make employment and 25places of employment safe and healthful.   10400HB3762ham001- 5 -LRB104 12261 SPS 23953 a1    Section 15.
