Edgar González, Jr. SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act    Creates the Workplace Extreme Temperature Safety Act. Provides that the Director of Labor shall adopt rules to establish excessive heat and excessive cold standards. Sets forth temporary excessive heat and excessive cold standards. Provides that, on or before January 1, 2026, the Director shall establish by rule an occupational temperature-related illness and injury prevention plan. Sets forth provisions concerning retaliation; violations; penalties; and enforcement of the Act.LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b  A BILL FOR HB3762LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1    AN ACT concerning employment. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Workplace Extreme Temperature Safety Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds and 7declares:8    (a) As the frequency of extreme weather events continues 9to grow, workers are at an increased risk of serious injury or 10death. Heat stress or cold stress can occur at temperatures as 11low as 40 degrees Fahrenheit or as high as 78 degrees 12Fahrenheit, depending on the working conditions. Unaddressed, 13heat stress and cold stress can cause a range of serious 14conditions, including stroke and death if not treated 15properly. Heat related injuries and fatalities may be 16underreported as heat stress exacerbates existing health 17problems like asthma, kidney failure, and heart disease, 18leading to potential comorbidities being reported. Workers in 19agriculture and construction are at the highest risk of 20weather-related injuries, but the problem affects all workers 21exposed to extreme temperatures, including indoor workers 22without adequately climate-controlled environments or 23appropriate personal protective equipment.  HB3762- 2 -LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1    (b) From 1979 to 2022, more than 14,000 Americans have 2died directly from heat-related causes, according to the 3United States Environmental Protection Agency.4    (c) In the absence of a temperature stress standard 5adopted by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, 6the Department of Labor should adopt a heat stress standard 7for the protection of employees against temperature-related 8hazards, illness, and injury that effects employers and 9employees in this State in private and public employment. 10    Section 10. Definitions.11    "Acclimatization" means the body's temporary adaptation to 12work in heat that occurs as a person is exposed to extreme 13temperature over a period of 7 to 14 days depending on the 14amount of recent work in excessive heat and the individual 15factors. "Acclimatization" may be lost after 7 consecutive 16days away from working in the heat.17    "Cold-related illness" means a medical condition resulting 18from the body losing heat faster than it can produce heat 19creating a risk of severe injury, illness, or death.20    "Cold stress" means the net load to which a worker is 21exposed from the combined contributions of metabolic heat, 22environmental factors, including temperature, wind chill, and 23moisture, and personal protective equipment worn that results 24in a loss of heat to the body, causing body temperature to 25drop.  HB3762- 3 -LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1    "Director" means the Director of Labor, or the Director's 2designee.3    "Department" means the Department of Labor.4    "Engineering controls" means the use of devices to reduce 5exposure to extreme temperatures. "Engineering controls" 6includes fans, heating stations, misting stations, and air 7conditioning. "Engineering controls" does not include wearable 8items. 9    "Employ" means to suffer or to permit to work.10    "Employee" means any individual employed by an employer.11    "Employer" means any individual, partnership, association, 12corporation, and the State and any county and municipality, 13and school district, agency, authority, department, bureau, or 14instrumentality thereof, acting directly or indirectly in the 15interest of an employer in relation to an employee.16    "Excessive cold" means levels of outdoor or indoor 17exposure to cold that exceed the capacities of the human body 18to maintain normal body functions.19    "Heat-related illness" means a medical condition resulting 20from the inability of the body to manage excess heat, 21including heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat 22syncope, and heat stroke.23    "Excessive heat" means levels of outdoor or indoor 24exposure to heat that exceed the capacities of the human body 25to maintain normal body functions.26    "Heat stress" means the net load to which a worker is   HB3762- 4 -LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1exposed from the combined contributions of metabolic heat, 2environmental factors, and clothing worn which result in an 3increase in heat storage in the body, causing body temperature 4to rise to sometimes dangerous levels.5    "Occupation" means any occupation, service, trade, 6business, industry or branch or group of industries or 7employment or class of employment in which employees are 8employed.9    "Occupational safety and health standard" means a rule 10that requires the following: a condition that is reasonably 11appropriate or necessary to make employment and places of 12employment safe and healthful; or the adoption or use of a 13means, method, operation, practice, or process that is 14reasonably appropriate or necessary to make employment and 15places of employment safe and healthful. 16    Section 15. Establishment of excessive heat and cold 17standards.18    (a) The Director shall adopt rules to establish excessive 19heat standards. Until rules are adopted under this Section, 20excessive heat standards are as follows:21        (1) for an outdoor place of employment, the heat index 22    equals or exceeds 80 degrees Fahrenheit;23        (2) for an indoor place of employment:24            (A) the temperature equals or exceeds 80 degrees 25        Fahrenheit and the heat index equals or exceeds 85   HB3762- 5 -LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1        degrees Fahrenheit;2            (B) if employees wear clothing that restricts heat 3        removal, the temperature equals or exceeds 80 degrees 4        Fahrenheit; and5            (C) if employees work in a high radiant heat area, 6        the temperature equals or exceeds 80 degrees 7        Fahrenheit.8    For indoor and outdoor places of employment, if the heat 9index equals or exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit, employers shall 10implement additional workplace safety standards, including the 11possible utilization of personal protective equipment.12    (b) The Director shall adopt rules to establish excessive 13heat standards. Until rules are adopted under this Section, 14excessive heat standards are as follows:15        (1) for an outdoor place of employment, the wind chill 16    is equal or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit; 17        (2) for an indoor place of employment where heavy work 18    is performed, unless prohibited by process requirements, 19    the temperature is equal or below 60 degrees Fahrenheit; 20    and21        (3) for an indoor place of employment where light work 22    is performed, unless prohibited by process requirements, a 23    temperature is equal or below 65 degrees Fahrenheit.24    (c) Any temperature, heat index, or wind chill described 25in this Section shall be based on a measurement of the National 26Weather Service.   HB3762- 6 -LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1    Section 20.

Edgar González, Jr. SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act    Creates the Workplace Extreme Temperature Safety Act. Provides that the Director of Labor shall adopt rules to establish excessive heat and excessive cold standards. Sets forth temporary excessive heat and excessive cold standards. Provides that, on or before January 1, 2026, the Director shall establish by rule an occupational temperature-related illness and injury prevention plan. Sets forth provisions concerning retaliation; violations; penalties; and enforcement of the Act.LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b  A BILL FOR HB3762LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1    AN ACT concerning employment. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Workplace Extreme Temperature Safety Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds and 7declares:8    (a) As the frequency of extreme weather events continues 9to grow, workers are at an increased risk of serious injury or 10death. Heat stress or cold stress can occur at temperatures as 11low as 40 degrees Fahrenheit or as high as 78 degrees 12Fahrenheit, depending on the working conditions. Unaddressed, 13heat stress and cold stress can cause a range of serious 14conditions, including stroke and death if not treated 15properly. Heat related injuries and fatalities may be 16underreported as heat stress exacerbates existing health 17problems like asthma, kidney failure, and heart disease, 18leading to potential comorbidities being reported. Workers in 19agriculture and construction are at the highest risk of 20weather-related injuries, but the problem affects all workers 21exposed to extreme temperatures, including indoor workers 22without adequately climate-controlled environments or 23appropriate personal protective equipment.  HB3762- 2 -LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1    (b) From 1979 to 2022, more than 14,000 Americans have 2died directly from heat-related causes, according to the 3United States Environmental Protection Agency.4    (c) In the absence of a temperature stress standard 5adopted by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, 6the Department of Labor should adopt a heat stress standard 7for the protection of employees against temperature-related 8hazards, illness, and injury that effects employers and 9employees in this State in private and public employment. 10    Section 10. Definitions.11    "Acclimatization" means the body's temporary adaptation to 12work in heat that occurs as a person is exposed to extreme 13temperature over a period of 7 to 14 days depending on the 14amount of recent work in excessive heat and the individual 15factors. "Acclimatization" may be lost after 7 consecutive 16days away from working in the heat.17    "Cold-related illness" means a medical condition resulting 18from the body losing heat faster than it can produce heat 19creating a risk of severe injury, illness, or death.20    "Cold stress" means the net load to which a worker is 21exposed from the combined contributions of metabolic heat, 22environmental factors, including temperature, wind chill, and 23moisture, and personal protective equipment worn that results 24in a loss of heat to the body, causing body temperature to 25drop.  HB3762- 3 -LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1    "Director" means the Director of Labor, or the Director's 2designee.3    "Department" means the Department of Labor.4    "Engineering controls" means the use of devices to reduce 5exposure to extreme temperatures. "Engineering controls" 6includes fans, heating stations, misting stations, and air 7conditioning. "Engineering controls" does not include wearable 8items. 9    "Employ" means to suffer or to permit to work.10    "Employee" means any individual employed by an employer.11    "Employer" means any individual, partnership, association, 12corporation, and the State and any county and municipality, 13and school district, agency, authority, department, bureau, or 14instrumentality thereof, acting directly or indirectly in the 15interest of an employer in relation to an employee.16    "Excessive cold" means levels of outdoor or indoor 17exposure to cold that exceed the capacities of the human body 18to maintain normal body functions.19    "Heat-related illness" means a medical condition resulting 20from the inability of the body to manage excess heat, 21including heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, heat 22syncope, and heat stroke.23    "Excessive heat" means levels of outdoor or indoor 24exposure to heat that exceed the capacities of the human body 25to maintain normal body functions.26    "Heat stress" means the net load to which a worker is   HB3762- 4 -LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1exposed from the combined contributions of metabolic heat, 2environmental factors, and clothing worn which result in an 3increase in heat storage in the body, causing body temperature 4to rise to sometimes dangerous levels.5    "Occupation" means any occupation, service, trade, 6business, industry or branch or group of industries or 7employment or class of employment in which employees are 8employed.9    "Occupational safety and health standard" means a rule 10that requires the following: a condition that is reasonably 11appropriate or necessary to make employment and places of 12employment safe and healthful; or the adoption or use of a 13means, method, operation, practice, or process that is 14reasonably appropriate or necessary to make employment and 15places of employment safe and healthful. 16    Section 15. Establishment of excessive heat and cold 17standards.18    (a) The Director shall adopt rules to establish excessive 19heat standards. Until rules are adopted under this Section, 20excessive heat standards are as follows:21        (1) for an outdoor place of employment, the heat index 22    equals or exceeds 80 degrees Fahrenheit;23        (2) for an indoor place of employment:24            (A) the temperature equals or exceeds 80 degrees 25        Fahrenheit and the heat index equals or exceeds 85   HB3762- 5 -LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1        degrees Fahrenheit;2            (B) if employees wear clothing that restricts heat 3        removal, the temperature equals or exceeds 80 degrees 4        Fahrenheit; and5            (C) if employees work in a high radiant heat area, 6        the temperature equals or exceeds 80 degrees 7        Fahrenheit.8    For indoor and outdoor places of employment, if the heat 9index equals or exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit, employers shall 10implement additional workplace safety standards, including the 11possible utilization of personal protective equipment.12    (b) The Director shall adopt rules to establish excessive 13heat standards. Until rules are adopted under this Section, 14excessive heat standards are as follows:15        (1) for an outdoor place of employment, the wind chill 16    is equal or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit; 17        (2) for an indoor place of employment where heavy work 18    is performed, unless prohibited by process requirements, 19    the temperature is equal or below 60 degrees Fahrenheit; 20    and21        (3) for an indoor place of employment where light work 22    is performed, unless prohibited by process requirements, a 23    temperature is equal or below 65 degrees Fahrenheit.24    (c) Any temperature, heat index, or wind chill described 25in this Section shall be based on a measurement of the National 26Weather Service.   HB3762- 6 -LRB104 12261 SPS 22373 b1    Section 20.
