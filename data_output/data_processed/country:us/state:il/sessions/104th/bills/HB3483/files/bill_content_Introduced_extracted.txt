Short title. This Act may be cited as the Paid 5Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program Act. 6    Section 5. Declaration of policy and intent. 7    (a) Many employees do not have access to family and 8medical leave programs. Those who do may not be in a financial 9position to take family and medical leave that is unpaid, and 10employer-paid benefits that are available may meet only a 11relatively small part of this need. Therefore, it is the 12public policy of this State to protect working families 13against the economic hardship caused by the need to take time 14off from work for reasons such as caring for themselves or 15family members who are suffering from serious illness or 16caring for a newborn or a newly adopted child. Moreover, many 17women are single mothers or the primary breadwinners for their 18families. If any of these women take unpaid maternity leave, 19their families and Illinois suffer. However, the United States 20is the only industrialized nation in the world that does not 21have a mandatory workplace-based program for such income 22support. It is, therefore, desirable and necessary to develop 23systems that help families adapt to the competing interests of   HB3483- 2 -LRB104 11016 SPS 21098 b1work and home and that not only benefit workers but also 2benefit employers by reducing employee turnover and increasing 3worker productivity.4    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to create a 5paid family and medical leave insurance program to relieve 6this serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of 7Illinois families, to increase workplace productivity, and to 8alleviate the enormous and growing stress on working families 9of balancing the demands of work and family needs. 10    Section 10.

The paid family and 8medical leave requirements of this Act may be waived in a bona 9fide collective bargaining agreement, but only if the waiver 10is set forth explicitly in the agreement in clear and 11unambiguous terms and the employer offers an approved 12equivalent plan under Section 50.13    (h) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect the 14validity or change the terms of bona fide collective 15bargaining agreements in force on the effective date of this 16Act.

Effective immediately.LRB104 11016 SPS 21098 b  A BILL FOR HB3483LRB104 11016 SPS 21098 b1    AN ACT concerning employment. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the Paid 5Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program Act. 6    Section 5. Declaration of policy and intent. 7    (a) Many employees do not have access to family and 8medical leave programs. Those who do may not be in a financial 9position to take family and medical leave that is unpaid, and 10employer-paid benefits that are available may meet only a 11relatively small part of this need. Therefore, it is the 12public policy of this State to protect working families 13against the economic hardship caused by the need to take time 14off from work for reasons such as caring for themselves or 15family members who are suffering from serious illness or 16caring for a newborn or a newly adopted child. Moreover, many 17women are single mothers or the primary breadwinners for their 18families. If any of these women take unpaid maternity leave, 19their families and Illinois suffer. However, the United States 20is the only industrialized nation in the world that does not 21have a mandatory workplace-based program for such income 22support. It is, therefore, desirable and necessary to develop 23systems that help families adapt to the competing interests of   HB3483- 2 -LRB104 11016 SPS 21098 b1work and home and that not only benefit workers but also 2benefit employers by reducing employee turnover and increasing 3worker productivity.4    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to create a 5paid family and medical leave insurance program to relieve 6this serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of 7Illinois families, to increase workplace productivity, and to 8alleviate the enormous and growing stress on working families 9of balancing the demands of work and family needs. 10    Section 10.

If 24    documentation has been submitted, the Department or the 25    employer shall not request or require any other 26    documentation if the reason for the initial or subsequent   HB3483- 15 -LRB104 11016 SPS 21098 b1    claim for paid family and medical leave is related to the 2    same incident of violence or the same perpetrator of the 3    violence. The Department may require alternative 4    documentation where it is impractical or impossible to 5    acquire certification from the listed documents in this 6    paragraph.7        (4) For a claim under paragraph (6) of Section 17, one 8    of the following documents is acceptable for 9    certification: a copy of the family member's active duty 10    orders, other documentation issued by the U.S. Armed 11    Forces, or other documentation permitted by the 12    Department.13    (b) If an employer provides paid or unpaid leave, the 14employee may elect whether first to use the paid or unpaid 15leave or to receive paid family and medical leave benefits 16under this Act. An employee may not be required to use paid or 17unpaid leave provided by the employer if leave is provided by 18federal, State, or local law.19    (c) This Section does not limit an employee's right to 20take leave from employment under other laws or employer 21policy.22    (d) The eligibility of an individual for benefits is not 23affected by a strike or lockout at the factory, establishment, 24or other premises at which the individual is or was last 25employed.26    (e) An employee who has received benefits under this   HB3483- 16 -LRB104 11016 SPS 21098 b1Section may not lose any other employment benefits, including 2seniority or pension rights, accrued before the date that paid 3family and medical leave commenced. This Section does not 4entitle an employee to accrue employment benefits during a 5period of paid family and medical leave or to a right, benefit, 6or position of employment other than a right, benefit, or 7position to which the employee would have been entitled had 8the employee not taken paid family and medical leave.9    (f) Subject to the requirements of this Act, an individual 10shall be eligible to receive benefits under this Act if that 11individual has been paid during the individual's base period 12wages equal to not less than $1,600, provided that the 13individual has been paid wages equal to at least $440 during 14that part of the individual's base period which does not 15include the calendar quarter in which the wages paid to the 16individual were highest. "Base period" means the first 4 of 17the last 5 completed calendar quarters immediately preceding 18the Sunday immediately preceding the first day that family and 19medical leave under this Act commences for the covered 20individual. If an individual is not eligible to receive paid 21family and medical leave benefits or an individual's weekly 22benefit amount would be lower using the base period, a base 23period consisting of the last 4 completed quarters immediately 24preceding the Sunday immediately preceding the first day that 25paid family and medical leave under this Act commences shall 26be used to establish eligibility or a higher weekly benefit   HB3483- 17 -LRB104 11016 SPS 21098 b1amount for the covered individual.2    (g) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to interfere with, 3impede, or in any way diminish the right of individuals to 4bargain collectively with their employers through 5representatives of their own choosing in order to establish 6wages or other conditions of work in excess of the applicable 7minimum standards established in this Act. The paid family and 8medical leave requirements of this Act may be waived in a bona 9fide collective bargaining agreement, but only if the waiver 10is set forth explicitly in the agreement in clear and 11unambiguous terms and the employer offers an approved 12equivalent plan under Section 50.13    (h) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect the 14validity or change the terms of bona fide collective 15bargaining agreements in force on the effective date of this 16Act. After that date, the requirements of this Act may be 17waived in a bona fide collective bargaining agreement, but 18only in accordance with subsection (g).19    (i) This Section does not create a continuing entitlement 20or contractual right.21    (j) Nothing in the Section shall limit the eligibility of 22an employee for benefits upon the change of employment as long 23as the employee remains an employee or has been employed by any 24employer in the State of Illinois within the 2 quarters 25preceding his or her submission of a claim for paid family and 26medical leave.   HB3483- 18 -LRB104 11016 SPS 21098 b1    Section 25.

The 24termination may not take effect sooner than 30 days after the 25notice is filed and may not be filed while the self-employed   HB3483- 19 -LRB104 11016 SPS 21098 b1individual is on leave approved under this Act. If termination 2is permitted, the Department may waive the requirements in 3subsection (a) that a self-employed individual submit payroll 4deductions as an employee and employer for a minimum period of 53 years. Once a self-employed individual terminates coverage, 6the individual shall be disqualified from seeking another 7election of coverage as a self-employed individual for a 8period of 2 years unless he or she can demonstrate a bona fide 9change in employment status resulting in the need for a 10subsequent election within those 2 years.11    (c) A self-employed individual who has elected to be 12covered may terminate coverage based upon the filing of a 13voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy petition.

All interest 12that accrues on moneys in the Fund shall be credited to the 13Fund. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to prohibit an 14employer from providing additional voluntary employer 15contributions toward the cost of benefits provided under this 16Act. These voluntary contributions may be in addition to 17employee payroll deductions or used to replace in whole or in 18part employee payroll deductions.19    (b) The Department shall by rule provide for the 20collection of premium contributions. The amount of the premium 21contribution imposed under this Section, less refunds 22authorized by this Act, and all assessments and penalties 23collected under this Act shall be deposited into and credited 24to the Fund.25        (1) Beginning January 1, 2027, the combined premium   HB3483- 21 -LRB104 11016 SPS 21098 b1    contribution shall be 1.12% of wages.2        (2) At no time shall the combined premium contribution 3    be greater than 1.25% of wages.4        (3) Beginning January 1, 2027, an employer shall 5    retain from all employees a payroll premium deduction in 6    the amount of 40% of the total premium contribution amount 7    established by the actuarial analysis as a percentage of 8    wages for all employees and an employer with 25 or more 9    employees shall pay the remaining 60% of the premium 10    contribution.11        (4) Beginning January 1, 2029, an employer shall 12    retain from all employees a payroll premium deduction in 13    the amount of 40% of the total premium contribution amount 14    established by the actuarial analysis as a percentage of 15    wages for all employees and an employer with one or more 16    employees shall pay the remaining 60% of the premium 17    contribution.

The Advisory Board shall 17continuously evaluate the program to determine what barriers 18to access or other inequities may exist within its 19administration, including evaluating program uptake to ensure 20low-income and middle-income workers are participating in the 21program. The Advisory Board shall make recommendations for 22improvements to the program, as appropriate, including, but 23not limited to, the appropriate and sustainable number of 24weeks of leave allowed, the rates of wage replacement and 25premium contributions, and any recommended wage exemptions or 26caps.  HB3483- 23 -LRB104 11016 SPS 21098 b1    (d) The Advisory Board shall include and represent the 2diversity of workers, business, self-employed individuals, and 3advocacy organizations in Illinois.
