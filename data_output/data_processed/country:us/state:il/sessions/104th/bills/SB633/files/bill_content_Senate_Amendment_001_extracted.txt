The Illinois Municipal Code is amended by 11changing Sections 10-1-7.1 and 10-2.1-6.3 as follows: 12    (65 ILCS 5/10-1-7.1)13    Sec. 10-1-7.1. Original appointments; full-time fire 14department.15    (a) Applicability. Unless a commission elects to follow 16the provisions of Section 10-1-7.2, this Section shall apply 17to all original appointments to an affected full-time fire 18department. Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 19be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 20years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 2197-251).22    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law 23to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 24department to which this Section applies shall be administered   10400SB0633sam001- 25 -LRB104 06911 RTM 24932 a1in the manner provided for in this Section. Provisions of the 2Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 3adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 4initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 5continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 6Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 7and any other law, this Section shall control.8    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 9administer its fire department process for original 10appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 11Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 12Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 13concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 14functions exercised by the State.15    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 16consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 17fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 18Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 19Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree. 20    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 21(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 22than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 23    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 24to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 25eligibles established in accordance with the processes 26established by this Section.

If the appointing authority has reason to 12conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 13minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 14authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 15the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 16the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 17either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 18register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 19highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 20of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 21eligibles is less than 5 people.22    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 23losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 24candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 25by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 26not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in   10400SB0633sam001- 27 -LRB104 06911 RTM 24932 a1future examinations, including an examination held during the 2time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 3eligibles.4    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 5shall be vested in the Civil Service Commission.

Each person who accepts a certificate of 19appointment and successfully completes his or her probationary 20period shall be enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular 21member of the fire department.22    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 23person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the 24effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 25department or fire protection district or employed by a State 26university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter   10400SB0633sam001- 28 -LRB104 06911 RTM 24932 a1duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 2persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 3reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call 4firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 5employees of a fire department or fire protection district who 6are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 7elected officials.8    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 9The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 10identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 11aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 12of members of the fire department in order to provide the 13highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 14applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 15department shall be subject to examination and testing which 16shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 17unless the municipality shall by ordinance limit applicants to 18residents of the municipality, county or counties in which the 19municipality is located, State, or nation.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 19Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 20extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 21employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 22sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 23hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 24licensure.25    In the event that any applicant who has been found 26eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon   10400SB0633sam001- 31 -LRB104 06911 RTM 24932 a1the final eligibility register provided for in this Division 1 2has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 3year after the date of his or her physical ability 4examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 5be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 6her appointment.

The Fire Protection District Act is amended by 2changing Section 16.06b as follows: 3    (70 ILCS 705/16.06b)4    Sec. 16.06b. Original appointments; full-time fire 5department.6    (a) Applicability. Unless a commission elects to follow 7the provisions of Section 16.06c, this Section shall apply to 8all original appointments to an affected full-time fire 9department. Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 10be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 11years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 1297-251).13    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law 14to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 15department to which this Section applies shall be administered 16in a no less stringent manner than the manner provided for in 17this Section. Provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code, Fire 18Protection District Act, fire district ordinances, and rules 19adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 20initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 21continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 22Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 23and any other law, this Section shall control.24    A fire protection district that is operating under a court 25order or consent decree regarding original appointments to a   10400SB0633sam001- 65 -LRB104 06911 RTM 24932 a1full-time fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective 2date of Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of 3this Section for the duration of the court order or consent 4decree.5    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 6to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 7eligibles established in accordance with the processes 8required by this Section.

If the appointing authority has reason to 20conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 21minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 22authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 23the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 24the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 25either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 26register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5   10400SB0633sam001- 66 -LRB104 06911 RTM 24932 a1highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 2of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 3eligibles is less than 5 people.4    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 5losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 6candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 7by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 8not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 9future examinations, including an examination held during the 10time a candidate is already on the fire district's register of 11eligibles.12    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 13shall be vested in the board of fire commissioners, or board of 14trustees serving in the capacity of a board of fire 15commissioners.

Each person who accepts a certificate of 4appointment and successfully completes his or her probationary 5period shall be enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular 6member of the fire department.7    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 8person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the 9effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 10department or fire protection district or employed by a State 11university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 12duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 13persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 14reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call 15firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian 16employees of a fire department or fire protection district who 17are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 18elected officials.19    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 20The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 21identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 22aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 23of members of the fire department in order to provide the 24highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 25applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 26department shall be subject to examination and testing which   10400SB0633sam001- 68 -LRB104 06911 RTM 24932 a1shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 2unless the district shall by ordinance limit applicants to 3residents of the district, county or counties in which the 4district is located, State, or nation.
