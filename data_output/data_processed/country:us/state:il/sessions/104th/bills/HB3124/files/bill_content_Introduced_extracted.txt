The 22        addition modification required by this subparagraph 23        shall be reduced to the extent that dividends were 24        included in base income of the unitary group for the 25        same taxable year and received by the taxpayer or by a 26        member of the taxpayer's unitary business group   HB3124- 11 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1        (including amounts included in gross income under 2        Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal Revenue Code 3        and amounts included in gross income under Section 78 4        of the Internal Revenue Code) with respect to the 5        stock of the same person to whom the premiums and costs 6        were directly or indirectly paid, incurred, or 7        accrued.

However, for taxable years ending on or after 17    December 31, 1986, net operating loss carryforwards from 18    taxable years ending prior to December 31, 1986, may not 19    exceed the sum of federal taxable income for the taxable 20    year before net operating loss deduction, plus the excess 21    of addition modifications over subtraction modifications 22    for the taxable year. For taxable years ending prior to 23    December 31, 1986, taxable income may never be an amount 24    in excess of the net operating loss for the taxable year as 25    defined in subsections (c) and (d) of Section 172 of the   HB3124- 101 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1    Internal Revenue Code, provided that when taxable income 2    of a corporation (other than a Subchapter S corporation), 3    trust, or estate is less than zero and addition 4    modifications, other than those provided by subparagraph 5    (E) of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) for corporations or 6    subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of subsection (c) for 7    trusts and estates, exceed subtraction modifications, an 8    addition modification must be made under those 9    subparagraphs for any other taxable year to which the 10    taxable income less than zero (net operating loss) is 11    applied under Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code or 12    under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection 13    (e) applied in conjunction with Section 172 of the 14    Internal Revenue Code.15        (2) Special rule. For purposes of paragraph (1) of 16    this subsection, the taxable income properly reportable 17    for federal income tax purposes shall mean:18            (A) Certain life insurance companies.

In the case 26        of mutual insurance companies subject to the tax   HB3124- 102 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1        imposed by Section 831 of the Internal Revenue Code, 2        insurance company taxable income;3            (C) Regulated investment companies.

In the case of 8        a real estate investment trust subject to the tax 9        imposed by Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code, 10        real estate investment trust taxable income;11            (E) Consolidated corporations. In the case of a 12        corporation which is a member of an affiliated group 13        of corporations filing a consolidated income tax 14        return for the taxable year for federal income tax 15        purposes, taxable income determined as if such 16        corporation had filed a separate return for federal 17        income tax purposes for the taxable year and each 18        preceding taxable year for which it was a member of an 19        affiliated group. For purposes of this subparagraph, 20        the taxpayer's separate taxable income shall be 21        determined as if the election provided by Section 22        243(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code had been in 23        effect for all such years;24            (F) Cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative 25        corporation or association, the taxable income of such 26        organization determined in accordance with the   HB3124- 103 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1        provisions of Section 1381 through 1388 of the 2        Internal Revenue Code, but without regard to the 3        prohibition against offsetting losses from patronage 4        activities against income from nonpatronage 5        activities; except that a cooperative corporation or 6        association may make an election to follow its federal 7        income tax treatment of patronage losses and 8        nonpatronage losses. In the event such election is 9        made, such losses shall be computed and carried over 10        in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of Section 11        207 of this Act and apportioned by the apportionment 12        factor reported by the cooperative on its Illinois 13        income tax return filed for the taxable year in which 14        the losses are incurred. The election shall be 15        effective for all taxable years with original returns 16        due on or after the date of the election. In addition, 17        the cooperative may file an amended return or returns, 18        as allowed under this Act, to provide that the 19        election shall be effective for losses incurred or 20        carried forward for taxable years occurring prior to 21        the date of the election. Once made, the election may 22        only be revoked upon approval of the Director. The 23        Department shall adopt rules setting forth 24        requirements for documenting the elections and any 25        resulting Illinois net loss and the standards to be 26        used by the Director in evaluating requests to revoke   HB3124- 104 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1        elections. Public Act 96-932 is declaratory of 2        existing law; 3            (G) Subchapter S corporations. In the case of: (i) 4        a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 5        effect an election for the taxable year under Section 6        1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxable income 7        of such corporation determined in accordance with 8        Section 1363(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, except 9        that taxable income shall take into account those 10        items which are required by Section 1363(b)(1) of the 11        Internal Revenue Code to be separately stated; and 12        (ii) a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 13        effect a federal election to opt out of the provisions 14        of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 and have 15        applied instead the prior federal Subchapter S rules 16        as in effect on July 1, 1982, the taxable income of 17        such corporation determined in accordance with the 18        federal Subchapter S rules as in effect on July 1, 19        1982; and20            (H) Partnerships. In the case of a partnership, 21        taxable income determined in accordance with Section 22        703 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that taxable 23        income shall take into account those items which are 24        required by Section 703(a)(1) to be separately stated 25        but which would be taken into account by an individual 26        in calculating his taxable income.  HB3124- 105 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1        (3) Recapture of business expenses on disposition of 2    asset or business. Notwithstanding any other law to the 3    contrary, if in prior years income from an asset or 4    business has been classified as business income and in a 5    later year is demonstrated to be non-business income, then 6    all expenses, without limitation, deducted in such later 7    year and in the 2 immediately preceding taxable years 8    related to that asset or business that generated the 9    non-business income shall be added back and recaptured as 10    business income in the year of the disposition of the 11    asset or business. Such amount shall be apportioned to 12    Illinois using the greater of the apportionment fraction 13    computed for the business under Section 304 of this Act 14    for the taxable year or the average of the apportionment 15    fractions computed for the business under Section 304 of 16    this Act for the taxable year and for the 2 immediately 17    preceding taxable years.  18    (f) Valuation limitation amount.19        (1) In general. The valuation limitation amount 20    referred to in subsections (a)(2)(G), (c)(2)(I) and 21    (d)(2)(E) is an amount equal to:22            (A) The sum of the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 23        amounts (to the extent consisting of gain reportable 24        under the provisions of Section 1245 or 1250 of the 25        Internal Revenue Code) for all property in respect of   HB3124- 106 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1        which such gain was reported for the taxable year; 2        plus3            (B) The lesser of (i) the sum of the pre-August 1, 4        1969 appreciation amounts (to the extent consisting of 5        capital gain) for all property in respect of which 6        such gain was reported for federal income tax purposes 7        for the taxable year, or (ii) the net capital gain for 8        the taxable year, reduced in either case by any amount 9        of such gain included in the amount determined under 10        subsection (a)(2)(F) or (c)(2)(H).11        (2) Pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation amount.12            (A) If the fair market value of property referred 13        to in paragraph (1) was readily ascertainable on 14        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 15        amount for such property is the lesser of (i) the 16        excess of such fair market value over the taxpayer's 17        basis (for determining gain) for such property on that 18        date (determined under the Internal Revenue Code as in 19        effect on that date), or (ii) the total gain realized 20        and reportable for federal income tax purposes in 21        respect of the sale, exchange or other disposition of 22        such property.23            (B) If the fair market value of property referred 24        to in paragraph (1) was not readily ascertainable on 25        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 26        amount for such property is that amount which bears   HB3124- 107 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1        the same ratio to the total gain reported in respect of 2        the property for federal income tax purposes for the 3        taxable year, as the number of full calendar months in 4        that part of the taxpayer's holding period for the 5        property ending July 31, 1969 bears to the number of 6        full calendar months in the taxpayer's entire holding 7        period for the property.8            (C) The Department shall prescribe such 9        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the 10        purposes of this paragraph. 11    (g) Double deductions. Unless specifically provided 12otherwise, nothing in this Section shall permit the same item 13to be deducted more than once. 14    (h) Legislative intention. Except as expressly provided by 15this Section there shall be no modifications or limitations on 16the amounts of income, gain, loss or deduction taken into 17account in determining gross income, adjusted gross income or 18taxable income for federal income tax purposes for the taxable 19year, or in the amount of such items entering into the 20computation of base income and net income under this Act for 21such taxable year, whether in respect of property values as of 22August 1, 1969 or otherwise.23(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 24102-658, eff. 8-27-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-1112, eff.   HB3124- 108 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b112-21-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23; 103-478, eff. 1-1-24; 103-592, 2Article 10, Section 10-900, eff. 6-7-24; 103-592, Article 170, 3Section 170-90, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24; 103-647, 4eff. 7-1-24; revised 8-20-24.)

The addition modification 24        required by this subparagraph shall be reduced to the 25        extent that dividends were included in base income of 26        the unitary group for the same taxable year and   HB3124- 5 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1        received by the taxpayer or by a member of the 2        taxpayer's unitary business group (including amounts 3        included in gross income under Sections 951 through 4        964 of the Internal Revenue Code and amounts included 5        in gross income under Section 78 of the Internal 6        Revenue Code) with respect to the stock of the same 7        person to whom the interest was paid, accrued, or 8        incurred.9            This paragraph shall not apply to the following: 10                (i) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 11            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person who 12            is subject in a foreign country or state, other 13            than a state which requires mandatory unitary 14            reporting, to a tax on or measured by net income 15            with respect to such interest; or16                (ii) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 17            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 18            the taxpayer can establish, based on a 19            preponderance of the evidence, both of the 20            following:21                    (a) the person, during the same taxable 22                year, paid, accrued, or incurred, the interest 23                to a person that is not a related member, and24                    (b) the transaction giving rise to the 25                interest expense between the taxpayer and the 26                person did not have as a principal purpose the   HB3124- 6 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1                avoidance of Illinois income tax, and is paid 2                pursuant to a contract or agreement that 3                reflects an arm's-length interest rate and 4                terms; or 5                (iii) the taxpayer can establish, based on 6            clear and convincing evidence, that the interest 7            paid, accrued, or incurred relates to a contract 8            or agreement entered into at arm's-length rates 9            and terms and the principal purpose for the 10            payment is not federal or Illinois tax avoidance; 11            or 12                (iv) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 13            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 14            the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing 15            evidence that the adjustments are unreasonable; or 16            if the taxpayer and the Director agree in writing 17            to the application or use of an alternative method 18            of apportionment under Section 304(f). 19                Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the 20            Director from making any other adjustment 21            otherwise allowed under Section 404 of this Act 22            for any tax year beginning after the effective 23            date of this amendment provided such adjustment is 24            made pursuant to regulation adopted by the 25            Department and such regulations provide methods 26            and standards by which the Department will utilize   HB3124- 7 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1            its authority under Section 404 of this Act; 2            (D-18) An amount equal to the amount of intangible 3        expenses and costs otherwise allowed as a deduction in 4        computing base income, and that were paid, accrued, or 5        incurred, directly or indirectly, (i) for taxable 6        years ending on or after December 31, 2004, to a 7        foreign person who would be a member of the same 8        unitary business group but for the fact that the 9        foreign person's business activity outside the United 10        States is 80% or more of that person's total business 11        activity and (ii) for taxable years ending on or after 12        December 31, 2008, to a person who would be a member of 13        the same unitary business group but for the fact that 14        the person is prohibited under Section 1501(a)(27) 15        from being included in the unitary business group 16        because he or she is ordinarily required to apportion 17        business income under different subsections of Section 18        304. The addition modification required by this 19        subparagraph shall be reduced to the extent that 20        dividends were included in base income of the unitary 21        group for the same taxable year and received by the 22        taxpayer or by a member of the taxpayer's unitary 23        business group (including amounts included in gross 24        income under Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal 25        Revenue Code and amounts included in gross income 26        under Section 78 of the Internal Revenue Code) with   HB3124- 8 -LRB104 10028 HLH 20099 b1        respect to the stock of the same person to whom the 2        intangible expenses and costs were directly or 3        indirectly paid, incurred, or accrued. The preceding 4        sentence does not apply to the extent that the same 5        dividends caused a reduction to the addition 6        modification required under Section 203(a)(2)(D-17) of 7        this Act. As used in this subparagraph, the term 8        "intangible expenses and costs" includes (1) expenses, 9        losses, and costs for, or related to, the direct or 10        indirect acquisition, use, maintenance or management, 11        ownership, sale, exchange, or any other disposition of 12        intangible property; (2) losses incurred, directly or 13        indirectly, from factoring transactions or discounting 14        transactions; (3) royalty, patent, technical, and 15        copyright fees; (4) licensing fees; and (5) other 16        similar expenses and costs.
