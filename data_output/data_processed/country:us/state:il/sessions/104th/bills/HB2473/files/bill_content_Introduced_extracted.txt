The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law 17in each Member State, provided however that where the Rules of 18the Commission conflict with the laws of the Member State that 19establish the Member State's laws, regulations, and applicable 20standards that govern the practice of Social Work as held by a 21court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission 22shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the 23conflict.24    C.

If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States 5rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute 6or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact 7within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then 8such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Member 9State.10    E.

The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 11    of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 12    interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to 13    intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure 14    to provide the Commission service of process shall render 15    a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this 16    Compact, or promulgated Rules.17    B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination18        1. If the Commission determines that a Member State 19    has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 20    responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated 21    Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the 22    defaulting State.

If a State in default fails to cure the default, the 4defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an 5affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member 6States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on 7that State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective 8date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 9offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during 10the period of default. 11    D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be 12imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have 13been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall 14be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and 15minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the 16defaulting State's State Licensing Authority and each of the 17Member States' State Licensing Authority.18    E.

Upon the termination of a State's membership from this 23Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all 24Licensees within that State of such termination. The 25terminated State shall continue to recognize all licenses 26granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six (6)   HB2473- 43 -LRB104 09801 BDA 19867 b1months after the date of said notice of termination.2    G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a 3State that is found to be in default or that has been 4terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing 5between the Commission and the defaulting State.6    H.

The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of 11such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.12    I. Dispute Resolution13        1.

The 15administrator of the Data System shall promptly notify the 16Home State and all other Member State's of any Adverse Actions 17by Remote States.18    I.

The Commission shall, by majority vote of all members, 25take final action on the proposed Rule based on the Rulemaking 26record and the full text of the Rule.  HB2473- 39 -LRB104 09801 BDA 19867 b1        1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed 2    Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original 3    purpose of the proposed Rule.4        2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the 5    reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule 6    as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that 7    were recommended by commenters.8        3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable 9    effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as 10    provided in Section 12.L, the effective date of the rule 11    shall be no sooner than 30 days after issuing the notice 12    that it adopted or amended the Rule.13    L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 14Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 48 15hours' notice, with opportunity to comment, provided that the 16usual Rulemaking procedures provided in the Compact and in 17this section shall be retroactively applied to the Rule as 18soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than ninety 19(90) days after the effective date of the Rule. For the 20purposes of this provision, an emergency Rule is one that must 21be adopted immediately in order to:22        1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, 23    or welfare;24        2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Member State funds;25        3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a Rule that 26    is established by federal law or rule; or  HB2473- 40 -LRB104 09801 BDA 19867 b1        4. Protect public health and safety.2    M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the 3Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted Rule 4for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in 5format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public 6notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the 7Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any 8person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The 9revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision 10results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be 11made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to the 12end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision 13will take effect without further action. If the revision is 14challenged, the revision may not take effect without the 15approval of the Commission.16    N. No Member State's rulemaking requirements shall apply 17under this compact. 18    SECTION 13. OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT19    A. Oversight20        1. The executive and judicial branches of State 21    government in each Member State shall enforce this Compact 22    and take all actions necessary and appropriate to 23    implement the Compact.24        2. Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, venue 25    is proper and judicial proceedings by or against the   HB2473- 41 -LRB104 09801 BDA 19867 b1    Commission shall be brought solely and exclusively in a 2    court of competent jurisdiction where the principal office 3    of the Commission is located. The Commission may waive 4    venue and jurisdictional defenses to the extent it adopts 5    or consents to participate in alternative dispute 6    resolution proceedings. Nothing herein shall affect or 7    limit the selection or propriety of venue in any action 8    against a Licensee for professional malpractice, 9    misconduct or any such similar matter.10        3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 11    of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 12    interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to 13    intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure 14    to provide the Commission service of process shall render 15    a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this 16    Compact, or promulgated Rules.17    B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination18        1. If the Commission determines that a Member State 19    has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 20    responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated 21    Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the 22    defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the 23    default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any 24    other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer 25    training and specific technical assistance regarding the 26    default.  HB2473- 42 -LRB104 09801 BDA 19867 b1        2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice 2    of default to the other Member States.3    C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the 4defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an 5affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member 6States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on 7that State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective 8date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 9offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during 10the period of default. 11    D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be 12imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have 13been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall 14be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and 15minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the 16defaulting State's State Licensing Authority and each of the 17Member States' State Licensing Authority.18    E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all 19assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the 20effective date of termination, including obligations that 21extend beyond the effective date of termination.22    F. Upon the termination of a State's membership from this 23Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all 24Licensees within that State of such termination. The 25terminated State shall continue to recognize all licenses 26granted pursuant to this Compact for a minimum of six (6)   HB2473- 43 -LRB104 09801 BDA 19867 b1months after the date of said notice of termination.2    G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a 3State that is found to be in default or that has been 4terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing 5between the Commission and the defaulting State.6    H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the 7Commission by petitioning the8    U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the 9federal district where the Commission has its principal 10offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of 11such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.12    I. Dispute Resolution13        1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission 14    shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact 15    that arise among Member States and between Member and 16    non-Member States.17        2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing 18    for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for 19    disputes as appropriate.20    J. Enforcement21        1. By majority vote as provided by Rule, the 22    Commission may initiate legal action against a Member 23    State in default in the United States District Court for 24    the District of Columbia or the federal district where the 25    Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance 26    with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated   HB2473- 44 -LRB104 09801 BDA 19867 b1    Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive 2    relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is 3    necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs 4    of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. 5    The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of 6    the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other 7    remedies available under federal or the defaulting Member 8    State's law. 9        2. A Member State may initiate legal action against 10    the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District 11    of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission 12    has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the 13    provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The 14    relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 15    damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 16    the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 17    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.18        3. No person other than a Member State shall enforce 19    this compact against the Commission. 20    SECTION 14. EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT21    A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which 22the Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member 23State.24        1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the 25    Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each   HB2473- 45 -LRB104 09801 BDA 19867 b1    of the first seven Member States ("Charter Member States") 2    to determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter 3    Member State is materially different than the model 4    Compact statute.5            a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found 6        to be materially different from the model Compact 7        statute shall be entitled to the default process set 8        forth in Section 13.9            b. If any Member State is later found to be in 10        default, or is terminated or withdraws from the 11        Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and 12        the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number 13        of Member States should be less than seven.14        2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to 15    the seven initial Charter Member States shall be subject 16    to the process set forth in Section 10(C)(21) to determine 17    if their enactments are materially different from the 18    model Compact statute and whether they qualify for 19    participation in the Compact.20        3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission 21    or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of 22    the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or 23    the Commission coming into existence shall be considered 24    to be actions of the Commission unless specifically 25    repudiated by the Commission.26        4. Any State that joins the Compact subsequent to the   HB2473- 46 -LRB104 09801 BDA 19867 b1    Commission's initial adoption of the Rules and bylaws 2    shall be subject to the Rules and bylaws as they exist on 3    the date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. 4    Any Rule that has been previously adopted by the 5    Commission shall have the full force and effect of law on 6    the day the Compact becomes law in that State.7    B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by 8enacting a statute repealing the same.9        1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect 10    until 180 days after enactment of the repealing statute.11        2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing 12    requirement of the withdrawing State's Licensing Authority 13    to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action 14    reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the 15    effective date of withdrawal.16        3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from 17    this compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of 18    such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State. 19    Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the 20    contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to 21    recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this compact 22    for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of 23    withdrawal.24    C. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to 25invalidate or prevent any licensure agreement or other 26cooperative arrangement between a Member State and a   HB2473- 47 -LRB104 09801 BDA 19867 b1non-Member State that does not conflict with the provisions of 2this Compact.3    D. This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No 4amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding 5upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all 6Member States. 7    SECTION 15. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY8    A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority 9shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, 10and the implementation and administration of the Compact. 11Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring 12the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the 13Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.14    B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and 15if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact 16is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to 17the constitution of any Member State, a State seeking 18participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the 19applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or 20circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 21competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this 22Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 23agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.24    C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the 25Commission may deny a State's participation in the Compact or,   HB2473- 48 -LRB104 09801 BDA 19867 b1in accordance with the requirements of Section 13.B, terminate 2a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it 3determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State 4is a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this 5Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any 6Member State, the Compact shall remain in full force and 7effect as to the remaining Member States and in full force and 8effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable 9matters. 10    SECTION 16. CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER 11STATE LAWS12    A. A Licensee providing services in a Remote State under a 13Multistate Authorization to Practice shall adhere to the laws 14and regulations, including laws, regulations, and applicable 15standards, of the Remote State where the client is located at 16the time care is rendered.17    B. Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement 18of any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent 19with the Compact.20    C. Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal 21requirements in a Member State in conflict with the Compact 22are superseded to the extent of the conflict.23    D. All permissible agreements between the Commission and 24the Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.
