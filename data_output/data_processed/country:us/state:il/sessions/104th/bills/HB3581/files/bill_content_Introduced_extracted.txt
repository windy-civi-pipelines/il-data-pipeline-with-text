The allotment shall be apportioned among the 20several counties in the State in the proportion which the 21total mileage of township or district roads in the respective 22counties bears to the total mileage of all township and 23district roads in the State. Funds allotted to the respective 24counties for the use of road districts therein shall be 25allocated to the several road districts in the county in the 26proportion which the total mileage of such township or   HB3581- 10 -LRB104 06161 RTM 16195 b1district roads in the respective road districts bears to the 2total mileage of all such township or district roads in the 3county. After July 1 of any year prior to 2011, no allocation 4shall be made for any road district unless it levied a tax for 5road and bridge purposes in an amount which will require the 6extension of such tax against the taxable property in any such 7road district at a rate of not less than either .08% of the 8value thereof, based upon the assessment for the year 9immediately prior to the year in which such tax was levied and 10as equalized by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage 11County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of 12road under the jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is 13less. Beginning July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, an 14allocation shall be made for any road district if it levied a 15tax for road and bridge purposes. In counties other than 16DuPage County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the 17extension of the tax against the taxable property in the road 18district at a rate that is less than 0.08% of the value 19thereof, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 20prior to the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 21by the Department of Revenue, then the amount of the 22allocation for that road district shall be a percentage of the 23maximum allocation equal to the percentage obtained by 24dividing the rate extended by the district by 0.08%. In DuPage 25County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the extension of 26the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a   HB3581- 11 -LRB104 06161 RTM 16195 b1rate that is less than the lesser of (i) 0.08% of the value of 2the taxable property in the road district, based upon the 3assessment for the year immediately prior to the year in which 4such tax was levied and as equalized by the Department of 5Revenue, or (ii) a rate that will yield an amount equal to 6$12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road 7district, then the amount of the allocation for the road 8district shall be a percentage of the maximum allocation equal 9to the percentage obtained by dividing the rate extended by 10the district by the lesser of (i) 0.08% or (ii) the rate that 11will yield an amount equal to $12,000 per mile of road under 12the jurisdiction of the road district. 13    Prior to 2011, if any road district has levied a special 14tax for road purposes pursuant to Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 156-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and such tax was levied in 16an amount which would require extension at a rate of not less 17than .08% of the value of the taxable property thereof, as 18equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue, or, in 19DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 20mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 21whichever is less, such levy shall, however, be deemed a 22proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 23road district for an allotment under this Section. Beginning 24in 2011 and thereafter, if any road district has levied a 25special tax for road purposes under Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 266-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and the tax was levied in   HB3581- 12 -LRB104 06161 RTM 16195 b1an amount that would require extension at a rate of not less 2than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property of that road 3district, as equalized or assessed by the Department of 4Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater 5than $12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the 6road district, whichever is less, that levy shall be deemed a 7proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 8road district for a full, rather than proportionate, allotment 9under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is less 10than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property, or, in DuPage 11County if the levy for the special tax is less than the lesser 12of (i) 0.08% or (ii) $12,000 per mile of road under the 13jurisdiction of the road district, and if the levy for the 14special tax is more than any other levy for road and bridge 15purposes, then the levy for the special tax qualifies the road 16district for a proportionate, rather than full, allotment 17under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is equal to 18or less than any other levy for road and bridge purposes, then 19any allotment under this Section shall be determined by the 20other levy for road and bridge purposes.21    Prior to 2011, if a township has transferred to the road 22and bridge fund money which, when added to the amount of any 23tax levy of the road district would be the equivalent of a tax 24levy requiring extension at a rate of at least .08%, or, in 25DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 26mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district,   HB3581- 13 -LRB104 06161 RTM 16195 b1whichever is less, such transfer, together with any such tax 2levy, shall be deemed a proper compliance with this Section 3and shall qualify the road district for an allotment under 4this Section.5    In counties in which a property tax extension limitation 6is imposed under the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, 7road districts may retain their entitlement to a motor fuel 8tax allotment or, beginning in 2011, their entitlement to a 9full allotment if, at the time the property tax extension 10limitation was imposed, the road district was levying a road 11and bridge tax at a rate sufficient to entitle it to a motor 12fuel tax allotment and continues to levy the maximum allowable 13amount after the imposition of the property tax extension 14limitation. Any road district may in all circumstances retain 15its entitlement to a motor fuel tax allotment or, beginning in 162011, its entitlement to a full allotment if it levied a road 17and bridge tax in an amount that will require the extension of 18the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 19rate of not less than 0.08% of the assessed value of the 20property, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 21preceding the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 22by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount 23equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of road under the 24jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is less.25    As used in this Section, the term "road district" means 26any road district, including a county unit road district,   HB3581- 14 -LRB104 06161 RTM 16195 b1provided for by the Illinois Highway Code; and the term 2"township or district road" means any road in the township and 3district road system as defined in the Illinois Highway Code. 4For the purposes of this Section, "township or district road" 5also includes such roads as are maintained by park districts, 6forest preserve districts and conservation districts. The 7Department of Transportation shall determine the mileage of 8all township and district roads for the purposes of making 9allotments and allocations of motor fuel tax funds for use in 10road districts.11    Payment of motor fuel tax moneys to municipalities and 12counties shall be made as soon as possible after the allotment 13is made. The treasurer of the municipality or county may 14invest these funds until their use is required and the 15interest earned by these investments shall be limited to the 16same uses as the principal funds.17(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 18102-699, eff. 4-19-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23.) 19    Section 10.

If the levy for the special tax is equal to 18or less than any other levy for road and bridge purposes, then 19any allotment under this Section shall be determined by the 20other levy for road and bridge purposes.21    Prior to 2011, if a township has transferred to the road 22and bridge fund money which, when added to the amount of any 23tax levy of the road district would be the equivalent of a tax 24levy requiring extension at a rate of at least .08%, or, in 25DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 26mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district,   HB3581- 13 -LRB104 06161 RTM 16195 b1whichever is less, such transfer, together with any such tax 2levy, shall be deemed a proper compliance with this Section 3and shall qualify the road district for an allotment under 4this Section.5    In counties in which a property tax extension limitation 6is imposed under the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, 7road districts may retain their entitlement to a motor fuel 8tax allotment or, beginning in 2011, their entitlement to a 9full allotment if, at the time the property tax extension 10limitation was imposed, the road district was levying a road 11and bridge tax at a rate sufficient to entitle it to a motor 12fuel tax allotment and continues to levy the maximum allowable 13amount after the imposition of the property tax extension 14limitation. Any road district may in all circumstances retain 15its entitlement to a motor fuel tax allotment or, beginning in 162011, its entitlement to a full allotment if it levied a road 17and bridge tax in an amount that will require the extension of 18the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 19rate of not less than 0.08% of the assessed value of the 20property, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 21preceding the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 22by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount 23equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of road under the 24jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is less.25    As used in this Section, the term "road district" means 26any road district, including a county unit road district,   HB3581- 14 -LRB104 06161 RTM 16195 b1provided for by the Illinois Highway Code; and the term 2"township or district road" means any road in the township and 3district road system as defined in the Illinois Highway Code. 4For the purposes of this Section, "township or district road" 5also includes such roads as are maintained by park districts, 6forest preserve districts and conservation districts.
