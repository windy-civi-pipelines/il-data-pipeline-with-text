The Court may deny or 13    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 14    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 15    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 16    filing of the petition and the hearing.17    (d) Contents of petition.18        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 19    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 20    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 21    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 22    persons or the community, based on the specific 23    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.24        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 25    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 26    to present a verified application setting forth in detail   SB2341- 9 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 2    filing of the previous petition.3    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 4for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 5proving by clear and convincing evidence that:6        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 7    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 8    subsection (a), and9        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 10    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 11    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 12    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 13    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 14    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 15    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 16    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 17    1986, and18        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 19    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 20    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 21    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 22    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 23    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 24    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 25    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and26        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407   SB2341- 10 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 2    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 3    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 4    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 5    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 6    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 7    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 8    appear in court as required.9    (f) Conduct of the hearings.10        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 11    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 12    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 13    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 14    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 15    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 16    hearing.17        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 18    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.19        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 20    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 21    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 22    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 23    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 24    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 25    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 26    any hearing at which conditions of release or the   SB2341- 11 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 2    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 3    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 4    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 5    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 6    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 7    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 8        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 9    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 10    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 11    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 12    court determines that the physical health and safety of 13    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 14    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 15    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 16    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 17    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 18    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 19    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 20    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 21    Courts every 6 months. 22        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 23    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 24    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 25    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 26    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The   SB2341- 12 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 2    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 3    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 4    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 5    the court shall state on the record the reason for 6    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 7    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 8    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 9    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 10    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 11    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 12    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 13    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 14    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 15    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 16    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 17    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 18    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 19    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 20    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 21    criminal history, if available, and any written or 22    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 23    statements made by any person, if in the State's 24    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 25        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 26    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and   SB2341- 13 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 2    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 3    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 4    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 5    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 6    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 7    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.8        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 9    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 10    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 11    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 12    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 13    the defendant.14        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 15    release, and detention prior to trial must be 16    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 17    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 18    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 19    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 20dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 21defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 22person or persons or the community, based on the specific 23articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 24limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:25        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 26    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of   SB2341- 14 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.2        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 3    including:4            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 5        history indicative of violent, abusive, or assaultive 6        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 7        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 8        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 9        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.10            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 11        psychiatric or other similar social history which 12        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 13        nature, or lack of any such history.14        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 15    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 16    nature of the threat.17        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 18    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 19    them.20        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.21        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 22    complaining witness. 23        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 24    access to any weapon or weapons.25        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 26    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation,   SB2341- 15 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release, 2    or other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 3    appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under 4    federal or State state law.5        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 6    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 7    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 8    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 9    or lack of such behavior.10    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 11detention:12        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 13    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 14    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 15    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 16    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 17    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 18    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;19        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 20    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 21    pending trial;22        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 23    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 24    communication with others of his or her choice by 25    visitation, mail and telephone; and26        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as   SB2341- 16 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    required for appearances in connection with court 2    proceedings.3    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 4detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 5Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 6offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 7on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 8is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 9the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 10release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 11any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 12the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 13from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 14good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.15    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 16before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 17is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 18of any person or persons or the community, based on the 19specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 20defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 21    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 22entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 23denying his or her pretrial release.24    (k) Appeal. The State may appeal any order entered under 25this Section denying any motion for denial of pretrial 26release.  SB2341- 17 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    (l) Presumption of innocence. Nothing in this Section 2shall be construed as modifying or limiting in any way the 3defendant's presumption of innocence in further criminal 4proceedings.5    (m) Interest of victims. 6        (1) Crime victims shall be given notice by the State's 7    Attorney's office of this hearing as required in paragraph 8    (1) of subsection (b) of Section 4.5 of the Rights of Crime 9    Victims and Witnesses Act and shall be informed of their 10    opportunity at this hearing to obtain a protective order. 11        (2) If the defendant is denied pretrial release, the 12    court may impose a no contact provision with the victim or 13    other interested party that shall be enforced while the 14    defendant remains in custody. 15(Source: P.A. 102-1104, eff. 1-1-23; 103-822, eff. 1-1-25; 16revised 10-23-24.)

The Court may deny or 13    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 14    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 15    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 16    filing of the petition and the hearing.17    (d) Contents of petition.18        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 19    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 20    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 21    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 22    persons or the community, based on the specific 23    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.24        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 25    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 26    to present a verified application setting forth in detail   SB2341- 9 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 2    filing of the previous petition.3    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 4for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 5proving by clear and convincing evidence that:6        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 7    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 8    subsection (a), and9        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 10    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 11    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 12    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 13    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 14    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 15    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 16    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 17    1986, and18        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 19    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 20    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 21    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 22    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 23    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 24    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 25    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and26        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407   SB2341- 10 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 2    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 3    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 4    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 5    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 6    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 7    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 8    appear in court as required.9    (f) Conduct of the hearings.10        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 11    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 12    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 13    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 14    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 15    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 16    hearing.17        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 18    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.19        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 20    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 21    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 22    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 23    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 24    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 25    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 26    any hearing at which conditions of release or the   SB2341- 11 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 2    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 3    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 4    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 5    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 6    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 7    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 8        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 9    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 10    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 11    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 12    court determines that the physical health and safety of 13    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 14    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 15    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 16    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 17    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 18    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 19    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 20    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 21    Courts every 6 months. 22        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 23    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 24    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 25    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 26    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The   SB2341- 12 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 2    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 3    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 4    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 5    the court shall state on the record the reason for 6    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 7    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 8    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 9    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 10    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 11    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 12    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 13    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 14    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 15    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 16    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 17    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 18    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 19    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 20    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 21    criminal history, if available, and any written or 22    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 23    statements made by any person, if in the State's 24    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 25        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 26    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and   SB2341- 13 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 2    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 3    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 4    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 5    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 6    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 7    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.8        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 9    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 10    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 11    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 12    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 13    the defendant.14        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 15    release, and detention prior to trial must be 16    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 17    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 18    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 19    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 20dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 21defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 22person or persons or the community, based on the specific 23articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 24limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:25        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 26    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of   SB2341- 14 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.2        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 3    including:4            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 5        history indicative of violent, abusive, or assaultive 6        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 7        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 8        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 9        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.10            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 11        psychiatric or other similar social history which 12        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 13        nature, or lack of any such history.14        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 15    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 16    nature of the threat.17        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 18    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 19    them.20        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.21        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 22    complaining witness. 23        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 24    access to any weapon or weapons.25        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 26    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation,   SB2341- 15 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release, 2    or other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 3    appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under 4    federal or State state law.5        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 6    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 7    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 8    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 9    or lack of such behavior.10    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 11detention:12        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 13    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 14    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 15    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 16    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 17    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 18    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;19        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 20    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 21    pending trial;22        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 23    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 24    communication with others of his or her choice by 25    visitation, mail and telephone; and26        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as   SB2341- 16 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    required for appearances in connection with court 2    proceedings.3    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 4detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 5Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 6offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 7on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 8is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 9the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 10release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 11any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 12the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 13from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 14good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.15    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 16before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 17is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 18of any person or persons or the community, based on the 19specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 20defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 21    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 22entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 23denying his or her pretrial release.24    (k) Appeal. The State may appeal any order entered under 25this Section denying any motion for denial of pretrial 26release.  SB2341- 17 -LRB104 10656 RLC 20733 b1    (l) Presumption of innocence. Nothing in this Section 2shall be construed as modifying or limiting in any way the 3defendant's presumption of innocence in further criminal 4proceedings.5    (m) Interest of victims. 6        (1) Crime victims shall be given notice by the State's 7    Attorney's office of this hearing as required in paragraph 8    (1) of subsection (b) of Section 4.5 of the Rights of Crime 9    Victims and Witnesses Act and shall be informed of their 10    opportunity at this hearing to obtain a protective order. 11        (2) If the defendant is denied pretrial release, the 12    court may impose a no contact provision with the victim or 13    other interested party that shall be enforced while the 14    defendant remains in custody. 15(Source: P.A. 102-1104, eff. 1-1-23; 103-822, eff. 1-1-25; 16revised 10-23-24.)
