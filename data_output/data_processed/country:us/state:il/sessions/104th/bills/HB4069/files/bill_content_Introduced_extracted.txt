If, following the 18disclosure, the parties and lawyers agree, without 19participation by the Supreme Court Judge or court personnel, 20that the Supreme Court Judge should not be disqualified, the 21Supreme Court Judge may participate in the proceeding. The 22agreement shall be incorporated into the record of the 23proceeding.24    (d) Under this Section, a Supreme Court Judge is 25disqualified whenever the Supreme Court Judge's impartiality 26might reasonably be questioned, regardless of whether any of   HB4069- 8 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1the specific provisions of subsection (a) apply.2    (e) A Supreme Court Judge's obligation not to hear or 3decide matters in which disqualification is required applies 4regardless of whether a motion to disqualify is filed.5    (f) The rule of necessity may override the rule of 6disqualification. In matters that require immediate action, 7the Supreme Court Judge must disclose on the record the basis 8for possible disqualification.9    (g) The fact that a lawyer in a proceeding is affiliated 10with a law firm with which a relative of the Supreme Court 11Judge is affiliated does not itself disqualify the Supreme 12Court Judge. If, however, the Supreme Court Judge's 13impartiality might reasonably be questioned under subsection 14(a) or the relative is known by the Supreme Court Judge to have 15an interest in the law firm that could be substantially 16affected by the proceeding under subparagraph (C) of paragraph 17(2) of subsection (a), the Supreme Court Judge's 18disqualification is required.19    (h) A Supreme Court Judge shall disclose on the record 20information that the Supreme Court Judge believes the parties 21or their lawyers might reasonably consider relevant to a 22possible motion for disqualification, even if the Supreme 23Court Judge believes there is no basis for disqualification.24    (i) A Supreme Court Judge's use of social media or social 25networking platforms may create the appearance of a 26relationship between the Supreme Court Judge and litigants or   HB4069- 9 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1lawyers who may appear before the Supreme Court Judge. Whether 2a relationship would cause the Supreme Court Judge's 3impartiality to "reasonably be questioned" depends on the 4facts. While the labels used by the social media or social 5networking platform are not dispositive of the nature of the 6relationship, Supreme Court Judges shall consider the manner 7in which the rules on disqualification have been applied in 8traditional contexts and the additional ways in which social 9media or social networking platforms may amplify any 10connection to the Supreme Court Judge. 11    Section 15. Acceptance of gifts, loans, bequests, favors, 12benefits, or other things of value.13    (a) A covered person shall not accept any gifts, loans, 14bequests, benefits, favors, or other things of value, except 15as follows: 16        (1) any items or items from any one source during a 17    calendar year having a cumulative total value of less than 18    $100; 19        (2) gifts, loans, bequests, benefits, favors, or other 20    things of value from individuals whose relationship with 21    the covered person would require disqualification of the 22    Supreme Court Judge under Section 10;23        (3) ordinary social hospitality; 24        (4) commercial or financial opportunities and 25    benefits, including special pricing and discounts, and   HB4069- 10 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1    loans from lending institutions in their regular course of 2    business, if the same opportunities and benefits or loans 3    are made available on the same terms to similarly situated 4    persons who are not covered persons;5        (5) rewards and prizes given to competitors or 6    participants in random drawings, contests, or other events 7    that are open to persons who are not covered persons; 8        (6) scholarships, fellowships, and similar benefits or 9    awards, if they are available to similarly situated 10    persons who are not covered persons, based upon the same 11    terms and criteria; 12        (7) books, magazines, journals, audiovisual materials, 13    and other resource materials supplied by publishers on a 14    complimentary basis for official use; 15        (8) gifts incident to a public testimonial; 16        (9) invitations to a covered person or the guest of a 17    Supreme Court Judge to attend without charge: 18            (A) an event associated with a bar-related 19        function or other activity relating to the law, the 20        legal system, or the administration of justice; or 21            (B) an event associated with any of the Supreme 22        Court Judge's educational, religious, charitable, 23        fraternal, or civic activities permitted by the 24        Illinois Code of Judicial Conduct of 2023, if the same 25        invitation is offered to nonjudges who are engaged in 26        similar ways in the activity as is the Supreme Court   HB4069- 11 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1        Judge;2        (10) gifts, loans, bequests, benefits, favors, or 3    other things of value, only if the donor is not a party or 4    other person whose interests have come or are likely to 5    come before the Supreme Court Judge, including lawyers who 6    practice or have practiced before the Supreme Court Judge 7    or the cumulative total value of the gifts, loans, 8    bequests, benefits, favors, or other things of value is 9    less than $100 in a calendar year; and10        (11) gifts loans, bequests, benefits, favors, or other 11    things of value the acceptance of which is allowed under 12    subsection (c).13    (b) Whenever a covered person accepts a gift or other 14thing of value without paying fair market value, there is a 15risk that the benefit might be viewed as intended to influence 16the Supreme Court Judge's decision in a case. This Section 17prohibits the acceptance of benefits except in circumstances 18where the risk of improper influence is low. 19    (c) Gift giving between friends and relatives is a common 20occurrence and ordinarily does not create an appearance of 21impropriety or cause reasonable persons to believe that the 22Supreme Court Judge's independence, integrity, or impartiality 23has been compromised. In addition, when the appearance of 24friends or relatives in a case would require the Supreme Court 25Judge's disqualification under Section 10, there would be no 26opportunity for a gift to influence the Supreme Court Judge's   HB4069- 12 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1decision-making. Paragraph (2) of subsection (a) places no 2restrictions upon the ability of a covered person to accept 3gifts or other things of value from friends or relatives under 4these circumstances. 5    (d) Businesses and financial institutions frequently make 6available special pricing, discounts, and other benefits, 7either in connection with a temporary promotion or for 8preferred customers based upon longevity of the relationship, 9volume of business transacted, and other factors. A covered 10person may freely accept such benefits if they are available 11to the general public or if the covered person qualifies for 12the special price or discount according to the same criteria 13as are applied to persons who are not covered persons. 14    (e) This Section applies only to acceptance of gifts or 15other things of value by covered persons.16    (f) Contributions to a Supreme Court Judge's campaign for 17judicial office are governed by paragraph (6) of subsection 18(a) of Section 10 of this Act and the Illinois Code of Judicial 19Conduct of 2023. 20    (g) Disclosure of economic interests, including gifts, is 21governed by Sections 20 and 25. 22    Section 20. Reporting requirements.23    (a) A Supreme Court Judge shall file annually with the 24Clerk of the Illinois Supreme Court a verified written 25statement of economic interests on an Illinois Judicial   HB4069- 13 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1Statement of Economic Interests Form that is substantially 2similar to the form prescribed in Section 25.3    (b) The disclosure of economic interests under this 4Section is intended to (1) maintain and promote public 5confidence in the integrity, impartiality, fairness, and 6independence of the judiciary; (2) provide public information 7bearing on Supreme Court Judges' potential conflicts of 8interest; and (3) foster compliance with this Act and Illinois 9Supreme Court Rules. The statement of economic interests is 10designed to achieve an appropriate balance with respect to 11particular information that might reasonably bear on these 12objectives between the value of public disclosure of that 13information, on the one hand, and Supreme Court Judges' 14legitimate privacy interests, on the other hand.15    (c) The verified written statement of economic interests 16required under this Section shall be filed annually by all 17Supreme Court Judges on or before April 30. Statements also 18shall be filed by every person who becomes a Supreme Court 19Judge, within 45 days after assuming office. However, Supreme 20Court Judges who assume office on or after December 1 and who 21file the statement before the following April 30 shall not be 22required to file another statement until the next year.23    (d) Before the first Monday in March of each year, the 24Director of the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts 25shall inform each Supreme Court Judge of the requirements of 26this Section and shall provide a copy of the Illinois Judicial   HB4069- 14 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1Statement of Economic Interests Form described in Section 25. 2The Director of the Administrative Office of the Illinois 3Courts shall do the same for each new Supreme Court Judge 4within 10 days of the Supreme Court Judge assuming office. 5    (e) The Clerk of the Illinois Supreme Court is authorized 6to redact any personal information that is not required to be 7disclosed in the statement. 8    (f) The Clerk of the Illinois Supreme Court shall maintain 9a publicly available list of all Supreme Court Judges and the 10last date on which each Supreme Court Judge filed the 11statement.12    (g) The Clerk of the Illinois Supreme Court shall send a 13Supreme Court Judge acknowledgment of receipt of the Supreme 14Court Judge's statement and the date of filing.15    (h) The Clerk of the Illinois Supreme Court shall post the 16contents of each statement filed with him or her and make the 17contents of the statement available for inspection and copying 18on a publicly accessible website.

If, following the 18disclosure, the parties and lawyers agree, without 19participation by the Supreme Court Judge or court personnel, 20that the Supreme Court Judge should not be disqualified, the 21Supreme Court Judge may participate in the proceeding. The 22agreement shall be incorporated into the record of the 23proceeding.24    (d) Under this Section, a Supreme Court Judge is 25disqualified whenever the Supreme Court Judge's impartiality 26might reasonably be questioned, regardless of whether any of   HB4069- 8 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1the specific provisions of subsection (a) apply.2    (e) A Supreme Court Judge's obligation not to hear or 3decide matters in which disqualification is required applies 4regardless of whether a motion to disqualify is filed.5    (f) The rule of necessity may override the rule of 6disqualification. In matters that require immediate action, 7the Supreme Court Judge must disclose on the record the basis 8for possible disqualification.9    (g) The fact that a lawyer in a proceeding is affiliated 10with a law firm with which a relative of the Supreme Court 11Judge is affiliated does not itself disqualify the Supreme 12Court Judge. If, however, the Supreme Court Judge's 13impartiality might reasonably be questioned under subsection 14(a) or the relative is known by the Supreme Court Judge to have 15an interest in the law firm that could be substantially 16affected by the proceeding under subparagraph (C) of paragraph 17(2) of subsection (a), the Supreme Court Judge's 18disqualification is required.19    (h) A Supreme Court Judge shall disclose on the record 20information that the Supreme Court Judge believes the parties 21or their lawyers might reasonably consider relevant to a 22possible motion for disqualification, even if the Supreme 23Court Judge believes there is no basis for disqualification.24    (i) A Supreme Court Judge's use of social media or social 25networking platforms may create the appearance of a 26relationship between the Supreme Court Judge and litigants or   HB4069- 9 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1lawyers who may appear before the Supreme Court Judge. Whether 2a relationship would cause the Supreme Court Judge's 3impartiality to "reasonably be questioned" depends on the 4facts. While the labels used by the social media or social 5networking platform are not dispositive of the nature of the 6relationship, Supreme Court Judges shall consider the manner 7in which the rules on disqualification have been applied in 8traditional contexts and the additional ways in which social 9media or social networking platforms may amplify any 10connection to the Supreme Court Judge. 11    Section 15. Acceptance of gifts, loans, bequests, favors, 12benefits, or other things of value.13    (a) A covered person shall not accept any gifts, loans, 14bequests, benefits, favors, or other things of value, except 15as follows: 16        (1) any items or items from any one source during a 17    calendar year having a cumulative total value of less than 18    $100; 19        (2) gifts, loans, bequests, benefits, favors, or other 20    things of value from individuals whose relationship with 21    the covered person would require disqualification of the 22    Supreme Court Judge under Section 10;23        (3) ordinary social hospitality; 24        (4) commercial or financial opportunities and 25    benefits, including special pricing and discounts, and   HB4069- 10 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1    loans from lending institutions in their regular course of 2    business, if the same opportunities and benefits or loans 3    are made available on the same terms to similarly situated 4    persons who are not covered persons;5        (5) rewards and prizes given to competitors or 6    participants in random drawings, contests, or other events 7    that are open to persons who are not covered persons; 8        (6) scholarships, fellowships, and similar benefits or 9    awards, if they are available to similarly situated 10    persons who are not covered persons, based upon the same 11    terms and criteria; 12        (7) books, magazines, journals, audiovisual materials, 13    and other resource materials supplied by publishers on a 14    complimentary basis for official use; 15        (8) gifts incident to a public testimonial; 16        (9) invitations to a covered person or the guest of a 17    Supreme Court Judge to attend without charge: 18            (A) an event associated with a bar-related 19        function or other activity relating to the law, the 20        legal system, or the administration of justice; or 21            (B) an event associated with any of the Supreme 22        Court Judge's educational, religious, charitable, 23        fraternal, or civic activities permitted by the 24        Illinois Code of Judicial Conduct of 2023, if the same 25        invitation is offered to nonjudges who are engaged in 26        similar ways in the activity as is the Supreme Court   HB4069- 11 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1        Judge;2        (10) gifts, loans, bequests, benefits, favors, or 3    other things of value, only if the donor is not a party or 4    other person whose interests have come or are likely to 5    come before the Supreme Court Judge, including lawyers who 6    practice or have practiced before the Supreme Court Judge 7    or the cumulative total value of the gifts, loans, 8    bequests, benefits, favors, or other things of value is 9    less than $100 in a calendar year; and10        (11) gifts loans, bequests, benefits, favors, or other 11    things of value the acceptance of which is allowed under 12    subsection (c).13    (b) Whenever a covered person accepts a gift or other 14thing of value without paying fair market value, there is a 15risk that the benefit might be viewed as intended to influence 16the Supreme Court Judge's decision in a case. This Section 17prohibits the acceptance of benefits except in circumstances 18where the risk of improper influence is low. 19    (c) Gift giving between friends and relatives is a common 20occurrence and ordinarily does not create an appearance of 21impropriety or cause reasonable persons to believe that the 22Supreme Court Judge's independence, integrity, or impartiality 23has been compromised. In addition, when the appearance of 24friends or relatives in a case would require the Supreme Court 25Judge's disqualification under Section 10, there would be no 26opportunity for a gift to influence the Supreme Court Judge's   HB4069- 12 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1decision-making. Paragraph (2) of subsection (a) places no 2restrictions upon the ability of a covered person to accept 3gifts or other things of value from friends or relatives under 4these circumstances. 5    (d) Businesses and financial institutions frequently make 6available special pricing, discounts, and other benefits, 7either in connection with a temporary promotion or for 8preferred customers based upon longevity of the relationship, 9volume of business transacted, and other factors. A covered 10person may freely accept such benefits if they are available 11to the general public or if the covered person qualifies for 12the special price or discount according to the same criteria 13as are applied to persons who are not covered persons. 14    (e) This Section applies only to acceptance of gifts or 15other things of value by covered persons.16    (f) Contributions to a Supreme Court Judge's campaign for 17judicial office are governed by paragraph (6) of subsection 18(a) of Section 10 of this Act and the Illinois Code of Judicial 19Conduct of 2023. 20    (g) Disclosure of economic interests, including gifts, is 21governed by Sections 20 and 25. 22    Section 20. Reporting requirements.23    (a) A Supreme Court Judge shall file annually with the 24Clerk of the Illinois Supreme Court a verified written 25statement of economic interests on an Illinois Judicial   HB4069- 13 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1Statement of Economic Interests Form that is substantially 2similar to the form prescribed in Section 25.3    (b) The disclosure of economic interests under this 4Section is intended to (1) maintain and promote public 5confidence in the integrity, impartiality, fairness, and 6independence of the judiciary; (2) provide public information 7bearing on Supreme Court Judges' potential conflicts of 8interest; and (3) foster compliance with this Act and Illinois 9Supreme Court Rules. The statement of economic interests is 10designed to achieve an appropriate balance with respect to 11particular information that might reasonably bear on these 12objectives between the value of public disclosure of that 13information, on the one hand, and Supreme Court Judges' 14legitimate privacy interests, on the other hand.15    (c) The verified written statement of economic interests 16required under this Section shall be filed annually by all 17Supreme Court Judges on or before April 30. Statements also 18shall be filed by every person who becomes a Supreme Court 19Judge, within 45 days after assuming office. However, Supreme 20Court Judges who assume office on or after December 1 and who 21file the statement before the following April 30 shall not be 22required to file another statement until the next year.23    (d) Before the first Monday in March of each year, the 24Director of the Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts 25shall inform each Supreme Court Judge of the requirements of 26this Section and shall provide a copy of the Illinois Judicial   HB4069- 14 -LRB104 13961 JDS 26907 b1Statement of Economic Interests Form described in Section 25. 2The Director of the Administrative Office of the Illinois 3Courts shall do the same for each new Supreme Court Judge 4within 10 days of the Supreme Court Judge assuming office. 5    (e) The Clerk of the Illinois Supreme Court is authorized 6to redact any personal information that is not required to be 7disclosed in the statement. 8    (f) The Clerk of the Illinois Supreme Court shall maintain 9a publicly available list of all Supreme Court Judges and the 10last date on which each Supreme Court Judge filed the 11statement.12    (g) The Clerk of the Illinois Supreme Court shall send a 13Supreme Court Judge acknowledgment of receipt of the Supreme 14Court Judge's statement and the date of filing.15    (h) The Clerk of the Illinois Supreme Court shall post the 16contents of each statement filed with him or her and make the 17contents of the statement available for inspection and copying 18on a publicly accessible website.
