The Department may continue to provide financial 24assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was 25determined eligible for financial assistance under this 26subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the   10400HB0871sam001- 9 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization 2of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or 3parents.

Special purpose grants are 14allowed where the child requires special service but such 15costs may not exceed the amounts which similar services would 16cost the Department if it were to provide or secure them as 17guardian of the child.18    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 19inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, 20garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 21a judgment or debt.22    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 23of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 24either outside of the Department region handling the case, or 25outside of the State of Illinois.26    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any   10400HB0871sam001- 10 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 2dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 3or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.4    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 5services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and 6Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including 7adoptive and extended families. Family preservation services 8shall be offered (i) to prevent the placement of children in 9substitute care when the children can be cared for at home or 10in the custody of the person responsible for the children's 11welfare, (ii) to reunite children with their families, or 12(iii) to maintain an adoptive placement. Family preservation 13services shall only be offered when doing so will not endanger 14the children's health or safety.

The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 9services as soon as the report is determined to be 10"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 11family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 12or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 13investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 14Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 15willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 16investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 17child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 18child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 19services available from other agencies in the community, even 20if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 21in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 22subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 23child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 24voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 25child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 26alternative to an investigation, as provided under the   10400HB0871sam001- 12 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1"differential response program" provided for in subsection 2(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 3Reporting Act.4    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 5children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 6care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 7as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 8requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 9Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 10be committed to the Department by any court without the 11approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 12effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 132017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 14Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 15adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 16or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 17less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 18Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 19for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 20exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 21minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 22to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 232-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 242017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 25Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 26adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of   10400HB0871sam001- 13 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 2less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 3Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 4for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 5exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 6minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 7to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 82-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 9exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 10or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 11circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 12delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 13attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 14the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 15hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 16release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 17    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 18date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 19implement a special program of family preservation services to 20support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 21experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 22stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 23pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 24that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 25safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 26family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused   10400HB0871sam001- 14 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 2the child or family to services available from other agencies 3in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 4home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 5future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 6of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 7develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 8health and social service providers and the general public 9about these special family preservation services. The nature 10and scope of the services offered and the number of families 11served under the special program implemented under this 12paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 13Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 14"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 15a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 16Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 17edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 18Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.19    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 20interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 21most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 22possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 23the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 24concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 25earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 26include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of   10400HB0871sam001- 15 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1the family when the child can be cared for at home without 2endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 3the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 4is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 5permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.6    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 7respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 8making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 9shall be the paramount concern.10    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 11shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 12prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 13child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 14reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 15occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 16Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 17where the Department believes that further reunification 18services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 19the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 20The Department is not required to provide further 21reunification services after such a finding.22    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 23made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 24best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 25also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 26placement made is the best available placement to provide   10400HB0871sam001- 16 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1permanency for the child.2    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 3planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 4shall consider the following factors when determining 5appropriateness of concurrent planning:6        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;7        (2) the past history of the family;8        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 9    the family;10        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;11        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 12    family to reunite;13        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 14    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;15        (7) the age of the child;16        (8) placement of siblings.17    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 18child if:19        (1) it has received a written consent to such 20    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 21    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 22    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 23    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 24    or25        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 26    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be   10400HB0871sam001- 17 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    located.2If the child is found in the child's residence without a 3parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 4Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 5temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 6Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 7guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 8willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 9and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 10relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 11child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 12a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 13such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 14resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 15home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 16follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 175-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.18    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 19and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 20pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 21Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 22custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 23Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 24acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 25limited custody, the Department, during the period of 26temporary custody and before the child is brought before a   10400HB0871sam001- 18 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 25-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 3authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 4of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 5the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.6    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 7custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 8examination.9    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 10temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 11the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 12Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 13the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 14The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1510 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 16the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 17Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 18Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 19the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 20the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 21custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 22later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 23the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 24temporary custody of the child shall terminate.25    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 26age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department   10400HB0871sam001- 19 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1that cares for children who are in need of secure living 2arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 3determination is made by the facility director and the 4Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 5facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 6of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 7subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 8pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 9unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 10of the Department before being subject to placement in a 11correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 12has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.13    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 14age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 15the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 16preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 17child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 18placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 19clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 20in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 21Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 22those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 23guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 24Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 25facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 26of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of   10400HB0871sam001- 20 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 2dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 3However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 4where children require specialized care and treatment for 5problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 6social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 7facilities for the placement of such children are not 8available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 9this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 10be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 11garnishment or otherwise.12    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 13welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 14sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 15minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 16subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 171987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 18provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 19yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 20responsibility for the development and delivery of services 21under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 22under this Section through the Department of Children and 23Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 24Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 25shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 26an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how   10400HB0871sam001- 21 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 2homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 3youth receiving child welfare services under this Section.

The Department shall be responsible 17    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 18    account for any purpose.19        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 20    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 21    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 22    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 23    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 24    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 25    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 26    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of   10400HB0871sam001- 24 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.2        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 3    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 4    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 5    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 6    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.7    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 8encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 9the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 10who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 11hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 12of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 13of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 14Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 15confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 16of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 17adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 18such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 19agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 20Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 21confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 22of the child.23    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 24establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and 25private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the 26Department of Children and Family Services for damages   10400HB0871sam001- 25 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or 2negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third 3party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions 4of foster children to other individuals. Such coverage will be 5secondary to the foster parent liability insurance policy, if 6applicable. The program shall be funded through appropriations 7from the General Revenue Fund, specifically designated for 8such purposes.9    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 10investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 11as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 12Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:13        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 14    directs the Department to perform such services; and15        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 16    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 17    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 18    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 19    party is financially able to pay.20    The Department shall provide written notification to the 21court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 22and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 23The Department shall send to the court information related to 24the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 25determined the parties are financially unable to pay.

The Department may also provide categories of 5financial assistance and education assistance grants, and 6shall establish rules and regulations for the assistance and 7grants, to persons appointed guardian of the person under 8Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, 94-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 for children 10who were youth in care for 12 months immediately prior to the 11appointment of the guardian.12    The amount of assistance may vary, depending upon the 13needs of the child and the adoptive parents or subsidized 14guardians, as set forth in the annual assistance agreement. 15Special purpose grants are allowed where the child requires 16special service but such costs may not exceed the amounts 17which similar services would cost the Department if it were to 18provide or secure them as guardian of the child.19    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 20inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, 21garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 22a judgment or debt.23    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 24of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 25either outside of the Department region handling the case, or 26outside of the State of Illinois.  10400HB0871sam001- 42 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any 2child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 3dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 4or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.5    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 6services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and 7Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including 8adoptive and extended families. Family preservation services 9shall be offered (i) to prevent the placement of children in 10substitute care when the children can be cared for at home or 11in the custody of the person responsible for the children's 12welfare, (ii) to reunite children with their families, or 13(iii) to maintain an adoption or subsidized guardianship. 14Family preservation services shall only be offered when doing 15so will not endanger the children's health or safety.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be 23construed to create a private right of action or claim on the 24part of any individual or child welfare agency, except that 25when a child is the subject of an action under Article II of 26the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 and the child's service plan   10400HB0871sam001- 43 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1calls for services to facilitate achievement of the permanency 2goal, the court hearing the action under Article II of the 3Juvenile Court Act of 1987 may order the Department to provide 4the services set out in the plan, if those services are not 5provided with reasonable promptness and if those services are 6available.7    The Department shall notify the child and the child's 8family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 9family preservation services as identified in the service 10plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 11services as soon as the report is determined to be 12"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 13family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 14or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 15investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 16Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 17willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 18investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 19child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 20child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 21services available from other agencies in the community, even 22if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 23in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 24subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 25child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 26voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any   10400HB0871sam001- 44 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 2alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 3"differential response program" provided for in subsection 4(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 5Reporting Act.6    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 7children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 8care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 9as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 10requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 11Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 12be committed to the Department by any court without the 13approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 14effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 152017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 16Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 17adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 18or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 19less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 20Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 21for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 22exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 23minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 24to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 252-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 262017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the   10400HB0871sam001- 45 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 2adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 3or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 4less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 5Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 6for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 7exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 8minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 9to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 102-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 11exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 12or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 13circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 14delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 15attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 16the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 17hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 18release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 19    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 20implement a special program of family preservation services to 21support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 22are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 23stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 24pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 25that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 26safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any   10400HB0871sam001- 46 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 2and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 3the child or family to services available from other agencies 4in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 5home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 6future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 7of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 8develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 9health and social service providers and the general public 10about these special family preservation services. The nature 11and scope of the services offered and the number of families 12served under the special program implemented under this 13paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 14Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 15"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 16a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 17Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 18edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 19Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.20    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 21interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 22most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 23option for the child, consistent with the child's best 24interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 25Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is 26practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General   10400HB0871sam001- 47 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family 2Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 3occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 4arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 5outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 6at home without endangering the child's health or safety; 7reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if 8temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 9toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 10status.11    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 12respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 13making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 14shall be the paramount concern.15    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 16shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 17prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 18child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 19reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 20occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 21Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 22where the Department believes that further reunification 23services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 24the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 25The Department is not required to provide further 26reunification services after such a finding.  10400HB0871sam001- 48 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 2made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 3best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 4place the child with a relative, document those diligent 5efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 6secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue 7preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative 8is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 9concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 10Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 11in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 122025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 13diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 14relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 15should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 16delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 17permanent placement for the child.18    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 19planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 20shall consider the following factors when determining 21appropriateness of concurrent planning:22        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;23        (2) the past history of the family;24        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 25    the family;26        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;  10400HB0871sam001- 49 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1        (4.5) the child's wishes; 2        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 3    family to reunite;4        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 5    provide a permanent placement;6        (7) the age of the child;7        (8) placement of siblings; and8        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 9    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 10    the child. 11    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 12child if:13        (1) it has received a written consent to such 14    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 15    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 16    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 17    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 18    or19        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 20    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 21    located.22If the child is found in the child's residence without a 23parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 24Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 25temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 26Department in that residence until such time as a parent,   10400HB0871sam001- 50 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 2willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 3and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 4relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 5child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 6a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 7such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 8resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 9home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 10follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 115-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.12    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 13and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 14pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 15Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 16custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 17Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 18acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 19limited custody, the Department, during the period of 20temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 21judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 225-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 23authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 24of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 25the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.26    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into   10400HB0871sam001- 51 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 2examination.3    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 4temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 5the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 6Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 7the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 8The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 910 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 10the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 11Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 12Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 13the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 14the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 15custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 16later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 17the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 18temporary custody of the child shall terminate.19    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 20age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 21that cares for children who are in need of secure living 22arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 23determination is made by the facility director and the 24Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 25facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 26of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is   10400HB0871sam001- 52 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 2pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 3unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 4of the Department before being subject to placement in a 5correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 6has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.7    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 8age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 9the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 10preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 11child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 12placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 13clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 14in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 15Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 16those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 17guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 18Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 19facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 20of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 21maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 22dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 23However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 24where children require specialized care and treatment for 25problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 26social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable   10400HB0871sam001- 53 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1facilities for the placement of such children are not 2available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 3this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 4be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 5garnishment or otherwise.6    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 7welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 8sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 9minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 10subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 111987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 12provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 13yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 14responsibility for the development and delivery of services 15under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 16under this Section through the Department of Children and 17Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 18Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 19shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 20an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 21the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 22homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 23youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 24Department shall continue child welfare services under this 25Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 26of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves   10400HB0871sam001- 54 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 2The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 3clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 4child welfare services under this Section and how such 5services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 6Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 7disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 8adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 9minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 10independent adults. 11    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 12review and appeal process for children and families who 13request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 14Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 15agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 16shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 17children and families in the case of placement by the 18Department, including the right to an initial review of a 19private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 20ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 21youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 22and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 23Department shall accept for administrative review and an 24appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 25with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following 26an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a   10400HB0871sam001- 55 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of 2subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 3concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 4conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 5current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 62-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a 7judicial determination on the merits of an administrative 8appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 9placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 10shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 11review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 12placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 13identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 14criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 15interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 16of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 17multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 18rules regarding placement changes shall be followed. The rules 19shall outline the essential elements of each form used in the 20implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this 21amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 22    (p) (Blank).23    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 24for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 25money or other property which is received on behalf of such 26children, or any financial benefits to which such children are   10400HB0871sam001- 56 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 2the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 35.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 4under Section 5.46.5    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 6interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 7institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 8responsible and who have been determined eligible for 9Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 10allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 11parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 12Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 13miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 14be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 15with this subsection.16    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 17Department shall:18        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 19    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 20    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 21    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 22    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 23    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 24    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 25    account for any purpose.26        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from   10400HB0871sam001- 57 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 2    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 3    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 4    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 5    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 6    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 7    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 8    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.9        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 10    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 11    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 12    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 13    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.14    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 15encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 16the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 17who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 18hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 19of such children who have not been placed for adoption.

The Child Care Act of 1969 is amended by 6changing Section 3.4 as follows: 7    (225 ILCS 10/3.4)8    (This Section may contain text from a Public Act with a 9delayed effective date)10    Sec. 3.4. Standards for certified relative caregiver 11homes.12    (a) No later than July 1, 2025, the Department shall adopt 13rules outlining the standards for certified relative caregiver 14homes, which are reasonably in accordance with the national 15consortium recommendations and federal law and rules, and 16consistent with the requirements of this Act. The standards 17for certified relative caregiver homes shall: (i) be different 18from licensing standards used for non-relative foster family 19homes under Section 4; (ii) align with the recommendation of 20the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' 21Administration for Children and Families for implementation of 22Section 471(a)(10), 471(a)(11), and 471(a)(20) and Section 474 23of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act; (iii) be no more 24restrictive than, and reasonably in accordance with, national   10400HB0871sam001- 73 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1consortium recommendations; and (iv) address background 2screening for caregivers and other household residents and 3assessing home safety and caregiver capacity to meet the 4identified child's needs.5    A guiding premise for certified relative caregiver home 6standards is that foster care maintenance payments for every 7relative, starting upon placement, regardless of federal 8reimbursement, are critical to ensure that the basic needs and 9well-being of all children in relative care are being met. If 10an agency places a child in the care of a relative, the 11relative must immediately be provided with adequate support to 12care for that child. The Department shall review foster care 13maintenance payments to ensure that children receive the same 14amount of foster care maintenance payments whether placed in a 15certified relative caregiver home or a licensed foster family 16home. 17    In developing rules, the Department shall solicit and 18incorporate feedback from relative caregivers. No later than 1960 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 20103rd General Assembly, the Department shall begin soliciting 21input from relatives who are currently or have recently been 22caregivers to youth in care to develop the rules and 23procedures to implement the requirements of this Section. The 24Department shall solicit this input in a manner convenient for 25caregivers to participate, including without limitation, 26in-person convenings at after hours and weekend venues,   10400HB0871sam001- 74 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1locations that provide child care, and modalities that are 2accessible and welcoming to new and experienced relative 3caregivers from all regions of the State. The rules shall 4outline the essential elements of each form used in the 5implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this 6amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 7    (b) In order to assess whether standards are met for a 8certified relative caregiver home under this Section, the 9Department or a licensed child welfare agency shall: 10        (1) complete the home safety and needs assessment and 11    identify and provide any necessary concrete goods or 12    safety modifications to assist the prospective certified 13    relative caregiver in meeting the needs of the specific 14    child or children being placed by the Department, in a 15    manner consistent with Department rule;16        (2) assess the ability of the prospective certified 17    relative caregiver to care for the physical, emotional, 18    medical, and educational needs of the specific child or 19    children being placed by the Department using the protocol 20    and form provided through national consortium 21    recommendations; and22        (3) using the standard background check form 23    established by rule, complete a background check for each 24    person seeking certified relative caregiver approval and 25    any other adults living in the home as required under this 26    Section.   10400HB0871sam001- 75 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    (c) The Department or a licensed child welfare agency 2shall conduct the following background screening investigation 3for every prospective certified relative caregiver and adult 4resident living in the home:5        (1) a name-based State, local, or tribal criminal 6    background check, and as soon as reasonably possible, 7    initiate a fingerprint-based background check;8        (2) a review of this State's Central Registry and 9    registries of any state in which an adult household member 10    has resided in the last 5 years, if applicable to 11    determine if the person has been determined to be a 12    perpetrator in an indicated report of child abuse or 13    neglect; and14        (3) a review of the sex offender registry. 15    No home may be a certified relative caregiver home if any 16prospective caregivers or adult residents in the home refuse 17to authorize a background screening investigation as required 18by this Section. Only information and standards that bear a 19reasonable and rational relation to the caregiving capacity of 20the certified relative caregiver and adult member of the 21household and overall safety provided by residents of that 22home shall be used by the Department or licensed child welfare 23agency. 24    In approving a certified relative caregiver home in 25accordance with this Section, if an adult has a criminal 26record, the Department or licensed child welfare agency shall   10400HB0871sam001- 76 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1thoroughly investigate and evaluate the criminal history of 2the adult and, in so doing, include an assessment of the 3adult's character and, in the case of the prospective 4certified relative caregiver, the impact that the criminal 5history has on the prospective certified relative caregiver's 6ability to parent the child; the investigation should consider 7the type of crime, the number of crimes, the nature of the 8offense, the age of the person at the time of the crime, the 9length of time that has elapsed since the last conviction, the 10relationship of the crime to the ability to care for children, 11the role that adult will have with the child, and any evidence 12of rehabilitation. In accordance with federal law, a home 13shall not be approved if the record of the prospective 14certified relative caregiver's background screening reveals: 15(i) a felony conviction for child abuse or neglect, for 16spousal abuse, for a crime against children crimes against a 17child, including child pornography, or for a crime involving 18violence, including human trafficking, sex trafficking, of 19rape, sexual assault, or homicide, but not including other 20physical assault or battery; or (ii) a felony conviction in 21the last 5 years for physical assault, battery, or a 22drug-related offense. 23    If the Department is contemplating denying approval of a 24certified relative caregiver home, the Department shall 25provide a written notice in the prospective certified relative 26caregiver's primary language to each prospective certified   10400HB0871sam001- 77 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1relative caregiver before the Department takes final action to 2deny approval of the home. This written notice shall include 3the specific reason or reasons the Department is considering 4denial, list actions prospective certified relative caregivers 5can take, if any, to remedy such conditions and the timeframes 6in which such actions would need to be completed, explain 7reasonable supports that the Department can provide to assist 8the prospective certified relative caregivers in taking 9remedial actions and how the prospective certified relative 10caregivers can request such assistance, and provide the 11recourse prospective certified relative caregivers can seek to 12resolve disputes about the Department's findings. The 13Department shall provide prospective certified relative 14caregivers reasonable opportunity pursuant to rulemaking to 15cure any remediable deficiencies that the Department 16identified before taking final action to deny approval of a 17certified relative caregiver home. 18    If conditions have not been remedied after a reasonable 19opportunity and assistance to cure identified deficiencies has 20been provided, the Department shall provide a final written 21notice explaining the reasons for denying the certified 22relative caregiver home approval and the reconsideration 23process to review the decision to deny certification.

The Department shall assign a caseworker to 13attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 14the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 15hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 16release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 17    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 18date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 19implement a special program of family preservation services to 20support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 21experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 22stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 23pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 24that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 25safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 26family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused   10400HB0871sam001- 14 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1and Neglected Child Reporting Act.

Acceptance 6of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 7develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 8health and social service providers and the general public 9about these special family preservation services. The nature 10and scope of the services offered and the number of families 11served under the special program implemented under this 12paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 13Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 14"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 15a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 16Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 17edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 18Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.19    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 20interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 21most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 22possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 23the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 24concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 25earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 26include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of   10400HB0871sam001- 15 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1the family when the child can be cared for at home without 2endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 3the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 4is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 5permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.6    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 7respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 8making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 9shall be the paramount concern.10    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 11shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 12prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 13child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 14reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 15occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 16Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 17where the Department believes that further reunification 18services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 19the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 20The Department is not required to provide further 21reunification services after such a finding.22    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 23made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 24best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 25also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 26placement made is the best available placement to provide   10400HB0871sam001- 16 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1permanency for the child.2    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 3planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 4shall consider the following factors when determining 5appropriateness of concurrent planning:6        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;7        (2) the past history of the family;8        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 9    the family;10        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;11        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 12    family to reunite;13        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 14    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;15        (7) the age of the child;16        (8) placement of siblings.17    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 18child if:19        (1) it has received a written consent to such 20    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 21    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 22    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 23    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 24    or25        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 26    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be   10400HB0871sam001- 17 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    located.2If the child is found in the child's residence without a 3parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 4Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 5temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 6Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 7guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 8willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 9and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 10relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 11child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 12a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 13such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 14resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 15home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 16follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 175-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.18    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 19and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 20pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 21Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 22custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 23Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 24acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 25limited custody, the Department, during the period of 26temporary custody and before the child is brought before a   10400HB0871sam001- 18 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 25-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 3authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 4of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 5the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.6    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 7custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 8examination.9    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 10temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 11the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 12Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 13the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 14The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1510 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 16the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 17Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 18Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 19the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 20the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 21custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 22later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 23the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 24temporary custody of the child shall terminate.25    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 26age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department   10400HB0871sam001- 19 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1that cares for children who are in need of secure living 2arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 3determination is made by the facility director and the 4Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 5facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 6of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 7subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 8pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 9unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 10of the Department before being subject to placement in a 11correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 12has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.13    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 14age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 15the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 16preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 17child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 18placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 19clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 20in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 21Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 22those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 23guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 24Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 25facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 26of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of   10400HB0871sam001- 20 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 2dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 3However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 4where children require specialized care and treatment for 5problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 6social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 7facilities for the placement of such children are not 8available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 9this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 10be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 11garnishment or otherwise.12    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 13welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 14sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 15minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 16subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 171987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 18provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 19yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 20responsibility for the development and delivery of services 21under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 22under this Section through the Department of Children and 23Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 24Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 25shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 26an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how   10400HB0871sam001- 21 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 2homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 3youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 4Department shall continue child welfare services under this 5Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 6of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 7self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 8The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 9clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 10child welfare services under this Section and how such 11services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 12Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 13disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 14adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 15minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 16independent adults. 17    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 18review and appeal process for children and families who 19request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 20Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 21agencies, and foster families with whom those youth are 22placed, shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal 23rights as children and families in the case of placement by the 24Department, including the right to an initial review of a 25private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 26ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts   10400HB0871sam001- 22 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 2and foster families. The Department shall accept for 3administrative review and an appeal hearing a complaint made 4by (i) a child or foster family concerning a decision 5following an initial review by a private child welfare agency 6or (ii) a prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation 7of subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 8concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 9conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 10current foster home placement is necessary and appropriate 11under Section 2-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not 12constitute a judicial determination on the merits of an 13administrative appeal, filed by a former foster parent, 14involving a change of placement decision.15    (p) (Blank).16    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 17for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 18money or other property which is received on behalf of such 19children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 20or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 21the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 225.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 23under Section 5.46.24    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 25interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 26institutions for children for whom the Department is legally   10400HB0871sam001- 23 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1responsible and who have been determined eligible for 2Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 3allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 4parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 5Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 6miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 7be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 8with this subsection.9    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 10Department shall:11        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 12    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 13    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 14    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 15    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 16    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 17    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 18    account for any purpose.19        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 20    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 21    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 22    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 23    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 24    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 25    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 26    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of   10400HB0871sam001- 24 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.2        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 3    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 4    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 5    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 6    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.7    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 8encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 9the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 10who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 11hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 12of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 13of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 14Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 15confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 16of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 17adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 18such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 19agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 20Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 21confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 22of the child.23    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 24establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and 25private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the 26Department of Children and Family Services for damages   10400HB0871sam001- 25 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or 2negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third 3party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions 4of foster children to other individuals. Such coverage will be 5secondary to the foster parent liability insurance policy, if 6applicable. The program shall be funded through appropriations 7from the General Revenue Fund, specifically designated for 8such purposes.9    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 10investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 11as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 12Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:13        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 14    directs the Department to perform such services; and15        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 16    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 17    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 18    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 19    party is financially able to pay.20    The Department shall provide written notification to the 21court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 22and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 23The Department shall send to the court information related to 24the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 25determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The 26court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.  10400HB0871sam001- 26 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    (u) In addition to other information that must be 2provided, whenever the Department places a child with a 3prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster 4home, group home, or child care institution, or in a relative 5home, the Department shall provide to the prospective adoptive 6parent or parents or other caretaker:7        (1) available detailed information concerning the 8    child's educational and health history, copies of 9    immunization records (including insurance and medical card 10    information), a history of the child's previous 11    placements, if any, and reasons for placement changes 12    excluding any information that identifies or reveals the 13    location of any previous caretaker;14        (2) a copy of the child's portion of the client 15    service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and 16    all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; 17    and18        (3) information containing details of the child's 19    individualized educational plan when the child is 20    receiving special education services.21    The caretaker shall be informed of any known social or 22behavioral information (including, but not limited to, 23criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual 24abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to 25care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently 26in the home. The Department may prepare a written summary of   10400HB0871sam001- 27 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1the information required by this paragraph, which may be 2provided to the foster or prospective adoptive parent in 3advance of a placement. The foster or prospective adoptive 4parent may review the supporting documents in the child's file 5in the presence of casework staff. In the case of an emergency 6placement, casework staff shall at least provide known 7information verbally, if necessary, and must subsequently 8provide the information in writing as required by this 9subsection. 10    The information described in this subsection shall be 11provided in writing. In the case of emergency placements when 12time does not allow prior review, preparation, and collection 13of written information, the Department shall provide such 14information as it becomes available. Within 10 business days 15after placement, the Department shall obtain from the 16prospective adoptive parent or parents or other caretaker a 17signed verification of receipt of the information provided. 18Within 10 business days after placement, the Department shall 19provide to the child's guardian ad litem a copy of the 20information provided to the prospective adoptive parent or 21parents or other caretaker.

The Department of Children and Family Services and 2its employees shall abide by rules and regulations established 3by the Illinois State Police relating to the access and 4dissemination of this information.5    (v-1) Prior to final approval for placement of a child, 6the Department shall conduct a criminal records background 7check of the prospective foster or adoptive parent, including 8fingerprint-based checks of national crime information 9databases. Final approval for placement shall not be granted 10if the record check reveals a felony conviction for child 11abuse or neglect, for spousal abuse, for a crime against 12children, or for a crime involving violence, including rape, 13sexual assault, or homicide, but not including other physical 14assault or battery, or if there is a felony conviction for 15physical assault, battery, or a drug-related offense committed 16within the past 5 years.17    (v-2) Prior to final approval for placement of a child, 18the Department shall check its child abuse and neglect 19registry for information concerning prospective foster and 20adoptive parents, and any adult living in the home. If any 21prospective foster or adoptive parent or other adult living in 22the home has resided in another state in the preceding 5 years, 23the Department shall request a check of that other state's 24child abuse and neglect registry. 25    (w) Within 120 days of August 20, 1995 (the effective date 26of Public Act 89-392), the Department shall prepare and submit   10400HB0871sam001- 30 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1to the Governor and the General Assembly, a written plan for 2the development of in-state licensed secure child care 3facilities that care for children who are in need of secure 4living arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being. 5For purposes of this subsection, secure care facility shall 6mean a facility that is designed and operated to ensure that 7all entrances and exits from the facility, a building or a 8distinct part of the building, are under the exclusive control 9of the staff of the facility, whether or not the child has the 10freedom of movement within the perimeter of the facility, 11building, or distinct part of the building.

However, the child's or family's 17willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 18investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 19child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 20child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 21services available from other agencies in the community, even 22if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 23in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 24subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 25child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 26voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any   10400HB0871sam001- 44 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 2alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 3"differential response program" provided for in subsection 4(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 5Reporting Act.6    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 7children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 8care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 9as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 10requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 11Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 12be committed to the Department by any court without the 13approval of the Department.

On and after January 1, 262017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the   10400HB0871sam001- 45 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 2adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 3or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 4less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 5Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 6for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 7exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 8minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 9to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 102-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 11exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 12or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 13circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 14delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 15attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 16the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 17hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 18release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 19    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 20implement a special program of family preservation services to 21support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 22are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 23stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 24pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 25that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 26safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any   10400HB0871sam001- 46 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 2and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 3the child or family to services available from other agencies 4in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 5home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 6future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 7of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 8develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 9health and social service providers and the general public 10about these special family preservation services. The nature 11and scope of the services offered and the number of families 12served under the special program implemented under this 13paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 14Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 15"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 16a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 17Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 18edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 19Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.20    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 21interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 22most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 23option for the child, consistent with the child's best 24interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 25Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is 26practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General   10400HB0871sam001- 47 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family 2Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 3occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 4arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 5outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 6at home without endangering the child's health or safety; 7reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if 8temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 9toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 10status.11    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 12respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 13making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 14shall be the paramount concern.15    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 16shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 17prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 18child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 19reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 20occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 21Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 22where the Department believes that further reunification 23services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 24the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 25The Department is not required to provide further 26reunification services after such a finding.  10400HB0871sam001- 48 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 2made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 3best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 4place the child with a relative, document those diligent 5efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 6secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue 7preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative 8is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 9concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 10Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 11in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 122025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 13diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 14relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 15should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 16delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 17permanent placement for the child.18    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 19planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 20shall consider the following factors when determining 21appropriateness of concurrent planning:22        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;23        (2) the past history of the family;24        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 25    the family;26        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;  10400HB0871sam001- 49 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1        (4.5) the child's wishes; 2        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 3    family to reunite;4        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 5    provide a permanent placement;6        (7) the age of the child;7        (8) placement of siblings; and8        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 9    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 10    the child. 11    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 12child if:13        (1) it has received a written consent to such 14    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 15    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 16    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 17    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 18    or19        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 20    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 21    located.22If the child is found in the child's residence without a 23parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 24Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 25temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 26Department in that residence until such time as a parent,   10400HB0871sam001- 50 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 2willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 3and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 4relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 5child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 6a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 7such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 8resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 9home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 10follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 115-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.12    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 13and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 14pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 15Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 16custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 17Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 18acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 19limited custody, the Department, during the period of 20temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 21judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 225-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 23authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 24of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 25the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.26    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into   10400HB0871sam001- 51 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 2examination.3    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 4temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 5the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 6Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 7the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 8The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 910 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 10the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 11Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 12Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 13the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 14the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 15custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 16later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 17the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 18temporary custody of the child shall terminate.19    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 20age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 21that cares for children who are in need of secure living 22arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 23determination is made by the facility director and the 24Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 25facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 26of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is   10400HB0871sam001- 52 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 2pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 3unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 4of the Department before being subject to placement in a 5correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 6has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.7    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 8age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 9the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 10preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 11child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 12placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 13clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 14in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 15Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 16those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 17guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 18Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 19facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 20of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 21maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 22dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 23However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 24where children require specialized care and treatment for 25problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 26social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable   10400HB0871sam001- 53 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1facilities for the placement of such children are not 2available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 3this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 4be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 5garnishment or otherwise.6    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 7welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 8sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 9minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 10subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 111987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 12provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 13yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 14responsibility for the development and delivery of services 15under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 16under this Section through the Department of Children and 17Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 18Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 19shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 20an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 21the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 22homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 23youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 24Department shall continue child welfare services under this 25Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 26of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves   10400HB0871sam001- 54 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 2The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 3clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 4child welfare services under this Section and how such 5services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 6Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 7disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 8adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 9minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 10independent adults. 11    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 12review and appeal process for children and families who 13request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 14Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 15agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 16shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 17children and families in the case of placement by the 18Department, including the right to an initial review of a 19private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 20ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 21youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 22and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 23Department shall accept for administrative review and an 24appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 25with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following 26an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a   10400HB0871sam001- 55 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of 2subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 3concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 4conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 5current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 62-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a 7judicial determination on the merits of an administrative 8appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 9placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 10shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 11review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 12placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 13identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 14criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 15interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 16of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 17multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 18rules regarding placement changes shall be followed.

Interest earned by each account shall 14be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 15with this subsection.16    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 17Department shall:18        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 19    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 20    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 21    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 22    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 23    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 24    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 25    account for any purpose.26        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from   10400HB0871sam001- 57 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 2    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 3    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 4    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 5    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 6    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 7    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 8    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.9        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 10    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 11    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 12    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 13    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.14    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 15encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 16the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 17who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 18hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 19of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 20of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 21Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 22confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 23of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 24adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 25such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 26agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The   10400HB0871sam001- 58 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 2confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 3of the child.4    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 5establish and implement a program to reimburse caregivers 6licensed, certified, or otherwise approved by the Department 7of Children and Family Services for damages sustained by the 8caregivers as a result of the malicious or negligent acts of 9children placed by the Department, as well as providing third 10party coverage for such caregivers with regard to actions of 11children placed by the Department to other individuals. Such 12coverage will be secondary to the caregiver's liability 13insurance policy, if applicable. The program shall be funded 14through appropriations from the General Revenue Fund, 15specifically designated for such purposes.16    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 17investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 18as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 19Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:20        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 21    directs the Department to perform such services; and22        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 23    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 24    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 25    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 26    party is financially able to pay.  10400HB0871sam001- 59 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    The Department shall provide written notification to the 2court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 3and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 4The Department shall send to the court information related to 5the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 6determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The 7court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.8    (u) In addition to other information that must be 9provided, whenever the Department places a child with a 10prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster 11home, group home, or child care institution, in a relative 12home, or in a certified relative caregiver home, the 13Department shall provide to the caregiver, appropriate 14facility staff, or prospective adoptive parent or parents:15        (1) available detailed information concerning the 16    child's educational and health history, copies of 17    immunization records (including insurance and medical card 18    information), a history of the child's previous 19    placements, if any, and reasons for placement changes 20    excluding any information that identifies or reveals the 21    location of any previous caregiver or adoptive parents;22        (2) a copy of the child's portion of the client 23    service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and 24    all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; 25    and26        (3) information containing details of the child's   10400HB0871sam001- 60 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1    individualized educational plan when the child is 2    receiving special education services.3    The caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective 4adoptive parent or parents, shall be informed of any known 5social or behavioral information (including, but not limited 6to, criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual 7abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to 8care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently 9in the home or setting. The Department may prepare a written 10summary of the information required by this paragraph, which 11may be provided to the caregiver, appropriate facility staff, 12or prospective adoptive parent in advance of a placement.

The Child Care Act of 1969 is amended by 6changing Section 3.4 as follows: 7    (225 ILCS 10/3.4)8    (This Section may contain text from a Public Act with a 9delayed effective date)10    Sec. 3.4. Standards for certified relative caregiver 11homes.12    (a) No later than July 1, 2025, the Department shall adopt 13rules outlining the standards for certified relative caregiver 14homes, which are reasonably in accordance with the national 15consortium recommendations and federal law and rules, and 16consistent with the requirements of this Act. The standards 17for certified relative caregiver homes shall: (i) be different 18from licensing standards used for non-relative foster family 19homes under Section 4; (ii) align with the recommendation of 20the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' 21Administration for Children and Families for implementation of 22Section 471(a)(10), 471(a)(11), and 471(a)(20) and Section 474 23of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act; (iii) be no more 24restrictive than, and reasonably in accordance with, national   10400HB0871sam001- 73 -LRB104 04769 KTG 26123 a1consortium recommendations; and (iv) address background 2screening for caregivers and other household residents and 3assessing home safety and caregiver capacity to meet the 4identified child's needs.5    A guiding premise for certified relative caregiver home 6standards is that foster care maintenance payments for every 7relative, starting upon placement, regardless of federal 8reimbursement, are critical to ensure that the basic needs and 9well-being of all children in relative care are being met. If 10an agency places a child in the care of a relative, the 11relative must immediately be provided with adequate support to 12care for that child. The Department shall review foster care 13maintenance payments to ensure that children receive the same 14amount of foster care maintenance payments whether placed in a 15certified relative caregiver home or a licensed foster family 16home. 17    In developing rules, the Department shall solicit and 18incorporate feedback from relative caregivers.
