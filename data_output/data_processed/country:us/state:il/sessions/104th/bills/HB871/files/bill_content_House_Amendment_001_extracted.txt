The Department may continue to provide financial 24assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was 25determined eligible for financial assistance under this 26subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the   10400HB0871ham001- 9 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization 2of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or 3parents.

Special purpose grants are 14allowed where the child requires special service but such 15costs may not exceed the amounts which similar services would 16cost the Department if it were to provide or secure them as 17guardian of the child.18    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 19inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, 20garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 21a judgment or debt.22    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 23of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 24either outside of the Department region handling the case, or 25outside of the State of Illinois.26    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any   10400HB0871ham001- 10 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 2dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 3or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.4    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 5services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and 6Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including 7adoptive and extended families. Family preservation services 8shall be offered (i) to prevent the placement of children in 9substitute care when the children can be cared for at home or 10in the custody of the person responsible for the children's 11welfare, (ii) to reunite children with their families, or 12(iii) to maintain an adoptive placement. Family preservation 13services shall only be offered when doing so will not endanger 14the children's health or safety.

The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 9services as soon as the report is determined to be 10"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 11family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 12or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 13investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 14Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 15willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 16investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 17child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 18child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 19services available from other agencies in the community, even 20if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 21in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 22subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 23child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 24voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 25child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 26alternative to an investigation, as provided under the   10400HB0871ham001- 12 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1"differential response program" provided for in subsection 2(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 3Reporting Act.4    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 5children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 6care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 7as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 8requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 9Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 10be committed to the Department by any court without the 11approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 12effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 132017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 14Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 15adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 16or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 17less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 18Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 19for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 20exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 21minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 22to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 232-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 242017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 25Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 26adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of   10400HB0871ham001- 13 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 2less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 3Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 4for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 5exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 6minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 7to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 82-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 9exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 10or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 11circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 12delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 13attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 14the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 15hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 16release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 17    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 18date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 19implement a special program of family preservation services to 20support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 21experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 22stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 23pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 24that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 25safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 26family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused   10400HB0871ham001- 14 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 2the child or family to services available from other agencies 3in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 4home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 5future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 6of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 7develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 8health and social service providers and the general public 9about these special family preservation services. The nature 10and scope of the services offered and the number of families 11served under the special program implemented under this 12paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 13Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 14"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 15a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 16Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 17edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 18Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.19    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 20interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 21most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 22possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 23the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 24concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 25earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 26include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of   10400HB0871ham001- 15 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1the family when the child can be cared for at home without 2endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 3the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 4is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 5permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.6    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 7respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 8making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 9shall be the paramount concern.10    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 11shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 12prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 13child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 14reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 15occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 16Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 17where the Department believes that further reunification 18services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 19the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 20The Department is not required to provide further 21reunification services after such a finding.22    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 23made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 24best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 25also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 26placement made is the best available placement to provide   10400HB0871ham001- 16 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1permanency for the child.2    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 3planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 4shall consider the following factors when determining 5appropriateness of concurrent planning:6        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;7        (2) the past history of the family;8        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 9    the family;10        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;11        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 12    family to reunite;13        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 14    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;15        (7) the age of the child;16        (8) placement of siblings.17    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 18child if:19        (1) it has received a written consent to such 20    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 21    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 22    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 23    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 24    or25        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 26    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be   10400HB0871ham001- 17 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1    located.2If the child is found in the child's residence without a 3parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 4Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 5temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 6Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 7guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 8willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 9and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 10relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 11child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 12a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 13such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 14resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 15home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 16follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 175-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.18    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 19and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 20pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 21Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 22custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 23Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 24acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 25limited custody, the Department, during the period of 26temporary custody and before the child is brought before a   10400HB0871ham001- 18 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 25-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 3authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 4of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 5the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.6    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 7custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 8examination.9    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 10temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 11the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 12Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 13the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 14The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1510 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 16the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 17Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 18Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 19the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 20the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 21custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 22later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 23the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 24temporary custody of the child shall terminate.25    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 26age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department   10400HB0871ham001- 19 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1that cares for children who are in need of secure living 2arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 3determination is made by the facility director and the 4Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 5facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 6of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 7subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 8pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 9unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 10of the Department before being subject to placement in a 11correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 12has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.13    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 14age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 15the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 16preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 17child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 18placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 19clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 20in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 21Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 22those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 23guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 24Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 25facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 26of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of   10400HB0871ham001- 20 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 2dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 3However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 4where children require specialized care and treatment for 5problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 6social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 7facilities for the placement of such children are not 8available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 9this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 10be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 11garnishment or otherwise.12    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 13welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 14sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 15minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 16subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 171987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 18provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 19yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 20responsibility for the development and delivery of services 21under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 22under this Section through the Department of Children and 23Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 24Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 25shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 26an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how   10400HB0871ham001- 21 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 2homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 3youth receiving child welfare services under this Section.

Monthly, 24    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 25    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 26    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of   10400HB0871ham001- 24 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.2        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 3    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 4    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 5    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 6    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.7    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 8encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 9the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 10who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 11hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 12of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 13of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 14Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 15confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 16of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 17adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 18such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 19agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 20Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 21confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 22of the child.23    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 24establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and 25private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the 26Department of Children and Family Services for damages   10400HB0871ham001- 25 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or 2negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third 3party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions 4of foster children to other individuals. Such coverage will be 5secondary to the foster parent liability insurance policy, if 6applicable. The program shall be funded through appropriations 7from the General Revenue Fund, specifically designated for 8such purposes.9    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 10investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 11as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 12Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:13        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 14    directs the Department to perform such services; and15        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 16    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 17    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 18    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 19    party is financially able to pay.20    The Department shall provide written notification to the 21court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 22and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 23The Department shall send to the court information related to 24the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 25determined the parties are financially unable to pay.

The Department may also provide categories of 6financial assistance and education assistance grants, and 7shall establish rules and regulations for the assistance and 8grants, to persons appointed guardian of the person under 9Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, 104-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 for children 11who were youth in care for 12 months immediately prior to the 12appointment of the guardian.13    The amount of assistance may vary, depending upon the 14needs of the child and the adoptive parents or subsidized 15guardians, as set forth in the annual assistance agreement. 16Special purpose grants are allowed where the child requires 17special service but such costs may not exceed the amounts 18which similar services would cost the Department if it were to 19provide or secure them as guardian of the child.20    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 21inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, 22garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 23a judgment or debt.24    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 25of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 26either outside of the Department region handling the case, or   10400HB0871ham001- 42 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1outside of the State of Illinois.2    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any 3child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 4dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 5or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.6    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 7services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and 8Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including 9adoptive and extended families. Family preservation services 10shall be offered (i) to prevent the placement of children in 11substitute care when the children can be cared for at home or 12in the custody of the person responsible for the children's 13welfare, (ii) to reunite children with their families, or 14(iii) to maintain an adoption or subsidized guardianship. 15Family preservation services shall only be offered when doing 16so will not endanger the children's health or safety. With 17respect to children who are in substitute care pursuant to the 18Juvenile Court Act of 1987, family preservation services shall 19not be offered if a goal other than those of subdivisions (A), 20(B), or (B-1) of subsection (2.3) of Section 2-28 of that Act 21has been set, except that reunification services may be 22offered as provided in paragraph (F) of subsection (2.3) of 23Section 2-28 of that Act. Nothing in this paragraph shall be 24construed to create a private right of action or claim on the 25part of any individual or child welfare agency, except that 26when a child is the subject of an action under Article II of   10400HB0871ham001- 43 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 and the child's service plan 2calls for services to facilitate achievement of the permanency 3goal, the court hearing the action under Article II of the 4Juvenile Court Act of 1987 may order the Department to provide 5the services set out in the plan, if those services are not 6provided with reasonable promptness and if those services are 7available.8    The Department shall notify the child and the child's 9family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 10family preservation services as identified in the service 11plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 12services as soon as the report is determined to be 13"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 14family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 15or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 16investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 17Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 18willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 19investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 20child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 21child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 22services available from other agencies in the community, even 23if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 24in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 25subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 26child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be   10400HB0871ham001- 44 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 2child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 3alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 4"differential response program" provided for in subsection 5(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 6Reporting Act.7    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 8children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 9care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 10as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 11requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 12Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 13be committed to the Department by any court without the 14approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 15effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 162017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 17Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 18adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 19or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 20less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 21Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 22for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 23exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 24minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 25to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 262-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1,   10400HB0871ham001- 45 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a12017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 2Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 3adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 4or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 5less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 6Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 7for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 8exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 9minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 10to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 112-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 12exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 13or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 14circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 15delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 16attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 17the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 18hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 19release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 20    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 21implement a special program of family preservation services to 22support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 23are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 24stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 25pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 26that those services are necessary to ensure the health and   10400HB0871ham001- 46 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 2family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 3and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 4the child or family to services available from other agencies 5in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 6home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 7future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 8of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 9develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 10health and social service providers and the general public 11about these special family preservation services. The nature 12and scope of the services offered and the number of families 13served under the special program implemented under this 14paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 15Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 16"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 17a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 18Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 19edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 20Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.21    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 22interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 23most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 24option for the child, consistent with the child's best 25interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 26Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is   10400HB0871ham001- 47 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General 2Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family 3Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 4occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 5arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 6outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 7at home without endangering the child's health or safety; 8reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if 9temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 10toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 11status.12    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 13respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 14making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 15shall be the paramount concern.16    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 17shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 18prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 19child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 20reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 21occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 22Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 23where the Department believes that further reunification 24services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 25the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 26The Department is not required to provide further   10400HB0871ham001- 48 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1reunification services after such a finding.2    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 3made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 4best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 5place the child with a relative, document those diligent 6efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 7secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue 8preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative 9is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 10concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 11Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 12in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 132025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 14diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 15relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 16should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 17delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 18permanent placement for the child.19    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 20planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 21shall consider the following factors when determining 22appropriateness of concurrent planning:23        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;24        (2) the past history of the family;25        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 26    the family;  10400HB0871ham001- 49 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;2        (4.5) the child's wishes; 3        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 4    family to reunite;5        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 6    provide a permanent placement;7        (7) the age of the child;8        (8) placement of siblings; and9        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 10    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 11    the child. 12    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 13child if:14        (1) it has received a written consent to such 15    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 16    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 17    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 18    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 19    or20        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 21    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 22    located.23If the child is found in the child's residence without a 24parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 25Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 26temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the   10400HB0871ham001- 50 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 2guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 3willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 4and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 5relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 6child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 7a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 8such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 9resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 10home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 11follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 125-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.13    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 14and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 15pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 16Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 17custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 18Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 19acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 20limited custody, the Department, during the period of 21temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 22judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 235-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 24authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 25of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 26the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.  10400HB0871ham001- 51 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 2custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 3examination.4    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 5temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 6the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 7Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 8the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 9The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1010 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 11the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 12Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 13Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 14the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 15the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 16custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 17later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 18the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 19temporary custody of the child shall terminate.20    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 21age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 22that cares for children who are in need of secure living 23arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 24determination is made by the facility director and the 25Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 26facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act   10400HB0871ham001- 52 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 2subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 3pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 4unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 5of the Department before being subject to placement in a 6correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 7has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.8    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 9age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 10the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 11preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 12child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 13placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 14clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 15in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 16Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 17those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 18guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 19Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 20facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 21of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 22maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 23dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 24However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 25where children require specialized care and treatment for 26problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability,   10400HB0871ham001- 53 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 2facilities for the placement of such children are not 3available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 4this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 5be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 6garnishment or otherwise.7    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 8welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 9sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 10minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 11subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 121987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 13provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 14yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 15responsibility for the development and delivery of services 16under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 17under this Section through the Department of Children and 18Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 19Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 20shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 21an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 22the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 23homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 24youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 25Department shall continue child welfare services under this 26Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years   10400HB0871ham001- 54 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 2self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 3The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 4clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 5child welfare services under this Section and how such 6services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 7Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 8disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 9adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 10minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 11independent adults. 12    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 13review and appeal process for children and families who 14request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 15Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 16agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 17shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 18children and families in the case of placement by the 19Department, including the right to an initial review of a 20private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 21ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 22youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 23and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 24Department shall accept for administrative review and an 25appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 26with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following   10400HB0871ham001- 55 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a 2prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of 3subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 4concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 5conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 6current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 72-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a 8judicial determination on the merits of an administrative 9appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 10placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 11shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 12review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 13placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 14identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 15criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 16interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 17of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 18multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 19rules regarding placement changes shall be followed. The rules 20shall outline the essential elements of each form used in the 21implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this 22amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 23    (p) (Blank).24    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 25for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 26money or other property which is received on behalf of such   10400HB0871ham001- 56 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 2or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 3the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 45.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 5under Section 5.46.6    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 7interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 8institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 9responsible and who have been determined eligible for 10Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 11allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 12parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 13Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 14miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 15be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 16with this subsection.17    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 18Department shall:19        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 20    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 21    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 22    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 23    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 24    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 25    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 26    account for any purpose.  10400HB0871ham001- 57 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 2    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 3    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 4    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 5    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 6    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 7    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 8    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 9    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.10        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 11    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 12    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 13    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 14    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.15    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 16encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 17the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 18who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 19hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 20of such children who have not been placed for adoption.

The requirements of this   10400HB0871ham001- 6 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1Section concerning advance disbursements shall not apply with 2respect to the following: payments to local public agencies 3for child day care services as authorized by Section 5a of this 4Act; and youth service programs receiving grant funds under 5Section 17a-4.6    (e) (Blank).7    (f) (Blank).8    (g) The Department shall establish rules and regulations 9concerning its operation of programs designed to meet the 10goals of child safety and protection, family preservation, 11family reunification, and adoption, including, but not limited 12to:13        (1) adoption;14        (2) foster care;15        (3) family counseling;16        (4) protective services;17        (5) (blank);18        (6) homemaker service;19        (7) return of runaway children;20        (8) (blank);21        (9) placement under Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court 22    Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, 4-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile 23    Court Act of 1987 in accordance with the federal Adoption 24    Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980; and25        (10) interstate services.26    Rules and regulations established by the Department shall   10400HB0871ham001- 7 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1include provisions for training Department staff and the staff 2of Department grantees, through contracts with other agencies 3or resources, in screening techniques to identify substance 4use disorders, as defined in the Substance Use Disorder Act, 5approved by the Department of Human Services, as a successor 6to the Department of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, for the 7purpose of identifying children and adults who should be 8referred for an assessment at an organization appropriately 9licensed by the Department of Human Services for substance use 10disorder treatment.11    (h) If the Department finds that there is no appropriate 12program or facility within or available to the Department for 13a youth in care and that no licensed private facility has an 14adequate and appropriate program or none agrees to accept the 15youth in care, the Department shall create an appropriate 16individualized, program-oriented plan for such youth in care. 17The plan may be developed within the Department or through 18purchase of services by the Department to the extent that it is 19within its statutory authority to do.20    (i) Service programs shall be available throughout the 21State and shall include but not be limited to the following 22services:23        (1) case management;24        (2) homemakers;25        (3) counseling;26        (4) parent education;  10400HB0871ham001- 8 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1        (5) day care; and2        (6) emergency assistance and advocacy.3    In addition, the following services may be made available 4to assess and meet the needs of children and families:5        (1) comprehensive family-based services;6        (2) assessments;7        (3) respite care; and8        (4) in-home health services.9    The Department shall provide transportation for any of the 10services it makes available to children or families or for 11which it refers children or families.12    (j) The Department may provide categories of financial 13assistance and education assistance grants, and shall 14establish rules and regulations concerning the assistance and 15grants, to persons who adopt children with physical or mental 16disabilities, children who are older, or other hard-to-place 17children who (i) immediately prior to their adoption were 18youth in care or (ii) were determined eligible for financial 19assistance with respect to a prior adoption and who become 20available for adoption because the prior adoption has been 21dissolved and the parental rights of the adoptive parents have 22been terminated or because the child's adoptive parents have 23died. The Department may continue to provide financial 24assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was 25determined eligible for financial assistance under this 26subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the   10400HB0871ham001- 9 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization 2of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or 3parents. The Department may also provide categories of 4financial assistance and education assistance grants, and 5shall establish rules and regulations for the assistance and 6grants, to persons appointed guardian of the person under 7Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, 84-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 for children 9who were youth in care for 12 months immediately prior to the 10appointment of the guardian.11    The amount of assistance may vary, depending upon the 12needs of the child and the adoptive parents, as set forth in 13the annual assistance agreement. Special purpose grants are 14allowed where the child requires special service but such 15costs may not exceed the amounts which similar services would 16cost the Department if it were to provide or secure them as 17guardian of the child.18    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 19inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, 20garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 21a judgment or debt.22    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 23of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 24either outside of the Department region handling the case, or 25outside of the State of Illinois.26    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any   10400HB0871ham001- 10 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 2dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 3or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.4    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 5services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and 6Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including 7adoptive and extended families. Family preservation services 8shall be offered (i) to prevent the placement of children in 9substitute care when the children can be cared for at home or 10in the custody of the person responsible for the children's 11welfare, (ii) to reunite children with their families, or 12(iii) to maintain an adoptive placement. Family preservation 13services shall only be offered when doing so will not endanger 14the children's health or safety. With respect to children who 15are in substitute care pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of 161987, family preservation services shall not be offered if a 17goal other than those of subdivisions (A), (B), or (B-1) of 18subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act has been set, except 19that reunification services may be offered as provided in 20paragraph (F) of subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act. 21Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create a 22private right of action or claim on the part of any individual 23or child welfare agency, except that when a child is the 24subject of an action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act 25of 1987 and the child's service plan calls for services to 26facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court   10400HB0871ham001- 11 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1hearing the action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act 2of 1987 may order the Department to provide the services set 3out in the plan, if those services are not provided with 4reasonable promptness and if those services are available.5    The Department shall notify the child and the child's 6family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 7family preservation services as identified in the service 8plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 9services as soon as the report is determined to be 10"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 11family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 12or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 13investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 14Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 15willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 16investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 17child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 18child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 19services available from other agencies in the community, even 20if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 21in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 22subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 23child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 24voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 25child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 26alternative to an investigation, as provided under the   10400HB0871ham001- 12 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1"differential response program" provided for in subsection 2(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 3Reporting Act.4    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 5children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 6care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 7as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 8requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 9Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 10be committed to the Department by any court without the 11approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 12effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 132017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 14Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 15adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 16or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 17less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 18Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 19for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 20exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 21minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 22to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 232-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 242017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 25Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 26adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of   10400HB0871ham001- 13 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 2less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 3Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 4for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 5exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 6minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 7to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 82-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 9exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 10or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 11circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 12delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 13attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 14the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 15hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 16release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 17    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 18date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 19implement a special program of family preservation services to 20support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 21experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 22stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 23pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 24that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 25safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 26family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused   10400HB0871ham001- 14 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 2the child or family to services available from other agencies 3in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 4home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 5future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 6of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 7develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 8health and social service providers and the general public 9about these special family preservation services. The nature 10and scope of the services offered and the number of families 11served under the special program implemented under this 12paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 13Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 14"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 15a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 16Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 17edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 18Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.19    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 20interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 21most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 22possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 23the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 24concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 25earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 26include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of   10400HB0871ham001- 15 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1the family when the child can be cared for at home without 2endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 3the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 4is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 5permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.6    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 7respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 8making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 9shall be the paramount concern.10    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 11shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 12prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 13child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 14reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 15occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 16Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 17where the Department believes that further reunification 18services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 19the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 20The Department is not required to provide further 21reunification services after such a finding.22    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 23made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 24best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 25also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 26placement made is the best available placement to provide   10400HB0871ham001- 16 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1permanency for the child.2    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 3planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 4shall consider the following factors when determining 5appropriateness of concurrent planning:6        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;7        (2) the past history of the family;8        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 9    the family;10        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;11        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 12    family to reunite;13        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 14    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;15        (7) the age of the child;16        (8) placement of siblings.17    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 18child if:19        (1) it has received a written consent to such 20    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 21    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 22    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 23    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 24    or25        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 26    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be   10400HB0871ham001- 17 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1    located.2If the child is found in the child's residence without a 3parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 4Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 5temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 6Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 7guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 8willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 9and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 10relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 11child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 12a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 13such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 14resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 15home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 16follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 175-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.18    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 19and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 20pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 21Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 22custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 23Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 24acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 25limited custody, the Department, during the period of 26temporary custody and before the child is brought before a   10400HB0871ham001- 18 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 25-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 3authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 4of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 5the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.6    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 7custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 8examination.9    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 10temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 11the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 12Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 13the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 14The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1510 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 16the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 17Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 18Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 19the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 20the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 21custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 22later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 23the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 24temporary custody of the child shall terminate.25    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 26age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department   10400HB0871ham001- 19 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1that cares for children who are in need of secure living 2arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 3determination is made by the facility director and the 4Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 5facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 6of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 7subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 8pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 9unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 10of the Department before being subject to placement in a 11correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 12has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.13    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 14age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 15the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 16preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 17child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 18placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 19clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 20in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 21Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 22those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 23guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 24Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 25facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 26of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of   10400HB0871ham001- 20 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 2dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 3However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 4where children require specialized care and treatment for 5problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 6social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 7facilities for the placement of such children are not 8available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 9this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 10be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 11garnishment or otherwise.12    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 13welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 14sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 15minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 16subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 171987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 18provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 19yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 20responsibility for the development and delivery of services 21under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 22under this Section through the Department of Children and 23Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 24Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 25shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 26an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how   10400HB0871ham001- 21 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 2homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 3youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 4Department shall continue child welfare services under this 5Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 6of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 7self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 8The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 9clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 10child welfare services under this Section and how such 11services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 12Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 13disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 14adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 15minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 16independent adults. 17    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 18review and appeal process for children and families who 19request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 20Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 21agencies, and foster families with whom those youth are 22placed, shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal 23rights as children and families in the case of placement by the 24Department, including the right to an initial review of a 25private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 26ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts   10400HB0871ham001- 22 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 2and foster families. The Department shall accept for 3administrative review and an appeal hearing a complaint made 4by (i) a child or foster family concerning a decision 5following an initial review by a private child welfare agency 6or (ii) a prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation 7of subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 8concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 9conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 10current foster home placement is necessary and appropriate 11under Section 2-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not 12constitute a judicial determination on the merits of an 13administrative appeal, filed by a former foster parent, 14involving a change of placement decision.15    (p) (Blank).16    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 17for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 18money or other property which is received on behalf of such 19children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 20or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 21the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 225.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 23under Section 5.46.24    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 25interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 26institutions for children for whom the Department is legally   10400HB0871ham001- 23 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1responsible and who have been determined eligible for 2Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 3allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 4parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 5Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 6miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 7be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 8with this subsection.9    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 10Department shall:11        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 12    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 13    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 14    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 15    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 16    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 17    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 18    account for any purpose.19        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 20    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 21    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 22    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 23    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 24    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 25    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 26    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of   10400HB0871ham001- 24 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.2        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 3    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 4    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 5    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 6    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.7    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 8encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 9the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 10who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 11hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 12of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 13of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 14Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 15confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 16of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 17adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 18such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 19agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 20Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 21confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 22of the child.23    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 24establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and 25private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the 26Department of Children and Family Services for damages   10400HB0871ham001- 25 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or 2negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third 3party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions 4of foster children to other individuals.

The Department shall assign a caseworker to 16attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 17the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 18hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 19release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 20    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 21implement a special program of family preservation services to 22support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 23are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 24stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 25pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 26that those services are necessary to ensure the health and   10400HB0871ham001- 46 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 2family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 3and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 4the child or family to services available from other agencies 5in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 6home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 7future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 8of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 9develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 10health and social service providers and the general public 11about these special family preservation services. The nature 12and scope of the services offered and the number of families 13served under the special program implemented under this 14paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 15Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 16"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 17a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 18Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 19edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 20Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.21    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 22interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 23most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 24option for the child, consistent with the child's best 25interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 26Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is   10400HB0871ham001- 47 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General 2Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family 3Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 4occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 5arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 6outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 7at home without endangering the child's health or safety; 8reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if 9temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 10toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 11status.12    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 13respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 14making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 15shall be the paramount concern.16    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 17shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 18prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 19child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 20reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 21occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 22Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 23where the Department believes that further reunification 24services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 25the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 26The Department is not required to provide further   10400HB0871ham001- 48 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1reunification services after such a finding.2    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 3made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 4best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 5place the child with a relative, document those diligent 6efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 7secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue 8preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative 9is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 10concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 11Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 12in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 132025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 14diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 15relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 16should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 17delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 18permanent placement for the child.19    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 20planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 21shall consider the following factors when determining 22appropriateness of concurrent planning:23        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;24        (2) the past history of the family;25        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 26    the family;  10400HB0871ham001- 49 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;2        (4.5) the child's wishes; 3        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 4    family to reunite;5        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 6    provide a permanent placement;7        (7) the age of the child;8        (8) placement of siblings; and9        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 10    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 11    the child. 12    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 13child if:14        (1) it has received a written consent to such 15    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 16    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 17    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 18    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 19    or20        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 21    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 22    located.23If the child is found in the child's residence without a 24parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 25Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 26temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the   10400HB0871ham001- 50 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 2guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 3willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 4and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 5relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 6child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 7a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 8such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 9resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 10home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 11follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 125-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.13    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 14and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 15pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 16Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 17custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 18Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 19acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 20limited custody, the Department, during the period of 21temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 22judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 235-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 24authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 25of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 26the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.  10400HB0871ham001- 51 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 2custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 3examination.4    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 5temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 6the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 7Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 8the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 9The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 1010 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 11the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 12Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 13Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 14the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 15the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 16custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 17later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 18the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 19temporary custody of the child shall terminate.20    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 21age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 22that cares for children who are in need of secure living 23arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 24determination is made by the facility director and the 25Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 26facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act   10400HB0871ham001- 52 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 2subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 3pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 4unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 5of the Department before being subject to placement in a 6correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 7has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.8    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 9age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 10the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 11preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 12child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 13placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 14clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 15in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 16Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 17those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 18guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 19Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 20facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 21of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 22maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 23dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 24However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 25where children require specialized care and treatment for 26problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability,   10400HB0871ham001- 53 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 2facilities for the placement of such children are not 3available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 4this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 5be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 6garnishment or otherwise.7    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 8welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 9sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 10minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 11subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 121987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 13provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 14yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 15responsibility for the development and delivery of services 16under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 17under this Section through the Department of Children and 18Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 19Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 20shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 21an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 22the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 23homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 24youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 25Department shall continue child welfare services under this 26Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years   10400HB0871ham001- 54 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 2self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 3The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 4clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 5child welfare services under this Section and how such 6services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 7Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 8disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 9adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 10minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 11independent adults. 12    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 13review and appeal process for children and families who 14request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 15Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 16agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 17shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 18children and families in the case of placement by the 19Department, including the right to an initial review of a 20private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 21ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 22youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 23and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 24Department shall accept for administrative review and an 25appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 26with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following   10400HB0871ham001- 55 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a 2prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of 3subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 4concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 5conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 6current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 72-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a 8judicial determination on the merits of an administrative 9appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 10placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 11shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 12review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 13placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 14identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 15criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 16interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 17of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 18multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 19rules regarding placement changes shall be followed. The rules 20shall outline the essential elements of each form used in the 21implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this 22amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 23    (p) (Blank).24    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 25for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 26money or other property which is received on behalf of such   10400HB0871ham001- 56 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 2or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 3the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 45.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 5under Section 5.46.6    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 7interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 8institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 9responsible and who have been determined eligible for 10Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 11allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 12parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 13Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 14miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 15be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 16with this subsection.17    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 18Department shall:19        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 20    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 21    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 22    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 23    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 24    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 25    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 26    account for any purpose.  10400HB0871ham001- 57 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 2    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 3    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 4    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 5    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 6    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 7    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 8    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 9    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.10        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 11    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 12    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 13    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 14    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.15    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 16encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 17the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 18who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 19hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 20of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 21of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 22Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 23confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 24of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 25adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 26such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an   10400HB0871ham001- 58 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 2Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 3confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 4of the child.5    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 6establish and implement a program to reimburse caregivers 7licensed, certified, or otherwise approved by the Department 8of Children and Family Services for damages sustained by the 9caregivers as a result of the malicious or negligent acts of 10children placed by the Department, as well as providing third 11party coverage for such caregivers with regard to actions of 12children placed by the Department to other individuals. Such 13coverage will be secondary to the caregiver's liability 14insurance policy, if applicable. The program shall be funded 15through appropriations from the General Revenue Fund, 16specifically designated for such purposes.17    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 18investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 19as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 20Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:21        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 22    directs the Department to perform such services; and23        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 24    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 25    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 26    with Department rules, or has determined that neither   10400HB0871ham001- 59 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1    party is financially able to pay.2    The Department shall provide written notification to the 3court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 4and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 5The Department shall send to the court information related to 6the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 7determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The 8court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.9    (u) In addition to other information that must be 10provided, whenever the Department places a child with a 11prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster 12home, group home, or child care institution, in a relative 13home, or in a certified relative caregiver home, the 14Department shall provide to the caregiver, appropriate 15facility staff, or prospective adoptive parent or parents:16        (1) available detailed information concerning the 17    child's educational and health history, copies of 18    immunization records (including insurance and medical card 19    information), a history of the child's previous 20    placements, if any, and reasons for placement changes 21    excluding any information that identifies or reveals the 22    location of any previous caregiver or adoptive parents;23        (2) a copy of the child's portion of the client 24    service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and 25    all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; 26    and  10400HB0871ham001- 60 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1        (3) information containing details of the child's 2    individualized educational plan when the child is 3    receiving special education services.4    The caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective 5adoptive parent or parents, shall be informed of any known 6social or behavioral information (including, but not limited 7to, criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual 8abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to 9care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently 10in the home or setting. The Department may prepare a written 11summary of the information required by this paragraph, which 12may be provided to the caregiver, appropriate facility staff, 13or prospective adoptive parent in advance of a placement. The 14caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive 15parent may review the supporting documents in the child's file 16in the presence of casework staff. In the case of an emergency 17placement, casework staff shall at least provide known 18information verbally, if necessary, and must subsequently 19provide the information in writing as required by this 20subsection. 21    The information described in this subsection shall be 22provided in writing. In the case of emergency placements when 23time does not allow prior review, preparation, and collection 24of written information, the Department shall provide such 25information as it becomes available. Within 10 business days 26after placement, the Department shall obtain from the   10400HB0871ham001- 61 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive 2parent or parents a signed verification of receipt of the 3information provided. Within 10 business days after placement, 4the Department shall provide to the child's guardian ad litem 5a copy of the information provided to the caregiver, 6appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive parent or 7parents. The information provided to the caregiver, 8appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive parent or 9parents shall be reviewed and approved regarding accuracy at 10the supervisory level. 11    (u-5) Beginning July 1, 2025, certified relative caregiver 12homes under Section 3.4 of the Child Care Act of 1969 shall be 13eligible to receive foster care maintenance payments from the 14Department in an amount no less than payments made to licensed 15foster family homes. Beginning July 1, 2025, relative homes 16providing care to a child placed by the Department that are not 17a certified relative caregiver home under Section 3.4 of the 18Child Care Act of 1969 or a licensed foster family home shall 19be eligible to receive payments from the Department in an 20amount no less 90% of the payments made to licensed foster 21family homes and certified relative caregiver homes.22    (u-6) To assist relative and certified relative 23caregivers, no later than July 1, 2025, the Department shall 24adopt rules to implement a relative support program, as 25follows: 26        (1) For relative and certified relative caregivers,   10400HB0871ham001- 62 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1    the Department is authorized to reimburse or prepay 2    reasonable expenditures to remedy home conditions 3    necessary to fulfill the home safety-related requirements 4    of relative caregiver homes. 5        (2) The Department may provide short-term emergency 6    funds to relative and certified relative caregiver homes 7    experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 8    stress associated with adding youth in care as new 9    household members. 10        (3) Consistent with federal law, the Department shall 11    include in any State Plan made in accordance with the 12    Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, Titles 13    IV-E and XIX of the Social Security Act, and any other 14    applicable federal laws the provision of kinship navigator 15    program services. The Department shall apply for and 16    administer all relevant federal aid in accordance with 17    law. Federal funds acquired for the kinship navigator 18    program shall be used for the development, implementation, 19    and operation of kinship navigator program services. The 20    kinship navigator program services may provide 21    information, referral services, support, and assistance to 22    relative and certified relative caregivers of youth in 23    care to address their unique needs and challenges. Until 24    the Department is approved to receive federal funds for 25    these purposes, the Department shall publicly post on the 26    Department's website semi-annual updates regarding the   10400HB0871ham001- 63 -LRB104 04769 KTG 23080 a1    Department's progress in pursuing federal funding. 2    Whenever the Department publicly posts these updates on 3    its website, the Department shall notify the General 4    Assembly through the General Assembly's designee. 5    (u-7) To support finding permanency for children through 6subsidized guardianship and adoption and to prevent disruption 7in guardianship and adoptive placements, the Department shall 8establish and maintain accessible subsidized guardianship and 9adoption support services for all children under 18 years of 10age placed in guardianship or adoption who, immediately 11preceding the guardianship or adoption, were in the custody or 12guardianship of the Department under Article II of the 13Juvenile Court Act of 1987.14    The Department shall establish and maintain a toll-free 15number to respond to requests from the public about its 16subsidized guardianship and adoption support services under 17this subsection and shall staff the toll-free number so that 18calls are answered on a timely basis, but in no event more than 19one business day after the receipt of a request. These 20requests from the public may be made anonymously.
