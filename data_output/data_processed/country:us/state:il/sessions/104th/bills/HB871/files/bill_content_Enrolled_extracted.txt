The Department may continue to provide financial 17assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was 18determined eligible for financial assistance under this 19subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the 20child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization 21of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or 22parents.

The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 2services as soon as the report is determined to be 3"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 4family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 5or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 6investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 7Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 8willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 9investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 10child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 11child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 12services available from other agencies in the community, even 13if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 14in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 15subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 16child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 17voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 18child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 19alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 20"differential response program" provided for in subsection 21(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 22Reporting Act.23    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 24children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 25care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 26as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor   HB0871 Enrolled- 12 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 2Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 3be committed to the Department by any court without the 4approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 5effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 62017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 7Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 8adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 9or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 10less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 11Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 12for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 13exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 14minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 15to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 162-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 172017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 18Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 19adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 20or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 21less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 22Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 23for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 24exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 25minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 26to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section   HB0871 Enrolled- 13 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b12-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 2exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 3or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 4circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 5delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 6attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 7the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 8hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 9release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 10    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 11date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 12implement a special program of family preservation services to 13support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 14experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 15stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 16pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 17that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 18safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 19family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 20and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 21the child or family to services available from other agencies 22in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 23home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 24future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 25of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 26develop and implement a public information campaign to alert   HB0871 Enrolled- 14 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1health and social service providers and the general public 2about these special family preservation services. The nature 3and scope of the services offered and the number of families 4served under the special program implemented under this 5paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 6Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 7"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 8a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 9Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 10edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 11Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.12    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 13interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 14most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 15possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 16the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 17concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 18earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 19include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of 20the family when the child can be cared for at home without 21endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 22the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 23is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 24permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.25    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 26respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in   HB0871 Enrolled- 15 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 2shall be the paramount concern.3    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 4shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 5prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 6child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 7reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 8occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 9Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 10where the Department believes that further reunification 11services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 12the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 13The Department is not required to provide further 14reunification services after such a finding.15    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 16made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 17best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 18also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 19placement made is the best available placement to provide 20permanency for the child.21    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 22planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 23shall consider the following factors when determining 24appropriateness of concurrent planning:25        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;26        (2) the past history of the family;  HB0871 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 2    the family;3        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;4        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 5    family to reunite;6        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 7    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;8        (7) the age of the child;9        (8) placement of siblings.10    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 11child if:12        (1) it has received a written consent to such 13    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 14    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 15    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 16    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 17    or18        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 19    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 20    located.21If the child is found in the child's residence without a 22parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 23Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 24temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 25Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 26guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a   HB0871 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 2and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 3relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 4child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 5a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 6such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 7resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 8home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 9follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 105-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.11    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 12and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 13pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 14Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 15custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 16Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 17acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 18limited custody, the Department, during the period of 19temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 20judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 215-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 22authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 23of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 24the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.25    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 26custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical   HB0871 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1examination.2    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 3temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 4the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 5Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 6the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 7The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 810 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 9the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 10Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 11Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 12the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 13the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 14custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 15later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 16the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 17temporary custody of the child shall terminate.18    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 19age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 20that cares for children who are in need of secure living 21arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 22determination is made by the facility director and the 23Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 24facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 25of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 26subject to placement in a correctional facility operated   HB0871 Enrolled- 19 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 2unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 3of the Department before being subject to placement in a 4correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 5has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.6    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 7age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 8the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 9preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 10child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 11placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 12clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 13in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 14Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 15those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 16guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 17Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 18facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 19of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 20maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 21dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 22However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 23where children require specialized care and treatment for 24problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 25social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 26facilities for the placement of such children are not   HB0871 Enrolled- 20 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 2this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 3be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 4garnishment or otherwise.5    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 6welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 7sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 8minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 9subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 101987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 11provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 12yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 13responsibility for the development and delivery of services 14under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 15under this Section through the Department of Children and 16Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 17Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 18shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 19an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 20the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 21homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 22youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 23Department shall continue child welfare services under this 24Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 25of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 26self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan.   HB0871 Enrolled- 21 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 2clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 3child welfare services under this Section and how such 4services may be obtained.

Monthly, 17    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 18    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 19    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 20    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.21        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 22    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 23    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 24    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 25    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.26    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations   HB0871 Enrolled- 24 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 2the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 3who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 4hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 5of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 6of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 7Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 8confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 9of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 10adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 11such children for adoption.

With 9respect to children who are in substitute care pursuant to the 10Juvenile Court Act of 1987, family preservation services shall 11not be offered if a goal other than those of subdivisions (A), 12(B), or (B-1) of subsection (2.3) of Section 2-28 of that Act 13has been set, except that reunification services may be 14offered as provided in paragraph (F) of subsection (2.3) of 15Section 2-28 of that Act. Nothing in this paragraph shall be 16construed to create a private right of action or claim on the 17part of any individual or child welfare agency, except that 18when a child is the subject of an action under Article II of 19the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 and the child's service plan 20calls for services to facilitate achievement of the permanency 21goal, the court hearing the action under Article II of the 22Juvenile Court Act of 1987 may order the Department to provide 23the services set out in the plan, if those services are not 24provided with reasonable promptness and if those services are 25available.26    The Department shall notify the child and the child's   HB0871 Enrolled- 43 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 2family preservation services as identified in the service 3plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 4services as soon as the report is determined to be 5"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 6family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 7or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 8investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 9Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 10willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 11investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 12child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 13child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 14services available from other agencies in the community, even 15if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 16in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 17subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 18child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 19voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 20child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 21alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 22"differential response program" provided for in subsection 23(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 24Reporting Act.25    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 26children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for   HB0871 Enrolled- 44 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 2as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 3requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 4Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 5be committed to the Department by any court without the 6approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 7effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 82017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 9Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 10adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 11or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 12less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 13Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 14for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 15exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 16minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 17to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 182-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 192017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 20Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 21adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 22or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 23less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 24Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 25for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 26exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a   HB0871 Enrolled- 45 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 2to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 32-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 4exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 5or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 6circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 7delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 8attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 9the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 10hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 11release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 12    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 13implement a special program of family preservation services to 14support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 15are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 16stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 17pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 18that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 19safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 20family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 21and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 22the child or family to services available from other agencies 23in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 24home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 25future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 26of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall   HB0871 Enrolled- 46 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 2health and social service providers and the general public 3about these special family preservation services. The nature 4and scope of the services offered and the number of families 5served under the special program implemented under this 6paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 7Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 8"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 9a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 10Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 11edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 12Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.13    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 14interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 15most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 16option for the child, consistent with the child's best 17interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 18Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is 19practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General 20Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family 21Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 22occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 23arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 24outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 25at home without endangering the child's health or safety; 26reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if   HB0871 Enrolled- 47 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 2toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 3status.4    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 5respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 6making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 7shall be the paramount concern.8    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 9shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 10prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 11child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 12reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 13occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 14Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 15where the Department believes that further reunification 16services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 17the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 18The Department is not required to provide further 19reunification services after such a finding.20    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 21made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 22best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 23place the child with a relative, document those diligent 24efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 25secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue 26preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative   HB0871 Enrolled- 48 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 2concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 3Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 4in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 52025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 6diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 7relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 8should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 9delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 10permanent placement for the child.11    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 12planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 13shall consider the following factors when determining 14appropriateness of concurrent planning:15        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;16        (2) the past history of the family;17        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 18    the family;19        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;20        (4.5) the child's wishes; 21        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 22    family to reunite;23        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 24    provide a permanent placement;25        (7) the age of the child;26        (8) placement of siblings; and  HB0871 Enrolled- 49 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 2    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 3    the child. 4    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 5child if:6        (1) it has received a written consent to such 7    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 8    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 9    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 10    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 11    or12        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 13    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 14    located.15If the child is found in the child's residence without a 16parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 17Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 18temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 19Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 20guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 21willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 22and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 23relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 24child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 25a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 26such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and   HB0871 Enrolled- 50 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 2home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 3follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 45-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.5    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 6and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 7pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 8Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 9custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 10Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 11acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 12limited custody, the Department, during the period of 13temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 14judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 155-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 16authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 17of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 18the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.19    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 20custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 21examination.22    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 23temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 24the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 25Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 26the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child.   HB0871 Enrolled- 51 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 210 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 3the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 4Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 5Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 6the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 7the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 8custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 9later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 10the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 11temporary custody of the child shall terminate.12    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 13age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 14that cares for children who are in need of secure living 15arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 16determination is made by the facility director and the 17Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 18facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 19of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 20subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 21pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 22unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 23of the Department before being subject to placement in a 24correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 25has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.26    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of   HB0871 Enrolled- 52 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 2the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 3preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 4child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 5placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 6clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 7in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 8Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 9those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 10guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 11Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 12facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 13of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 14maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 15dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 16However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 17where children require specialized care and treatment for 18problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 19social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 20facilities for the placement of such children are not 21available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 22this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 23be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 24garnishment or otherwise.25    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 26welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve   HB0871 Enrolled- 53 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 2minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 3subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 41987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 5provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 6yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 7responsibility for the development and delivery of services 8under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 9under this Section through the Department of Children and 10Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 11Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 12shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 13an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 14the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 15homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 16youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 17Department shall continue child welfare services under this 18Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 19of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 20self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 21The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 22clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 23child welfare services under this Section and how such 24services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 25Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 26disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall   HB0871 Enrolled- 54 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 2minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 3independent adults. 4    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 5review and appeal process for children and families who 6request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 7Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 8agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 9shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 10children and families in the case of placement by the 11Department, including the right to an initial review of a 12private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 13ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 14youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 15and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 16Department shall accept for administrative review and an 17appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 18with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following 19an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a 20prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of 21subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 22concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 23conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 24current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 252-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a 26judicial determination on the merits of an administrative   HB0871 Enrolled- 55 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 2placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 3shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 4review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 5placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 6identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 7criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 8interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 9of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 10multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 11rules regarding placement changes shall be followed. The rules 12shall outline the essential elements of each form used in the 13implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this 14amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 15    (p) (Blank).16    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 17for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 18money or other property which is received on behalf of such 19children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 20or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 21the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 225.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 23under Section 5.46.24    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 25interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 26institutions for children for whom the Department is legally   HB0871 Enrolled- 56 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1responsible and who have been determined eligible for 2Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 3allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 4parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 5Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 6miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 7be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 8with this subsection.9    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 10Department shall:11        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 12    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 13    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 14    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 15    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 16    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 17    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 18    account for any purpose.19        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 20    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 21    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 22    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 23    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 24    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 25    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 26    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of   HB0871 Enrolled- 57 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.2        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 3    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 4    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 5    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 6    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.7    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 8encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 9the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 10who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 11hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 12of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 13of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 14Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 15confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 16of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 17adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 18such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 19agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 20Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 21confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 22of the child.23    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 24establish and implement a program to reimburse caregivers 25licensed, certified, or otherwise approved by the Department 26of Children and Family Services for damages sustained by the   HB0871 Enrolled- 58 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1caregivers as a result of the malicious or negligent acts of 2children placed by the Department, as well as providing third 3party coverage for such caregivers with regard to actions of 4children placed by the Department to other individuals. Such 5coverage will be secondary to the caregiver's liability 6insurance policy, if applicable. The program shall be funded 7through appropriations from the General Revenue Fund, 8specifically designated for such purposes.9    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 10investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 11as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 12Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:13        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 14    directs the Department to perform such services; and15        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 16    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 17    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 18    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 19    party is financially able to pay.20    The Department shall provide written notification to the 21court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 22and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 23The Department shall send to the court information related to 24the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 25determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The 26court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.  HB0871 Enrolled- 59 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    (u) In addition to other information that must be 2provided, whenever the Department places a child with a 3prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster 4home, group home, or child care institution, in a relative 5home, or in a certified relative caregiver home, the 6Department shall provide to the caregiver, appropriate 7facility staff, or prospective adoptive parent or parents:8        (1) available detailed information concerning the 9    child's educational and health history, copies of 10    immunization records (including insurance and medical card 11    information), a history of the child's previous 12    placements, if any, and reasons for placement changes 13    excluding any information that identifies or reveals the 14    location of any previous caregiver or adoptive parents;15        (2) a copy of the child's portion of the client 16    service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and 17    all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; 18    and19        (3) information containing details of the child's 20    individualized educational plan when the child is 21    receiving special education services.22    The caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective 23adoptive parent or parents, shall be informed of any known 24social or behavioral information (including, but not limited 25to, criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual 26abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to   HB0871 Enrolled- 60 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently 2in the home or setting. The Department may prepare a written 3summary of the information required by this paragraph, which 4may be provided to the caregiver, appropriate facility staff, 5or prospective adoptive parent in advance of a placement. The 6caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive 7parent may review the supporting documents in the child's file 8in the presence of casework staff. In the case of an emergency 9placement, casework staff shall at least provide known 10information verbally, if necessary, and must subsequently 11provide the information in writing as required by this 12subsection. 13    The information described in this subsection shall be 14provided in writing. In the case of emergency placements when 15time does not allow prior review, preparation, and collection 16of written information, the Department shall provide such 17information as it becomes available. Within 10 business days 18after placement, the Department shall obtain from the 19caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive 20parent or parents a signed verification of receipt of the 21information provided.

The Child Care Act of 1969 is amended by 25changing Section 3.4 as follows:   HB0871 Enrolled- 72 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    (225 ILCS 10/3.4)2    (This Section may contain text from a Public Act with a 3delayed effective date)4    Sec. 3.4. Standards for certified relative caregiver 5homes.6    (a) No later than July 1, 2025, the Department shall adopt 7rules outlining the standards for certified relative caregiver 8homes, which are reasonably in accordance with the national 9consortium recommendations and federal law and rules, and 10consistent with the requirements of this Act. The standards 11for certified relative caregiver homes shall: (i) be different 12from licensing standards used for non-relative foster family 13homes under Section 4; (ii) align with the recommendation of 14the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' 15Administration for Children and Families for implementation of 16Section 471(a)(10), 471(a)(11), and 471(a)(20) and Section 474 17of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act; (iii) be no more 18restrictive than, and reasonably in accordance with, national 19consortium recommendations; and (iv) address background 20screening for caregivers and other household residents and 21assessing home safety and caregiver capacity to meet the 22identified child's needs.23    A guiding premise for certified relative caregiver home 24standards is that foster care maintenance payments for every 25relative, starting upon placement, regardless of federal   HB0871 Enrolled- 73 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1reimbursement, are critical to ensure that the basic needs and 2well-being of all children in relative care are being met. If 3an agency places a child in the care of a relative, the 4relative must immediately be provided with adequate support to 5care for that child. The Department shall review foster care 6maintenance payments to ensure that children receive the same 7amount of foster care maintenance payments whether placed in a 8certified relative caregiver home or a licensed foster family 9home. 10    In developing rules, the Department shall solicit and 11incorporate feedback from relative caregivers. No later than 1260 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 13103rd General Assembly, the Department shall begin soliciting 14input from relatives who are currently or have recently been 15caregivers to youth in care to develop the rules and 16procedures to implement the requirements of this Section. The 17Department shall solicit this input in a manner convenient for 18caregivers to participate, including without limitation, 19in-person convenings at after hours and weekend venues, 20locations that provide child care, and modalities that are 21accessible and welcoming to new and experienced relative 22caregivers from all regions of the State. The rules shall 23outline the essential elements of each form used in the 24implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this 25amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 26    (b) In order to assess whether standards are met for a   HB0871 Enrolled- 74 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1certified relative caregiver home under this Section, the 2Department or a licensed child welfare agency shall: 3        (1) complete the home safety and needs assessment and 4    identify and provide any necessary concrete goods or 5    safety modifications to assist the prospective certified 6    relative caregiver in meeting the needs of the specific 7    child or children being placed by the Department, in a 8    manner consistent with Department rule;9        (2) assess the ability of the prospective certified 10    relative caregiver to care for the physical, emotional, 11    medical, and educational needs of the specific child or 12    children being placed by the Department using the protocol 13    and form provided through national consortium 14    recommendations; and15        (3) using the standard background check form 16    established by rule, complete a background check for each 17    person seeking certified relative caregiver approval and 18    any other adults living in the home as required under this 19    Section. 20    (c) The Department or a licensed child welfare agency 21shall conduct the following background screening investigation 22for every prospective certified relative caregiver and adult 23resident living in the home:24        (1) a name-based State, local, or tribal criminal 25    background check, and as soon as reasonably possible, 26    initiate a fingerprint-based background check;  HB0871 Enrolled- 75 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1        (2) a review of this State's Central Registry and 2    registries of any state in which an adult household member 3    has resided in the last 5 years, if applicable to 4    determine if the person has been determined to be a 5    perpetrator in an indicated report of child abuse or 6    neglect; and7        (3) a review of the sex offender registry. 8    No home may be a certified relative caregiver home if any 9prospective caregivers or adult residents in the home refuse 10to authorize a background screening investigation as required 11by this Section. Only information and standards that bear a 12reasonable and rational relation to the caregiving capacity of 13the certified relative caregiver and adult member of the 14household and overall safety provided by residents of that 15home shall be used by the Department or licensed child welfare 16agency. 17    In approving a certified relative caregiver home in 18accordance with this Section, if an adult has a criminal 19record, the Department or licensed child welfare agency shall 20thoroughly investigate and evaluate the criminal history of 21the adult and, in so doing, include an assessment of the 22adult's character and, in the case of the prospective 23certified relative caregiver, the impact that the criminal 24history has on the prospective certified relative caregiver's 25ability to parent the child; the investigation should consider 26the type of crime, the number of crimes, the nature of the   HB0871 Enrolled- 76 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1offense, the age of the person at the time of the crime, the 2length of time that has elapsed since the last conviction, the 3relationship of the crime to the ability to care for children, 4the role that adult will have with the child, and any evidence 5of rehabilitation. In accordance with federal law, a home 6shall not be approved if the record of the prospective 7certified relative caregiver's background screening reveals: 8(i) a felony conviction for child abuse or neglect, for 9spousal abuse, for a crime against children crimes against a 10child, including child pornography, or for a crime involving 11violence, including human trafficking, sex trafficking, of 12rape, sexual assault, or homicide, but not including other 13physical assault or battery; or (ii) a felony conviction in 14the last 5 years for physical assault, battery, or a 15drug-related offense. 16    If the Department is contemplating denying approval of a 17certified relative caregiver home, the Department shall 18provide a written notice in the prospective certified relative 19caregiver's primary language to each prospective certified 20relative caregiver before the Department takes final action to 21deny approval of the home. This written notice shall include 22the specific reason or reasons the Department is considering 23denial, list actions prospective certified relative caregivers 24can take, if any, to remedy such conditions and the timeframes 25in which such actions would need to be completed, explain 26reasonable supports that the Department can provide to assist   HB0871 Enrolled- 77 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1the prospective certified relative caregivers in taking 2remedial actions and how the prospective certified relative 3caregivers can request such assistance, and provide the 4recourse prospective certified relative caregivers can seek to 5resolve disputes about the Department's findings. The 6Department shall provide prospective certified relative 7caregivers reasonable opportunity pursuant to rulemaking to 8cure any remediable deficiencies that the Department 9identified before taking final action to deny approval of a 10certified relative caregiver home. 11    If conditions have not been remedied after a reasonable 12opportunity and assistance to cure identified deficiencies has 13been provided, the Department shall provide a final written 14notice explaining the reasons for denying the certified 15relative caregiver home approval and the reconsideration 16process to review the decision to deny certification. The 17Department shall not prohibit a prospective certified relative 18caregiver from being reconsidered for approval if the 19prospective certified relative caregivers are able to 20demonstrate a change in circumstances that improves deficient 21conditions. 22    Documentation that a certified relative caregiver home 23meets the required standards may be filed on behalf of such 24homes by a licensed child welfare agency, by a State agency 25authorized to place children in foster care, or by 26out-of-state agencies approved by the Department to place   HB0871 Enrolled- 78 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1children in this State. For documentation on behalf of a home 2in which specific children are placed by and remain under 3supervision of the applicant agency, such agency shall 4document that the certified relative caregiver home, 5responsible for the care of related specific children therein, 6was found to be in reasonable compliance with standards 7prescribed by the Department for certified relative caregiver 8homes under this Section. Certification is applicable to one 9or more related children and documentation for certification 10shall indicate the specific child or children who would be 11eligible for placement in this certified relative caregiver 12home. 13    Information concerning criminal convictions of prospective 14certified relative caregivers and adult residents of a 15prospective certified relative caregiver home investigated 16under this Section, including the source of the information, 17State conviction information provided by the Illinois State 18Police, and any conclusions or recommendations derived from 19the information, shall be offered to the prospective certified 20relative caregivers and adult residents of a prospective 21certified relative caregiver home, and provided, upon request, 22to such persons prior to final action by the Department in the 23certified relative caregiver home approval process. 24    Any information concerning criminal charges or the 25disposition of such criminal charges obtained by the 26Department shall be confidential and may not be transmitted   HB0871 Enrolled- 79 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1outside the Department, except as required or permitted by 2State or federal law, and may not be transmitted to anyone 3within the Department except as needed for the purpose of 4evaluating standards for a certified relative caregiver home 5or for evaluating the placement of a specific child in the 6home.

The Department may also provide services to any 10child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 11child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 12services available from other agencies in the community, even 13if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 14in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 15subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 16child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 17voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 18child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 19alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 20"differential response program" provided for in subsection 21(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 22Reporting Act.23    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 24children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 25care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 26as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor   HB0871 Enrolled- 12 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 2Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 3be committed to the Department by any court without the 4approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 5effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 62017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 7Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 8adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 9or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 10less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 11Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 12for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 13exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 14minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 15to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 162-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 172017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 18Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 19adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 20or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 21less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 22Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 23for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 24exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 25minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 26to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section   HB0871 Enrolled- 13 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b12-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 2exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 3or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 4circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 5delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 6attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 7the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 8hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 9release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 10    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 11date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 12implement a special program of family preservation services to 13support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 14experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 15stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 16pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 17that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 18safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 19family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 20and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 21the child or family to services available from other agencies 22in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 23home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 24future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 25of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 26develop and implement a public information campaign to alert   HB0871 Enrolled- 14 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1health and social service providers and the general public 2about these special family preservation services. The nature 3and scope of the services offered and the number of families 4served under the special program implemented under this 5paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 6Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 7"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 8a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 9Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 10edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 11Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.12    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 13interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 14most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 15possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 16the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 17concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 18earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 19include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of 20the family when the child can be cared for at home without 21endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 22the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 23is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 24permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.25    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 26respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in   HB0871 Enrolled- 15 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 2shall be the paramount concern.3    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 4shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 5prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 6child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 7reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 8occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 9Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 10where the Department believes that further reunification 11services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 12the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 13The Department is not required to provide further 14reunification services after such a finding.15    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 16made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 17best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 18also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 19placement made is the best available placement to provide 20permanency for the child.21    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 22planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 23shall consider the following factors when determining 24appropriateness of concurrent planning:25        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;26        (2) the past history of the family;  HB0871 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 2    the family;3        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;4        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 5    family to reunite;6        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 7    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;8        (7) the age of the child;9        (8) placement of siblings.10    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 11child if:12        (1) it has received a written consent to such 13    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 14    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 15    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 16    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 17    or18        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 19    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 20    located.21If the child is found in the child's residence without a 22parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 23Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 24temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 25Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 26guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a   HB0871 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 2and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 3relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 4child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 5a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 6such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 7resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 8home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 9follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 105-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.11    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 12and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 13pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 14Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 15custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 16Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 17acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 18limited custody, the Department, during the period of 19temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 20judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 215-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 22authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 23of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 24the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.25    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 26custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical   HB0871 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1examination.2    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 3temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 4the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 5Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 6the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 7The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 810 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 9the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 10Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 11Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 12the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 13the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 14custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 15later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 16the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 17temporary custody of the child shall terminate.18    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 19age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 20that cares for children who are in need of secure living 21arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 22determination is made by the facility director and the 23Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 24facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 25of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 26subject to placement in a correctional facility operated   HB0871 Enrolled- 19 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 2unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 3of the Department before being subject to placement in a 4correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 5has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.6    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 7age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 8the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 9preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 10child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 11placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 12clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 13in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 14Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 15those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 16guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 17Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 18facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 19of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 20maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 21dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 22However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 23where children require specialized care and treatment for 24problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 25social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 26facilities for the placement of such children are not   HB0871 Enrolled- 20 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 2this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 3be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 4garnishment or otherwise.5    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 6welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 7sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 8minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 9subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 101987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 11provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 12yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 13responsibility for the development and delivery of services 14under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 15under this Section through the Department of Children and 16Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 17Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 18shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 19an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 20the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 21homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 22youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 23Department shall continue child welfare services under this 24Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 25of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 26self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan.   HB0871 Enrolled- 21 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 2clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 3child welfare services under this Section and how such 4services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 5Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 6disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 7adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 8minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 9independent adults. 10    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 11review and appeal process for children and families who 12request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 13Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 14agencies, and foster families with whom those youth are 15placed, shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal 16rights as children and families in the case of placement by the 17Department, including the right to an initial review of a 18private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 19ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 20youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 21and foster families. The Department shall accept for 22administrative review and an appeal hearing a complaint made 23by (i) a child or foster family concerning a decision 24following an initial review by a private child welfare agency 25or (ii) a prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation 26of subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision   HB0871 Enrolled- 22 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 2conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 3current foster home placement is necessary and appropriate 4under Section 2-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not 5constitute a judicial determination on the merits of an 6administrative appeal, filed by a former foster parent, 7involving a change of placement decision.8    (p) (Blank).9    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 10for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 11money or other property which is received on behalf of such 12children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 13or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 14the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 155.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 16under Section 5.46.17    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 18interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 19institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 20responsible and who have been determined eligible for 21Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 22allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 23parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 24Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 25miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 26be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance   HB0871 Enrolled- 23 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1with this subsection.2    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 3Department shall:4        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 5    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 6    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 7    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 8    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 9    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 10    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 11    account for any purpose.12        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 13    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 14    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 15    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 16    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 17    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 18    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 19    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 20    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.21        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 22    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 23    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 24    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 25    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.26    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations   HB0871 Enrolled- 24 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 2the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 3who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 4hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 5of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 6of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 7Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 8confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 9of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 10adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 11such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 12agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 13Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 14confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 15of the child.16    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 17establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and 18private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the 19Department of Children and Family Services for damages 20sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or 21negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third 22party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions 23of foster children to other individuals. Such coverage will be 24secondary to the foster parent liability insurance policy, if 25applicable. The program shall be funded through appropriations 26from the General Revenue Fund, specifically designated for   HB0871 Enrolled- 25 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1such purposes.2    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 3investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 4as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 5Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:6        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 7    directs the Department to perform such services; and8        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 9    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 10    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 11    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 12    party is financially able to pay.13    The Department shall provide written notification to the 14court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 15and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 16The Department shall send to the court information related to 17the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 18determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The 19court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.20    (u) In addition to other information that must be 21provided, whenever the Department places a child with a 22prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster 23home, group home, or child care institution, or in a relative 24home, the Department shall provide to the prospective adoptive 25parent or parents or other caretaker:26        (1) available detailed information concerning the   HB0871 Enrolled- 26 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    child's educational and health history, copies of 2    immunization records (including insurance and medical card 3    information), a history of the child's previous 4    placements, if any, and reasons for placement changes 5    excluding any information that identifies or reveals the 6    location of any previous caretaker;7        (2) a copy of the child's portion of the client 8    service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and 9    all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; 10    and11        (3) information containing details of the child's 12    individualized educational plan when the child is 13    receiving special education services.14    The caretaker shall be informed of any known social or 15behavioral information (including, but not limited to, 16criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual 17abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to 18care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently 19in the home. The Department may prepare a written summary of 20the information required by this paragraph, which may be 21provided to the foster or prospective adoptive parent in 22advance of a placement. The foster or prospective adoptive 23parent may review the supporting documents in the child's file 24in the presence of casework staff. In the case of an emergency 25placement, casework staff shall at least provide known 26information verbally, if necessary, and must subsequently   HB0871 Enrolled- 27 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1provide the information in writing as required by this 2subsection. 3    The information described in this subsection shall be 4provided in writing. In the case of emergency placements when 5time does not allow prior review, preparation, and collection 6of written information, the Department shall provide such 7information as it becomes available. Within 10 business days 8after placement, the Department shall obtain from the 9prospective adoptive parent or parents or other caretaker a 10signed verification of receipt of the information provided. 11Within 10 business days after placement, the Department shall 12provide to the child's guardian ad litem a copy of the 13information provided to the prospective adoptive parent or 14parents or other caretaker. The information provided to the 15prospective adoptive parent or parents or other caretaker 16shall be reviewed and approved regarding accuracy at the 17supervisory level. 18    (u-5) Effective July 1, 1995, only foster care placements 19licensed as foster family homes pursuant to the Child Care Act 20of 1969 shall be eligible to receive foster care payments from 21the Department. Relative caregivers who, as of July 1, 1995, 22were approved pursuant to approved relative placement rules 23previously promulgated by the Department at 89 Ill. Adm. Code 24335 and had submitted an application for licensure as a foster 25family home may continue to receive foster care payments only 26until the Department determines that they may be licensed as a   HB0871 Enrolled- 28 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1foster family home or that their application for licensure is 2denied or until September 30, 1995, whichever occurs first.3    (v) The Department shall access criminal history record 4information as defined in the Illinois Uniform Conviction 5Information Act and information maintained in the adjudicatory 6and dispositional record system as defined in Section 2605-355 7of the Illinois State Police Law if the Department determines 8the information is necessary to perform its duties under the 9Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, the Child Care Act 10of 1969, and the Children and Family Services Act.

The Department may continue to provide financial 18assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was 19determined eligible for financial assistance under this 20subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the 21child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization 22of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or 23parents. The Department may also provide categories of 24financial assistance and education assistance grants, and 25shall establish rules and regulations for the assistance and 26grants, to persons appointed guardian of the person under   HB0871 Enrolled- 41 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, 24-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 for children 3who were youth in care for 12 months immediately prior to the 4appointment of the guardian.5    The amount of assistance may vary, depending upon the 6needs of the child and the adoptive parents or subsidized 7guardians, as set forth in the annual assistance agreement. 8Special purpose grants are allowed where the child requires 9special service but such costs may not exceed the amounts 10which similar services would cost the Department if it were to 11provide or secure them as guardian of the child.12    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 13inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, 14garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 15a judgment or debt.16    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 17of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 18either outside of the Department region handling the case, or 19outside of the State of Illinois.20    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any 21child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 22dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 23or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.24    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 25services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and 26Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including   HB0871 Enrolled- 42 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1adoptive and extended families.

With 9respect to children who are in substitute care pursuant to the 10Juvenile Court Act of 1987, family preservation services shall 11not be offered if a goal other than those of subdivisions (A), 12(B), or (B-1) of subsection (2.3) of Section 2-28 of that Act 13has been set, except that reunification services may be 14offered as provided in paragraph (F) of subsection (2.3) of 15Section 2-28 of that Act. Nothing in this paragraph shall be 16construed to create a private right of action or claim on the 17part of any individual or child welfare agency, except that 18when a child is the subject of an action under Article II of 19the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 and the child's service plan 20calls for services to facilitate achievement of the permanency 21goal, the court hearing the action under Article II of the 22Juvenile Court Act of 1987 may order the Department to provide 23the services set out in the plan, if those services are not 24provided with reasonable promptness and if those services are 25available.26    The Department shall notify the child and the child's   HB0871 Enrolled- 43 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 2family preservation services as identified in the service 3plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 4services as soon as the report is determined to be 5"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 6family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 7or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 8investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 9Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 10willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 11investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 12child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 13child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 14services available from other agencies in the community, even 15if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 16in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 17subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 18child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 19voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 20child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 21alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 22"differential response program" provided for in subsection 23(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 24Reporting Act.25    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 26children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for   HB0871 Enrolled- 44 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 2as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 3requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 4Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 5be committed to the Department by any court without the 6approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 7effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 82017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 9Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 10adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 11or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 12less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 13Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 14for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 15exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 16minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 17to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 182-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 192017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 20Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 21adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 22or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 23less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 24Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 25for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 26exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a   HB0871 Enrolled- 45 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 2to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 32-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 4exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 5or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 6circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 7delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 8attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 9the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 10hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 11release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 12    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 13implement a special program of family preservation services to 14support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 15are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 16stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 17pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 18that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 19safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 20family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 21and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 22the child or family to services available from other agencies 23in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 24home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 25future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 26of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall   HB0871 Enrolled- 46 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 2health and social service providers and the general public 3about these special family preservation services. The nature 4and scope of the services offered and the number of families 5served under the special program implemented under this 6paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 7Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 8"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 9a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 10Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 11edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 12Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.13    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 14interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 15most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 16option for the child, consistent with the child's best 17interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 18Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is 19practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General 20Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family 21Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 22occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 23arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 24outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 25at home without endangering the child's health or safety; 26reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if   HB0871 Enrolled- 47 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 2toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 3status.4    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 5respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 6making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 7shall be the paramount concern.8    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 9shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 10prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 11child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 12reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 13occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 14Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 15where the Department believes that further reunification 16services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 17the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 18The Department is not required to provide further 19reunification services after such a finding.20    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 21made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 22best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 23place the child with a relative, document those diligent 24efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 25secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue 26preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative   HB0871 Enrolled- 48 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 2concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 3Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 4in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 52025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 6diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 7relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 8should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 9delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 10permanent placement for the child.11    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 12planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 13shall consider the following factors when determining 14appropriateness of concurrent planning:15        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;16        (2) the past history of the family;17        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 18    the family;19        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;20        (4.5) the child's wishes; 21        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 22    family to reunite;23        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 24    provide a permanent placement;25        (7) the age of the child;26        (8) placement of siblings; and  HB0871 Enrolled- 49 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 2    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 3    the child. 4    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 5child if:6        (1) it has received a written consent to such 7    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 8    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 9    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 10    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 11    or12        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 13    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 14    located.15If the child is found in the child's residence without a 16parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 17Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 18temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 19Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 20guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 21willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 22and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 23relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 24child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 25a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 26such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and   HB0871 Enrolled- 50 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 2home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 3follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 45-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.5    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 6and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 7pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 8Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 9custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 10Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 11acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 12limited custody, the Department, during the period of 13temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 14judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 155-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 16authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 17of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 18the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.19    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 20custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 21examination.22    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 23temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 24the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 25Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 26the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child.   HB0871 Enrolled- 51 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 210 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 3the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 4Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 5Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 6the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 7the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 8custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 9later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 10the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 11temporary custody of the child shall terminate.12    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 13age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 14that cares for children who are in need of secure living 15arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 16determination is made by the facility director and the 17Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 18facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 19of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 20subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 21pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 22unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 23of the Department before being subject to placement in a 24correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 25has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.26    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of   HB0871 Enrolled- 52 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 2the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 3preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 4child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 5placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 6clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 7in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 8Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 9those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 10guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 11Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 12facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 13of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 14maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 15dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 16However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 17where children require specialized care and treatment for 18problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 19social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 20facilities for the placement of such children are not 21available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 22this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 23be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 24garnishment or otherwise.25    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 26welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve   HB0871 Enrolled- 53 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 2minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 3subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 41987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 5provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 6yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 7responsibility for the development and delivery of services 8under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 9under this Section through the Department of Children and 10Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 11Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 12shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 13an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 14the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 15homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 16youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 17Department shall continue child welfare services under this 18Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 19of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 20self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 21The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 22clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 23child welfare services under this Section and how such 24services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 25Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 26disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall   HB0871 Enrolled- 54 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 2minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 3independent adults. 4    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 5review and appeal process for children and families who 6request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 7Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 8agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 9shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 10children and families in the case of placement by the 11Department, including the right to an initial review of a 12private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 13ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 14youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 15and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 16Department shall accept for administrative review and an 17appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 18with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following 19an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a 20prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of 21subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 22concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 23conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 24current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 252-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a 26judicial determination on the merits of an administrative   HB0871 Enrolled- 55 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 2placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 3shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 4review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 5placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 6identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 7criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 8interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 9of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 10multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 11rules regarding placement changes shall be followed. The rules 12shall outline the essential elements of each form used in the 13implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this 14amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 15    (p) (Blank).16    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 17for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 18money or other property which is received on behalf of such 19children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 20or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 21the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 225.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 23under Section 5.46.24    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 25interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 26institutions for children for whom the Department is legally   HB0871 Enrolled- 56 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1responsible and who have been determined eligible for 2Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 3allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 4parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 5Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 6miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 7be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 8with this subsection.9    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 10Department shall:11        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 12    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 13    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 14    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 15    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 16    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 17    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 18    account for any purpose.19        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 20    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 21    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 22    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 23    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 24    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 25    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 26    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of   HB0871 Enrolled- 57 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.2        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 3    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 4    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 5    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 6    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.7    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 8encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 9the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 10who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 11hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 12of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 13of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 14Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 15confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 16of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 17adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 18such children for adoption.

Such 5coverage will be secondary to the caregiver's liability 6insurance policy, if applicable. The program shall be funded 7through appropriations from the General Revenue Fund, 8specifically designated for such purposes.9    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 10investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 11as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 12Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:13        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 14    directs the Department to perform such services; and15        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 16    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 17    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 18    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 19    party is financially able to pay.20    The Department shall provide written notification to the 21court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 22and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 23The Department shall send to the court information related to 24the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 25determined the parties are financially unable to pay.

The Child Care Act of 1969 is amended by 25changing Section 3.4 as follows:   HB0871 Enrolled- 72 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    (225 ILCS 10/3.4)2    (This Section may contain text from a Public Act with a 3delayed effective date)4    Sec. 3.4. Standards for certified relative caregiver 5homes.6    (a) No later than July 1, 2025, the Department shall adopt 7rules outlining the standards for certified relative caregiver 8homes, which are reasonably in accordance with the national 9consortium recommendations and federal law and rules, and 10consistent with the requirements of this Act. The standards 11for certified relative caregiver homes shall: (i) be different 12from licensing standards used for non-relative foster family 13homes under Section 4; (ii) align with the recommendation of 14the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' 15Administration for Children and Families for implementation of 16Section 471(a)(10), 471(a)(11), and 471(a)(20) and Section 474 17of Title IV-E of the Social Security Act; (iii) be no more 18restrictive than, and reasonably in accordance with, national 19consortium recommendations; and (iv) address background 20screening for caregivers and other household residents and 21assessing home safety and caregiver capacity to meet the 22identified child's needs.23    A guiding premise for certified relative caregiver home 24standards is that foster care maintenance payments for every 25relative, starting upon placement, regardless of federal   HB0871 Enrolled- 73 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1reimbursement, are critical to ensure that the basic needs and 2well-being of all children in relative care are being met. If 3an agency places a child in the care of a relative, the 4relative must immediately be provided with adequate support to 5care for that child. The Department shall review foster care 6maintenance payments to ensure that children receive the same 7amount of foster care maintenance payments whether placed in a 8certified relative caregiver home or a licensed foster family 9home. 10    In developing rules, the Department shall solicit and 11incorporate feedback from relative caregivers.
