The Department may continue to provide financial 17assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was 18determined eligible for financial assistance under this 19subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the 20child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization 21of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or 22parents.

The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 2services as soon as the report is determined to be 3"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 4family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 5or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 6investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 7Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 8willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 9investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 10child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 11child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 12services available from other agencies in the community, even 13if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 14in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 15subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 16child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 17voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 18child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 19alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 20"differential response program" provided for in subsection 21(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 22Reporting Act.23    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 24children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 25care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 26as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor   HB0871 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 2Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 3be committed to the Department by any court without the 4approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 5effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 62017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 7Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 8adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 9or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 10less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 11Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 12for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 13exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 14minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 15to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 162-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 172017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 18Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 19adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 20or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 21less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 22Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 23for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 24exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 25minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 26to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section   HB0871 Engrossed- 13 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b12-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 2exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 3or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 4circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 5delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 6attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 7the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 8hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 9release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 10    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 11date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 12implement a special program of family preservation services to 13support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 14experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 15stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 16pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 17that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 18safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 19family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 20and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 21the child or family to services available from other agencies 22in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 23home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 24future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 25of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 26develop and implement a public information campaign to alert   HB0871 Engrossed- 14 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1health and social service providers and the general public 2about these special family preservation services. The nature 3and scope of the services offered and the number of families 4served under the special program implemented under this 5paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 6Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 7"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 8a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 9Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 10edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 11Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.12    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 13interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 14most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 15possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 16the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 17concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 18earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 19include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of 20the family when the child can be cared for at home without 21endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 22the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 23is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 24permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.25    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 26respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in   HB0871 Engrossed- 15 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 2shall be the paramount concern.3    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 4shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 5prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 6child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 7reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 8occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 9Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 10where the Department believes that further reunification 11services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 12the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 13The Department is not required to provide further 14reunification services after such a finding.15    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 16made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 17best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 18also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 19placement made is the best available placement to provide 20permanency for the child.21    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 22planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 23shall consider the following factors when determining 24appropriateness of concurrent planning:25        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;26        (2) the past history of the family;  HB0871 Engrossed- 16 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 2    the family;3        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;4        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 5    family to reunite;6        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 7    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;8        (7) the age of the child;9        (8) placement of siblings.10    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 11child if:12        (1) it has received a written consent to such 13    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 14    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 15    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 16    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 17    or18        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 19    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 20    located.21If the child is found in the child's residence without a 22parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 23Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 24temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 25Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 26guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a   HB0871 Engrossed- 17 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 2and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 3relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 4child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 5a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 6such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 7resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 8home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 9follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 105-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.11    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 12and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 13pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 14Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 15custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 16Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 17acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 18limited custody, the Department, during the period of 19temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 20judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 215-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 22authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 23of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 24the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.25    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 26custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical   HB0871 Engrossed- 18 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1examination.2    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 3temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 4the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 5Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 6the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 7The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 810 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 9the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 10Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 11Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 12the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 13the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 14custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 15later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 16the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 17temporary custody of the child shall terminate.18    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 19age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 20that cares for children who are in need of secure living 21arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 22determination is made by the facility director and the 23Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 24facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 25of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 26subject to placement in a correctional facility operated   HB0871 Engrossed- 19 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 2unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 3of the Department before being subject to placement in a 4correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 5has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.6    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 7age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 8the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 9preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 10child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 11placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 12clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 13in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 14Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 15those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 16guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 17Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 18facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 19of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 20maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 21dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 22However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 23where children require specialized care and treatment for 24problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 25social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 26facilities for the placement of such children are not   HB0871 Engrossed- 20 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 2this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 3be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 4garnishment or otherwise.5    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 6welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 7sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 8minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 9subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 101987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 11provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 12yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 13responsibility for the development and delivery of services 14under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 15under this Section through the Department of Children and 16Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 17Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 18shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 19an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 20the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 21homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 22youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 23Department shall continue child welfare services under this 24Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 25of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 26self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan.   HB0871 Engrossed- 21 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 2clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 3child welfare services under this Section and how such 4services may be obtained.

With 10respect to children who are in substitute care pursuant to the 11Juvenile Court Act of 1987, family preservation services shall 12not be offered if a goal other than those of subdivisions (A), 13(B), or (B-1) of subsection (2.3) of Section 2-28 of that Act 14has been set, except that reunification services may be 15offered as provided in paragraph (F) of subsection (2.3) of 16Section 2-28 of that Act. Nothing in this paragraph shall be 17construed to create a private right of action or claim on the 18part of any individual or child welfare agency, except that 19when a child is the subject of an action under Article II of 20the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 and the child's service plan 21calls for services to facilitate achievement of the permanency 22goal, the court hearing the action under Article II of the 23Juvenile Court Act of 1987 may order the Department to provide 24the services set out in the plan, if those services are not 25provided with reasonable promptness and if those services are 26available.  HB0871 Engrossed- 43 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    The Department shall notify the child and the child's 2family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 3family preservation services as identified in the service 4plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 5services as soon as the report is determined to be 6"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 7family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 8or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 9investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 10Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 11willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 12investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 13child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 14child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 15services available from other agencies in the community, even 16if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 17in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 18subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 19child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 20voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 21child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 22alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 23"differential response program" provided for in subsection 24(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 25Reporting Act.26    The Department may, at its discretion except for those   HB0871 Engrossed- 44 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 2care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 3as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 4requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 5Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 6be committed to the Department by any court without the 7approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 8effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 92017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 10Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 11adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 12or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 13less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 14Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 15for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 16exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 17minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 18to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 192-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 202017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 21Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 22adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 23or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 24less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 25Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 26for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency   HB0871 Engrossed- 45 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 2minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 3to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 42-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 5exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 6or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 7circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 8delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 9attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 10the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 11hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 12release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 13    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 14implement a special program of family preservation services to 15support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 16are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 17stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 18pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 19that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 20safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 21family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 22and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 23the child or family to services available from other agencies 24in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 25home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 26future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance   HB0871 Engrossed- 46 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 2develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 3health and social service providers and the general public 4about these special family preservation services. The nature 5and scope of the services offered and the number of families 6served under the special program implemented under this 7paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 8Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 9"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 10a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 11Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 12edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 13Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.14    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 15interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 16most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 17option for the child, consistent with the child's best 18interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 19Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is 20practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General 21Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family 22Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 23occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 24arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 25outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 26at home without endangering the child's health or safety;   HB0871 Engrossed- 47 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if 2temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 3toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 4status.5    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 6respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 7making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 8shall be the paramount concern.9    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 10shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 11prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 12child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 13reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 14occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 15Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 16where the Department believes that further reunification 17services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 18the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 19The Department is not required to provide further 20reunification services after such a finding.21    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 22made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 23best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 24place the child with a relative, document those diligent 25efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 26secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue   HB0871 Engrossed- 48 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative 2is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 3concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 4Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 5in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 62025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 7diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 8relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 9should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 10delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 11permanent placement for the child.12    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 13planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 14shall consider the following factors when determining 15appropriateness of concurrent planning:16        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;17        (2) the past history of the family;18        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 19    the family;20        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;21        (4.5) the child's wishes; 22        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 23    family to reunite;24        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 25    provide a permanent placement;26        (7) the age of the child;  HB0871 Engrossed- 49 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1        (8) placement of siblings; and2        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 3    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 4    the child. 5    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 6child if:7        (1) it has received a written consent to such 8    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 9    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 10    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 11    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 12    or13        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 14    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 15    located.16If the child is found in the child's residence without a 17parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 18Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 19temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 20Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 21guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 22willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 23and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 24relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 25child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 26a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses   HB0871 Engrossed- 50 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 2resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 3home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 4follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 55-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.6    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 7and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 8pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 9Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 10custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 11Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 12acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 13limited custody, the Department, during the period of 14temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 15judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 165-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 17authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 18of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 19the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.20    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 21custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 22examination.23    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 24temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 25the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 26Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that   HB0871 Engrossed- 51 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 2The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 310 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 4the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 5Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 6Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 7the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 8the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 9custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 10later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 11the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 12temporary custody of the child shall terminate.13    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 14age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 15that cares for children who are in need of secure living 16arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 17determination is made by the facility director and the 18Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 19facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 20of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 21subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 22pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 23unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 24of the Department before being subject to placement in a 25correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 26has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.  HB0871 Engrossed- 52 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 2age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 3the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 4preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 5child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 6placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 7clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 8in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 9Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 10those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 11guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 12Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 13facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 14of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 15maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 16dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 17However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 18where children require specialized care and treatment for 19problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 20social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 21facilities for the placement of such children are not 22available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 23this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 24be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 25garnishment or otherwise.26    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child   HB0871 Engrossed- 53 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 2sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 3minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 4subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 51987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 6provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 7yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 8responsibility for the development and delivery of services 9under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 10under this Section through the Department of Children and 11Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 12Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 13shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 14an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 15the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 16homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 17youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 18Department shall continue child welfare services under this 19Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 20of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 21self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 22The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 23clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 24child welfare services under this Section and how such 25services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 26Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall   HB0871 Engrossed- 54 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 2adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 3minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 4independent adults. 5    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 6review and appeal process for children and families who 7request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 8Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 9agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 10shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 11children and families in the case of placement by the 12Department, including the right to an initial review of a 13private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 14ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 15youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 16and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 17Department shall accept for administrative review and an 18appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 19with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following 20an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a 21prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of 22subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 23concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 24conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 25current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 262-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a   HB0871 Engrossed- 55 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1judicial determination on the merits of an administrative 2appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 3placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 4shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 5review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 6placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 7identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 8criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 9interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 10of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 11multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 12rules regarding placement changes shall be followed. The rules 13shall outline the essential elements of each form used in the 14implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this 15amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 16    (p) (Blank).17    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 18for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 19money or other property which is received on behalf of such 20children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 21or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 22the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 235.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 24under Section 5.46.25    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 26interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial   HB0871 Engrossed- 56 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 2responsible and who have been determined eligible for 3Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 4allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 5parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 6Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 7miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 8be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 9with this subsection.10    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 11Department shall:12        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 13    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 14    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 15    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 16    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 17    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 18    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 19    account for any purpose.20        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 21    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 22    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 23    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 24    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 25    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 26    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the   HB0871 Engrossed- 57 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 2    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.3        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 4    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 5    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 6    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 7    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.8    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 9encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 10the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 11who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 12hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 13of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 14of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 15Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 16confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 17of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 18adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 19such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 20agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 21Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 22confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 23of the child.24    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 25establish and implement a program to reimburse caregivers 26licensed, certified, or otherwise approved by the Department   HB0871 Engrossed- 58 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1of Children and Family Services for damages sustained by the 2caregivers as a result of the malicious or negligent acts of 3children placed by the Department, as well as providing third 4party coverage for such caregivers with regard to actions of 5children placed by the Department to other individuals. Such 6coverage will be secondary to the caregiver's liability 7insurance policy, if applicable. The program shall be funded 8through appropriations from the General Revenue Fund, 9specifically designated for such purposes.10    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 11investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 12as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 13Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:14        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 15    directs the Department to perform such services; and16        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 17    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 18    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 19    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 20    party is financially able to pay.21    The Department shall provide written notification to the 22court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 23and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 24The Department shall send to the court information related to 25the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 26determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The   HB0871 Engrossed- 59 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.2    (u) In addition to other information that must be 3provided, whenever the Department places a child with a 4prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster 5home, group home, or child care institution, in a relative 6home, or in a certified relative caregiver home, the 7Department shall provide to the caregiver, appropriate 8facility staff, or prospective adoptive parent or parents:9        (1) available detailed information concerning the 10    child's educational and health history, copies of 11    immunization records (including insurance and medical card 12    information), a history of the child's previous 13    placements, if any, and reasons for placement changes 14    excluding any information that identifies or reveals the 15    location of any previous caregiver or adoptive parents;16        (2) a copy of the child's portion of the client 17    service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and 18    all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; 19    and20        (3) information containing details of the child's 21    individualized educational plan when the child is 22    receiving special education services.23    The caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective 24adoptive parent or parents, shall be informed of any known 25social or behavioral information (including, but not limited 26to, criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual   HB0871 Engrossed- 60 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to 2care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently 3in the home or setting. The Department may prepare a written 4summary of the information required by this paragraph, which 5may be provided to the caregiver, appropriate facility staff, 6or prospective adoptive parent in advance of a placement. The 7caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive 8parent may review the supporting documents in the child's file 9in the presence of casework staff. In the case of an emergency 10placement, casework staff shall at least provide known 11information verbally, if necessary, and must subsequently 12provide the information in writing as required by this 13subsection. 14    The information described in this subsection shall be 15provided in writing. In the case of emergency placements when 16time does not allow prior review, preparation, and collection 17of written information, the Department shall provide such 18information as it becomes available. Within 10 business days 19after placement, the Department shall obtain from the 20caregiver, appropriate facility staff, or prospective adoptive 21parent or parents a signed verification of receipt of the 22information provided.

With respect to children who 8are in substitute care pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of 91987, family preservation services shall not be offered if a 10goal other than those of subdivisions (A), (B), or (B-1) of 11subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act has been set, except 12that reunification services may be offered as provided in 13paragraph (F) of subsection (2) of Section 2-28 of that Act. 14Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create a 15private right of action or claim on the part of any individual 16or child welfare agency, except that when a child is the 17subject of an action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act 18of 1987 and the child's service plan calls for services to 19facilitate achievement of the permanency goal, the court 20hearing the action under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act 21of 1987 may order the Department to provide the services set 22out in the plan, if those services are not provided with 23reasonable promptness and if those services are available.24    The Department shall notify the child and the child's 25family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 26family preservation services as identified in the service   HB0871 Engrossed- 11 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 2services as soon as the report is determined to be 3"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 4family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 5or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 6investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 7Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 8willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 9investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 10child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 11child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 12services available from other agencies in the community, even 13if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 14in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 15subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 16child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 17voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 18child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 19alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 20"differential response program" provided for in subsection 21(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 22Reporting Act.23    The Department may, at its discretion except for those 24children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 25care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 26as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor   HB0871 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 2Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 3be committed to the Department by any court without the 4approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 5effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 62017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 7Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 8adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 9or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 10less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 11Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 12for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 13exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 14minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 15to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 162-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 172017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 18Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 19adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 20or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 21less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 22Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 23for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 24exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 25minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 26to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section   HB0871 Engrossed- 13 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b12-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 2exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 3or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 4circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 5delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 6attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 7the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 8hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 9release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 10    As soon as is possible after August 7, 2009 (the effective 11date of Public Act 96-134), the Department shall develop and 12implement a special program of family preservation services to 13support intact, foster, and adoptive families who are 14experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 15stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 16pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 17that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 18safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 19family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 20and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 21the child or family to services available from other agencies 22in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 23home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 24future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance 25of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 26develop and implement a public information campaign to alert   HB0871 Engrossed- 14 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1health and social service providers and the general public 2about these special family preservation services. The nature 3and scope of the services offered and the number of families 4served under the special program implemented under this 5paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 6Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 7"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 8a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 9Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 10edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 11Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.12    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 13interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 14most permanent living arrangement as soon as is practically 15possible. To achieve this goal, the General Assembly directs 16the Department of Children and Family Services to conduct 17concurrent planning so that permanency may occur at the 18earliest opportunity. Permanent living arrangements may 19include prevention of placement of a child outside the home of 20the family when the child can be cared for at home without 21endangering the child's health or safety; reunification with 22the family, when safe and appropriate, if temporary placement 23is necessary; or movement of the child toward the most 24permanent living arrangement and permanent legal status.25    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 26respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in   HB0871 Engrossed- 15 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 2shall be the paramount concern.3    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 4shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 5prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 6child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 7reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 8occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 9Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 10where the Department believes that further reunification 11services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 12the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 13The Department is not required to provide further 14reunification services after such a finding.15    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 16made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 17best interests. At the time of placement, consideration should 18also be given so that if reunification fails or is delayed, the 19placement made is the best available placement to provide 20permanency for the child.21    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 22planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 23shall consider the following factors when determining 24appropriateness of concurrent planning:25        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;26        (2) the past history of the family;  HB0871 Engrossed- 16 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 2    the family;3        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;4        (5) the foster parents' willingness to work with the 5    family to reunite;6        (6) the willingness and ability of the foster family 7    to provide an adoptive home or long-term placement;8        (7) the age of the child;9        (8) placement of siblings.10    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 11child if:12        (1) it has received a written consent to such 13    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 14    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 15    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 16    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 17    or18        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 19    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 20    located.21If the child is found in the child's residence without a 22parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 23Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 24temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 25Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 26guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a   HB0871 Engrossed- 17 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 2and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 3relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 4child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 5a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses 6such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 7resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 8home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 9follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 105-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.11    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 12and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 13pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 14Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 15custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 16Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 17acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 18limited custody, the Department, during the period of 19temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 20judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 215-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 22authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 23of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 24the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.25    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 26custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical   HB0871 Engrossed- 18 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1examination.2    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 3temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 4the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 5Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that 6the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 7The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 810 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 9the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 10Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 11Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 12the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 13the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 14custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 15later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 16the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 17temporary custody of the child shall terminate.18    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 19age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 20that cares for children who are in need of secure living 21arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 22determination is made by the facility director and the 23Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 24facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 25of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 26subject to placement in a correctional facility operated   HB0871 Engrossed- 19 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 2unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 3of the Department before being subject to placement in a 4correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 5has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.6    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 7age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 8the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 9preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 10child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 11placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 12clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 13in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 14Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 15those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 16guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 17Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 18facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 19of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 20maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 21dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 22However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 23where children require specialized care and treatment for 24problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 25social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 26facilities for the placement of such children are not   HB0871 Engrossed- 20 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 2this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 3be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 4garnishment or otherwise.5    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child 6welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 7sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 8minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 9subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 101987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 11provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 12yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 13responsibility for the development and delivery of services 14under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 15under this Section through the Department of Children and 16Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 17Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 18shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 19an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 20the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 21homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 22youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 23Department shall continue child welfare services under this 24Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 25of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 26self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan.   HB0871 Engrossed- 21 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 2clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 3child welfare services under this Section and how such 4services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 5Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall 6disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 7adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 8minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 9independent adults. 10    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 11review and appeal process for children and families who 12request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 13Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 14agencies, and foster families with whom those youth are 15placed, shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal 16rights as children and families in the case of placement by the 17Department, including the right to an initial review of a 18private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 19ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 20youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 21and foster families. The Department shall accept for 22administrative review and an appeal hearing a complaint made 23by (i) a child or foster family concerning a decision 24following an initial review by a private child welfare agency 25or (ii) a prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation 26of subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision   HB0871 Engrossed- 22 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 2conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 3current foster home placement is necessary and appropriate 4under Section 2-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not 5constitute a judicial determination on the merits of an 6administrative appeal, filed by a former foster parent, 7involving a change of placement decision.8    (p) (Blank).9    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 10for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 11money or other property which is received on behalf of such 12children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 13or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 14the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 155.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 16under Section 5.46.17    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 18interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial 19institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 20responsible and who have been determined eligible for 21Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 22allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 23parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 24Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 25miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 26be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance   HB0871 Engrossed- 23 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1with this subsection.2    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 3Department shall:4        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 5    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 6    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 7    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 8    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 9    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 10    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 11    account for any purpose.12        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 13    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 14    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 15    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 16    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 17    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 18    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the 19    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 20    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.21        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 22    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 23    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 24    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 25    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.26    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations   HB0871 Engrossed- 24 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 2the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 3who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 4hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 5of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 6of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 7Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 8confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 9of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 10adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 11such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 12agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 13Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 14confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 15of the child.16    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 17establish and implement a program to reimburse Department and 18private child welfare agency foster parents licensed by the 19Department of Children and Family Services for damages 20sustained by the foster parents as a result of the malicious or 21negligent acts of foster children, as well as providing third 22party coverage for such foster parents with regard to actions 23of foster children to other individuals. Such coverage will be 24secondary to the foster parent liability insurance policy, if 25applicable. The program shall be funded through appropriations 26from the General Revenue Fund, specifically designated for   HB0871 Engrossed- 25 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1such purposes.2    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 3investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 4as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 5Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:6        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 7    directs the Department to perform such services; and8        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 9    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 10    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 11    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 12    party is financially able to pay.13    The Department shall provide written notification to the 14court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 15and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 16The Department shall send to the court information related to 17the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 18determined the parties are financially unable to pay. The 19court may order additional periodic reports as appropriate.20    (u) In addition to other information that must be 21provided, whenever the Department places a child with a 22prospective adoptive parent or parents, in a licensed foster 23home, group home, or child care institution, or in a relative 24home, the Department shall provide to the prospective adoptive 25parent or parents or other caretaker:26        (1) available detailed information concerning the   HB0871 Engrossed- 26 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    child's educational and health history, copies of 2    immunization records (including insurance and medical card 3    information), a history of the child's previous 4    placements, if any, and reasons for placement changes 5    excluding any information that identifies or reveals the 6    location of any previous caretaker;7        (2) a copy of the child's portion of the client 8    service plan, including any visitation arrangement, and 9    all amendments or revisions to it as related to the child; 10    and11        (3) information containing details of the child's 12    individualized educational plan when the child is 13    receiving special education services.14    The caretaker shall be informed of any known social or 15behavioral information (including, but not limited to, 16criminal background, fire setting, perpetuation of sexual 17abuse, destructive behavior, and substance abuse) necessary to 18care for and safeguard the children to be placed or currently 19in the home. The Department may prepare a written summary of 20the information required by this paragraph, which may be 21provided to the foster or prospective adoptive parent in 22advance of a placement. The foster or prospective adoptive 23parent may review the supporting documents in the child's file 24in the presence of casework staff. In the case of an emergency 25placement, casework staff shall at least provide known 26information verbally, if necessary, and must subsequently   HB0871 Engrossed- 27 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1provide the information in writing as required by this 2subsection. 3    The information described in this subsection shall be 4provided in writing. In the case of emergency placements when 5time does not allow prior review, preparation, and collection 6of written information, the Department shall provide such 7information as it becomes available. Within 10 business days 8after placement, the Department shall obtain from the 9prospective adoptive parent or parents or other caretaker a 10signed verification of receipt of the information provided. 11Within 10 business days after placement, the Department shall 12provide to the child's guardian ad litem a copy of the 13information provided to the prospective adoptive parent or 14parents or other caretaker. The information provided to the 15prospective adoptive parent or parents or other caretaker 16shall be reviewed and approved regarding accuracy at the 17supervisory level. 18    (u-5) Effective July 1, 1995, only foster care placements 19licensed as foster family homes pursuant to the Child Care Act 20of 1969 shall be eligible to receive foster care payments from 21the Department. Relative caregivers who, as of July 1, 1995, 22were approved pursuant to approved relative placement rules 23previously promulgated by the Department at 89 Ill. Adm. Code 24335 and had submitted an application for licensure as a foster 25family home may continue to receive foster care payments only 26until the Department determines that they may be licensed as a   HB0871 Engrossed- 28 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1foster family home or that their application for licensure is 2denied or until September 30, 1995, whichever occurs first.3    (v) The Department shall access criminal history record 4information as defined in the Illinois Uniform Conviction 5Information Act and information maintained in the adjudicatory 6and dispositional record system as defined in Section 2605-355 7of the Illinois State Police Law if the Department determines 8the information is necessary to perform its duties under the 9Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, the Child Care Act 10of 1969, and the Children and Family Services Act. The 11Department shall provide for interactive computerized 12communication and processing equipment that permits direct 13on-line communication with the Illinois State Police's central 14criminal history data repository. The Department shall comply 15with all certification requirements and provide certified 16operators who have been trained by personnel from the Illinois 17State Police. In addition, one Office of the Inspector General 18investigator shall have training in the use of the criminal 19history information access system and have access to the 20terminal. The Department of Children and Family Services and 21its employees shall abide by rules and regulations established 22by the Illinois State Police relating to the access and 23dissemination of this information.24    (v-1) Prior to final approval for placement of a child, 25the Department shall conduct a criminal records background 26check of the prospective foster or adoptive parent, including   HB0871 Engrossed- 29 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1fingerprint-based checks of national crime information 2databases.

The Department may continue to provide financial 19assistance and education assistance grants for a child who was 20determined eligible for financial assistance under this 21subsection (j) in the interim period beginning when the 22child's adoptive parents died and ending with the finalization 23of the new adoption of the child by another adoptive parent or 24parents. The Department may also provide categories of 25financial assistance and education assistance grants, and 26shall establish rules and regulations for the assistance and   HB0871 Engrossed- 41 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1grants, to persons appointed guardian of the person under 2Section 5-7 of the Juvenile Court Act or Section 2-27, 3-28, 34-25, or 5-740 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 for children 4who were youth in care for 12 months immediately prior to the 5appointment of the guardian.6    The amount of assistance may vary, depending upon the 7needs of the child and the adoptive parents or subsidized 8guardians, as set forth in the annual assistance agreement. 9Special purpose grants are allowed where the child requires 10special service but such costs may not exceed the amounts 11which similar services would cost the Department if it were to 12provide or secure them as guardian of the child.13    Any financial assistance provided under this subsection is 14inalienable by assignment, sale, execution, attachment, 15garnishment, or any other remedy for recovery or collection of 16a judgment or debt.17    (j-5) The Department shall not deny or delay the placement 18of a child for adoption if an approved family is available 19either outside of the Department region handling the case, or 20outside of the State of Illinois.21    (k) The Department shall accept for care and training any 22child who has been adjudicated neglected or abused, or 23dependent committed to it pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act 24or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.25    (l) The Department shall offer family preservation 26services, as defined in Section 8.2 of the Abused and   HB0871 Engrossed- 42 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1Neglected Child Reporting Act, to help families, including 2adoptive and extended families.

Nothing in this paragraph shall be 17construed to create a private right of action or claim on the 18part of any individual or child welfare agency, except that 19when a child is the subject of an action under Article II of 20the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 and the child's service plan 21calls for services to facilitate achievement of the permanency 22goal, the court hearing the action under Article II of the 23Juvenile Court Act of 1987 may order the Department to provide 24the services set out in the plan, if those services are not 25provided with reasonable promptness and if those services are 26available.  HB0871 Engrossed- 43 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    The Department shall notify the child and the child's 2family of the Department's responsibility to offer and provide 3family preservation services as identified in the service 4plan. The child and the child's family shall be eligible for 5services as soon as the report is determined to be 6"indicated". The Department may offer services to any child or 7family with respect to whom a report of suspected child abuse 8or neglect has been filed, prior to concluding its 9investigation under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected 10Child Reporting Act. However, the child's or family's 11willingness to accept services shall not be considered in the 12investigation. The Department may also provide services to any 13child or family who is the subject of any report of suspected 14child abuse or neglect or may refer such child or family to 15services available from other agencies in the community, even 16if the report is determined to be unfounded, if the conditions 17in the child's or family's home are reasonably likely to 18subject the child or family to future reports of suspected 19child abuse or neglect. Acceptance of such services shall be 20voluntary. The Department may also provide services to any 21child or family after completion of a family assessment, as an 22alternative to an investigation, as provided under the 23"differential response program" provided for in subsection 24(a-5) of Section 7.4 of the Abused and Neglected Child 25Reporting Act.26    The Department may, at its discretion except for those   HB0871 Engrossed- 44 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1children also adjudicated neglected or dependent, accept for 2care and training any child who has been adjudicated addicted, 3as a truant minor in need of supervision or as a minor 4requiring authoritative intervention, under the Juvenile Court 5Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, but no such child shall 6be committed to the Department by any court without the 7approval of the Department. On and after January 1, 2015 (the 8effective date of Public Act 98-803) and before January 1, 92017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 10Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 11adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 12or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 13less than 16 years of age committed to the Department under 14Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 15for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency 16exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 17minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 18to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 192-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. On and after January 1, 202017, a minor charged with a criminal offense under the 21Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 or 22adjudicated delinquent shall not be placed in the custody of 23or committed to the Department by any court, except (i) a minor 24less than 15 years of age committed to the Department under 25Section 5-710 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, (ii) a minor 26for whom an independent basis of abuse, neglect, or dependency   HB0871 Engrossed- 45 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1exists, which must be defined by departmental rule, or (iii) a 2minor for whom the court has granted a supplemental petition 3to reinstate wardship pursuant to subsection (2) of Section 42-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. An independent basis 5exists when the allegations or adjudication of abuse, neglect, 6or dependency do not arise from the same facts, incident, or 7circumstances which give rise to a charge or adjudication of 8delinquency. The Department shall assign a caseworker to 9attend any hearing involving a youth in the care and custody of 10the Department who is placed on aftercare release, including 11hearings involving sanctions for violation of aftercare 12release conditions and aftercare release revocation hearings. 13    As soon as is possible, the Department shall develop and 14implement a special program of family preservation services to 15support intact, relative, foster, and adoptive families who 16are experiencing extreme hardships due to the difficulty and 17stress of caring for a child who has been diagnosed with a 18pervasive developmental disorder if the Department determines 19that those services are necessary to ensure the health and 20safety of the child. The Department may offer services to any 21family whether or not a report has been filed under the Abused 22and Neglected Child Reporting Act. The Department may refer 23the child or family to services available from other agencies 24in the community if the conditions in the child's or family's 25home are reasonably likely to subject the child or family to 26future reports of suspected child abuse or neglect. Acceptance   HB0871 Engrossed- 46 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1of these services shall be voluntary. The Department shall 2develop and implement a public information campaign to alert 3health and social service providers and the general public 4about these special family preservation services. The nature 5and scope of the services offered and the number of families 6served under the special program implemented under this 7paragraph shall be determined by the level of funding that the 8Department annually allocates for this purpose. The term 9"pervasive developmental disorder" under this paragraph means 10a neurological condition, including, but not limited to, 11Asperger's Syndrome and autism, as defined in the most recent 12edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 13Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association.14    (l-1) The General Assembly recognizes that the best 15interests of the child require that the child be placed in the 16most permanent living arrangement that is an appropriate 17option for the child, consistent with the child's best 18interest, using the factors set forth in subsection (4.05) of 19Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as soon as is 20practically possible. To achieve this goal, the General 21Assembly directs the Department of Children and Family 22Services to conduct concurrent planning so that permanency may 23occur at the earliest opportunity. Permanent living 24arrangements may include prevention of placement of a child 25outside the home of the family when the child can be cared for 26at home without endangering the child's health or safety;   HB0871 Engrossed- 47 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1reunification with the family, when safe and appropriate, if 2temporary placement is necessary; or movement of the child 3toward the most appropriate living arrangement and legal 4status.5    When determining reasonable efforts to be made with 6respect to a child, as described in this subsection, and in 7making such reasonable efforts, the child's health and safety 8shall be the paramount concern.9    When a child is placed in foster care, the Department 10shall ensure and document that reasonable efforts were made to 11prevent or eliminate the need to remove the child from the 12child's home. The Department must make reasonable efforts to 13reunify the family when temporary placement of the child 14occurs unless otherwise required, pursuant to the Juvenile 15Court Act of 1987. At any time after the dispositional hearing 16where the Department believes that further reunification 17services would be ineffective, it may request a finding from 18the court that reasonable efforts are no longer appropriate. 19The Department is not required to provide further 20reunification services after such a finding.21    A decision to place a child in substitute care shall be 22made with considerations of the child's health, safety, and 23best interests. The Department shall make diligent efforts to 24place the child with a relative, document those diligent 25efforts, and document reasons for any failure or inability to 26secure such a relative placement. If the primary issue   HB0871 Engrossed- 48 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1preventing an emergency placement of a child with a relative 2is a lack of resources, including, but not limited to, 3concrete goods, safety modifications, and services, the 4Department shall make diligent efforts to assist the relative 5in obtaining the necessary resources. No later than July 1, 62025, the Department shall adopt rules defining what is 7diligent and necessary in providing supports to potential 8relative placements. At the time of placement, consideration 9should also be given so that if reunification fails or is 10delayed, the placement has the potential to be an appropriate 11permanent placement for the child.12    The Department shall adopt rules addressing concurrent 13planning for reunification and permanency. The Department 14shall consider the following factors when determining 15appropriateness of concurrent planning:16        (1) the likelihood of prompt reunification;17        (2) the past history of the family;18        (3) the barriers to reunification being addressed by 19    the family;20        (4) the level of cooperation of the family;21        (4.5) the child's wishes; 22        (5) the caregivers' willingness to work with the 23    family to reunite;24        (6) the willingness and ability of the caregivers' to 25    provide a permanent placement;26        (7) the age of the child;  HB0871 Engrossed- 49 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1        (8) placement of siblings; and2        (9) the wishes of the parent or parents unless the 3    parental preferences are contrary to the best interests of 4    the child. 5    (m) The Department may assume temporary custody of any 6child if:7        (1) it has received a written consent to such 8    temporary custody signed by the parents of the child or by 9    the parent having custody of the child if the parents are 10    not living together or by the guardian or custodian of the 11    child if the child is not in the custody of either parent, 12    or13        (2) the child is found in the State and neither a 14    parent, guardian nor custodian of the child can be 15    located.16If the child is found in the child's residence without a 17parent, guardian, custodian, or responsible caretaker, the 18Department may, instead of removing the child and assuming 19temporary custody, place an authorized representative of the 20Department in that residence until such time as a parent, 21guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses a 22willingness and apparent ability to ensure the child's health 23and safety and resume permanent charge of the child, or until a 24relative enters the home and is willing and able to ensure the 25child's health and safety and assume charge of the child until 26a parent, guardian, or custodian enters the home and expresses   HB0871 Engrossed- 50 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1such willingness and ability to ensure the child's safety and 2resume permanent charge. After a caretaker has remained in the 3home for a period not to exceed 12 hours, the Department must 4follow those procedures outlined in Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 55-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.6    The Department shall have the authority, responsibilities 7and duties that a legal custodian of the child would have 8pursuant to subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of the Juvenile 9Court Act of 1987. Whenever a child is taken into temporary 10custody pursuant to an investigation under the Abused and 11Neglected Child Reporting Act, or pursuant to a referral and 12acceptance under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 of a minor in 13limited custody, the Department, during the period of 14temporary custody and before the child is brought before a 15judicial officer as required by Section 2-9, 3-11, 4-8, or 165-415 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, shall have the 17authority, responsibilities and duties that a legal custodian 18of the child would have under subsection (9) of Section 1-3 of 19the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.20    The Department shall ensure that any child taken into 21custody is scheduled for an appointment for a medical 22examination.23    A parent, guardian, or custodian of a child in the 24temporary custody of the Department who would have custody of 25the child if the child were not in the temporary custody of the 26Department may deliver to the Department a signed request that   HB0871 Engrossed- 51 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1the Department surrender the temporary custody of the child. 2The Department may retain temporary custody of the child for 310 days after the receipt of the request, during which period 4the Department may cause to be filed a petition pursuant to the 5Juvenile Court Act of 1987. If a petition is so filed, the 6Department shall retain temporary custody of the child until 7the court orders otherwise. If a petition is not filed within 8the 10-day period, the child shall be surrendered to the 9custody of the requesting parent, guardian, or custodian not 10later than the expiration of the 10-day period, at which time 11the authority and duties of the Department with respect to the 12temporary custody of the child shall terminate.13    (m-1) The Department may place children under 18 years of 14age in a secure child care facility licensed by the Department 15that cares for children who are in need of secure living 16arrangements for their health, safety, and well-being after a 17determination is made by the facility director and the 18Director or the Director's designate prior to admission to the 19facility subject to Section 2-27.1 of the Juvenile Court Act 20of 1987. This subsection (m-1) does not apply to a child who is 21subject to placement in a correctional facility operated 22pursuant to Section 3-15-2 of the Unified Code of Corrections, 23unless the child is a youth in care who was placed in the care 24of the Department before being subject to placement in a 25correctional facility and a court of competent jurisdiction 26has ordered placement of the child in a secure care facility.  HB0871 Engrossed- 52 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    (n) The Department may place children under 18 years of 2age in licensed child care facilities when in the opinion of 3the Department, appropriate services aimed at family 4preservation have been unsuccessful and cannot ensure the 5child's health and safety or are unavailable and such 6placement would be for their best interest. Payment for board, 7clothing, care, training and supervision of any child placed 8in a licensed child care facility may be made by the 9Department, by the parents or guardians of the estates of 10those children, or by both the Department and the parents or 11guardians, except that no payments shall be made by the 12Department for any child placed in a licensed child care 13facility for board, clothing, care, training, and supervision 14of such a child that exceed the average per capita cost of 15maintaining and of caring for a child in institutions for 16dependent or neglected children operated by the Department. 17However, such restriction on payments does not apply in cases 18where children require specialized care and treatment for 19problems of severe emotional disturbance, physical disability, 20social adjustment, or any combination thereof and suitable 21facilities for the placement of such children are not 22available at payment rates within the limitations set forth in 23this Section. All reimbursements for services delivered shall 24be absolutely inalienable by assignment, sale, attachment, or 25garnishment or otherwise.26    (n-1) The Department shall provide or authorize child   HB0871 Engrossed- 53 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1welfare services, aimed at assisting minors to achieve 2sustainable self-sufficiency as independent adults, for any 3minor eligible for the reinstatement of wardship pursuant to 4subsection (2) of Section 2-33 of the Juvenile Court Act of 51987, whether or not such reinstatement is sought or allowed, 6provided that the minor consents to such services and has not 7yet attained the age of 21. The Department shall have 8responsibility for the development and delivery of services 9under this Section. An eligible youth may access services 10under this Section through the Department of Children and 11Family Services or by referral from the Department of Human 12Services. Youth participating in services under this Section 13shall cooperate with the assigned case manager in developing 14an agreement identifying the services to be provided and how 15the youth will increase skills to achieve self-sufficiency. A 16homeless shelter is not considered appropriate housing for any 17youth receiving child welfare services under this Section. The 18Department shall continue child welfare services under this 19Section to any eligible minor until the minor becomes 21 years 20of age, no longer consents to participate, or achieves 21self-sufficiency as identified in the minor's service plan. 22The Department of Children and Family Services shall create 23clear, readable notice of the rights of former foster youth to 24child welfare services under this Section and how such 25services may be obtained. The Department of Children and 26Family Services and the Department of Human Services shall   HB0871 Engrossed- 54 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1disseminate this information statewide. The Department shall 2adopt regulations describing services intended to assist 3minors in achieving sustainable self-sufficiency as 4independent adults. 5    (o) The Department shall establish an administrative 6review and appeal process for children and families who 7request or receive child welfare services from the Department. 8Youth in care who are placed by private child welfare 9agencies, and caregivers with whom those youth are placed, 10shall be afforded the same procedural and appeal rights as 11children and families in the case of placement by the 12Department, including the right to an initial review of a 13private agency decision by that agency. The Department shall 14ensure that any private child welfare agency, which accepts 15youth in care for placement, affords those rights to children 16and caregivers with whom those children are placed. The 17Department shall accept for administrative review and an 18appeal hearing a complaint made by (i) a child or caregiver 19with whom the child is placed concerning a decision following 20an initial review by a private child welfare agency or (ii) a 21prospective adoptive parent who alleges a violation of 22subsection (j-5) of this Section. An appeal of a decision 23concerning a change in the placement of a child shall be 24conducted in an expedited manner. A court determination that a 25current placement is necessary and appropriate under Section 262-28 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 does not constitute a   HB0871 Engrossed- 55 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1judicial determination on the merits of an administrative 2appeal, filed by a former caregiver, involving a change of 3placement decision. No later than July 1, 2025, the Department 4shall adopt rules to develop a reconsideration process to 5review: a denial of certification of a relative, a denial of 6placement with a relative, and a denial of visitation with an 7identified relative. Rules shall include standards and 8criteria for reconsideration that incorporate the best 9interests of the child under subsection (4.05) of Section 1-3 10of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, address situations where 11multiple relatives seek certification, and provide that all 12rules regarding placement changes shall be followed. The rules 13shall outline the essential elements of each form used in the 14implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this 15amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 16    (p) (Blank).17    (q) The Department may receive and use, in their entirety, 18for the benefit of children any gift, donation, or bequest of 19money or other property which is received on behalf of such 20children, or any financial benefits to which such children are 21or may become entitled while under the jurisdiction or care of 22the Department, except that the benefits described in Section 235.46 must be used and conserved consistent with the provisions 24under Section 5.46.25    The Department shall set up and administer no-cost, 26interest-bearing accounts in appropriate financial   HB0871 Engrossed- 56 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1institutions for children for whom the Department is legally 2responsible and who have been determined eligible for 3Veterans' Benefits, Social Security benefits, assistance 4allotments from the armed forces, court ordered payments, 5parental voluntary payments, Supplemental Security Income, 6Railroad Retirement payments, Black Lung benefits, or other 7miscellaneous payments. Interest earned by each account shall 8be credited to the account, unless disbursed in accordance 9with this subsection.10    In disbursing funds from children's accounts, the 11Department shall:12        (1) Establish standards in accordance with State and 13    federal laws for disbursing money from children's 14    accounts. In all circumstances, the Department's 15    Guardianship Administrator or the Guardianship 16    Administrator's designee must approve disbursements from 17    children's accounts. The Department shall be responsible 18    for keeping complete records of all disbursements for each 19    account for any purpose.20        (2) Calculate on a monthly basis the amounts paid from 21    State funds for the child's board and care, medical care 22    not covered under Medicaid, and social services; and 23    utilize funds from the child's account, as covered by 24    regulation, to reimburse those costs. Monthly, 25    disbursements from all children's accounts, up to 1/12 of 26    $13,000,000, shall be deposited by the Department into the   HB0871 Engrossed- 57 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1    General Revenue Fund and the balance over 1/12 of 2    $13,000,000 into the DCFS Children's Services Fund.3        (3) Maintain any balance remaining after reimbursing 4    for the child's costs of care, as specified in item (2). 5    The balance shall accumulate in accordance with relevant 6    State and federal laws and shall be disbursed to the child 7    or the child's guardian or to the issuing agency.8    (r) The Department shall promulgate regulations 9encouraging all adoption agencies to voluntarily forward to 10the Department or its agent names and addresses of all persons 11who have applied for and have been approved for adoption of a 12hard-to-place child or child with a disability and the names 13of such children who have not been placed for adoption. A list 14of such names and addresses shall be maintained by the 15Department or its agent, and coded lists which maintain the 16confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 17of the child shall be made available, without charge, to every 18adoption agency in the State to assist the agencies in placing 19such children for adoption. The Department may delegate to an 20agent its duty to maintain and make available such lists. The 21Department shall ensure that such agent maintains the 22confidentiality of the person seeking to adopt the child and 23of the child.24    (s) The Department of Children and Family Services may 25establish and implement a program to reimburse caregivers 26licensed, certified, or otherwise approved by the Department   HB0871 Engrossed- 58 -LRB104 04769 SPS 14796 b1of Children and Family Services for damages sustained by the 2caregivers as a result of the malicious or negligent acts of 3children placed by the Department, as well as providing third 4party coverage for such caregivers with regard to actions of 5children placed by the Department to other individuals. Such 6coverage will be secondary to the caregiver's liability 7insurance policy, if applicable. The program shall be funded 8through appropriations from the General Revenue Fund, 9specifically designated for such purposes.10    (t) The Department shall perform home studies and 11investigations and shall exercise supervision over visitation 12as ordered by a court pursuant to the Illinois Marriage and 13Dissolution of Marriage Act or the Adoption Act only if:14        (1) an order entered by an Illinois court specifically 15    directs the Department to perform such services; and16        (2) the court has ordered one or both of the parties to 17    the proceeding to reimburse the Department for its 18    reasonable costs for providing such services in accordance 19    with Department rules, or has determined that neither 20    party is financially able to pay.21    The Department shall provide written notification to the 22court of the specific arrangements for supervised visitation 23and projected monthly costs within 60 days of the court order. 24The Department shall send to the court information related to 25the costs incurred except in cases where the court has 26determined the parties are financially unable to pay.
