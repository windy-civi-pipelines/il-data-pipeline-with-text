Reimbursement by State for transportation. Any 8school district or State-authorized charter school, 9maintaining a school, transporting resident pupils to another 10school district's vocational program, offered through a joint 11agreement approved by the State Board of Education, as 12provided in Section 10-22.22 or transporting its resident 13pupils to a school which meets the standards for recognition 14as established by the State Board of Education which provides 15transportation meeting the standards of safety, comfort, 16convenience, efficiency and operation prescribed by the State 17Board of Education for resident pupils attending 18prekindergarten through grade 12 in kindergarten or any of 19grades 1 through 12 who: (a) reside at least 1 1/2 miles as 20measured by the customary route of travel, from the school 21attended; or (b) reside in areas where conditions are such 22that walking constitutes a hazard to the safety of the child 23when determined under Section 29-3; and (c) are transported to 24the school attended from pick-up points at the beginning of 25the school day and back again at the close of the school day or   SB2250- 7 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1transported to and from their assigned attendance centers 2during the school day shall be reimbursed by the State as 3hereinafter provided in this Section. 4    The State will pay the prorated allowable cost of 5transporting eligible pupils less the real equalized assessed 6valuation as computed under paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of 7Section 18-8.15 in a dual school district maintaining 8secondary grades 9 to 12 inclusive times a qualifying rate of 9.05%; in elementary school districts maintaining 10prekindergarten to grade grades K to 8 times a qualifying rate 11of .06%; and in unit districts maintaining prekindergarten 12grades K to grade 12, including partial elementary unit 13districts formed pursuant to Article 11E, times a qualifying 14rate of .07%. For a State-authorized charter school, the State 15shall pay the prorated allowable cost of transporting eligible 16pupils less a real equalized assessed valuation calculated 17pursuant to this Section times a qualifying rate. For purposes 18of calculating the real equalized assessed valuation for a 19State-authorized charter school whose resident district is not 20a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code, the 21State Board of Education shall calculate the average of the 22number of students attending prekindergarten to grade in 23grades kindergarten through 12 reported as enrolled in the 24charter school in the State Board's Student Information System 25on October 1 and March 1 of the immediately preceding school 26year. That value shall be divided by the average of the number   SB2250- 8 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1of students attending prekindergarten in grades kindergarten 2through grade 12 reported as enrolled in the charter school's 3resident district on October 1 and March 1 of the immediately 4preceding school year. That proportion shall be multiplied by 5the real equalized assessed valuation as computed under 6paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of Section 18-8.15 for each 7State-authorized charter school's applicable resident 8district. A State-authorized charter school whose resident 9district is organized under Article 34 of this Code shall have 10a real equalized assessed valuation equal to the real 11equalized assessed valuation of its resident district as 12computed under paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of Section 1318-8.15. A State-authorized charter school's qualifying rate 14shall be the same as the rate that applies to the charter 15school's resident district. 16    To be eligible to receive reimbursement in excess of 4/5 17of the cost to transport eligible pupils, a school district or 18partial elementary unit district formed pursuant to Article 1911E shall have a Transportation Fund tax rate of at least .12%. 20The Transportation Fund tax rate for a partial elementary unit 21district formed pursuant Article 11E shall be the combined 22elementary and high school rates pursuant to paragraph (4) of 23subsection (a) of Section 18-8.15. 24    If a school district or partial elementary unit district 25formed pursuant to Article 11E does not have a .12% 26Transportation Fund tax rate, the amount of its claim in   SB2250- 9 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1excess of 4/5 of the cost of transporting pupils shall be 2reduced by the sum arrived at by subtracting the 3Transportation Fund tax rate from .12% and multiplying that 4amount by the district's real equalized assessed valuation as 5computed under paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of Section 618-8.15, provided that in no case shall said reduction result 7in reimbursement of less than 4/5 of the cost to transport 8eligible pupils. No such adjustment may be applied to a claim 9filed by a State-authorized charter school.10    Subject to the calculation of equalized assessed 11valuation, an adjustment for an insufficient tax rate, and the 12use of a qualifying rate as provided in this Section, a 13State-authorized charter school may make a claim for 14reimbursement by the State that is calculated in the same 15manner as a school district. 16    The minimum amount to be received by a district is $16 17times the number of eligible pupils transported. 18    When calculating the reimbursement for transportation 19costs, the State Board of Education may not deduct the number 20of pupils enrolled in early education programs from the number 21of pupils eligible for reimbursement if the pupils enrolled in 22the early education programs are transported at the same time 23as other eligible pupils. 24    Any such district transporting resident pupils during the 25school day to an area vocational school or another school 26district's vocational program more than 1 1/2 miles from the   SB2250- 10 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1school attended, as provided in Sections 10-22.20a and 210-22.22, shall be reimbursed by the State for 4/5 of the cost 3of transporting eligible pupils. 4    School day means that period of time during which the 5pupil is required to be in attendance for instructional 6purposes. 7    If a pupil is at a location within the school district 8other than his residence for child care purposes at the time 9for transportation to school, that location may be considered 10for purposes of determining the 1 1/2 miles from the school 11attended. 12    Claims for reimbursement that include children who attend 13any school other than a public school shall show the number of 14such children transported. 15    Claims for reimbursement under this Section shall not be 16paid for the transportation of pupils for whom transportation 17costs are claimed for payment under other Sections of this 18Act. 19    The allowable direct cost of transporting pupils for 20regular, vocational, and special education pupil 21transportation shall be limited to the sum of the cost of 22physical examinations required for employment as a school bus 23driver; the salaries of full-time or part-time drivers and 24school bus maintenance personnel; employee benefits excluding 25Illinois municipal retirement payments, social security 26payments, unemployment insurance payments and workers'   SB2250- 11 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1compensation insurance premiums; expenditures to independent 2carriers who operate school buses; payments to other school 3districts for pupil transportation services; pre-approved 4contractual expenditures for computerized bus scheduling; 5expenditures for housing assistance and homeless prevention 6under Sections 1-17 and 1-18 of the Education for Homeless 7Children Act that are not in excess of the school district's 8actual costs for providing transportation services and are not 9otherwise claimed in another State or federal grant that 10permits those costs to a parent, a legal guardian, any other 11person who enrolled a pupil, or a homeless assistance agency 12that is part of the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance 13Act's continuum of care for the area in which the district is 14located; the cost of gasoline, oil, tires, and other supplies 15necessary for the operation of school buses; the cost of 16converting buses' gasoline engines to more fuel efficient 17engines or to engines which use alternative energy sources; 18the cost of travel to meetings and workshops conducted by the 19regional superintendent or the State Superintendent of 20Education pursuant to the standards established by the 21Secretary of State under Section 6-106 of the Illinois Vehicle 22Code to improve the driving skills of school bus drivers; the 23cost of maintenance of school buses including parts and 24materials used; expenditures for leasing transportation 25vehicles, except interest and service charges; the cost of 26insurance and licenses for transportation vehicles;   SB2250- 12 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1expenditures for the rental of transportation equipment; plus 2a depreciation allowance of 20% for 5 years for school buses 3and vehicles approved for transporting pupils to and from 4school and a depreciation allowance of 10% for 10 years for 5other transportation equipment so used. Each school year, if a 6school district has made expenditures to the Regional 7Transportation Authority or any of its service boards, a mass 8transit district, or an urban transportation district under an 9intergovernmental agreement with the district to provide for 10the transportation of pupils and if the public transit carrier 11received direct payment for services or passes from a school 12district within its service area during the 2000-2001 school 13year, then the allowable direct cost of transporting pupils 14for regular, vocational, and special education pupil 15transportation shall also include the expenditures that the 16district has made to the public transit carrier. In addition 17to the above allowable costs, school districts shall also 18claim all transportation supervisory salary costs, including 19Illinois municipal retirement payments, and all transportation 20related building and building maintenance costs without 21limitation. 22    Special education allowable costs shall also include 23expenditures for the salaries of attendants or aides for that 24portion of the time they assist special education pupils while 25in transit and expenditures for parents and public carriers 26for transporting special education pupils when pre-approved by   SB2250- 13 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1the State Superintendent of Education. 2    Indirect costs shall be included in the reimbursement 3claim for districts which own and operate their own school 4buses. Such indirect costs shall include administrative costs, 5or any costs attributable to transporting pupils from their 6attendance centers to another school building for 7instructional purposes. No school district which owns and 8operates its own school buses may claim reimbursement for 9indirect costs which exceed 5% of the total allowable direct 10costs for pupil transportation. 11    The State Board of Education shall prescribe uniform 12regulations for determining the above standards and shall 13prescribe forms of cost accounting and standards of 14determining reasonable depreciation. Such depreciation shall 15include the cost of equipping school buses with the safety 16features required by law or by the rules, regulations and 17standards promulgated by the State Board of Education, and the 18Department of Transportation for the safety and construction 19of school buses provided, however, any equipment cost 20reimbursed by the Department of Transportation for equipping 21school buses with such safety equipment shall be deducted from 22the allowable cost in the computation of reimbursement under 23this Section in the same percentage as the cost of the 24equipment is depreciated. 25    On or before August 15, annually, the chief school 26administrator for the district shall certify to the State   SB2250- 14 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1Superintendent of Education the district's claim for 2reimbursement for the school year ending on June 30 next 3preceding.

Each fiscal 6year, the State Superintendent of Education shall prepare and 7transmit the first 3 vouchers to the Comptroller on the 30th 8day of September, December and March, respectively, and the 9final voucher, no later than June 20. 10    If the amount appropriated for transportation 11reimbursement is insufficient to fund total claims for any 12fiscal year, the State Board of Education shall reduce each 13school district's allowable costs and flat grant amount 14proportionately to make total adjusted claims equal the total 15amount appropriated. 16    For purposes of calculating claims for reimbursement under 17this Section for any school year beginning July 1, 2016, the 18equalized assessed valuation for a school district or partial 19elementary unit district formed pursuant to Article 11E used 20to compute reimbursement shall be the real equalized assessed 21valuation as computed under paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of 22Section 18-8.15. 23    All reimbursements received from the State shall be 24deposited into the district's transportation fund or into the 25fund from which the allowable expenditures were made. 26    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any school   SB2250- 15 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1district receiving a payment under this Section or under 2Section 14-7.02, 14-7.02b, or 14-13.01 of this Code may 3classify all or a portion of the funds that it receives in a 4particular fiscal year or from State aid pursuant to Section 518-8.15 of this Code as funds received in connection with any 6funding program for which it is entitled to receive funds from 7the State in that fiscal year (including, without limitation, 8any funding program referenced in this Section), regardless of 9the source or timing of the receipt. The district may not 10classify more funds as funds received in connection with the 11funding program than the district is entitled to receive in 12that fiscal year for that program. Any classification by a 13district must be made by a resolution of its board of 14education. The resolution must identify the amount of any 15payments or general State aid to be classified under this 16paragraph and must specify the funding program to which the 17funds are to be treated as received in connection therewith. 18This resolution is controlling as to the classification of 19funds referenced therein. A certified copy of the resolution 20must be sent to the State Superintendent of Education. The 21resolution shall still take effect even though a copy of the 22resolution has not been sent to the State Superintendent of 23Education in a timely manner. No classification under this 24paragraph by a district shall affect the total amount or 25timing of money the district is entitled to receive under this 26Code. No classification under this paragraph by a district   SB2250- 16 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1shall in any way relieve the district from or affect any 2requirements that otherwise would apply with respect to that 3funding program, including any accounting of funds by source, 4reporting expenditures by original source and purpose, 5reporting requirements, or requirements of providing services. 6    Any school district with a population of not more than 7500,000 must deposit all funds received under this Article 8into the transportation fund and use those funds for the 9provision of transportation services. 10(Source: P.A. 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 11103-588, eff. 1-1-25.)

Reimbursement by State for transportation. Any 8school district or State-authorized charter school, 9maintaining a school, transporting resident pupils to another 10school district's vocational program, offered through a joint 11agreement approved by the State Board of Education, as 12provided in Section 10-22.22 or transporting its resident 13pupils to a school which meets the standards for recognition 14as established by the State Board of Education which provides 15transportation meeting the standards of safety, comfort, 16convenience, efficiency and operation prescribed by the State 17Board of Education for resident pupils attending 18prekindergarten through grade 12 in kindergarten or any of 19grades 1 through 12 who: (a) reside at least 1 1/2 miles as 20measured by the customary route of travel, from the school 21attended; or (b) reside in areas where conditions are such 22that walking constitutes a hazard to the safety of the child 23when determined under Section 29-3; and (c) are transported to 24the school attended from pick-up points at the beginning of 25the school day and back again at the close of the school day or   SB2250- 7 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1transported to and from their assigned attendance centers 2during the school day shall be reimbursed by the State as 3hereinafter provided in this Section. 4    The State will pay the prorated allowable cost of 5transporting eligible pupils less the real equalized assessed 6valuation as computed under paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of 7Section 18-8.15 in a dual school district maintaining 8secondary grades 9 to 12 inclusive times a qualifying rate of 9.05%; in elementary school districts maintaining 10prekindergarten to grade grades K to 8 times a qualifying rate 11of .06%; and in unit districts maintaining prekindergarten 12grades K to grade 12, including partial elementary unit 13districts formed pursuant to Article 11E, times a qualifying 14rate of .07%. For a State-authorized charter school, the State 15shall pay the prorated allowable cost of transporting eligible 16pupils less a real equalized assessed valuation calculated 17pursuant to this Section times a qualifying rate. For purposes 18of calculating the real equalized assessed valuation for a 19State-authorized charter school whose resident district is not 20a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code, the 21State Board of Education shall calculate the average of the 22number of students attending prekindergarten to grade in 23grades kindergarten through 12 reported as enrolled in the 24charter school in the State Board's Student Information System 25on October 1 and March 1 of the immediately preceding school 26year. That value shall be divided by the average of the number   SB2250- 8 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1of students attending prekindergarten in grades kindergarten 2through grade 12 reported as enrolled in the charter school's 3resident district on October 1 and March 1 of the immediately 4preceding school year. That proportion shall be multiplied by 5the real equalized assessed valuation as computed under 6paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of Section 18-8.15 for each 7State-authorized charter school's applicable resident 8district. A State-authorized charter school whose resident 9district is organized under Article 34 of this Code shall have 10a real equalized assessed valuation equal to the real 11equalized assessed valuation of its resident district as 12computed under paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of Section 1318-8.15. A State-authorized charter school's qualifying rate 14shall be the same as the rate that applies to the charter 15school's resident district. 16    To be eligible to receive reimbursement in excess of 4/5 17of the cost to transport eligible pupils, a school district or 18partial elementary unit district formed pursuant to Article 1911E shall have a Transportation Fund tax rate of at least .12%. 20The Transportation Fund tax rate for a partial elementary unit 21district formed pursuant Article 11E shall be the combined 22elementary and high school rates pursuant to paragraph (4) of 23subsection (a) of Section 18-8.15. 24    If a school district or partial elementary unit district 25formed pursuant to Article 11E does not have a .12% 26Transportation Fund tax rate, the amount of its claim in   SB2250- 9 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1excess of 4/5 of the cost of transporting pupils shall be 2reduced by the sum arrived at by subtracting the 3Transportation Fund tax rate from .12% and multiplying that 4amount by the district's real equalized assessed valuation as 5computed under paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of Section 618-8.15, provided that in no case shall said reduction result 7in reimbursement of less than 4/5 of the cost to transport 8eligible pupils. No such adjustment may be applied to a claim 9filed by a State-authorized charter school.10    Subject to the calculation of equalized assessed 11valuation, an adjustment for an insufficient tax rate, and the 12use of a qualifying rate as provided in this Section, a 13State-authorized charter school may make a claim for 14reimbursement by the State that is calculated in the same 15manner as a school district. 16    The minimum amount to be received by a district is $16 17times the number of eligible pupils transported. 18    When calculating the reimbursement for transportation 19costs, the State Board of Education may not deduct the number 20of pupils enrolled in early education programs from the number 21of pupils eligible for reimbursement if the pupils enrolled in 22the early education programs are transported at the same time 23as other eligible pupils. 24    Any such district transporting resident pupils during the 25school day to an area vocational school or another school 26district's vocational program more than 1 1/2 miles from the   SB2250- 10 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1school attended, as provided in Sections 10-22.20a and 210-22.22, shall be reimbursed by the State for 4/5 of the cost 3of transporting eligible pupils. 4    School day means that period of time during which the 5pupil is required to be in attendance for instructional 6purposes. 7    If a pupil is at a location within the school district 8other than his residence for child care purposes at the time 9for transportation to school, that location may be considered 10for purposes of determining the 1 1/2 miles from the school 11attended. 12    Claims for reimbursement that include children who attend 13any school other than a public school shall show the number of 14such children transported. 15    Claims for reimbursement under this Section shall not be 16paid for the transportation of pupils for whom transportation 17costs are claimed for payment under other Sections of this 18Act. 19    The allowable direct cost of transporting pupils for 20regular, vocational, and special education pupil 21transportation shall be limited to the sum of the cost of 22physical examinations required for employment as a school bus 23driver; the salaries of full-time or part-time drivers and 24school bus maintenance personnel; employee benefits excluding 25Illinois municipal retirement payments, social security 26payments, unemployment insurance payments and workers'   SB2250- 11 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1compensation insurance premiums; expenditures to independent 2carriers who operate school buses; payments to other school 3districts for pupil transportation services; pre-approved 4contractual expenditures for computerized bus scheduling; 5expenditures for housing assistance and homeless prevention 6under Sections 1-17 and 1-18 of the Education for Homeless 7Children Act that are not in excess of the school district's 8actual costs for providing transportation services and are not 9otherwise claimed in another State or federal grant that 10permits those costs to a parent, a legal guardian, any other 11person who enrolled a pupil, or a homeless assistance agency 12that is part of the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance 13Act's continuum of care for the area in which the district is 14located; the cost of gasoline, oil, tires, and other supplies 15necessary for the operation of school buses; the cost of 16converting buses' gasoline engines to more fuel efficient 17engines or to engines which use alternative energy sources; 18the cost of travel to meetings and workshops conducted by the 19regional superintendent or the State Superintendent of 20Education pursuant to the standards established by the 21Secretary of State under Section 6-106 of the Illinois Vehicle 22Code to improve the driving skills of school bus drivers; the 23cost of maintenance of school buses including parts and 24materials used; expenditures for leasing transportation 25vehicles, except interest and service charges; the cost of 26insurance and licenses for transportation vehicles;   SB2250- 12 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1expenditures for the rental of transportation equipment; plus 2a depreciation allowance of 20% for 5 years for school buses 3and vehicles approved for transporting pupils to and from 4school and a depreciation allowance of 10% for 10 years for 5other transportation equipment so used. Each school year, if a 6school district has made expenditures to the Regional 7Transportation Authority or any of its service boards, a mass 8transit district, or an urban transportation district under an 9intergovernmental agreement with the district to provide for 10the transportation of pupils and if the public transit carrier 11received direct payment for services or passes from a school 12district within its service area during the 2000-2001 school 13year, then the allowable direct cost of transporting pupils 14for regular, vocational, and special education pupil 15transportation shall also include the expenditures that the 16district has made to the public transit carrier. In addition 17to the above allowable costs, school districts shall also 18claim all transportation supervisory salary costs, including 19Illinois municipal retirement payments, and all transportation 20related building and building maintenance costs without 21limitation. 22    Special education allowable costs shall also include 23expenditures for the salaries of attendants or aides for that 24portion of the time they assist special education pupils while 25in transit and expenditures for parents and public carriers 26for transporting special education pupils when pre-approved by   SB2250- 13 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1the State Superintendent of Education. 2    Indirect costs shall be included in the reimbursement 3claim for districts which own and operate their own school 4buses. Such indirect costs shall include administrative costs, 5or any costs attributable to transporting pupils from their 6attendance centers to another school building for 7instructional purposes. No school district which owns and 8operates its own school buses may claim reimbursement for 9indirect costs which exceed 5% of the total allowable direct 10costs for pupil transportation. 11    The State Board of Education shall prescribe uniform 12regulations for determining the above standards and shall 13prescribe forms of cost accounting and standards of 14determining reasonable depreciation. Such depreciation shall 15include the cost of equipping school buses with the safety 16features required by law or by the rules, regulations and 17standards promulgated by the State Board of Education, and the 18Department of Transportation for the safety and construction 19of school buses provided, however, any equipment cost 20reimbursed by the Department of Transportation for equipping 21school buses with such safety equipment shall be deducted from 22the allowable cost in the computation of reimbursement under 23this Section in the same percentage as the cost of the 24equipment is depreciated. 25    On or before August 15, annually, the chief school 26administrator for the district shall certify to the State   SB2250- 14 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1Superintendent of Education the district's claim for 2reimbursement for the school year ending on June 30 next 3preceding. The State Superintendent of Education shall check 4and approve the claims and prepare the vouchers showing the 5amounts due for district reimbursement claims. Each fiscal 6year, the State Superintendent of Education shall prepare and 7transmit the first 3 vouchers to the Comptroller on the 30th 8day of September, December and March, respectively, and the 9final voucher, no later than June 20. 10    If the amount appropriated for transportation 11reimbursement is insufficient to fund total claims for any 12fiscal year, the State Board of Education shall reduce each 13school district's allowable costs and flat grant amount 14proportionately to make total adjusted claims equal the total 15amount appropriated. 16    For purposes of calculating claims for reimbursement under 17this Section for any school year beginning July 1, 2016, the 18equalized assessed valuation for a school district or partial 19elementary unit district formed pursuant to Article 11E used 20to compute reimbursement shall be the real equalized assessed 21valuation as computed under paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of 22Section 18-8.15. 23    All reimbursements received from the State shall be 24deposited into the district's transportation fund or into the 25fund from which the allowable expenditures were made. 26    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any school   SB2250- 15 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1district receiving a payment under this Section or under 2Section 14-7.02, 14-7.02b, or 14-13.01 of this Code may 3classify all or a portion of the funds that it receives in a 4particular fiscal year or from State aid pursuant to Section 518-8.15 of this Code as funds received in connection with any 6funding program for which it is entitled to receive funds from 7the State in that fiscal year (including, without limitation, 8any funding program referenced in this Section), regardless of 9the source or timing of the receipt. The district may not 10classify more funds as funds received in connection with the 11funding program than the district is entitled to receive in 12that fiscal year for that program. Any classification by a 13district must be made by a resolution of its board of 14education. The resolution must identify the amount of any 15payments or general State aid to be classified under this 16paragraph and must specify the funding program to which the 17funds are to be treated as received in connection therewith. 18This resolution is controlling as to the classification of 19funds referenced therein. A certified copy of the resolution 20must be sent to the State Superintendent of Education. The 21resolution shall still take effect even though a copy of the 22resolution has not been sent to the State Superintendent of 23Education in a timely manner. No classification under this 24paragraph by a district shall affect the total amount or 25timing of money the district is entitled to receive under this 26Code. No classification under this paragraph by a district   SB2250- 16 -LRB104 09499 LNS 19560 b1shall in any way relieve the district from or affect any 2requirements that otherwise would apply with respect to that 3funding program, including any accounting of funds by source, 4reporting expenditures by original source and purpose, 5reporting requirements, or requirements of providing services. 6    Any school district with a population of not more than 7500,000 must deposit all funds received under this Article 8into the transportation fund and use those funds for the 9provision of transportation services. 10(Source: P.A. 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 11103-588, eff. 1-1-25.)
