Unless it complies with the provisions set 2forth in this Section, a municipality is not permitted to 3acquire by eminent domain that portion of a system located in 4another incorporated municipality without agreement of that 5municipality, but this provision shall not prevent the 6acquisition of that portion of the water system existing 7within the acquiring municipality. 8    (b) Where a water or sewer system that is owned by a public 9utility (as defined in the Public Utilities Act) provides 10water or sewer services to customers located in 2 or more 11municipalities, the system may be acquired by a majority of 12the municipalities by eminent domain. If the system is to be 13acquired by more than one municipality, then there must be an 14intergovernmental agreement in existence between the acquiring 15municipalities providing for the acquisition. 16    (c) If a water or sewer system that is owned by a public 17utility provides water or sewer services to customers located 18in one or more municipalities and also to customers in an 19unincorporated area and if at least 70% of the customers of the 20system or portion thereof are located within the municipality 21or municipalities, then the system, or portion thereof as 22determined by the corporate authorities, may be acquired, 23using eminent domain or otherwise, by either a municipality 24under subsection (a) or an entity created by agreement between 25municipalities where at least 70% of the customers reside. For 26the purposes of determining "customers of the system", only   10400SB0639sam001- 3 -LRB104 06917 RTM 25951 a1retail customers directly billed by the company shall be 2included in the computation. The number of customers of the 3system most recently reported to the Illinois Commerce 4Commission for any calendar year preceding the year a 5resolution is passed by a municipality or municipalities 6expressing preliminary intent to purchase the water system or 7portion thereof shall be presumed to be the total number of 8customers within the system. The public utility shall provide 9information relative to the number of customers within each 10municipality and within the system within 60 days after any 11such request by a municipality.12    (d) In the case of acquisition by a municipality or 13municipalities or a public entity created by law to own or 14operate a water system under this Section, service and water 15supply must be provided to persons who are customers of the 16system on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 17General Assembly without discrimination based on whether the 18customer is located within or outside of the boundaries of the 19acquiring municipality or municipalities or entity, and a 20supply contract existing on the effective date of this 21amendatory Act of the 94th General Assembly must be honored by 22an acquiring municipality, municipalities, or entity according 23to the terms so long as the agreement does not conflict with 24any other existing agreement.25    (e) For the purposes of this Section, "system" includes 26all assets reasonably necessary to provide water or sewer   10400SB0639sam001- 4 -LRB104 06917 RTM 25951 a1service to a contiguous or compact geographical service area 2or to an area served by a common pipeline and include, but are 3not limited to, interests in real estate, all wells, pipes, 4treatment plants, pumps and other physical apparatus, data and 5records of facilities and customers, fire hydrants, equipment, 6or vehicles and also includes service agreements and 7obligations derived from use of the assets, whether or not the 8assets are contiguous to the municipality, municipalities, or 9entity created for the purpose of owning or operating a water 10or sewer system.11    (f) Before making a good faith offer, a municipality may 12pass a resolution of intent to study the feasibility of 13purchasing or exercising its power of eminent domain to 14acquire any water system or water works, sewer system or sewer 15works, or combined water and sewer system or works, or part 16thereof. Upon the passage of such a resolution, the 17municipality shall have the right to review and inspect all 18financial and other records, and both corporeal and 19incorporeal assets of such utility related to the condition 20and the operation of the system or works, or part thereof, as 21part of the study and determination of feasibility of the 22proposed acquisition by purchase or exercise of the power of 23eminent domain, and the utility shall make knowledgeable 24persons who have access to all relevant facts and information 25regarding the subject system or works available to answer 26inquiries related to the study and determination.  10400SB0639sam001- 5 -LRB104 06917 RTM 25951 a1    The right to review and inspect shall be upon reasonable 2notice to the utility, with reasonable inspection and review 3time limitations and reasonable response times for production, 4copying, and answer.

Rights 21under franchise agreements and other agreements or statutory 22or regulatory provisions are not limited by this Section and 23are preserved.24    The passage of time between an inspection of the utilities 25and physical assets and the making of a good faith offer or 26initiation of an eminent domain action because of the limit   10400SB0639sam001- 7 -LRB104 06917 RTM 25951 a1placed on inspections by this subsection shall not be used as a 2basis for challenging the good faith of any offer or be used as 3the basis for attacking any appraisal, expert, argument, or 4position before a court related to an acquisition by purchase 5or eminent domain. 6    (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 7Illinois Commerce Commission has no approval authority of any 8eminent domain action brought by any governmental entity or 9combination of such entities to acquire water or sewer systems 10or water works, except as is provided in subsection (h) of 11Section 10-5-10 of the Eminent Domain Act.12    (h) The provisions of this Section are severable under 13Section 1.31 of the Statute on Statutes.14    (i) This Section does not apply to any public utility 15company that, on January 1, 2006, supplied a total of 70,000 or 16fewer meter connections in the State unless and until (i) that 17public utility company receives approval from the Illinois 18Commerce Commission under Section 7-204 of the Public 19Utilities Act for the reorganization of the public utility 20company or (ii) the majority control of the company changes 21through a stock sale, a sale of assets, a merger (other than an 22internal reorganization) or otherwise.
