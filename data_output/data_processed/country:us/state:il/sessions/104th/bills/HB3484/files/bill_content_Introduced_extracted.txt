Traffic rules. 24    A. The area straight ahead of a vessel to the point that is 2522.5 degrees beyond the middle of the vessel on the starboard   HB3484- 15 -LRB104 12161 LNS 22262 b1side of the watercraft shall be designated the danger zone. An 2operator of a watercraft shall yield the right-of-way to any 3other watercraft occupying or entering into the danger zone 4that may result in collision.5    A-5. Head-on situation.6        (1) If 2 power-driven vessels are meeting head-on or 7    nearly head-on courses so as to involve risk of collision, 8    each shall alter course to starboard so that each shall 9    pass on the port side of the other.10        (2) A vessel proceeding along the course of a narrow 11    channel or canal shall keep as near to the outer limit of 12    the channel or canal that lies on the starboard side as is 13    safe and practicable.14        (3) A power-driven vessel operating in narrow channels 15    and proceeding downbound with a following current 16    downstream shall have the right-of-way over an upbound 17    vessel, shall propose the manner and place of passage, and 18    shall imitate the maneuvering signals as required by law a 19    vessel proceeding upstream. The vessel proceeding upstream 20    shall yield as necessary to permit safe passing. 21    B. Crossing. As used in this Section, "crossing" means 2 22or more watercraft traveling in directions that would have the 23path of travel of the watercraft intersect each other.24        (1) If 2 power-driven vessels are crossing so as to 25    involve the risk of collision, the vessel that has the 26    other on the starboard side shall keep out of the way and   HB3484- 16 -LRB104 12161 LNS 22262 b1    shall avoid crossing ahead of the other vessel.2        (2) A power-driven vessel crossing a river shall keep 3    out of the way of a power-driven vessel ascending or 4    descending the river.5        (3) A vessel may not cross a narrow channel or canal if 6    the crossing impedes the passage of a vessel that can only 7    safely navigate within the channel or canal. 8    C. Overtaking.9        (1) A vessel overtaking any other shall give way to 10    the vessel being overtaken.11        (2) If a vessel operator is in doubt as to whether he 12    or she is overtaking another vessel, the operator shall 13    assume he or she is overtaking the other vessel and shall 14    act accordingly.15        (3) Any subsequent alteration of the bearing between 16    the 2 vessels shall not make the overtaking vessel a 17    crossing vessel within the meaning of this Section or 18    relieve the overtaking operator of the duty to keep clear 19    of the overtaken vessel until finally past and clear.20        (4) When overtaking in a narrow channel or canal, the 21    operator of a power-driven vessel intending to overtake 22    another power-driven vessel shall proceed to pass safety 23    only after indicating his or her intention by sounding the 24    horn as follows:25            (a) one short blast from the horn signifies a 26        request to pass on the overtaken vessel's starboard   HB3484- 17 -LRB104 12161 LNS 22262 b1        side;2            (b) 2 short blasts from the horn signify a request 3        to pass on the overtaken vessel's port side.4        (5) The operator of the power-driven vessel being 5    overtaken shall:6            (a) acknowledge the request by sounding the same 7        signal; or8            (b) sound 5 short blasts from the horn to indicate 9        danger or to warn the overtaking vessel not to pass.10        No response from the overtaken vessel shall be 11    interpreted as an indication of danger and is the same as 12    if 5 short blasts from the horn were sounded. In the 13    absence of an audible signal or horn, a light signal 14    device using the appropriate number of rapid bursts of 15    light may be used. 16    D. Sailing vessels. 17        (1) The operator of a power-driven vessel shall yield 18    the right-of-way to any nonpowered or sailing vessel 19    unless the nonpowered vessel is overtaking the 20    power-driven vessel or when a large craft is navigating in 21    a confined channel, the large craft has the right-of-way 22    over a boat propelled solely by oars or sails.23        (2) If 2 sailing vessels are approaching one another, 24    so as to involve risk of collision, one of them shall keep 25    out of the way of the other as follows:26            (a) If each has the wind on a different side, the   HB3484- 18 -LRB104 12161 LNS 22262 b1        vessel that has the wind on the port side shall give 2        way to the other vessel.3            (b) If both have the wind on the same side, the 4        vessel that is to windward shall give way to the vessel 5        that is to leeward.6            (c) If a vessel with the wind on the port side sees 7        a vessel to windward and cannot determine with 8        certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on the 9        port or starboard side, the vessel shall give way to 10        the other vessel. 11(Source: P.A. 102-595, eff. 6-1-22.) 12    (625 ILCS 45/5-18)  (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 315-13)13    Sec. 5-18.
