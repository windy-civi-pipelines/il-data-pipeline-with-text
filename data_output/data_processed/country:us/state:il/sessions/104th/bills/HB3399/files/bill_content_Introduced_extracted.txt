Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Geothermal Homes and Business Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that: 7        (1) Geothermal heating and cooling systems leverage 8    the year-round stability of the earth's underground 9    temperature, which creates renewable energy potential, in 10    order to provide a zero-cost base temperature for space 11    heating or cooling and water heating. 12        (2) The Geothermal Homes and Business Program would 13    promote innovation in, and production and use of, 14    geothermal heating and cooling systems that (i) 15    significantly reduce ratepayer impacts and spur economic 16    development in the State, (ii) expand job opportunities 17    for State trade-based labor and manufacturing in the 18    United States, (iii) bolster resiliency and support State 19    infrastructure, and (iv) mitigate local pollution and 20    global greenhouse gas emissions. 21        (3) Incentives generated through the use of 22    State-sited geothermal heating and cooling systems under 23    this Act will promote innovation and investment in   HB3399- 2 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1    geothermal heating and cooling systems. 2    Section 10. Definition of qualifying systems. As used in 3this Act:4    "Agency" means the Illinois Power Agency.5    "Commission" means the Illinois Commerce Commission.6    "Geothermal heating and cooling system" or means a system 7located in this State that meets all of the following 8requirements: 9        (1) exchanges thermal energy from groundwater or a 10    shallow ground source to generate thermal energy through 11    an electric geothermal heat pump or a system of electric 12    geothermal heat pumps interconnected with any geothermal 13    extraction facility that is (i) a closed loop or a series 14    of closed loop systems in which fluid is permanently 15    confined within a pipe or tubing and does not come in 16    contact with the outside environment or (ii) an open loop 17    system in which ground or surface water is circulated in 18    an environmentally safe manner directly into the facility 19    and returned to the same aquifer or surface water source; 20        (2) meets or exceeds the current federal Energy Star 21    product specification standards; 22        (3) replaces or displaces less efficient space or 23    water heating systems, regardless of fuel type; 24        (4) replaces or displaces less efficient space cooling 25    systems;   HB3399- 3 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1        (5) does not feed electricity back to the grid, as 2    defined at the level of the geothermal heat pump; and 3        (6) became operational on or after June 1, 2017.4    "Program" means the Geothermal Homes and Business Program. 5    Section 15. Program establishment. Beginning January 1, 62026, the long-term renewable resources procurement plan 7developed by the Agency shall include a Geothermal Homes and 8Business Program for the procurement of geothermal renewable 9energy credits. The Program shall be designed to provide for 10the steady, predictable, and sustainable growth of new 11geothermal heating and cooling system deployment in the State 12    Section 20. Categorization. Qualifying systems for the 13Program shall be organized into 3 categories based on 14structural features and use-cases: (i) Residential, (ii) 15Commercial, and (iii) Public or Environmental Justice. These 16categories shall be defined at the discretion of the Agency.  17    Section 25. Geothermal heating and cooling system 18calculation methodology. Energy derived from a geothermal 19heating and cooling system shall be eligible for inclusion in 20meeting the requirements of the Program. Eligible geothermal 21renewable energy credits shall be created by calculating the 22difference between the load served by the geothermal heating 23and cooling system and the load served by a less efficient   HB3399- 4 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1baseline system for space heating and cooling or water 2heating. To make this calculation, the Agency shall identify 3an appropriate formula supported by a geothermal industry 4trade organization. This formula shall generally reflect 5calculation methodologies already in use for other State 6renewable portfolio standards. The Agency shall determine the 7form and manner in which such geothermal renewable energy 8credits are verified, in accordance with national best 9practices. 10    Section 30. Program block allocation. 11    (a) As used in this Section, "period" means each Program 12delivery year through a specified delivery year.13    (b) The Program shall include the following for eligible 14projects for each delivery year: 15        (1) a block of geothermal renewable energy credit 16    volumes;17        (2) a price for geothermal renewable energy credits 18    within the identified block; and 19        (3) the terms and conditions for securing a spot on a 20    waitlist once the block is fully committed or reserved.21    The Agency shall strive to issue blocks sized to provide 22for stability and market growth. 23    (c) The Agency shall propose a block for each Program 24delivery year through the delivery year beginning in 2035. 25Before the close of the period in 2035, the Agency shall   HB3399- 5 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1propose blocks for each Program delivery year for the next 2period, beginning in 2036 and ending at the discretion of the 3Agency. The Agency shall continue to establish subsequent 4periods. 5    (d) The waitlist of projects in a given year shall carry 6over to apply to the subsequent year when another block is 7opened. For each category for a delivery year, the Agency 8shall determine the amount of geothermal renewable energy 9credit volumes available in each block and the purchase price 10for each block, if the purchase price provided and the total 11geothermal renewable energy credit volume in all blocks for 12all categories shall be sufficient to meet Program goals. 13    (e) Systems in any of the categories listed in Section 20 14may reserve volumes in the annual block. However, at least 50% 15of each annual block shall be reserved by systems that meet the 16Agency's definition of "Residential". At the Agency's 17discretion, certain volumes of an annual block may be reserved 18for the Public or Environmental Justice category at a price 19that makes it feasible and affordable for buildings such as 20public schools, military bases, military hospitals, and 21low-income housing to install geothermal heating and cooling 22systems on premises. Additional allocation of geothermal 23renewable energy credit volumes per block per structural 24category may be defined at the discretion of the Agency. 25    (f) The Agency shall establish Program eligibility 26requirements that ensure that systems that enter the Program   HB3399- 6 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1are sufficiently mature to indicate a demonstrable path to 2completion. The Agency may periodically review its prior 3decisions establishing the amount of geothermal renewable 4energy credit volumes in each annual block and the purchase 5price for each block and may propose, on an expedited basis, 6changes to the previously set values, including, but not 7limited to, redistributing the amounts and the available funds 8as necessary and appropriate, subject to Commission approval. 9The Agency may define different block sizes, purchase prices, 10or other distinct terms and conditions for projects located in 11different utility service territories if the Agency deems it 12necessary. 13    (g) The Program shall be designed to ensure that 14geothermal renewable energy credits are procured from projects 15in diverse locations and are not concentrated in a few 16regional areas. 17    Section 35. Program block pricing. The Program shall 18provide a transparent annual schedule of geothermal renewable 19energy credit prices and quantities to enable the geothermal 20heating and cooling market to scale up and for geothermal 21renewable energy credit prices to adjust at a predictable rate 22over time. Geothermal renewable energy credit prices set by 23the Agency for the Program shall be reflected as a set value or 24the product of a formula.   HB3399- 7 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1    Section 40. Approved vendors requirement. 2    (a) Property owners participating in the Program shall be 3required to work with an approved vendor for Program 4registration and application, geothermal renewable energy 5credit generation, geothermal renewable energy credit 6verification, geothermal renewable energy credit delivery, as 7well as Program contract fulfillment and payment. 8    (b) The Agency shall establish a registration process for 9entities seeking to qualify for Program-administered incentive 10funding and establish baseline qualifications for vendor 11approval. The Agency shall maintain a list of approved 12entities on the Program's website, and may revoke a vendor's 13ability to receive Program-administered incentive funding 14status upon a determination that the vendor failed to comply 15with contract terms, the law, or other Program requirements. 16    (c) The Agency shall establish Program requirements and 17minimum contract terms to ensure projects are properly 18installed and operate to the level of expected benefits. 19Program requirements may include on-site inspections and photo 20documentation of projects under construction. The Agency may 21require repairs, alterations, or additions to remedy any 22enforcement actions taken in response to those complaints. 23    Section 45. Contract terms; advanced capital; contract 24length; transfer of geothermal heating and cooling system 25ownership.   HB3399- 8 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1    (a) The Agency shall propose a payment structure for 2Program contracts upon a demonstration of qualification or 3need and applicant firms shall have advanced capital disbursed 4after the geothermal heating and cooling system is operational 5but before geothermal renewable energy credits are first 6generated. The amount or percentage of capital advanced shall 7be at the discretion of the Agency but not be less than 40% of 8the total contract.9    (b) The amount or percentage of advanced capital may vary 10by year, or inter-year, by structure category, block, and 11other factors as deemed applicable by the Agency and by an 12applicant's demonstration of need. 13    (c) Contracts featuring capital advanced prior to system 14operation shall feature provisions to ensure both the 15successful development of applicant projects and the delivery 16of geothermal renewable energy credits for the full term of 17the contract, including ongoing collateral requirements and 18other provisions deemed necessary by the Agency. The 19percentage or amount of capital advanced prior to system 20operation shall not increase the overall contract value, 21except that contracts executed under this Section may feature 22geothermal renewable energy credits higher than those offered 23to similar projects participating in other categories. 24    (d) The capital which is not advanced shall be disbursed 25upon delivery of geothermal renewable energy credits as per 26contract fulfillment over the delivery term, not to exceed,   HB3399- 9 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1during each delivery year, the contract price multiplied by 2the estimated annual geothermal renewable energy credit 3generation amount. 4    (e) For geothermal renewable energy credits that qualify 5and are procured under the Program, geothermal renewable 6energy credits delivery contract length shall be 25 years. 7    (f) If generation of geothermal renewable energy credits 8during a delivery year exceeds the estimated annual generation 9amount, the excess geothermal renewable energy credits shall 10be carried forward to future delivery years and shall not 11expire during the delivery term. If geothermal renewable 12energy credit generation during a delivery year, including 13carried forward excess geothermal renewable energy credits, if 14any, is less than the estimated annual generation amount, 15payments during such delivery year shall not exceed the 16quantity generated plus the quantity carried forward 17multiplied by the contract price. The electric utility shall 18receive all geothermal renewable energy credits generated by 19the project during the first 25 years of operation and retire 20all geothermal renewable energy credits paid for under this 21item and return at the end of the delivery term all geothermal 22renewable energy credits that were not paid for. 23    (g) Geothermal renewable energy credits generated by the 24project thereafter shall not be transferred under the 25geothermal renewable energy credit delivery contract with the 26counterparty electric utility. Subscription of 90% of total   HB3399- 10 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1geothermal renewable energy credit volumes or greater shall be 2deemed to be fully subscribed. 3    Section 50. Contract terms; collateral and counterparties. 4    (a) Each contract shall include provisions to ensure the 5delivery of the estimated quantity of geothermal renewable 6energy credits, including the requirement of a bid security 7deposit in an amount deemed appropriate by the Agency. 8    (b) An obligated utility shall be the counterparty to the 9contracts executed under this Act that are approved by the 10Commission. No contract shall be executed for an amount that 11is less than one geothermal renewable energy credit per year. 12    (c) Nothing in this Act shall require the utility to 13advance any payment or pay any amounts that exceed the actual 14amount of revenues anticipated to be collected by the utility 15inclusive of eligible funds collected in prior years and 16alternative compliance payments for use by the utility. 17    (d) Contracts may be assignable, but only to entities 18first deemed by the Agency to have met Program terms and 19requirements applicable to direct Program participation. In 20developing contracts for the delivery of geothermal renewable 21energy credits, the Agency may establish fees applicable to 22each contract assignment. 23    Section 55. Utility cost recovery. The electric utility 24shall be entitled to recover all of its costs associated with   HB3399- 11 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1the procurement of geothermal renewable energy credits under 2the Program. These costs shall include associated reasonable 3expenses for implementing the procurement Programs, including, 4but not limited to, the costs of administering and evaluating 5the Program through an automatic adjustment clause tariff. 6    Section 60. Extenuating circumstances. If, at any time, 7approved applications for the Program exceed funds collected 8by the electric utility or would cause the Agency to exceed the 9limitation on the amount of renewable energy resources that 10may be procured, then the Agency may consider future 11uncommitted funds to be reserved for these contracts on a 12first-come, first-served basis. 13    Notwithstanding other requirements of this Act, no 14modification shall be required to Program contracts if they 15were already executed prior to the establishment, approval, 16and implementation of new contract forms as a result of this 17Act. 18    Section 65. Illinois Power Agency administration. 19    (a) The Agency shall strive to minimize administrative 20expenses in the implementation of the Program. The Agency 21shall be authorized to retain one or more experts or expert 22consulting firms to develop, administer, implement, operate, 23and evaluate the Program and the Agency shall retain the 24consultant or consultants in the same manner, to the extent   HB3399- 12 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1practicable, as the Agency retains others to administer 2provisions of this Act, including, but not limited to, the 3procurement administrator. 4    (b) If the Agency becomes aware of a circumstance that 5would warrant consideration of a mid-year renewable energy 6credit price adjustment, it shall conduct modeling of 7renewable energy credit pricing dynamics, in order to provide 8notice to stakeholders, and conduct a stakeholder feedback 9process before finalizing any changes. In line with the 10Illinois Power Agency Act, Program modifications to any block 11price that does not deviate from the Commission's approved 12value by more than 10% shall take effect immediately and are 13not subject to Commission review and approval. Program 14modifications to any block price that deviate more than 10% 15from the Commission's approved value shall be approved by the 16Commission as a long-term plan amendment under Section 1716-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. 18    (c) In addition to covering the costs of Program 19administration, the Agency, in conjunction with its Program 20Administrator, may also use the proceeds of such fees charged 21to participating firms to support public education, labor 22training, and ongoing regional and national coordination with 23nonprofit organizations, public bodies, and others engaged in 24the implementation of geothermal heating and cooling system 25incentive Programs or similar initiatives. This work may 26include developing papers and reports, hosting regional and   HB3399- 13 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1national conferences, and other work deemed necessary by the 2Agency to position the State as a national leader in renewable 3energy incentive Program development and administration. 4    (d) The Agency and its consultant or consultants shall 5monitor block activity, share Program activity with 6stakeholders and conduct quarterly meetings to discuss Program 7activity and market conditions. If necessary, the Agency may 8make prospective administrative adjustments to Program design, 9such as making adjustments to purchase prices as necessary to 10achieve the goals of this Act. Program modifications to any 11block price that do not deviate from the Commission's approved 12value by more than 10% shall take effect immediately and are 13not subject to Commission review and approval. Program 14modifications to any block price that deviate more than 10% 15from the Commission's approved value shall be approved by the 16Commission as a long-term plan amendment. The Agency shall 17consider stakeholder feedback when making adjustments to 18Program design and shall notify stakeholders in advance of any 19planned changes. 20    (e) The Agency shall schedule regular meetings with 21representatives of the Attorney General, the Commission, 22consumer protection groups, and other interested stakeholders 23to share relevant information about consumer protection, 24project compliance, and complaints received. 25    (f) To the extent that complaints received implicate the 26jurisdiction of the Attorney General, the Commission, or   HB3399- 14 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1local, State, or federal law enforcement, the Agency shall 2also refer complaints to those entities as appropriate. 3    Section 70. Prohibition of double claiming geothermal 4renewable energy credits. Geothermal renewable energy credits 5retired by obligated utilities for compliance with the Program 6are only valid for compliance if those geothermal renewable 7energy credits have not been previously retired by another 8entity that is not the obligated utility on any tracking 9system, carbon registry, or other accounting mechanism at any 10time. Additionally, geothermal renewable energy credits 11retired by obligated utilities for compliance with the Program 12are only valid for compliance if those geothermal renewable 13energy credits have not been used to substantiate a public 14emissions or energy usage claim by any other another entity 15that is not the obligated utility, of any type and at any time, 16whether or not such geothermal renewable energy credits were 17actually retired on a tracking system, registry, or other 18accounting mechanism at the time of the public emissions-based 19claim. To that end, geothermal renewable energy credits 20generated for compliance with the Program are valid only if 21retired once, and claimed once, by the obligated utility. 22    Section 99. Effective date. This Act takes effect upon 23becoming law.

The 19percentage or amount of capital advanced prior to system 20operation shall not increase the overall contract value, 21except that contracts executed under this Section may feature 22geothermal renewable energy credits higher than those offered 23to similar projects participating in other categories. 24    (d) The capital which is not advanced shall be disbursed 25upon delivery of geothermal renewable energy credits as per 26contract fulfillment over the delivery term, not to exceed,   HB3399- 9 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1during each delivery year, the contract price multiplied by 2the estimated annual geothermal renewable energy credit 3generation amount. 4    (e) For geothermal renewable energy credits that qualify 5and are procured under the Program, geothermal renewable 6energy credits delivery contract length shall be 25 years. 7    (f) If generation of geothermal renewable energy credits 8during a delivery year exceeds the estimated annual generation 9amount, the excess geothermal renewable energy credits shall 10be carried forward to future delivery years and shall not 11expire during the delivery term. If geothermal renewable 12energy credit generation during a delivery year, including 13carried forward excess geothermal renewable energy credits, if 14any, is less than the estimated annual generation amount, 15payments during such delivery year shall not exceed the 16quantity generated plus the quantity carried forward 17multiplied by the contract price. The electric utility shall 18receive all geothermal renewable energy credits generated by 19the project during the first 25 years of operation and retire 20all geothermal renewable energy credits paid for under this 21item and return at the end of the delivery term all geothermal 22renewable energy credits that were not paid for. 23    (g) Geothermal renewable energy credits generated by the 24project thereafter shall not be transferred under the 25geothermal renewable energy credit delivery contract with the 26counterparty electric utility. Subscription of 90% of total   HB3399- 10 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1geothermal renewable energy credit volumes or greater shall be 2deemed to be fully subscribed. 3    Section 50. Contract terms; collateral and counterparties. 4    (a) Each contract shall include provisions to ensure the 5delivery of the estimated quantity of geothermal renewable 6energy credits, including the requirement of a bid security 7deposit in an amount deemed appropriate by the Agency. 8    (b) An obligated utility shall be the counterparty to the 9contracts executed under this Act that are approved by the 10Commission. No contract shall be executed for an amount that 11is less than one geothermal renewable energy credit per year. 12    (c) Nothing in this Act shall require the utility to 13advance any payment or pay any amounts that exceed the actual 14amount of revenues anticipated to be collected by the utility 15inclusive of eligible funds collected in prior years and 16alternative compliance payments for use by the utility. 17    (d) Contracts may be assignable, but only to entities 18first deemed by the Agency to have met Program terms and 19requirements applicable to direct Program participation. In 20developing contracts for the delivery of geothermal renewable 21energy credits, the Agency may establish fees applicable to 22each contract assignment. 23    Section 55. Utility cost recovery. The electric utility 24shall be entitled to recover all of its costs associated with   HB3399- 11 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1the procurement of geothermal renewable energy credits under 2the Program. These costs shall include associated reasonable 3expenses for implementing the procurement Programs, including, 4but not limited to, the costs of administering and evaluating 5the Program through an automatic adjustment clause tariff. 6    Section 60. Extenuating circumstances. If, at any time, 7approved applications for the Program exceed funds collected 8by the electric utility or would cause the Agency to exceed the 9limitation on the amount of renewable energy resources that 10may be procured, then the Agency may consider future 11uncommitted funds to be reserved for these contracts on a 12first-come, first-served basis. 13    Notwithstanding other requirements of this Act, no 14modification shall be required to Program contracts if they 15were already executed prior to the establishment, approval, 16and implementation of new contract forms as a result of this 17Act. 18    Section 65. Illinois Power Agency administration. 19    (a) The Agency shall strive to minimize administrative 20expenses in the implementation of the Program. The Agency 21shall be authorized to retain one or more experts or expert 22consulting firms to develop, administer, implement, operate, 23and evaluate the Program and the Agency shall retain the 24consultant or consultants in the same manner, to the extent   HB3399- 12 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1practicable, as the Agency retains others to administer 2provisions of this Act, including, but not limited to, the 3procurement administrator. 4    (b) If the Agency becomes aware of a circumstance that 5would warrant consideration of a mid-year renewable energy 6credit price adjustment, it shall conduct modeling of 7renewable energy credit pricing dynamics, in order to provide 8notice to stakeholders, and conduct a stakeholder feedback 9process before finalizing any changes. In line with the 10Illinois Power Agency Act, Program modifications to any block 11price that does not deviate from the Commission's approved 12value by more than 10% shall take effect immediately and are 13not subject to Commission review and approval. Program 14modifications to any block price that deviate more than 10% 15from the Commission's approved value shall be approved by the 16Commission as a long-term plan amendment under Section 1716-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. 18    (c) In addition to covering the costs of Program 19administration, the Agency, in conjunction with its Program 20Administrator, may also use the proceeds of such fees charged 21to participating firms to support public education, labor 22training, and ongoing regional and national coordination with 23nonprofit organizations, public bodies, and others engaged in 24the implementation of geothermal heating and cooling system 25incentive Programs or similar initiatives. This work may 26include developing papers and reports, hosting regional and   HB3399- 13 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1national conferences, and other work deemed necessary by the 2Agency to position the State as a national leader in renewable 3energy incentive Program development and administration. 4    (d) The Agency and its consultant or consultants shall 5monitor block activity, share Program activity with 6stakeholders and conduct quarterly meetings to discuss Program 7activity and market conditions. If necessary, the Agency may 8make prospective administrative adjustments to Program design, 9such as making adjustments to purchase prices as necessary to 10achieve the goals of this Act. Program modifications to any 11block price that do not deviate from the Commission's approved 12value by more than 10% shall take effect immediately and are 13not subject to Commission review and approval. Program 14modifications to any block price that deviate more than 10% 15from the Commission's approved value shall be approved by the 16Commission as a long-term plan amendment. The Agency shall 17consider stakeholder feedback when making adjustments to 18Program design and shall notify stakeholders in advance of any 19planned changes. 20    (e) The Agency shall schedule regular meetings with 21representatives of the Attorney General, the Commission, 22consumer protection groups, and other interested stakeholders 23to share relevant information about consumer protection, 24project compliance, and complaints received. 25    (f) To the extent that complaints received implicate the 26jurisdiction of the Attorney General, the Commission, or   HB3399- 14 -LRB104 10086 AAS 20158 b1local, State, or federal law enforcement, the Agency shall 2also refer complaints to those entities as appropriate. 3    Section 70. Prohibition of double claiming geothermal 4renewable energy credits. Geothermal renewable energy credits 5retired by obligated utilities for compliance with the Program 6are only valid for compliance if those geothermal renewable 7energy credits have not been previously retired by another 8entity that is not the obligated utility on any tracking 9system, carbon registry, or other accounting mechanism at any 10time. Additionally, geothermal renewable energy credits 11retired by obligated utilities for compliance with the Program 12are only valid for compliance if those geothermal renewable 13energy credits have not been used to substantiate a public 14emissions or energy usage claim by any other another entity 15that is not the obligated utility, of any type and at any time, 16whether or not such geothermal renewable energy credits were 17actually retired on a tracking system, registry, or other 18accounting mechanism at the time of the public emissions-based 19claim. To that end, geothermal renewable energy credits 20generated for compliance with the Program are valid only if 21retired once, and claimed once, by the obligated utility. 22    Section 99. Effective date. This Act takes effect upon 23becoming law.
