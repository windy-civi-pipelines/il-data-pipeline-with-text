Retaliation and Enforcement.18    (a) It is a violation of this Act for a TNC to retaliate 19through deactivation or in any other manner against a TNC 20driver for exercising any rights granted under this Act.

The TNC must make the deactivation policy 3available online, through the TNC's digital platform. Updates 4or changes to the policy must be provided to TNC drivers at 5least 48 hours before they go into effect. The deactivation 6policy must:7        (1) state that the deactivation policy is enforceable 8    as a term of the TNC's contract with a driver;9        (2) provide drivers with a reasonable understanding of 10    the circumstances that constitute a violation that may 11    warrant deactivation under the deactivation policy and 12    indicate the consequences known, including the specific 13    number of days or range of days for a deactivation if 14    applicable;15        (3) describe fair and reasonable procedures for 16    notifying a driver of a deactivation and the reason for 17    the deactivation;18        (4) describe fair, objective, and reasonable 19    procedures and eligibility criteria for the 20    reconsideration of a deactivation decision and the process 21    by which a driver may request a deactivation appeal with 22    the TNC; and23        (5) be specific enough for a driver to understand what 24    constitutes a violation of the policy and how to avoid 25    violating the policy.26    (b) A TNC must not deactivate a TNC driver for:  SB1973- 10 -LRB104 12140 LNS 22239 b1        (1) a violation not reasonably understood as part of a 2    TNC's written deactivation policy;3        (2) a driver's ability to work a minimum number of 4    hours;5        (3) a driver's acceptance or rejection of a ride, as 6    long as the acceptance or rejection is not for a 7    discriminatory purpose;8        (4) a driver's good faith statement regarding 9    compensation or working conditions made publicly or 10    privately; or11        (5) a driver asserting the driver's legal rights under 12    any local, State, or federal law.13    (c) The TNC must provide notice at the time of the 14deactivation or, for deactivations based on serious 15misconduct, within 3 days of the deactivation. A written 16notice must include:17        (1) the reason for deactivation;18        (2) anticipated length of the deactivation, if known;19        (3) what day the deactivation started on;20        (4) an explanation of whether or not the deactivation 21    can be reversed and clear steps for the driver to take to 22    reverse a deactivation; and23        (5) instructions for a driver to challenge the 24    deactivation and information on their rights under the 25    appeals process described in subsection (d).26    (d) The deactivation policy must provide the driver with   SB1973- 11 -LRB104 12140 LNS 22239 b1an opportunity to appeal the deactivation upon receipt of the 2notice and an opportunity to provide information to support 3the request.

Unless the TNC or the 7driver requests an additional 15 days, a TNC must review and 8make a final decision on the appeal within 15 days from the 9receipt of the requested appeal and information to support the 10request. A TNC may use a third party to assist with appeals. 11The TNC must consider any information presented by the driver 12under the appeal process. For a deactivation to be upheld, 13there must be evidence under the totality of the circumstances 14to find that it is more likely than not that a rule violation 15subjecting the driver to deactivation has occurred. This 16Section does not apply to deactivations for economic reasons 17or during a public state of emergency that are not targeted at 18a particular driver or drivers. If an unintentional 19deactivation of an individual driver occurs due to a purely 20technical issue and is not caused by any action or fault of the 21driver, the driver, upon request, must be provided reasonable 22compensation for the period of time the driver was not able to 23accept rides through the TNC capped at a maximum of 21 days. 24For the purposes of this subsection, "reasonable compensation" 25means compensation for each day the driver was deactivated 26using the driver's daily average in earnings from the TNC for   SB1973- 12 -LRB104 12140 LNS 22239 b1the 90 days prior to the deactivation. 2    (625 ILCS 57/31 new)3    Sec. 31.
