The tax imposed by a 12county under this Section and all civil penalties that may be 13assessed as an incident of the tax shall be collected and 14enforced by the Illinois Department of Revenue and deposited 15into a special fund created for that purpose. The certificate 16of registration that is issued by the Department to a retailer 17under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act shall permit the 18retailer to engage in a business that is taxable without 19registering separately with the Department under an ordinance 20or resolution under this Section. The Department has full 21power to administer and enforce this Section, to collect all 22taxes and penalties due under this Section, to dispose of 23taxes and penalties so collected in the manner provided in 24this Section, and to determine all rights to credit memoranda 25arising on account of the erroneous payment of a tax or penalty 26under this Section. In the administration of and compliance   HB3847- 11 -LRB104 06344 RTM 16380 b1with this Section, the Department and persons who are subject 2to this Section shall (i) have the same rights, remedies, 3privileges, immunities, powers, and duties, (ii) be subject to 4the same conditions, restrictions, limitations, penalties, and 5definitions of terms, and (iii) employ the same modes of 6procedure as are prescribed in Sections 1, 1a, 1a-1, 1d, 1e, 71f, 1i, 1j, 1k, 1m, 1n, 2 through 2-70 (in respect to all 8provisions contained in those Sections other than the State 9rate of tax), 2a, 2b, 2c, 3 (except provisions relating to 10transaction returns and quarter monthly payments, and except 11that the retailer's discount is not allowed for taxes paid on 12aviation fuel that are deposited into the Local Government 13Aviation Trust Fund), 4, 5, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f, 5g, 5h, 5i, 145j, 5k, 5l, 6, 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11a, 12, and 13 15of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act and Section 3-7 of the 16Uniform Penalty and Interest Act as if those provisions were 17set forth in this Section.18    Persons subject to any tax imposed under the authority 19granted in this Section may reimburse themselves for their 20sellers' tax liability by separately stating the tax as an 21additional charge, which charge may be stated in combination, 22in a single amount, with State tax which sellers are required 23to collect under the Use Tax Act, pursuant to such bracketed 24schedules as the Department may prescribe.25    Whenever the Department determines that a refund should be 26made under this Section to a claimant instead of issuing a   HB3847- 12 -LRB104 06344 RTM 16380 b1credit memorandum, the Department shall notify the State 2Comptroller, who shall cause the order to be drawn for the 3amount specified and to the person named in the notification 4from the Department. The refund shall be paid by the State 5Treasurer out of the County Public Safety, Public Facilities, 6Mental Health, Substance Abuse, or Transportation Retailers' 7Occupation Tax Fund or the Local Government Aviation Trust 8Fund, as appropriate. 9    (b) If a tax has been imposed under subsection (a), a 10service occupation tax shall also be imposed at the same rate 11upon all persons engaged, in the county, in the business of 12making sales of service, who, as an incident to making those 13sales of service, transfer tangible personal property within 14the county as an incident to a sale of service. This tax may 15not be imposed on tangible personal property taxed at the 1% 16rate under the Service Occupation Tax Act (or at the 0% rate 17imposed under this amendatory Act of the 102nd General 18Assembly). Beginning December 1, 2019 and through December 31, 192020, this tax is not imposed on sales of aviation fuel unless 20the tax revenue is expended for airport-related purposes. If 21the county does not have an airport-related purpose to which 22it dedicates aviation fuel tax revenue, then aviation fuel is 23excluded from the tax. The county must comply with the 24certification requirements for airport-related purposes under 25Section 2-22 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. For 26purposes of this Section, "airport-related purposes" has the   HB3847- 13 -LRB104 06344 RTM 16380 b1meaning ascribed in Section 6z-20.2 of the State Finance Act. 2Beginning January 1, 2021, this tax is not imposed on sales of 3aviation fuel for so long as the revenue use requirements of 49 4U.S.C. 47107(b) and 49 U.S.C. 47133 are binding on the county. 5The tax imposed under this subsection and all civil penalties 6that may be assessed as an incident thereof shall be collected 7and enforced by the Department of Revenue. The Department has 8full power to administer and enforce this subsection; to 9collect all taxes and penalties due hereunder; to dispose of 10taxes and penalties so collected in the manner hereinafter 11provided; and to determine all rights to credit memoranda 12arising on account of the erroneous payment of tax or penalty 13hereunder. In the administration of and compliance with this 14subsection, the Department and persons who are subject to this 15paragraph shall (i) have the same rights, remedies, 16privileges, immunities, powers, and duties, (ii) be subject to 17the same conditions, restrictions, limitations, penalties, 18exclusions, exemptions, and definitions of terms, and (iii) 19employ the same modes of procedure as are prescribed in 20Sections 2 (except that the reference to State in the 21definition of supplier maintaining a place of business in this 22State shall mean the county), 2a, 2b, 2c, 3 through 3-50 (in 23respect to all provisions therein other than the State rate of 24tax), 4 (except that the reference to the State shall be to the 25county), 5, 7, 8 (except that the jurisdiction to which the tax 26shall be a debt to the extent indicated in that Section 8 shall   HB3847- 14 -LRB104 06344 RTM 16380 b1be the county), 9 (except as to the disposition of taxes and 2penalties collected, and except that the retailer's discount 3is not allowed for taxes paid on aviation fuel that are 4deposited into the Local Government Aviation Trust Fund), 10, 511, 12 (except the reference therein to Section 2b of the 6Retailers' Occupation Tax Act), 13 (except that any reference 7to the State shall mean the county), Section 15, 16, 17, 18, 819, and 20 of the Service Occupation Tax Act, and Section 3-7 9of the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act, as fully as if those 10provisions were set forth herein.11    Persons subject to any tax imposed under the authority 12granted in this subsection may reimburse themselves for their 13serviceman's tax liability by separately stating the tax as an 14additional charge, which charge may be stated in combination, 15in a single amount, with State tax that servicemen are 16authorized to collect under the Service Use Tax Act, in 17accordance with such bracket schedules as the Department may 18prescribe.19    Whenever the Department determines that a refund should be 20made under this subsection to a claimant instead of issuing a 21credit memorandum, the Department shall notify the State 22Comptroller, who shall cause the warrant to be drawn for the 23amount specified, and to the person named, in the notification 24from the Department. The refund shall be paid by the State 25Treasurer out of the County Public Safety, Public Facilities, 26Mental Health, Substance Abuse, or Transportation Retailers'   HB3847- 15 -LRB104 06344 RTM 16380 b1Occupation Fund or the Local Government Aviation Trust Fund, 2as appropriate.3    Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize 4the county to impose a tax upon the privilege of engaging in 5any business which under the Constitution of the United States 6may not be made the subject of taxation by the State.7    (b-5) If, on January 1, 2025, a unit of local government 8has in effect a tax under this Section, or if, after January 1, 92025, a unit of local government imposes a tax under this 10Section, then that tax applies to leases of tangible personal 11property in effect, entered into, or renewed on or after that 12date in the same manner as the tax under this Section and in 13accordance with the changes made by this amendatory Act of the 14103rd General Assembly. 15    (c) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the 16Department shall immediately pay over to the State Treasurer, 17ex officio, as trustee, all taxes and penalties collected 18under this Section to be deposited into the County Public 19Safety, Public Facilities, Mental Health, Substance Abuse, or 20Transportation Retailers' Occupation Tax Fund, which shall be 21an unappropriated trust fund held outside of the State 22treasury.

The tax imposed by a 12county under this Section and all civil penalties that may be 13assessed as an incident of the tax shall be collected and 14enforced by the Illinois Department of Revenue and deposited 15into a special fund created for that purpose. The certificate 16of registration that is issued by the Department to a retailer 17under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act shall permit the 18retailer to engage in a business that is taxable without 19registering separately with the Department under an ordinance 20or resolution under this Section. The Department has full 21power to administer and enforce this Section, to collect all 22taxes and penalties due under this Section, to dispose of 23taxes and penalties so collected in the manner provided in 24this Section, and to determine all rights to credit memoranda 25arising on account of the erroneous payment of a tax or penalty 26under this Section. In the administration of and compliance   HB3847- 11 -LRB104 06344 RTM 16380 b1with this Section, the Department and persons who are subject 2to this Section shall (i) have the same rights, remedies, 3privileges, immunities, powers, and duties, (ii) be subject to 4the same conditions, restrictions, limitations, penalties, and 5definitions of terms, and (iii) employ the same modes of 6procedure as are prescribed in Sections 1, 1a, 1a-1, 1d, 1e, 71f, 1i, 1j, 1k, 1m, 1n, 2 through 2-70 (in respect to all 8provisions contained in those Sections other than the State 9rate of tax), 2a, 2b, 2c, 3 (except provisions relating to 10transaction returns and quarter monthly payments, and except 11that the retailer's discount is not allowed for taxes paid on 12aviation fuel that are deposited into the Local Government 13Aviation Trust Fund), 4, 5, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 5e, 5f, 5g, 5h, 5i, 145j, 5k, 5l, 6, 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11a, 12, and 13 15of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act and Section 3-7 of the 16Uniform Penalty and Interest Act as if those provisions were 17set forth in this Section.18    Persons subject to any tax imposed under the authority 19granted in this Section may reimburse themselves for their 20sellers' tax liability by separately stating the tax as an 21additional charge, which charge may be stated in combination, 22in a single amount, with State tax which sellers are required 23to collect under the Use Tax Act, pursuant to such bracketed 24schedules as the Department may prescribe.25    Whenever the Department determines that a refund should be 26made under this Section to a claimant instead of issuing a   HB3847- 12 -LRB104 06344 RTM 16380 b1credit memorandum, the Department shall notify the State 2Comptroller, who shall cause the order to be drawn for the 3amount specified and to the person named in the notification 4from the Department. The refund shall be paid by the State 5Treasurer out of the County Public Safety, Public Facilities, 6Mental Health, Substance Abuse, or Transportation Retailers' 7Occupation Tax Fund or the Local Government Aviation Trust 8Fund, as appropriate. 9    (b) If a tax has been imposed under subsection (a), a 10service occupation tax shall also be imposed at the same rate 11upon all persons engaged, in the county, in the business of 12making sales of service, who, as an incident to making those 13sales of service, transfer tangible personal property within 14the county as an incident to a sale of service. This tax may 15not be imposed on tangible personal property taxed at the 1% 16rate under the Service Occupation Tax Act (or at the 0% rate 17imposed under this amendatory Act of the 102nd General 18Assembly). Beginning December 1, 2019 and through December 31, 192020, this tax is not imposed on sales of aviation fuel unless 20the tax revenue is expended for airport-related purposes. If 21the county does not have an airport-related purpose to which 22it dedicates aviation fuel tax revenue, then aviation fuel is 23excluded from the tax. The county must comply with the 24certification requirements for airport-related purposes under 25Section 2-22 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act. For 26purposes of this Section, "airport-related purposes" has the   HB3847- 13 -LRB104 06344 RTM 16380 b1meaning ascribed in Section 6z-20.2 of the State Finance Act. 2Beginning January 1, 2021, this tax is not imposed on sales of 3aviation fuel for so long as the revenue use requirements of 49 4U.S.C. 47107(b) and 49 U.S.C. 47133 are binding on the county. 5The tax imposed under this subsection and all civil penalties 6that may be assessed as an incident thereof shall be collected 7and enforced by the Department of Revenue.
