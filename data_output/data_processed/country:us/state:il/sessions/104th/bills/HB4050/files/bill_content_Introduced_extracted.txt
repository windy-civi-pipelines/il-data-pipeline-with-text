The Environmental Protection Agency, Illinois Power 17Agency, and Illinois Commerce Commission shall consult PJM 18Interconnection, LLC and Midcontinent Independent System 19Operator, Inc., or their respective successor organizations 20regarding forecasted resource adequacy and reliability needs, 21anticipated new generation interconnection, new transmission 22development or upgrades, and any announced large GHG-emitting 23unit closure dates and include this information in the report. 24The report shall be released publicly by no later than 25December 15 of the year it is prepared. If the Environmental 26Protection Agency, Illinois Power Agency, and Illinois   HB4050- 13 -LRB104 13382 BDA 25711 b1Commerce Commission jointly conclude in the report that the 2data from the regional grid operators, the pace of renewable 3energy development, the pace of development of energy storage 4and demand response utilization, transmission capacity, and 5the CO2e and copollutant emissions reductions required by 6subsection (i) or (k-5) reasonably demonstrate that a resource 7adequacy shortfall will occur, including whether there will be 8sufficient in-state capacity to meet the zonal requirements of 9MISO Zone 4 or the PJM ComEd Zone, per the requirements of the 10regional transmission organizations, or that the regional 11transmission operators determine that a reliability violation 12will occur during the time frame the study is evaluating, then 13the Illinois Power Agency, in conjunction with the 14Environmental Protection Agency shall develop a plan to reduce 15or delay CO2e and copollutant emissions reductions 16requirements only to the extent and for the duration necessary 17to meet the resource adequacy and reliability needs of the 18State, including allowing any plants whose emission reduction 19deadline has been identified in the plan as creating a 20reliability concern to continue operating, including operating 21with reduced emissions or as emergency backup where 22appropriate. The plan shall also consider the use of renewable 23energy, energy storage, demand response, transmission 24development, or other strategies to resolve the identified 25resource adequacy shortfall or reliability violation.26        (1) In developing the plan, the Environmental   HB4050- 14 -LRB104 13382 BDA 25711 b1    Protection Agency and the Illinois Power Agency shall hold 2    at least one workshop open to, and accessible at a time and 3    place convenient to, the public and shall consider any 4    comments made by stakeholders or the public. Upon 5    development of the plan, copies of the plan shall be 6    posted and made publicly available on the Environmental 7    Protection Agency's, the Illinois Power Agency's, and the 8    Illinois Commerce Commission's websites. All interested 9    parties shall have 60 days following the date of posting 10    to provide comment to the Environmental Protection Agency 11    and the Illinois Power Agency on the plan. All comments 12    submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency and the 13    Illinois Power Agency shall be encouraged to be specific, 14    supported by data or other detailed analyses, and, if 15    objecting to all or a portion of the plan, accompanied by 16    specific alternative wording or proposals. All comments 17    shall be posted on the Environmental Protection Agency's, 18    the Illinois Power Agency's, and the Illinois Commerce 19    Commission's websites.

Within 30 days after the 3    expiration of the comment period, the Illinois Commerce 4    Commission shall determine whether an evidentiary hearing 5    is necessary. The Illinois Commerce Commission shall also 6    host 3 public hearings within 90 days after the plan is 7    filed. Following the evidentiary and public hearings, the 8    Illinois Commerce Commission shall enter its order 9    approving or approving with modifications the reliability 10    mitigation plan within 180 days.11        (3) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall only 12    approve the plan if the Illinois Commerce Commission 13    determines that it will resolve the resource adequacy or 14    reliability deficiency identified in the reliability 15    mitigation plan at the least amount of CO2e and copollutant 16    emissions, taking into consideration the emissions impacts 17    on environmental justice communities, and that it will 18    ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and 19    environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest 20    total cost over time, taking into account the impact of 21    increases in emissions.22        (4) If the resource adequacy or reliability deficiency 23    identified in the reliability mitigation plan is resolved 24    or reduced, the Environmental Protection Agency and the 25    Illinois Power Agency may file an amended plan adjusting 26    the reduction or delay in CO2e and copollutant emission   HB4050- 16 -LRB104 13382 BDA 25711 b1    reduction requirements identified in the plan. 2(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 102-1031, eff. 5-27-22.) 3    (415 ILCS 5/3.131 rep.)4    Section 10.

Within 30 days after the 3    expiration of the comment period, the Illinois Commerce 4    Commission shall determine whether an evidentiary hearing 5    is necessary. The Illinois Commerce Commission shall also 6    host 3 public hearings within 90 days after the plan is 7    filed. Following the evidentiary and public hearings, the 8    Illinois Commerce Commission shall enter its order 9    approving or approving with modifications the reliability 10    mitigation plan within 180 days.11        (3) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall only 12    approve the plan if the Illinois Commerce Commission 13    determines that it will resolve the resource adequacy or 14    reliability deficiency identified in the reliability 15    mitigation plan at the least amount of CO2e and copollutant 16    emissions, taking into consideration the emissions impacts 17    on environmental justice communities, and that it will 18    ensure adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and 19    environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest 20    total cost over time, taking into account the impact of 21    increases in emissions.22        (4) If the resource adequacy or reliability deficiency 23    identified in the reliability mitigation plan is resolved 24    or reduced, the Environmental Protection Agency and the 25    Illinois Power Agency may file an amended plan adjusting 26    the reduction or delay in CO2e and copollutant emission   HB4050- 16 -LRB104 13382 BDA 25711 b1    reduction requirements identified in the plan. 2(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21; 102-1031, eff. 5-27-22.) 3    (415 ILCS 5/3.131 rep.)4    Section 10.
