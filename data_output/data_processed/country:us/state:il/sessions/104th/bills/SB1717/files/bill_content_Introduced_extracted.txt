If the nomination papers of any candidate and the 12    statement of economic interests of that candidate are not 13    required to be filed with the same officer, the candidate 14    must file with the officer with whom the nomination papers 15    are filed a receipt from the officer with whom the 16    statement of economic interests is filed showing the date 17    on which such statement was filed. Such receipt shall be 18    so filed not later than the last day on which nomination 19    papers may be filed.20        (9) Except as otherwise provided in this Code, any 21    person for whom a petition for nomination, or for 22    committeeperson or for delegate or alternate delegate to a 23    national nominating convention has been filed may cause 24    his name to be withdrawn by request in writing, signed by 25    him and duly acknowledged before an officer qualified to 26    take acknowledgments of deeds, and filed in the principal   SB1717- 7 -LRB104 10200 SPS 20274 b1    or permanent branch office of the State Board of Elections 2    or with the appropriate election authority or local 3    election official, not later than the date of 4    certification of candidates for the consolidated primary 5    or general primary ballot.

If petitions for nomination have been filed for the 11    same person for 2 or more offices which are incompatible 12    so that the same person could not serve in more than one of 13    such offices if elected, that person must withdraw as a 14    candidate for all but one of such offices within the 5 15    business days following the last day for petition filing. 16    A candidate in a judicial election may file petitions for 17    nomination for only one vacancy in a subcircuit and only 18    one vacancy in a circuit in any one filing period, and if 19    petitions for nomination have been filed for the same 20    person for 2 or more vacancies in the same circuit or 21    subcircuit in the same filing period, his or her name 22    shall be certified only for the first vacancy for which 23    the petitions for nomination were filed.

Whenever a 9    political party's nomination of candidates is uncontested 10    as to one or more, but not all, of the offices to be voted 11    upon by the electors of a township, municipality, or ward 12    thereof, then a primary shall be held for that party in 13    such township, municipality, or ward thereof; provided 14    that the primary ballot shall not include those offices 15    within such township, municipality, or ward thereof, for 16    which the nomination is uncontested. For purposes of this 17    Article, the nomination of an established political party 18    of a candidate for election to an office shall be deemed to 19    be uncontested where not more than the number of persons 20    to be nominated have timely filed valid nomination papers 21    seeking the nomination of such party for election to such 22    office.23        (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other 24    statute, no primary election shall be held for an 25    established political party for any special primary 26    election called for the purpose of filling a vacancy in   SB1717- 9 -LRB104 10200 SPS 20274 b1    the office of representative in the United States Congress 2    where the nomination of such political party for said 3    office is uncontested. For the purposes of this Article, 4    the nomination of an established political party of a 5    candidate for election to said office shall be deemed to 6    be uncontested where not more than the number of persons 7    to be nominated have timely filed valid nomination papers 8    seeking the nomination of such established party for 9    election to said office. This subsection (b) shall not 10    apply if such primary election is conducted on a regularly 11    scheduled election day.12        (c) Notwithstanding the provisions in subparagraph (a) 13    and (b) of this paragraph (10), whenever a person who has 14    not timely filed valid nomination papers and who intends 15    to become a write-in candidate for a political party's 16    nomination for any office for which the nomination is 17    uncontested files a written statement or notice of that 18    intent with the local election official where the 19    candidate is seeking to appear on the ballot, a primary 20    ballot shall be prepared and a primary shall be held for 21    that office. Such statement or notice shall be filed on or 22    before the date established in this Article for certifying 23    candidates for the primary ballot. Such statement or 24    notice shall contain (i) the name and address of the 25    person intending to become a write-in candidate, (ii) a 26    statement that the person is a qualified primary elector   SB1717- 10 -LRB104 10200 SPS 20274 b1    of the political party from whom the nomination is sought, 2    (iii) a statement that the person intends to become a 3    write-in candidate for the party's nomination, and (iv) 4    the office the person is seeking as a write-in candidate. 5    An election authority shall have no duty to conduct a 6    primary and prepare a primary ballot for any office for 7    which the nomination is uncontested unless a statement or 8    notice meeting the requirements of this Section is filed 9    in a timely manner.10        (11) If multiple sets of nomination papers are filed 11    for a candidate to the same office, the State Board of 12    Elections, appropriate election authority or local 13    election official where the petitions are filed shall 14    within 2 business days notify the candidate of his or her 15    multiple petition filings and that the candidate has 3 16    business days after receipt of the notice to notify the 17    State Board of Elections, appropriate election authority 18    or local election official that he or she may cancel prior 19    sets of petitions. If the candidate notifies the State 20    Board of Elections, appropriate election authority or 21    local election official, the last set of petitions filed 22    shall be the only petitions to be considered valid by the 23    State Board of Elections, election authority or local 24    election official. If the candidate fails to notify the 25    State Board of Elections, election authority or local 26    election official then only the first set of petitions   SB1717- 11 -LRB104 10200 SPS 20274 b1    filed shall be valid and all subsequent petitions shall be 2    void.3        (12) All nominating petitions shall be available for 4    public inspection and shall be preserved for a period of 5    not less than 6 months.6        (13) The State Board of Elections and the various 7    election authorities and local election officials with 8    whom such petitions for nomination are filed shall: (i) 9    create a form that is not associated with the Freedom of 10    Information Act for a prospective candidate to request a 11    petition for nomination; (ii) provide a prospective 12    candidate with a petition for nomination within 24 hours 13    after receiving a completed request form; (iii) timestamp 14    when a completed petition for nomination is filed; and 15    (iv) make publicly available a list of filed petitions for 16    nomination that shall be preserved for a period of not 17    less than 6 months. 18(Source: P.A. 102-15, eff. 6-17-21; 102-687, eff. 12-17-21; 19103-586, eff. 5-3-24; 103-600, eff. 7-1-24.)

This subsection (b) shall not 10    apply if such primary election is conducted on a regularly 11    scheduled election day.12        (c) Notwithstanding the provisions in subparagraph (a) 13    and (b) of this paragraph (10), whenever a person who has 14    not timely filed valid nomination papers and who intends 15    to become a write-in candidate for a political party's 16    nomination for any office for which the nomination is 17    uncontested files a written statement or notice of that 18    intent with the local election official where the 19    candidate is seeking to appear on the ballot, a primary 20    ballot shall be prepared and a primary shall be held for 21    that office. Such statement or notice shall be filed on or 22    before the date established in this Article for certifying 23    candidates for the primary ballot. Such statement or 24    notice shall contain (i) the name and address of the 25    person intending to become a write-in candidate, (ii) a 26    statement that the person is a qualified primary elector   SB1717- 10 -LRB104 10200 SPS 20274 b1    of the political party from whom the nomination is sought, 2    (iii) a statement that the person intends to become a 3    write-in candidate for the party's nomination, and (iv) 4    the office the person is seeking as a write-in candidate. 5    An election authority shall have no duty to conduct a 6    primary and prepare a primary ballot for any office for 7    which the nomination is uncontested unless a statement or 8    notice meeting the requirements of this Section is filed 9    in a timely manner.10        (11) If multiple sets of nomination papers are filed 11    for a candidate to the same office, the State Board of 12    Elections, appropriate election authority or local 13    election official where the petitions are filed shall 14    within 2 business days notify the candidate of his or her 15    multiple petition filings and that the candidate has 3 16    business days after receipt of the notice to notify the 17    State Board of Elections, appropriate election authority 18    or local election official that he or she may cancel prior 19    sets of petitions. If the candidate notifies the State 20    Board of Elections, appropriate election authority or 21    local election official, the last set of petitions filed 22    shall be the only petitions to be considered valid by the 23    State Board of Elections, election authority or local 24    election official. If the candidate fails to notify the 25    State Board of Elections, election authority or local 26    election official then only the first set of petitions   SB1717- 11 -LRB104 10200 SPS 20274 b1    filed shall be valid and all subsequent petitions shall be 2    void.3        (12) All nominating petitions shall be available for 4    public inspection and shall be preserved for a period of 5    not less than 6 months.6        (13) The State Board of Elections and the various 7    election authorities and local election officials with 8    whom such petitions for nomination are filed shall: (i) 9    create a form that is not associated with the Freedom of 10    Information Act for a prospective candidate to request a 11    petition for nomination; (ii) provide a prospective 12    candidate with a petition for nomination within 24 hours 13    after receiving a completed request form; (iii) timestamp 14    when a completed petition for nomination is filed; and 15    (iv) make publicly available a list of filed petitions for 16    nomination that shall be preserved for a period of not 17    less than 6 months. 18(Source: P.A. 102-15, eff. 6-17-21; 102-687, eff. 12-17-21; 19103-586, eff. 5-3-24; 103-600, eff. 7-1-24.)
