If no agreement can be reached, then a list of 5 22arbitrators shall be provided by the Department of Insurance 23or the approved entity. From the list of 5 arbitrators, the 24health insurance issuer can veto 2 arbitrators and the 25provider or facility can veto 2 arbitrators. The remaining 26arbitrator shall be the chosen arbitrator.

The arbitrator shall not establish a rebuttable 3presumption that the qualifying payment amount should be the 4total amount owed to the provider or facility by the 5combination of the issuer and the insured, beneficiary, or 6enrollee.

Upon the issuance 16of the arbitrator's decision, Section 368a applies with 17respect to the amount, if any, by which the arbitrator's 18determination exceeds the issuer's initial payment under 19subsection (c), or the entire amount of the arbitrator's 20determination if initial payment was denied. Any interest 21required to be paid to a provider under Section 368a shall not 22accrue until after 30 days of an arbitrator's decision as 23provided in subsection (d), but in no circumstances longer 24than 150 days from the date the nonparticipating 25facility-based provider billed for services rendered.26    (h) Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to change   10400HB2785sam002- 21 -LRB104 07806 BAB 26841 a1the prudent layperson provisions with respect to emergency 2services under the Managed Care Reform and Patient Rights Act. 3    (i) Nothing in this Section shall preclude a health care 4provider from billing a beneficiary, insured, or enrollee for 5reasonable administrative fees, such as service fees for 6checks returned for nonsufficient funds and missed 7appointments.8    (j) Nothing in this Section shall preclude a beneficiary, 9insured, or enrollee from assigning benefits to a 10nonparticipating provider when the notice and consent criteria 11are satisfied under paragraph (2) of subsection (b-5) or in 12any other situation not described in subsection (b) or (b-5).13    (k) Except when the notice and consent criteria are 14satisfied under paragraph (2) of subsection (b-5), if an 15individual receives health care services under the situations 16described in subsection (b) or (b-5), no referral requirement 17or any other provision contained in the policy or certificate 18of coverage shall deny coverage, reduce benefits, or otherwise 19defeat the requirements of this Section for services that 20would have been covered with a participating provider. 21However, this subsection shall not be construed to preclude a 22provider contract with a health insurance issuer, or with an 23administrator or similar entity acting on the issuer's behalf, 24from imposing requirements on the participating provider, 25participating emergency facility, or participating health care 26facility relating to the referral of covered individuals to   10400HB2785sam002- 22 -LRB104 07806 BAB 26841 a1nonparticipating providers.2    (l) Except if the notice and consent criteria are 3satisfied under paragraph (2) of subsection (b-5), 4cost-sharing amounts calculated in conformity with this 5Section shall count toward any deductible or out-of-pocket 6maximum applicable to in-network coverage.7    (m) The Department has the authority to enforce the 8requirements of this Section in the situations described in 9subsections (b) and (b-5), and in any other situation for 10which 42 U.S.C. Chapter 6A, Subchapter XXV, Parts D or E and 11regulations promulgated thereunder would prohibit an 12individual from being billed or liable for emergency services 13furnished by a nonparticipating provider or nonparticipating 14emergency facility or for non-emergency health care services 15furnished by a nonparticipating provider at a participating 16health care facility.17    (n) This Section does not apply with respect to air 18ambulance or ground ambulance services.
