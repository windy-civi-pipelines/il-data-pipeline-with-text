The Children and Family Services Act is amended 5by adding Section 46 as follows: 6    (20 ILCS 505/46 new)7    Sec. 46. Office of Alumni Support; Former Youth in Care 8Crisis Support Services Program. 9    (a) Legislative findings and intent. The General Assembly 10finds that:11        (1) Youth in care experience multiple traumas prior to 12    exiting care. They suffer abuse, neglect, or abandonment 13    causing them to be placed in care, trauma from being 14    removed from their families and communities, and many 15    suffer additional trauma while in care, including multiple 16    placement changes, delayed access to necessary treatment, 17    and maltreatment while in care.18        (2) Research has shown that former youth in care 19    statistically have worse outcomes than their peers in the 20    general population across a broad range of measures of 21    well-being, including housing, employment, and education. 22    These outcomes lead to homelessness, unemployment, 23    incarceration, and psychiatric hospitalization, causing   SB1508- 2 -LRB104 05807 KTG 15838 b1    former youth in care to utilize costly State-funded 2    programs and social supports at higher rates than their 3    peers.4        (3) According to U.S. Census Data from 2023, 5    approximately 57% of men and 54% of women ages 18 to 24 6    live in their family home with their parents. For former 7    youth in care who were removed from their families, living 8    with their parents is often not an available or stable 9    option. When youth exit care, they are expected to live 10    entirely independent from not only financial support from 11    the State, but also from the guidance, encouragement, role 12    modeling, and mentoring that they received from 13    caseworkers, foster parents, child care staff, and other 14    adults during their time in care.15        (4) Evidence-based programs have shown that assistance 16    and support provided to former youth in care can improve 17    outcomes in target areas, including leading to increases 18    in employment and earnings, increased housing stability, 19    increased economic well-being, and significant impacts on 20    health and safety outcomes for the youth.21        (5) It is the intent of the General Assembly to direct 22    the Department of Children of Family Services to create, 23    with the guidance, direction, and involvement of current 24    and former youth in care, an Office of Alumni Support to 25    provide assistance and support to former youth in care by 26    (i) helping former youth in care navigate existing   SB1508- 3 -LRB104 05807 KTG 15838 b1    supports, (ii) determining what additional supports would 2    be beneficial to former youth in care, including 3    researching existing evidence-based and evidence-informed 4    practice models of providing assistance to alumni of the 5    child welfare system, and (iii) implementing any 6    additional supports to improve outcomes for former youth 7    in care.8    (b) Office of Alumni Support. No later than July 1, 2026, 9the Department shall establish the Office of Alumni Support to 10provide assistance, guidance, and support to any former youth 11in care needing or requesting assistance, guidance, or 12support.13    (c) The Office of Alumni Support shall link former youth 14in care to existing supports, determine what additional 15supports are necessary to improve outcomes for former youth in 16care based upon identified needs, including researching 17existing evidence-based and evidence-informed practice models 18of providing assistance to former youth in care, and implement 19necessary changes to provide the additional supports.
