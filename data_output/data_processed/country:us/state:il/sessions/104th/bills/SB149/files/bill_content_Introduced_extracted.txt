If the victim or 3        the victim's attorney was not allowed to be heard at 4        the hearing regarding the prosecuting attorney's 5        motion, and the court denies the prosecuting 6        attorney's assertion of the right or denies the 7        request for enforcement of a right, the victim or 8        victim's attorney may file a motion to assert the 9        victim's right or to request enforcement of the right 10        within 10 days of the court's ruling. The motion need 11        not demonstrate the grounds for a motion for 12        reconsideration. The court shall rule on the merits of 13        the motion.14            (D) The court shall take up and decide any motion 15        or request asserting or seeking enforcement of a 16        victim's right without delay, unless a specific time 17        period is specified by law or court rule.

For complaints or motions filed by 20        or on behalf of the victim, the clerk of court shall 21        waive filing fees that would otherwise be owed by the 22        victim for any court filing with the purpose of 23        enforcing crime victims' rights.

Remedies may include, 22        but are not limited to: injunctive relief requiring 23        the victim's right to be afforded; declaratory 24        judgment recognizing or clarifying the victim's 25        rights; a writ of mandamus; and may include reopening 26        previously held proceedings; however, in no event   SB0149- 18 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        shall the court vacate a conviction.

The court shall rule on the motion within 21    30 days. If the motion is granted, the court shall set 22    forth on the record the facts that support its finding 23    that the victim's testimony will be materially affected if 24    the victim hears other testimony at trial.25        (8) Right to have advocate and support person present 26    at court proceedings.  SB0149- 19 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1            (A) A party who intends to call an advocate as a 2        witness at trial must seek permission of the court 3        before the subpoena is issued.

The court 10        shall consider the motion and make findings within 30 11        days of the filing of the motion. If the court finds by 12        a preponderance of the evidence that: (i) the 13        anticipated testimony is not protected by an absolute 14        privilege; and (ii) the anticipated testimony contains 15        relevant, admissible, and material evidence that is 16        not available through other witnesses or evidence, the 17        court shall issue a subpoena requiring the advocate to 18        appear to testify at an in camera hearing. The 19        prosecuting attorney and the victim shall have 15 days 20        to seek appellate review before the advocate is 21        required to testify at an ex parte in camera 22        proceeding. 23            The prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the 24        advocate's attorney shall be allowed to be present at 25        the ex parte in camera proceeding. If, after 26        conducting the ex parte in camera hearing, the court   SB0149- 20 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        determines that due process requires any testimony 2        regarding confidential or privileged information or 3        communications, the court shall provide to the 4        prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the advocate's 5        attorney a written memorandum on the substance of the 6        advocate's testimony. The prosecuting attorney, the 7        victim, and the advocate's attorney shall have 15 days 8        to seek appellate review before a subpoena may be 9        issued for the advocate to testify at trial. The 10        presence of the prosecuting attorney at the ex parte 11        in camera proceeding does not make the substance of 12        the advocate's testimony that the court has ruled 13        inadmissible subject to discovery.14            (B) If a victim has asserted the right to have a 15        support person present at the court proceedings, the 16        victim shall provide the name of the person the victim 17        has chosen to be the victim's support person to the 18        prosecuting attorney, within 60 days of trial. The 19        prosecuting attorney shall provide the name to the 20        defendant. If the defendant intends to call the 21        support person as a witness at trial, the defendant 22        must seek permission of the court before a subpoena is 23        issued. The defendant must file a written motion at 24        least 45 days prior to trial that sets forth 25        specifically the issues on which the support person 26        will testify and an offer of proof regarding: (i) the   SB0149- 21 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        content of the anticipated testimony of the support 2        person; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 3        materiality of the anticipated testimony.4            If the prosecuting attorney intends to call the 5        support person as a witness during the State's 6        case-in-chief, the prosecuting attorney shall inform 7        the court of this intent in the response to the 8        defendant's written motion. The victim may choose a 9        different person to be the victim's support person. 10        The court may allow the defendant to inquire about 11        matters outside the scope of the direct examination 12        during cross-examination. If the court allows the 13        defendant to do so, the support person shall be 14        allowed to remain in the courtroom after the support 15        person has testified. A defendant who fails to 16        question the support person about matters outside the 17        scope of direct examination during the State's 18        case-in-chief waives the right to challenge the 19        presence of the support person on appeal. The court 20        shall allow the support person to testify if called as 21        a witness in the defendant's case-in-chief or the 22        State's rebuttal.23            If the court does not allow the defendant to 24        inquire about matters outside the scope of the direct 25        examination, the support person shall be allowed to 26        remain in the courtroom after the support person has   SB0149- 22 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        been called by the defendant or the defendant has 2        rested. The court shall allow the support person to 3        testify in the State's rebuttal.4            If the prosecuting attorney does not intend to 5        call the support person in the State's case-in-chief, 6        the court shall verify with the support person whether 7        the support person, if called as a witness, would 8        testify as set forth in the offer of proof. If the 9        court finds that the support person would testify as 10        set forth in the offer of proof, the court shall rule 11        on the relevance, materiality, and admissibility of 12        the anticipated testimony. If the court rules the 13        anticipated testimony is admissible, the court shall 14        issue the subpoena. The support person may remain in 15        the courtroom after the support person testifies and 16        shall be allowed to testify in rebuttal.17            If the court excludes the victim's support person 18        during the State's case-in-chief, the victim shall be 19        allowed to choose another support person to be present 20        in court. 21            If the victim fails to designate a support person 22        within 60 days of trial and the defendant has 23        subpoenaed the support person to testify at trial, the 24        court may exclude the support person from the trial 25        until the support person testifies. If the court 26        excludes the support person the victim may choose   SB0149- 23 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        another person as a support person. 2        (9) Right to notice and hearing before disclosure of 3    confidential or privileged information or records.4            (A) A defendant who seeks to subpoena testimony or 5        records of or concerning the victim that are 6        confidential or privileged by law must seek permission 7        of the court before the subpoena is issued. The 8        defendant must file a written motion and an offer of 9        proof regarding the relevance, admissibility and 10        materiality of the testimony or records. If the court 11        finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:12                (i) the testimony or records are not protected 13            by an absolute privilege and14                (ii) the testimony or records contain 15            relevant, admissible, and material evidence that 16            is not available through other witnesses or 17            evidence, the court shall issue a subpoena 18            requiring the witness to appear in camera or a 19            sealed copy of the records be delivered to the 20            court to be reviewed in camera. If, after 21            conducting an in camera review of the witness 22            statement or records, the court determines that 23            due process requires disclosure of any potential 24            testimony or any portion of the records, the court 25            shall provide copies of the records that it 26            intends to disclose to the prosecuting attorney   SB0149- 24 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1            and the victim. The prosecuting attorney and the 2            victim shall have 30 days to seek appellate review 3            before the records are disclosed to the defendant, 4            used in any court proceeding, or disclosed to 5            anyone or in any way that would subject the 6            testimony or records to public review. The 7            disclosure of copies of any portion of the 8            testimony or records to the prosecuting attorney 9            under this Section does not make the records 10            subject to discovery or required to be provided to 11            the defendant.12            (B) A prosecuting attorney who seeks to subpoena 13        information or records concerning the victim that are 14        confidential or privileged by law must first request 15        the written consent of the crime victim. If the victim 16        does not provide such written consent, including where 17        necessary the appropriate signed document required for 18        waiving privilege, the prosecuting attorney must serve 19        the subpoena at least 21 days prior to the date a 20        response or appearance is required to allow the 21        subject of the subpoena time to file a motion to quash 22        or request a hearing. The prosecuting attorney must 23        also send a written notice to the victim at least 21 24        days prior to the response date to allow the victim to 25        file a motion or request a hearing. The notice to the 26        victim shall inform the victim (i) that a subpoena has   SB0149- 25 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        been issued for confidential information or records 2        concerning the victim, (ii) that the victim has the 3        right to request a hearing prior to the response date 4        of the subpoena, and (iii) how to request the hearing. 5        The notice to the victim shall also include a copy of 6        the subpoena. If requested, a hearing regarding the 7        subpoena shall occur before information or records are 8        provided to the prosecuting attorney. 9        (10) Right to notice of court proceedings. If the 10    victim is not present at a court proceeding in which a 11    right of the victim is at issue, the court shall ask the 12    prosecuting attorney whether the victim was notified of 13    the time, place, and purpose of the court proceeding and 14    that the victim had a right to be heard at the court 15    proceeding. If the court determines that timely notice was 16    not given or that the victim was not adequately informed 17    of the nature of the court proceeding, the court shall not 18    rule on any substantive issues, accept a plea, or impose a 19    sentence and shall continue the hearing for the time 20    necessary to notify the victim of the time, place and 21    nature of the court proceeding. The time between court 22    proceedings shall not be attributable to the State under 23    Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.24        (11) Right to timely disposition of the case. A victim 25    has the right to timely disposition of the case so as to 26    minimize the stress, cost, and inconvenience resulting   SB0149- 26 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1    from the victim's involvement in the case. Before ruling 2    on a motion to continue trial or other court proceeding, 3    the court shall inquire into the circumstances for the 4    request for the delay and, if the victim has provided 5    written notice of the assertion of the right to a timely 6    disposition, and whether the victim objects to the delay. 7    If the victim objects, the prosecutor shall inform the 8    court of the victim's objections. If the prosecutor has 9    not conferred with the victim about the continuance, the 10    prosecutor shall inform the court of the attempts to 11    confer. If the court finds the attempts of the prosecutor 12    to confer with the victim were inadequate to protect the 13    victim's right to be heard, the court shall give the 14    prosecutor at least 3 but not more than 5 business days to 15    confer with the victim. In ruling on a motion to continue, 16    the court shall consider the reasons for the requested 17    continuance, the number and length of continuances that 18    have been granted, the victim's objections and procedures 19    to avoid further delays. If a continuance is granted over 20    the victim's objection, the court shall specify on the 21    record the reasons for the continuance and the procedures 22    that have been or will be taken to avoid further delays.23        (12) Right to Restitution.24            (A) If the victim has asserted the right to 25        restitution and the amount of restitution is known at 26        the time of sentencing, the court shall enter the   SB0149- 27 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        judgment of restitution at the time of sentencing. 2            (B) If the victim has asserted the right to 3        restitution and the amount of restitution is not known 4        at the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall, 5        within 5 days after sentencing, notify the victim what 6        information and documentation related to restitution 7        is needed and that the information and documentation 8        must be provided to the prosecutor within 45 days 9        after sentencing. Failure to timely provide 10        information and documentation related to restitution 11        shall be deemed a waiver of the right to restitution. 12        The prosecutor shall file and serve within 60 days 13        after sentencing a proposed judgment for restitution 14        and a notice that includes information concerning the 15        identity of any victims or other persons seeking 16        restitution, whether any victim or other person 17        expressly declines restitution, the nature and amount 18        of any damages together with any supporting 19        documentation, a restitution amount recommendation, 20        and the names of any co-defendants and their case 21        numbers. Within 30 days after receipt of the proposed 22        judgment for restitution, the defendant shall file any 23        objection to the proposed judgment, a statement of 24        grounds for the objection, and a financial statement. 25        If the defendant does not file an objection, the court 26        may enter the judgment for restitution without further   SB0149- 28 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        proceedings. If the defendant files an objection and 2        either party requests a hearing, the court shall 3        schedule a hearing. 4        (13) Access to presentence reports.5            (A) The victim may request a copy of the 6        presentence report prepared under the Unified Code of 7        Corrections from the State's Attorney. The State's 8        Attorney shall redact the following information before 9        providing a copy of the report:10                (i) the defendant's mental history and 11            condition;12                (ii) any evaluation prepared under subsection 13            (b) or (b-5) of Section 5-3-2; and14                (iii) the name, address, phone number, and 15            other personal information about any other victim.16            (B) The State's Attorney or the defendant may 17        request the court redact other information in the 18        report that may endanger the safety of any person.19            (C) The State's Attorney may orally disclose to 20        the victim any of the information that has been 21        redacted if there is a reasonable likelihood that the 22        information will be stated in court at the sentencing.23            (D) The State's Attorney must advise the victim 24        that the victim must maintain the confidentiality of 25        the report and other information. Any dissemination of 26        the report or information that was not stated at a   SB0149- 29 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        court proceeding constitutes indirect criminal 2        contempt of court. 3        (14) Appellate relief. If the trial court denies the 4    relief requested, the victim, the victim's attorney, or 5    the prosecuting attorney may file an appeal within 30 days 6    of the trial court's ruling. The trial or appellate court 7    may stay the court proceedings if the court finds that a 8    stay would not violate a constitutional right of the 9    defendant. If the appellate court denies the relief 10    sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated 11    in a written opinion. In any appeal in a criminal case, the 12    State may assert as error the court's denial of any crime 13    victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal 14    relates.15        (15) Limitation on appellate relief. In no case shall 16    an appellate court provide a new trial to remedy the 17    violation of a victim's right. 18        (16) The right to be reasonably protected from the 19    accused throughout the criminal justice process and the 20    right to have the safety of the victim and the victim's 21    family considered in determining whether to release the 22    defendant, and setting conditions of release after arrest 23    and conviction. A victim of domestic violence, a sexual 24    offense, or stalking may request the entry of a protective 25    order under Article 112A of the Code of Criminal Procedure 26    of 1963.   SB0149- 30 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        (17) Right to discovery information upon request for 2    protection and civil litigation preparation.3            (A) In addition to the rights afforded to victims 4        under Section 8.1 of Article I of the Illinois 5        Constitution, victims of crimes shall have the right 6        to request and receive, upon request, discovery 7        information that is directly relevant to the criminal 8        case and pertinent to the victim's involvement in the 9        case. This access is provided to aid victims in 10        protecting themselves from future harm and to assist 11        in their preparation for potential civil litigation.12            (B) Discovery information includes, but Is not 13        limited to:14                (i) all reports generated by law enforcement 15            agencies related to the investigation of the 16            crime;17                (ii) cellular data, including, but not limited 18            to, text messages, phone call records, and other 19            communications that are directly relevant to the 20            crime and victim; and21                (iii) all communications, including emails, 22            text messages, social media exchanges, and other 23            forms of communication that involve the victim and 24            any parties related to the case, including 25            defendants, co-defendants, witnesses, law 26            enforcement, or attorneys.  SB0149- 31 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1            (C) Certain sensitive materials, such as 2        confidential law enforcement methods, protected 3        witness statements, and materials related to minors 4        may be withheld if disclosure would jeopardize the 5        investigation or the safety of others.6            (D) Victims shall be provided with the requested 7        discovery information within a reasonable period, but 8        no later than 30 days following the submission of the 9        request, unless a court orders a delay or exemption 10        for just cause.11            (E) Law enforcement and the office of the 12        prosecuting attorney must provide written notice to 13        victims informing them of their rights to access 14        relevant discovery materials within 10 days of the 15        filing of charges.16            (F) Victims who request discovery materials shall 17        be offered assistance from victim advocates or legal 18        aid services to help them understand and interpret the 19        materials provided.20            (G) The disclosure of discovery materials must be 21        done in a manner that safeguards the victim's personal 22        safety and privacy, especially in cases in which there 23        is a known risk of further harm or retaliation by the 24        defendant or others involved in the case.25            (H) Discovery materials disclosed under this 26        paragraph (17) may only be used for the purpose of   SB0149- 32 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        understanding the criminal case and preparing for 2        potential civil litigation. The information may not be 3        disclosed to third parties or used for any purpose 4        unrelated to the criminal proceedings or related civil 5        litigation.6            (I) Failure of law enforcement or the office of 7        the prosecuting attorney to comply with the disclosure 8        of discovery materials within the required time frame 9        may result in a civil penalty of up to $50,000, or 10        disciplinary action, or both, as determined by the 11        appropriate oversight body. 12    (d) Procedures after the imposition of sentence.13        (1) The Prisoner Review Board shall inform a victim or 14    any other concerned citizen, upon written request, of the 15    prisoner's release on parole, mandatory supervised 16    release, electronic detention, work release, international 17    transfer or exchange, or by the custodian, other than the 18    Department of Juvenile Justice, of the discharge of any 19    individual who was adjudicated a delinquent for a crime 20    from State custody and by the sheriff of the appropriate 21    county of any such person's final discharge from county 22    custody.

For complaints or motions filed by 20        or on behalf of the victim, the clerk of court shall 21        waive filing fees that would otherwise be owed by the 22        victim for any court filing with the purpose of 23        enforcing crime victims' rights.

Remedies may include, 22        but are not limited to: injunctive relief requiring 23        the victim's right to be afforded; declaratory 24        judgment recognizing or clarifying the victim's 25        rights; a writ of mandamus; and may include reopening 26        previously held proceedings; however, in no event   SB0149- 18 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        shall the court vacate a conviction.

The court shall rule on the motion within 21    30 days. If the motion is granted, the court shall set 22    forth on the record the facts that support its finding 23    that the victim's testimony will be materially affected if 24    the victim hears other testimony at trial.25        (8) Right to have advocate and support person present 26    at court proceedings.  SB0149- 19 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1            (A) A party who intends to call an advocate as a 2        witness at trial must seek permission of the court 3        before the subpoena is issued.

If the court finds by 12        a preponderance of the evidence that: (i) the 13        anticipated testimony is not protected by an absolute 14        privilege; and (ii) the anticipated testimony contains 15        relevant, admissible, and material evidence that is 16        not available through other witnesses or evidence, the 17        court shall issue a subpoena requiring the advocate to 18        appear to testify at an in camera hearing. The 19        prosecuting attorney and the victim shall have 15 days 20        to seek appellate review before the advocate is 21        required to testify at an ex parte in camera 22        proceeding. 23            The prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the 24        advocate's attorney shall be allowed to be present at 25        the ex parte in camera proceeding. If, after 26        conducting the ex parte in camera hearing, the court   SB0149- 20 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        determines that due process requires any testimony 2        regarding confidential or privileged information or 3        communications, the court shall provide to the 4        prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the advocate's 5        attorney a written memorandum on the substance of the 6        advocate's testimony. The prosecuting attorney, the 7        victim, and the advocate's attorney shall have 15 days 8        to seek appellate review before a subpoena may be 9        issued for the advocate to testify at trial. The 10        presence of the prosecuting attorney at the ex parte 11        in camera proceeding does not make the substance of 12        the advocate's testimony that the court has ruled 13        inadmissible subject to discovery.14            (B) If a victim has asserted the right to have a 15        support person present at the court proceedings, the 16        victim shall provide the name of the person the victim 17        has chosen to be the victim's support person to the 18        prosecuting attorney, within 60 days of trial. The 19        prosecuting attorney shall provide the name to the 20        defendant. If the defendant intends to call the 21        support person as a witness at trial, the defendant 22        must seek permission of the court before a subpoena is 23        issued. The defendant must file a written motion at 24        least 45 days prior to trial that sets forth 25        specifically the issues on which the support person 26        will testify and an offer of proof regarding: (i) the   SB0149- 21 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        content of the anticipated testimony of the support 2        person; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 3        materiality of the anticipated testimony.4            If the prosecuting attorney intends to call the 5        support person as a witness during the State's 6        case-in-chief, the prosecuting attorney shall inform 7        the court of this intent in the response to the 8        defendant's written motion. The victim may choose a 9        different person to be the victim's support person. 10        The court may allow the defendant to inquire about 11        matters outside the scope of the direct examination 12        during cross-examination. If the court allows the 13        defendant to do so, the support person shall be 14        allowed to remain in the courtroom after the support 15        person has testified. A defendant who fails to 16        question the support person about matters outside the 17        scope of direct examination during the State's 18        case-in-chief waives the right to challenge the 19        presence of the support person on appeal. The court 20        shall allow the support person to testify if called as 21        a witness in the defendant's case-in-chief or the 22        State's rebuttal.23            If the court does not allow the defendant to 24        inquire about matters outside the scope of the direct 25        examination, the support person shall be allowed to 26        remain in the courtroom after the support person has   SB0149- 22 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        been called by the defendant or the defendant has 2        rested. The court shall allow the support person to 3        testify in the State's rebuttal.4            If the prosecuting attorney does not intend to 5        call the support person in the State's case-in-chief, 6        the court shall verify with the support person whether 7        the support person, if called as a witness, would 8        testify as set forth in the offer of proof. If the 9        court finds that the support person would testify as 10        set forth in the offer of proof, the court shall rule 11        on the relevance, materiality, and admissibility of 12        the anticipated testimony. If the court rules the 13        anticipated testimony is admissible, the court shall 14        issue the subpoena. The support person may remain in 15        the courtroom after the support person testifies and 16        shall be allowed to testify in rebuttal.17            If the court excludes the victim's support person 18        during the State's case-in-chief, the victim shall be 19        allowed to choose another support person to be present 20        in court. 21            If the victim fails to designate a support person 22        within 60 days of trial and the defendant has 23        subpoenaed the support person to testify at trial, the 24        court may exclude the support person from the trial 25        until the support person testifies. If the court 26        excludes the support person the victim may choose   SB0149- 23 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        another person as a support person. 2        (9) Right to notice and hearing before disclosure of 3    confidential or privileged information or records.4            (A) A defendant who seeks to subpoena testimony or 5        records of or concerning the victim that are 6        confidential or privileged by law must seek permission 7        of the court before the subpoena is issued. The 8        defendant must file a written motion and an offer of 9        proof regarding the relevance, admissibility and 10        materiality of the testimony or records. If the court 11        finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:12                (i) the testimony or records are not protected 13            by an absolute privilege and14                (ii) the testimony or records contain 15            relevant, admissible, and material evidence that 16            is not available through other witnesses or 17            evidence, the court shall issue a subpoena 18            requiring the witness to appear in camera or a 19            sealed copy of the records be delivered to the 20            court to be reviewed in camera. If, after 21            conducting an in camera review of the witness 22            statement or records, the court determines that 23            due process requires disclosure of any potential 24            testimony or any portion of the records, the court 25            shall provide copies of the records that it 26            intends to disclose to the prosecuting attorney   SB0149- 24 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1            and the victim. The prosecuting attorney and the 2            victim shall have 30 days to seek appellate review 3            before the records are disclosed to the defendant, 4            used in any court proceeding, or disclosed to 5            anyone or in any way that would subject the 6            testimony or records to public review. The 7            disclosure of copies of any portion of the 8            testimony or records to the prosecuting attorney 9            under this Section does not make the records 10            subject to discovery or required to be provided to 11            the defendant.12            (B) A prosecuting attorney who seeks to subpoena 13        information or records concerning the victim that are 14        confidential or privileged by law must first request 15        the written consent of the crime victim. If the victim 16        does not provide such written consent, including where 17        necessary the appropriate signed document required for 18        waiving privilege, the prosecuting attorney must serve 19        the subpoena at least 21 days prior to the date a 20        response or appearance is required to allow the 21        subject of the subpoena time to file a motion to quash 22        or request a hearing. The prosecuting attorney must 23        also send a written notice to the victim at least 21 24        days prior to the response date to allow the victim to 25        file a motion or request a hearing. The notice to the 26        victim shall inform the victim (i) that a subpoena has   SB0149- 25 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        been issued for confidential information or records 2        concerning the victim, (ii) that the victim has the 3        right to request a hearing prior to the response date 4        of the subpoena, and (iii) how to request the hearing. 5        The notice to the victim shall also include a copy of 6        the subpoena. If requested, a hearing regarding the 7        subpoena shall occur before information or records are 8        provided to the prosecuting attorney. 9        (10) Right to notice of court proceedings. If the 10    victim is not present at a court proceeding in which a 11    right of the victim is at issue, the court shall ask the 12    prosecuting attorney whether the victim was notified of 13    the time, place, and purpose of the court proceeding and 14    that the victim had a right to be heard at the court 15    proceeding. If the court determines that timely notice was 16    not given or that the victim was not adequately informed 17    of the nature of the court proceeding, the court shall not 18    rule on any substantive issues, accept a plea, or impose a 19    sentence and shall continue the hearing for the time 20    necessary to notify the victim of the time, place and 21    nature of the court proceeding. The time between court 22    proceedings shall not be attributable to the State under 23    Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.24        (11) Right to timely disposition of the case. A victim 25    has the right to timely disposition of the case so as to 26    minimize the stress, cost, and inconvenience resulting   SB0149- 26 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1    from the victim's involvement in the case. Before ruling 2    on a motion to continue trial or other court proceeding, 3    the court shall inquire into the circumstances for the 4    request for the delay and, if the victim has provided 5    written notice of the assertion of the right to a timely 6    disposition, and whether the victim objects to the delay. 7    If the victim objects, the prosecutor shall inform the 8    court of the victim's objections. If the prosecutor has 9    not conferred with the victim about the continuance, the 10    prosecutor shall inform the court of the attempts to 11    confer. If the court finds the attempts of the prosecutor 12    to confer with the victim were inadequate to protect the 13    victim's right to be heard, the court shall give the 14    prosecutor at least 3 but not more than 5 business days to 15    confer with the victim. In ruling on a motion to continue, 16    the court shall consider the reasons for the requested 17    continuance, the number and length of continuances that 18    have been granted, the victim's objections and procedures 19    to avoid further delays. If a continuance is granted over 20    the victim's objection, the court shall specify on the 21    record the reasons for the continuance and the procedures 22    that have been or will be taken to avoid further delays.23        (12) Right to Restitution.24            (A) If the victim has asserted the right to 25        restitution and the amount of restitution is known at 26        the time of sentencing, the court shall enter the   SB0149- 27 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        judgment of restitution at the time of sentencing. 2            (B) If the victim has asserted the right to 3        restitution and the amount of restitution is not known 4        at the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall, 5        within 5 days after sentencing, notify the victim what 6        information and documentation related to restitution 7        is needed and that the information and documentation 8        must be provided to the prosecutor within 45 days 9        after sentencing. Failure to timely provide 10        information and documentation related to restitution 11        shall be deemed a waiver of the right to restitution. 12        The prosecutor shall file and serve within 60 days 13        after sentencing a proposed judgment for restitution 14        and a notice that includes information concerning the 15        identity of any victims or other persons seeking 16        restitution, whether any victim or other person 17        expressly declines restitution, the nature and amount 18        of any damages together with any supporting 19        documentation, a restitution amount recommendation, 20        and the names of any co-defendants and their case 21        numbers. Within 30 days after receipt of the proposed 22        judgment for restitution, the defendant shall file any 23        objection to the proposed judgment, a statement of 24        grounds for the objection, and a financial statement. 25        If the defendant does not file an objection, the court 26        may enter the judgment for restitution without further   SB0149- 28 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        proceedings. If the defendant files an objection and 2        either party requests a hearing, the court shall 3        schedule a hearing. 4        (13) Access to presentence reports.5            (A) The victim may request a copy of the 6        presentence report prepared under the Unified Code of 7        Corrections from the State's Attorney. The State's 8        Attorney shall redact the following information before 9        providing a copy of the report:10                (i) the defendant's mental history and 11            condition;12                (ii) any evaluation prepared under subsection 13            (b) or (b-5) of Section 5-3-2; and14                (iii) the name, address, phone number, and 15            other personal information about any other victim.16            (B) The State's Attorney or the defendant may 17        request the court redact other information in the 18        report that may endanger the safety of any person.19            (C) The State's Attorney may orally disclose to 20        the victim any of the information that has been 21        redacted if there is a reasonable likelihood that the 22        information will be stated in court at the sentencing.23            (D) The State's Attorney must advise the victim 24        that the victim must maintain the confidentiality of 25        the report and other information. Any dissemination of 26        the report or information that was not stated at a   SB0149- 29 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        court proceeding constitutes indirect criminal 2        contempt of court. 3        (14) Appellate relief. If the trial court denies the 4    relief requested, the victim, the victim's attorney, or 5    the prosecuting attorney may file an appeal within 30 days 6    of the trial court's ruling. The trial or appellate court 7    may stay the court proceedings if the court finds that a 8    stay would not violate a constitutional right of the 9    defendant. If the appellate court denies the relief 10    sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated 11    in a written opinion. In any appeal in a criminal case, the 12    State may assert as error the court's denial of any crime 13    victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal 14    relates.15        (15) Limitation on appellate relief. In no case shall 16    an appellate court provide a new trial to remedy the 17    violation of a victim's right. 18        (16) The right to be reasonably protected from the 19    accused throughout the criminal justice process and the 20    right to have the safety of the victim and the victim's 21    family considered in determining whether to release the 22    defendant, and setting conditions of release after arrest 23    and conviction. A victim of domestic violence, a sexual 24    offense, or stalking may request the entry of a protective 25    order under Article 112A of the Code of Criminal Procedure 26    of 1963.   SB0149- 30 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        (17) Right to discovery information upon request for 2    protection and civil litigation preparation.3            (A) In addition to the rights afforded to victims 4        under Section 8.1 of Article I of the Illinois 5        Constitution, victims of crimes shall have the right 6        to request and receive, upon request, discovery 7        information that is directly relevant to the criminal 8        case and pertinent to the victim's involvement in the 9        case. This access is provided to aid victims in 10        protecting themselves from future harm and to assist 11        in their preparation for potential civil litigation.12            (B) Discovery information includes, but Is not 13        limited to:14                (i) all reports generated by law enforcement 15            agencies related to the investigation of the 16            crime;17                (ii) cellular data, including, but not limited 18            to, text messages, phone call records, and other 19            communications that are directly relevant to the 20            crime and victim; and21                (iii) all communications, including emails, 22            text messages, social media exchanges, and other 23            forms of communication that involve the victim and 24            any parties related to the case, including 25            defendants, co-defendants, witnesses, law 26            enforcement, or attorneys.  SB0149- 31 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1            (C) Certain sensitive materials, such as 2        confidential law enforcement methods, protected 3        witness statements, and materials related to minors 4        may be withheld if disclosure would jeopardize the 5        investigation or the safety of others.6            (D) Victims shall be provided with the requested 7        discovery information within a reasonable period, but 8        no later than 30 days following the submission of the 9        request, unless a court orders a delay or exemption 10        for just cause.11            (E) Law enforcement and the office of the 12        prosecuting attorney must provide written notice to 13        victims informing them of their rights to access 14        relevant discovery materials within 10 days of the 15        filing of charges.16            (F) Victims who request discovery materials shall 17        be offered assistance from victim advocates or legal 18        aid services to help them understand and interpret the 19        materials provided.20            (G) The disclosure of discovery materials must be 21        done in a manner that safeguards the victim's personal 22        safety and privacy, especially in cases in which there 23        is a known risk of further harm or retaliation by the 24        defendant or others involved in the case.25            (H) Discovery materials disclosed under this 26        paragraph (17) may only be used for the purpose of   SB0149- 32 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1        understanding the criminal case and preparing for 2        potential civil litigation. The information may not be 3        disclosed to third parties or used for any purpose 4        unrelated to the criminal proceedings or related civil 5        litigation.6            (I) Failure of law enforcement or the office of 7        the prosecuting attorney to comply with the disclosure 8        of discovery materials within the required time frame 9        may result in a civil penalty of up to $50,000, or 10        disciplinary action, or both, as determined by the 11        appropriate oversight body. 12    (d) Procedures after the imposition of sentence.13        (1) The Prisoner Review Board shall inform a victim or 14    any other concerned citizen, upon written request, of the 15    prisoner's release on parole, mandatory supervised 16    release, electronic detention, work release, international 17    transfer or exchange, or by the custodian, other than the 18    Department of Juvenile Justice, of the discharge of any 19    individual who was adjudicated a delinquent for a crime 20    from State custody and by the sheriff of the appropriate 21    county of any such person's final discharge from county 22    custody. The Prisoner Review Board, upon written request, 23    shall provide to a victim or any other concerned citizen a 24    recent photograph of any person convicted of a felony, 25    upon his or her release from custody. The Prisoner Review 26    Board, upon written request, shall inform a victim or any   SB0149- 33 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1    other concerned citizen when feasible at least 7 days 2    prior to the prisoner's release on furlough of the times 3    and dates of such furlough. Upon written request by the 4    victim or any other concerned citizen, the State's 5    Attorney shall notify the person once of the times and 6    dates of release of a prisoner sentenced to periodic 7    imprisonment. Notification shall be based on the most 8    recent information as to the victim's or other concerned 9    citizen's residence or other location available to the 10    notifying authority. 11        (2) When the defendant has been committed to the 12    Department of Human Services pursuant to Section 5-2-4 or 13    any other provision of the Unified Code of Corrections, 14    the victim may request to be notified by the releasing 15    authority of the approval by the court of an on-grounds 16    pass, a supervised off-grounds pass, an unsupervised 17    off-grounds pass, or conditional release; the release on 18    an off-grounds pass; the return from an off-grounds pass; 19    transfer to another facility; conditional release; escape; 20    death; or final discharge from State custody. The 21    Department of Human Services shall establish and maintain 22    a statewide telephone number to be used by victims to make 23    notification requests under these provisions and shall 24    publicize this telephone number on its website and to the 25    State's Attorney of each county.26        (3) In the event of an escape from State custody, the   SB0149- 34 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1    Department of Corrections or the Department of Juvenile 2    Justice immediately shall notify the Prisoner Review Board 3    of the escape and the Prisoner Review Board shall notify 4    the victim. The notification shall be based upon the most 5    recent information as to the victim's residence or other 6    location available to the Board. When no such information 7    is available, the Board shall make all reasonable efforts 8    to obtain the information and make the notification. When 9    the escapee is apprehended, the Department of Corrections 10    or the Department of Juvenile Justice immediately shall 11    notify the Prisoner Review Board and the Board shall 12    notify the victim.13        (4) The victim of the crime for which the prisoner has 14    been sentenced has the right to register with the Prisoner 15    Review Board's victim registry. Victims registered with 16    the Board shall receive reasonable written notice not less 17    than 30 days prior to the parole hearing or target 18    aftercare release date. The victim has the right to submit 19    a victim statement for consideration by the Prisoner 20    Review Board or the Department of Juvenile Justice in 21    writing, on film, videotape, or other electronic means, or 22    in the form of a recording prior to the parole hearing or 23    target aftercare release date, or in person at the parole 24    hearing or aftercare release protest hearing, or by 25    calling the toll-free number established in subsection (f) 26    of this Section. The victim shall be notified within 7   SB0149- 35 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1    days after the prisoner has been granted parole or 2    aftercare release and shall be informed of the right to 3    inspect the registry of parole decisions, established 4    under subsection (g) of Section 3-3-5 of the Unified Code 5    of Corrections. The provisions of this paragraph (4) are 6    subject to the Open Parole Hearings Act. Victim statements 7    provided to the Board shall be confidential and 8    privileged, including any statements received prior to 9    January 1, 2020 (the effective date of Public Act 10    101-288), except if the statement was an oral statement 11    made by the victim at a hearing open to the public.12        (4-1) The crime victim has the right to submit a 13    victim statement for consideration by the Prisoner Review 14    Board or the Department of Juvenile Justice prior to or at 15    a hearing to determine the conditions of mandatory 16    supervised release of a person sentenced to a determinate 17    sentence or at a hearing on revocation of mandatory 18    supervised release of a person sentenced to a determinate 19    sentence. A victim statement may be submitted in writing, 20    on film, videotape, or other electronic means, or in the 21    form of a recording, or orally at a hearing, or by calling 22    the toll-free number established in subsection (f) of this 23    Section.

Victim statements provided to the Board 12    shall be confidential and privileged, including any 13    statements received prior to January 1, 2020 (the 14    effective date of Public Act 101-288), except if the 15    statement was an oral statement made by the victim at a 16    hearing open to the public. 17        (5) If a statement is presented under Section 6, the 18    Prisoner Review Board or Department of Juvenile Justice 19    shall inform the victim of any order of discharge pursuant 20    to Section 3-2.5-85 or 3-3-8 of the Unified Code of 21    Corrections.22        (6) At the written or oral request of the victim of the 23    crime for which the prisoner was sentenced or the State's 24    Attorney of the county where the person seeking parole or 25    aftercare release was prosecuted, the Prisoner Review 26    Board or Department of Juvenile Justice shall notify the   SB0149- 37 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1    victim and the State's Attorney of the county where the 2    person seeking parole or aftercare release was prosecuted 3    of the death of the prisoner if the prisoner died while on 4    parole or aftercare release or mandatory supervised 5    release.6        (7) When a defendant who has been committed to the 7    Department of Corrections, the Department of Juvenile 8    Justice, or the Department of Human Services is released 9    or discharged and subsequently committed to the Department 10    of Human Services as a sexually violent person and the 11    victim had requested to be notified by the releasing 12    authority of the defendant's discharge, conditional 13    release, death, or escape from State custody, the 14    releasing authority shall provide to the Department of 15    Human Services such information that would allow the 16    Department of Human Services to contact the victim.17        (8) When a defendant has been convicted of a sex 18    offense as defined in Section 2 of the Sex Offender 19    Registration Act and has been sentenced to the Department 20    of Corrections or the Department of Juvenile Justice, the 21    Prisoner Review Board or the Department of Juvenile 22    Justice shall notify the victim of the sex offense of the 23    prisoner's eligibility for release on parole, aftercare 24    release, mandatory supervised release, electronic 25    detention, work release, international transfer or 26    exchange, or by the custodian of the discharge of any   SB0149- 38 -LRB104 07858 RLC 17904 b1    individual who was adjudicated a delinquent for a sex 2    offense from State custody and by the sheriff of the 3    appropriate county of any such person's final discharge 4    from county custody.
