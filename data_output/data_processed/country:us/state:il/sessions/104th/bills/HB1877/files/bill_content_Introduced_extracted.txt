In addition, in taxable year 1997, the applicant's 10exemption shall also include an amount equal to (i) the amount 11of any exemption denied to the applicant in taxable year 1995 12as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, as the base year, 13(ii) the amount of any exemption denied to the applicant in 14taxable year 1996 as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, 15as the base year, and (iii) the amount of the exemption 16erroneously denied for taxable year 1994.17    For purposes of this Section, a person who will be 65 years 18of age during the current taxable year shall be eligible to 19apply for the homestead exemption during that taxable year. 20Application shall be made during the application period in 21effect for the county of his or her residence. 22    The Chief County Assessment Officer may determine the 23eligibility of a life care facility that qualifies as a 24cooperative to receive the benefits provided by this Section 25by use of an affidavit, application, visual inspection, 26questionnaire, or other reasonable method in order to insure   HB1877- 14 -LRB104 09491 HLH 19552 b1that the tax savings resulting from the exemption are credited 2by the management firm to the apportioned tax liability of 3each qualifying resident. The Chief County Assessment Officer 4may request reasonable proof that the management firm has so 5credited that exemption.6    Except as provided in this Section, all information 7received by the chief county assessment officer or the 8Department from applications filed under this Section, or from 9any investigation conducted under the provisions of this 10Section, shall be confidential, except for official purposes 11or pursuant to official procedures for collection of any State 12or local tax or enforcement of any civil or criminal penalty or 13sanction imposed by this Act or by any statute or ordinance 14imposing a State or local tax.
