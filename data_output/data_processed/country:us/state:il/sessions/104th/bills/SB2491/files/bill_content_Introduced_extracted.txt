Bill Cunningham SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 20 ILCS 3125/55    Amends the Energy Efficient Building Act. In provisions concerning the Illinois Stretch Energy Code, changes the date by which the Capital Development Board shall create and adopt a stretch energy code with a site energy index no greater than 40% of the 2006 International Energy Conservation Code from December 31, 2025 to December 31, 2026. Changes the date that the Board shall create and adopt a stretch energy code with a site energy index that is no greater than 33% of the 2006 International Energy Conservation Code from no later than December 31, 2028 to no later than December 31, 2029. Changes the date by which the Board shall create and adopt a stretch energy code with a site energy index no greater than 25% of the 2006 International Energy Conservation Code from no later than December 31, 2031 to no later than December 31, 2032.LRB104 12220 HLH 22325 b  A BILL FOR SB2491LRB104 12220 HLH 22325 b1    AN ACT concerning State government. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Energy Efficient Building Act is amended by 5changing Section 55 as follows: 6    (20 ILCS 3125/55)7    Sec. 55. Illinois Stretch Energy Code.8    (a) The Board, in consultation with the Agency, shall 9create and adopt the Illinois Stretch Energy Code, to allow 10municipalities and projects authorized or funded by the Board 11to achieve more energy efficiency in buildings than the 12Illinois Energy Conservation Code through a consistent pathway 13across the State. The Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall be 14available for adoption by any municipality and shall set 15minimum energy efficiency requirements, taking the place of 16the Illinois Energy Conservation Code within any municipality 17that adopts the Illinois Stretch Energy Code.18    (b) The Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall have separate 19components for commercial and residential buildings, which may 20be adopted by the municipality jointly or separately.21    (c) The Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall apply to all 22projects to which an energy conservation code is applicable 23that are authorized or funded in any part by the Board after   SB2491- 2 -LRB104 12220 HLH 22325 b1July 1, 2024.2    (d) Development of the Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall 3be completed and available for adoption by municipalities by 4June 30, 2024.5    (e) Consistent with the requirements under paragraph (2.5) 6of subsection (g) of Section 8-103B of the Public Utilities 7Act and under paragraph (2) of subsection (j) of Section 8-104 8of the Public Utilities Act, municipalities may adopt the 9Illinois Stretch Energy Code and may use utility programs to 10support compliance with the Illinois Stretch Energy Code. The 11amount of savings from such utility efforts that may be 12counted toward achievement of their annual savings goals shall 13be based on reasonable estimates of the increase in savings 14resulting from the utility efforts, relative to reasonable 15approximations of what would have occurred absent the utility 16involvement.17    (f) The Illinois Stretch Energy Code's residential 18components shall:19        (1) apply to residential buildings as defined under 20    Section 10;21        (2) set performance targets using a site energy index 22    with reductions relative to the 2006 International Energy 23    Conservation Code; and24        (3) include stretch energy codes with site energy 25    index standards and adoption dates as follows: by no later 26    than June 30, 2024, the Board shall create and adopt a   SB2491- 3 -LRB104 12220 HLH 22325 b1    stretch energy code with a site energy index no greater 2    than 0.50 of the 2006 International Energy Conservation 3    Code;
