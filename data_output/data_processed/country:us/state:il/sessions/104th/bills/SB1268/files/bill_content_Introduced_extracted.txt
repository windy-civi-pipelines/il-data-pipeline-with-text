Estimates of State allocations to be received during 25any taxable year shall be considered in the determination of 26the municipality's tax rate for that year under Section 7-171.   SB1268- 14 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1If a special tax is levied under Section 7-171, none of the 2proceeds may be used to reimburse the municipality for the 3amount of State allocations received and paid to the Board. 4Any multiple-county or consolidated health department which 5receives contributions from a county under Section 11.2 of "An 6Act in relation to establishment and maintenance of county and 7multiple-county health departments", approved July 9, 1943, as 8amended, or distributions under Section 3 of the Department of 9Public Health Act, shall use these only for municipality 10contributions by the health department.11    (g) Municipality contributions for the several purposes 12specified shall, for township treasurers and employees in the 13offices of the township treasurers who meet the qualifying 14conditions for coverage hereunder, be allocated among the 15several school districts and parts of school districts 16serviced by such treasurers and employees in the proportion 17which the amount of school funds of each district or part of a 18district handled by the treasurer bears to the total amount of 19all school funds handled by the treasurer.20    From the funds subject to allocation among districts and 21parts of districts pursuant to the School Code, the trustees 22shall withhold the proportionate share of the liability for 23municipality contributions imposed upon such districts by this 24Section, in respect to such township treasurers and employees 25and remit the same to the Board.26    The municipality contribution rate for an educational   SB1268- 15 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1service center shall initially be the same rate for each year 2as the regional office of education or school district which 3serves as its administrative agent. When actuarial data become 4available, a separate rate shall be established as provided in 5subparagraph (i) of this Section.6    The municipality contribution rate for a public agency, 7other than a vocational education cooperative, formed under 8the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act shall initially be the 9average rate for the municipalities which are parties to the 10intergovernmental agreement. When actuarial data become 11available, a separate rate shall be established as provided in 12subparagraph (i) of this Section.13    (h) Each participating municipality and participating 14instrumentality shall make the contributions in the amounts 15provided in this Section in the manner prescribed from time to 16time by the Board and all such contributions shall be 17obligations of the respective participating municipalities and 18participating instrumentalities to this fund. The failure to 19deduct any employee contributions shall not relieve the 20participating municipality or participating instrumentality of 21its obligation to this fund. Delinquent payments of 22contributions due under this Section may, with interest, be 23recovered by civil action against the participating 24municipalities or participating instrumentalities. 25Municipality contributions, other than the amount necessary 26for employee contributions, for periods of service by   SB1268- 16 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1employees from whose earnings no deductions were made for 2employee contributions to the fund, may be charged to the 3municipality reserve for the municipality or participating 4instrumentality.5    (i) Contributions by participating instrumentalities shall 6be determined as provided herein except that the percentage 7derived under subparagraph 2 of paragraph (b) of this Section, 8and the amount payable under subparagraph 4 of paragraph (a) 9of this Section, shall be based on an amortization period of 10 10years.11    (j) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, 12the additional unfunded liability accruing as a result of 13Public Act 94-712 shall be amortized over a period of 30 years 14beginning on January 1 of the second calendar year following 15the calendar year in which Public Act 94-712 takes effect, 16except that the employer may provide for a longer amortization 17period by adopting a resolution or ordinance specifying a 1835-year or 40-year period and submitting a certified copy of 19the ordinance or resolution to the fund no later than June 1 of 20the calendar year following the calendar year in which Public 21Act 94-712 takes effect. 22    (k) If the amount of a participating employee's reported 23earnings for any of the 12-month periods used to determine the 24final rate of earnings exceeds the employee's 12-month 25reported earnings with the same employer for the previous year 26by the greater of 6% or 1.5 times the annual increase in the   SB1268- 17 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1Consumer Price Index-U, as established by the United States 2Department of Labor for the preceding September, the 3participating municipality or participating instrumentality 4that paid those earnings shall pay to the Fund, in addition to 5any other contributions required under this Article, the 6present value of the increase in the pension resulting from 7the portion of the increase in reported earnings that is in 8excess of the greater of 6% or 1.5 times the annual increase in 9the Consumer Price Index-U, as determined by the Fund. This 10present value shall be computed on the basis of the actuarial 11assumptions and tables used in the most recent actuarial 12valuation of the Fund that is available at the time of the 13computation.14    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 15required under this subsection (k), the fund shall calculate 16the amount of the payment and bill the participating 17municipality or participating instrumentality for that amount. 18The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 19amount due. If the participating municipality or participating 20instrumentality disputes the amount of the bill, it may, 21within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the fund in 22writing for a recalculation. The application must specify in 23detail the grounds of the dispute.

All annuities payable shall be charged to the annuity 8reserve.9    1. Amounts credited to annuity reserves shall be derived 10by transfer of all the employee credits from the appropriate 11employee reserves and by charges to the municipality reserve 12of those municipalities in which the retiring employee has 13accumulated service.

Estimates of State allocations to be received during 25any taxable year shall be considered in the determination of 26the municipality's tax rate for that year under Section 7-171.   SB1268- 14 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1If a special tax is levied under Section 7-171, none of the 2proceeds may be used to reimburse the municipality for the 3amount of State allocations received and paid to the Board. 4Any multiple-county or consolidated health department which 5receives contributions from a county under Section 11.2 of "An 6Act in relation to establishment and maintenance of county and 7multiple-county health departments", approved July 9, 1943, as 8amended, or distributions under Section 3 of the Department of 9Public Health Act, shall use these only for municipality 10contributions by the health department.11    (g) Municipality contributions for the several purposes 12specified shall, for township treasurers and employees in the 13offices of the township treasurers who meet the qualifying 14conditions for coverage hereunder, be allocated among the 15several school districts and parts of school districts 16serviced by such treasurers and employees in the proportion 17which the amount of school funds of each district or part of a 18district handled by the treasurer bears to the total amount of 19all school funds handled by the treasurer.20    From the funds subject to allocation among districts and 21parts of districts pursuant to the School Code, the trustees 22shall withhold the proportionate share of the liability for 23municipality contributions imposed upon such districts by this 24Section, in respect to such township treasurers and employees 25and remit the same to the Board.26    The municipality contribution rate for an educational   SB1268- 15 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1service center shall initially be the same rate for each year 2as the regional office of education or school district which 3serves as its administrative agent. When actuarial data become 4available, a separate rate shall be established as provided in 5subparagraph (i) of this Section.6    The municipality contribution rate for a public agency, 7other than a vocational education cooperative, formed under 8the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act shall initially be the 9average rate for the municipalities which are parties to the 10intergovernmental agreement. When actuarial data become 11available, a separate rate shall be established as provided in 12subparagraph (i) of this Section.13    (h) Each participating municipality and participating 14instrumentality shall make the contributions in the amounts 15provided in this Section in the manner prescribed from time to 16time by the Board and all such contributions shall be 17obligations of the respective participating municipalities and 18participating instrumentalities to this fund. The failure to 19deduct any employee contributions shall not relieve the 20participating municipality or participating instrumentality of 21its obligation to this fund. Delinquent payments of 22contributions due under this Section may, with interest, be 23recovered by civil action against the participating 24municipalities or participating instrumentalities. 25Municipality contributions, other than the amount necessary 26for employee contributions, for periods of service by   SB1268- 16 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1employees from whose earnings no deductions were made for 2employee contributions to the fund, may be charged to the 3municipality reserve for the municipality or participating 4instrumentality.5    (i) Contributions by participating instrumentalities shall 6be determined as provided herein except that the percentage 7derived under subparagraph 2 of paragraph (b) of this Section, 8and the amount payable under subparagraph 4 of paragraph (a) 9of this Section, shall be based on an amortization period of 10 10years.11    (j) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, 12the additional unfunded liability accruing as a result of 13Public Act 94-712 shall be amortized over a period of 30 years 14beginning on January 1 of the second calendar year following 15the calendar year in which Public Act 94-712 takes effect, 16except that the employer may provide for a longer amortization 17period by adopting a resolution or ordinance specifying a 1835-year or 40-year period and submitting a certified copy of 19the ordinance or resolution to the fund no later than June 1 of 20the calendar year following the calendar year in which Public 21Act 94-712 takes effect. 22    (k) If the amount of a participating employee's reported 23earnings for any of the 12-month periods used to determine the 24final rate of earnings exceeds the employee's 12-month 25reported earnings with the same employer for the previous year 26by the greater of 6% or 1.5 times the annual increase in the   SB1268- 17 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1Consumer Price Index-U, as established by the United States 2Department of Labor for the preceding September, the 3participating municipality or participating instrumentality 4that paid those earnings shall pay to the Fund, in addition to 5any other contributions required under this Article, the 6present value of the increase in the pension resulting from 7the portion of the increase in reported earnings that is in 8excess of the greater of 6% or 1.5 times the annual increase in 9the Consumer Price Index-U, as determined by the Fund. This 10present value shall be computed on the basis of the actuarial 11assumptions and tables used in the most recent actuarial 12valuation of the Fund that is available at the time of the 13computation.14    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 15required under this subsection (k), the fund shall calculate 16the amount of the payment and bill the participating 17municipality or participating instrumentality for that amount. 18The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 19amount due. If the participating municipality or participating 20instrumentality disputes the amount of the bill, it may, 21within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the fund in 22writing for a recalculation. The application must specify in 23detail the grounds of the dispute. Upon receiving a timely 24application for recalculation, the fund shall review the 25application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount due. 26The participating municipality and participating   SB1268- 18 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1instrumentality contributions required under this subsection 2(k) may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 3receipt of the bill. If the participating municipality and 4participating instrumentality contributions are not paid 5within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest will be 6charged at a rate equal to the fund's annual actuarially 7assumed rate of return on investment compounded annually from 8the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments must be 9concluded within 3 years after receipt of the bill by the 10participating municipality or participating instrumentality.11    When assessing payment for any amount due under this 12subsection (k), the fund shall exclude earnings increases 13resulting from overload or overtime earnings.14    When assessing payment for any amount due under this 15subsection (k), the fund shall exclude earnings increases 16resulting from payments for unused vacation time, but only for 17payments for unused vacation time made in the final 3 months of 18the final rate of earnings period.19    When assessing payment for any amount due under this 20subsection (k), the fund shall also exclude earnings increases 21attributable to standard employment promotions resulting in 22increased responsibility and workload.23    When assessing payment for any amount due under this 24subsection (k), the fund shall exclude reportable earnings 25increases resulting from periods where the member was paid 26through workers' compensation.   SB1268- 19 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1    This subsection (k) does not apply to earnings increases 2due to amounts paid as required by federal or State law or 3court mandate or to earnings increases due to the 4participating employee returning to the regular number of 5hours worked after having a temporary reduction in the number 6of hours worked. 7    This subsection (k) does not apply to earnings increases 8paid to individuals under contracts or collective bargaining 9agreements entered into, amended, or renewed before January 1, 102012 (the effective date of Public Act 97-609), earnings 11increases paid to members who are 10 years or more from 12retirement eligibility, or earnings increases resulting from 13an increase in the number of hours required to be worked. 14    When assessing payment for any amount due under this 15subsection (k), the fund shall also exclude earnings 16attributable to personnel policies adopted before January 1, 172012 (the effective date of Public Act 97-609) as long as those 18policies are not applicable to employees who begin service on 19or after January 1, 2012 (the effective date of Public Act 2097-609). 21    The change made to this Section by Public Act 100-139 is a 22clarification of existing law and is intended to be 23retroactive to January 1, 2012 (the effective date of Public 24Act 97-609). 25(Source: P.A. 102-849, eff. 5-13-22; 103-464, eff. 8-4-23.)   SB1268- 20 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1    (40 ILCS 5/7-205)  (from Ch. 108 1/2, par. 7-205)2    Sec. 7-205. Reserves for annuities. Appropriate reserves 3shall be created for payment of all annuities granted under 4this Article at the time such annuities are granted and in 5amounts determined to be necessary under actuarial tables 6adopted by the Board upon recommendation of the actuary of the 7fund. All annuities payable shall be charged to the annuity 8reserve.9    1. Amounts credited to annuity reserves shall be derived 10by transfer of all the employee credits from the appropriate 11employee reserves and by charges to the municipality reserve 12of those municipalities in which the retiring employee has 13accumulated service. If a retiring employee has accumulated 14service in more than one participating municipality or 15participating instrumentality, the municipality charges for 16non-concurrent service shall be calculated as follows:17        (A) for purposes of calculating the annuity reserve, 18    an annuity will be calculated based on service and 19    adjusted earnings with each employer (without regard to 20    the vesting requirement contained in subsection (a) of 21    Section 7-142); and 22        (B) the difference between the municipality charges 23    for the actual annuity granted and the aggregation of the 24    municipality charges based upon the ratio of each from 25    those calculations to the aggregated total from paragraph 26    (A) of this item 1.   SB1268- 21 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1    Aggregate municipality charges for concurrent service 2shall be prorated based on the employee's earnings. The 3municipality charges for retirement annuities calculated under 4subparagraph a. of paragraph 1. of subsection (a) of Section 57-142 shall be prorated based on actual contributions.6    2. Supplemental annuities shall be handled as a separate 7annuity and amounts to be credited to the annuity reserve 8therefor shall be derived in the same manner as a regular 9annuity.10    3. When a retirement annuity is granted to an employee 11with a spouse eligible for a surviving spouse annuity, there 12shall be credited to the annuity reserve an amount to fund the 13cost of both the retirement and surviving spouse annuity as a 14joint and survivors annuity.15    4. Beginning January 1, 1989, when a retirement annuity is 16awarded, an amount equal to the present value of the $8,000 17($3,000 for those who first retired prior to the effective 18date of this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly) 19$3,000 death benefit payable upon the death of the annuitant 20shall be transferred to the annuity reserve from the 21appropriate municipality reserves in the same manner as the 22transfer for annuities.23    5. All annuity reserves shall be revalued annually as of 24December 31. Beginning as of December 31, 1973, adjustment 25required therein by such revaluation shall be charged or 26credited to the earnings and experience variation reserve.  SB1268- 22 -LRB104 08547 RPS 18599 b1    6. There shall be credited to the annuity reserve all of 2the payments made by annuitants under Section 7-144.2, plus an 3additional amount from the earnings and experience variation 4reserve to fund the cost of the incremental annuities granted 5to annuitants making these payments.6    7. As of December 31, 1972, the excess in the annuity 7reserve shall be transferred to the municipality reserves. An 8amount equal to the deficiency in the reserve of participating 9municipalities and participating instrumentalities which have 10no participating employees shall be allocated to their 11reserves. The remainder shall be allocated in amounts 12proportionate to the present value, as of January 1, 1972, of 13annuities of annuitants of the remaining participating 14municipalities and participating instrumentalities.15(Source: P.A. 97-319, eff. 1-1-12; 97-609, eff. 1-1-12; 1697-813, eff. 7-13-12.) 17    (40 ILCS 5/7-206)  (from Ch. 108 1/2, par. 7-206)18    Sec. 7-206.
