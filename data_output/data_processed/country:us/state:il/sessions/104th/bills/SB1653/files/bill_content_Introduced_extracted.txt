Payments under this Section are not due 16and payable, however, until: (i) the methodologies described 17in this Section are approved by the federal government in an 18appropriate State Plan amendment or directed payment preprint; 19and (ii) the assessment imposed under this Article is 20determined to be a permissible tax under Title XIX of the 21Social Security Act. In determining the hospital access 22payments authorized under subsection (g) of this Section, if a 23hospital ceases to qualify for payments from the pool, the   SB1653- 2 -LRB104 09504 KTG 19567 b1payments for all hospitals continuing to qualify for payments 2from such pool shall be uniformly adjusted to fully expend the 3aggregate net amount of the pool, with such adjustment being 4effective on the first day of the second month following the 5date the hospital ceases to receive payments from such pool.6    (b) Amounts moved into claims-based rates and distributed 7in accordance with Section 14-12 shall remain in those 8claims-based rates.9    (c) Graduate medical education.10        (1) The calculation of graduate medical education 11    payments shall be based on the hospital's Medicare cost 12    report ending in Calendar Year 2018, as reported in the 13    Healthcare Cost Report Information System file, release 14    date September 30, 2019. An Illinois hospital reporting 15    intern and resident cost on its Medicare cost report shall 16    be eligible for graduate medical education payments.17        (2) Each hospital's annualized Medicaid Intern 18    Resident Cost is calculated using annualized intern and 19    resident total costs obtained from Worksheet B Part I, 20    Columns 21 and 22 the sum of Lines 30-43, 50-76, 90-93, 21    96-98, and 105-112 multiplied by the percentage that the 22    hospital's Medicaid days (Worksheet S3 Part I, Column 7, 23    Lines 2, 3, 4, 14, 16-18, and 32) comprise of the 24    hospital's total days (Worksheet S3 Part I, Column 8, 25    Lines 14, 16-18, and 32).26        (3) An annualized Medicaid indirect medical education   SB1653- 3 -LRB104 09504 KTG 19567 b1    (IME) payment is calculated for each hospital using its 2    IME payments (Worksheet E Part A, Line 29, Column 1) 3    multiplied by the percentage that its Medicaid days 4    (Worksheet S3 Part I, Column 7, Lines 2, 3, 4, 14, 16-18, 5    and 32) comprise of its Medicare days (Worksheet S3 Part 6    I, Column 6, Lines 2, 3, 4, 14, and 16-18).7        (4) For each hospital, its annualized Medicaid Intern 8    Resident Cost and its annualized Medicaid IME payment are 9    summed, and, except as capped at 120% of the average cost 10    per intern and resident for all qualifying hospitals as 11    calculated under this paragraph, is multiplied by the 12    applicable reimbursement factor as described in this 13    paragraph, to determine the hospital's final graduate 14    medical education payment.

Pass-through 19    payments to safety-net hospitals, as defined in Section 20    5-5e.1 of this Code, shall not be reduced until all 21    pass-through payments to other hospitals have been 22    eliminated. All other hospitals shall have their 23    pass-through payments reduced proportionally. 24    (k) At least 30 days prior to each calendar year, the 25Department shall notify each hospital of changes to the 26payment methodologies in this Section, including, but not   SB1653- 29 -LRB104 09504 KTG 19567 b1limited to, changes in the fixed rate directed payment rates, 2the aggregate pass-through payment amount for all hospitals, 3and the hospital's pass-through payment amount for the 4upcoming calendar year.5    (l) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, 6the Department may adopt rules to change the methodology for 7directed and pass-through payments as set forth in this 8Section, but only to the extent necessary to obtain federal 9approval of a necessary State Plan amendment or Directed 10Payment Preprint or to otherwise conform to federal law or 11federal regulation.12    (m) As used in this subsection, "managed care 13organization" or "MCO" means an entity which contracts with 14the Department to provide services where payment for medical 15services is made on a capitated basis, excluding contracted 16entities for dual eligible or Department of Children and 17Family Services youth populations.18    (n) In order to address the escalating infant mortality 19rates among minority communities in Illinois, the State shall, 20subject to appropriation, create a pool of funding of at least 21$50,000,000 annually to be disbursed among safety-net 22hospitals that maintain perinatal designation from the 23Department of Public Health.
