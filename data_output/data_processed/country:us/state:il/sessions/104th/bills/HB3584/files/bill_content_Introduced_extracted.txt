The Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 5Marriage Act is amended by changing Section 510 as follows: 6    (750 ILCS 5/510)  (from Ch. 40, par. 510)7    Sec. 510. Modification and termination of provisions for 8maintenance, support, educational expenses, and property 9disposition.10    (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of 11Section 502 and in subsection (b), clause (3) of Section 12505.2, the provisions of any judgment respecting maintenance 13or support may be modified only as to installments accruing 14subsequent to due notice by the moving party of the filing of 15the motion for modification. An order for child support may be 16modified as follows:17        (1) upon a showing of a substantial change in 18    circumstances. Contemplation or foreseeability of future 19    events shall not be considered as a factor or used as a 20    defense in determining whether a substantial change in 21    circumstances is shown, unless the future event is 22    expressly specified in the court's order or the agreement 23    of the parties incorporated into a court order. The   HB3584- 2 -LRB104 10259 JRC 20333 b1    parties may expressly specify in the agreement 2    incorporated into a court order or the court may expressly 3    specify in the order that the occurrence of a specific 4    future event is contemplated and will not constitute a 5    substantial change in circumstances to warrant 6    modification of the order; and7        (2) without the necessity of showing a substantial 8    change in circumstances, as follows:9            (A) upon a showing of an inconsistency of at least 10        20%, but no less than $10 per month, between the amount 11        of the existing order and the amount of child support 12        that results from application of the guidelines 13        specified in Section 505 of this Act unless the 14        inconsistency is due to the fact that the amount of the 15        existing order resulted from a deviation from the 16        guideline amount and there has not been a change in the 17        circumstances that resulted in that deviation; or18            (B) upon a showing of a need to provide for the 19        health care needs of the child under the order through 20        health insurance or other means.21    The provisions of subparagraph (a)(2)(A) shall apply only 22in cases in which a party is receiving child support 23enforcement services from the Department of Healthcare and 24Family Services under Article X of the Illinois Public Aid 25Code, and only when at least 36 months have elapsed since the 26order for child support was entered or last modified.  HB3584- 3 -LRB104 10259 JRC 20333 b1    The court may grant a petition for modification that seeks 2to apply the changes made to subsection (a) of Section 505 by 3Public Act 99-764 to an order entered before the effective 4date of Public Act 99-764 only upon a finding of a substantial 5change in circumstances that warrants application of the 6changes. The enactment of Public Act 99-764 itself does not 7constitute a substantial change in circumstances warranting a 8modification.9    Any obligor paying child support under this Act must 10annually notify the obligee, in writing, if the obligor's 11adjusted net income has increased by 10% or more in the 12obligor's most recent federal tax return. If the obligor fails 13to do so, and the obligee files a petition to modify child 14support, the court must consider that failure to notify as a 15substantial change in circumstances and also award the obligee 16attorney's fees and costs for bringing this petition. The 17changes made to this amendatory Act of the 104th General 18Assembly apply to federal tax returns filed on or after the 19effective date of this Act. 20    (a-5) An order for maintenance may be modified or 21terminated only upon a showing of a substantial change in 22circumstances. Contemplation or foreseeability of future 23events shall not be considered as a factor or used as a defense 24in determining whether a substantial change in circumstances 25is shown, unless the future event is expressly specified in 26the court's order or the agreement of the parties incorporated   HB3584- 4 -LRB104 10259 JRC 20333 b1into a court order. The parties may expressly specify in the 2agreement incorporated into a court order or the court may 3expressly specify in the order that the occurrence of a 4specific future event is contemplated and will not constitute 5a substantial change in circumstances to warrant modification 6of the order. The court may grant a petition for modification 7that seeks to apply the changes made to Section 504 by this 8amendatory Act of the 100th General Assembly to an order 9entered before the effective date of this amendatory Act of 10the 100th General Assembly only upon a finding of a 11substantial change in circumstances that warrants application 12of the changes. The enactment of this amendatory Act of the 13100th General Assembly itself does not constitute a 14substantial change in circumstances warranting a modification. 15In all such proceedings, as well as in proceedings in which 16maintenance is being reviewed, the court shall consider the 17applicable factors set forth in subsection (a) of Section 504 18and the following factors:19        (1) any change in the employment status of either 20    party and whether the change has been made in good faith;21        (2) the efforts, if any, made by the party receiving 22    maintenance to become self-supporting, and the 23    reasonableness of the efforts where they are appropriate;24        (3) any impairment of the present and future earning 25    capacity of either party;26        (4) the tax consequences of the maintenance payments   HB3584- 5 -LRB104 10259 JRC 20333 b1    upon the respective economic circumstances of the parties;2        (5) the duration of the maintenance payments 3    previously paid (and remaining to be paid) relative to the 4    length of the marriage;5        (6) the property, including retirement benefits, 6    awarded to each party under the judgment of dissolution of 7    marriage, judgment of legal separation, or judgment of 8    declaration of invalidity of marriage and the present 9    status of the property;10        (7) the increase or decrease in each party's income 11    since the prior judgment or order from which a review, 12    modification, or termination is being sought;13        (8) the property acquired and currently owned by each 14    party after the entry of the judgment of dissolution of 15    marriage, judgment of legal separation, or judgment of 16    declaration of invalidity of marriage; and17        (9) any other factor that the court expressly finds to 18    be just and equitable.19    (a-6) (Blank).20    (b) The provisions as to property disposition may not be 21revoked or modified, unless the court finds the existence of 22conditions that justify the reopening of a judgment under the 23laws of this State.24    (c) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in a written 25agreement set forth in the judgment or otherwise approved by 26the court, the obligation to pay future maintenance is   HB3584- 6 -LRB104 10259 JRC 20333 b1terminated upon the death of either party, or the remarriage 2of the party receiving maintenance, or if the party receiving 3maintenance cohabits with another person on a resident, 4continuing conjugal basis. An obligor's obligation to pay 5maintenance or unallocated maintenance terminates by operation 6of law on the date the obligee remarries or the date the court 7finds cohabitation began. The obligor is entitled to 8reimbursement for all maintenance paid from that date forward. 9Any termination of an obligation for maintenance as a result 10of the death of the obligor, however, shall be inapplicable to 11any right of the other party or such other party's designee to 12receive a death benefit under such insurance on the obligor's 13life. An obligee must advise the obligor of his or her 14intention to marry at least 30 days before the remarriage, 15unless the decision is made within this time period. In that 16event, he or she must notify the obligor within 72 hours of 17getting married.18    (c-5) In an adjudicated case, the court shall make 19specific factual findings as to the reason for the 20modification as well as the amount, nature, and duration of 21the modified maintenance award.22    (d) Unless otherwise provided in this Act, or as agreed in 23writing or expressly provided in the judgment, provisions for 24the support of a child are terminated by emancipation of the 25child, or if the child has attained the age of 18 and is still 26attending high school, provisions for the support of the child   HB3584- 7 -LRB104 10259 JRC 20333 b1are terminated upon the date that the child graduates from 2high school or the date the child attains the age of 19, 3whichever is earlier, but not by the death of a parent 4obligated to support or educate the child. An existing 5obligation to pay for support or educational expenses, or 6both, is not terminated by the death of a parent. When a parent 7obligated to pay support or educational expenses, or both, 8dies, the amount of support or educational expenses, or both, 9may be enforced, modified, revoked or commuted to a lump sum 10payment, as equity may require, and that determination may be 11provided for at the time of the dissolution of the marriage or 12thereafter.13    (e) The right to petition for support or educational 14expenses, or both, under Sections 505, 513, and 513.5 is not 15extinguished by the death of a parent. Upon a petition filed 16before or after a parent's death, the court may award sums of 17money out of the decedent's estate for the child's support or 18educational expenses, or both, as equity may require. The time 19within which a claim may be filed against the estate of a 20decedent under Sections 505 and 513 and subsection (d) and 21this subsection shall be governed by the provisions of the 22Probate Act of 1975, as a barrable, noncontingent claim.23    (f) A petition to modify or terminate child support or the 24allocation of parental responsibilities, including parenting 25time, shall not delay any child support enforcement litigation 26or supplementary proceeding on behalf of the obligee,   HB3584- 8 -LRB104 10259 JRC 20333 b1including, but not limited to, a petition for a rule to show 2cause, for non-wage garnishment, or for a restraining order.3(Source: P.A. 102-541, eff. 8-20-21; 102-823, eff. 5-13-22.) 4    Section 99.
