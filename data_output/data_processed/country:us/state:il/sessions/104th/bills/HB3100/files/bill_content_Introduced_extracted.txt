The Illinois Sports Facilities Authority Act 4is amended by changing Section 19 as follows: 5    (70 ILCS 3205/19)  (from Ch. 85, par. 6019)6    Sec. 19. Tax. The Authority may impose an occupation tax 7upon all hotel operators in the City of Chicago, as defined in 8The Hotel Operators' Occupation Tax Act, at a rate not to 9exceed 2% of the gross rental receipts from engaging in 10business as a hotel operator within the City of Chicago, 11excluding, however, from gross rental receipts, the proceeds 12of such renting, leasing or letting of hotel rooms to 13permanent residents of a hotel and proceeds from the tax 14imposed under subsection (c) of Section 13 of the Metropolitan 15Pier and Exposition Authority Act.16    The tax imposed by the Authority pursuant to this Section 17and all civil penalties that may be assessed as an incident 18thereof shall be collected and enforced by the State 19Department of Revenue. The certificate of registration which 20is issued by the Department to a lessor under The Hotel 21Operators' Occupation Tax Act shall permit such registrant to 22engage in a business which is taxable under any ordinance or 23resolution enacted pursuant to this Section without 24registering separately with the Department under such   HB3100- 17 -LRB104 08028 HLH 18074 b1ordinance or resolution or under this Section. The Department 2shall have full power to administer and enforce this Section; 3to collect all taxes and penalties due hereunder; to dispose 4of taxes and penalties so collected in the manner provided in 5this Section, and to determine all rights to credit memoranda, 6arising on account of the erroneous payment of tax or penalty 7hereunder. In the administration of, and compliance with, this 8Section, the Department and persons who are subject to this 9Section shall have the same rights, remedies, privileges, 10immunities, powers and duties, and be subject to the same 11conditions, restrictions, limitations, penalties and 12definitions of terms, and employ the same modes of procedure, 13as are prescribed in The Hotel Operators' Occupation Tax Act 14(except where that Act is inconsistent herewith), as the same 15is now or may hereafter be amended, as fully as if the 16provisions contained in The Hotel Operators' Occupation Tax 17Act were set forth herein.18    Whenever the Department determines that a refund should be 19made under this Section to a claimant instead of issuing a 20credit memorandum, the Department shall notify the State 21Comptroller, who shall cause the warrant to be drawn for the 22amount specified, and to the person named, in such 23notification from the Department. Such refund shall be paid by 24the State Treasurer out of the amounts held by the State 25Treasurer as trustee for the Authority.26    Persons subject to any tax imposed pursuant to authority   HB3100- 18 -LRB104 08028 HLH 18074 b1granted by this Section may reimburse themselves for their tax 2liability for such tax by separately stating such tax as an 3additional charge, which charge may be stated in combination, 4in a single amount, with State tax imposed under The Hotel 5Operators' Occupation Tax Act, the municipal tax imposed under 6Section 8-3-13 of the Illinois Municipal Code, and the tax 7imposed under Section 13 of the Metropolitan Pier and 8Exposition Authority Act.9    The Department shall forthwith pay over to the State 10Treasurer, ex-officio, as trustee for the Authority, all taxes 11and penalties collected hereunder for deposit in a trust fund 12outside the State Treasury. On or before the 25th day of each 13calendar month, the Department shall certify to the 14Comptroller the amount to be paid to or on behalf of the 15Authority from amounts collected hereunder by the Department, 16and deposited into such trust fund during the second preceding 17calendar month.

Each such monthly certification by the   HB3100- 19 -LRB104 08028 HLH 18074 b1Department shall also certify to the Comptroller the amount to 2be so retained by the State Treasurer for payment as provided 3in Section 6 of the Hotel Operators' Occupation Tax Act into 4the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury.5    Each monthly certification by the Department shall 6certify, of the amount paid to or on behalf of the Authority, 7(i) the portion to be paid to the Authority, (ii) the portion 8to be paid into the General Revenue Fund of the State Treasury 9on behalf of the Authority as provided in Section 6 of the 10Hotel Operators' Occupation Tax Act as repayment of amounts 11advanced to the Authority pursuant to appropriation from the 12Illinois Sports Facilities Fund.13    With respect to each State fiscal year, of the total 14amount to be paid to or on behalf of the Authority, the 15Department shall certify that payments shall first be made 16directly to the Authority in an amount equal to any difference 17between the annual amount certified by the Chairman of the 18Authority pursuant to Section 8.25-4 of the State Finance Act 19and the amount appropriated to the Authority from the Illinois 20Sports Facilities Fund. Next, the Department shall certify 21that payment shall be made as provided in Section 6 of the 22Hotel Operators' Occupation Tax Act into the General Revenue 23Fund of the State Treasury in an amount equal to the difference 24between (i) the lesser of (x) the amount appropriated from the 25Illinois Sports Facilities Fund to the Authority and (y) the 26annual amount certified by the Chairman of the Authority   HB3100- 20 -LRB104 08028 HLH 18074 b1pursuant to Section 8.25-4 of the State Finance Act and (ii) 2$10,000,000. The Department shall certify that all additional 3amounts shall be paid to the Authority and used for its 4corporate purposes.5    Within 10 days after receipt, by the Comptroller, of the 6Department's monthly certification of amounts to be paid to or 7on behalf of the Authority and amounts to be paid into the 8General Revenue Fund, the Comptroller shall cause the warrants 9to be drawn for the respective amounts in accordance with the 10directions contained in such certification.11    Amounts collected by the Department and paid to the 12Authority pursuant to this Section shall be used for the 13corporate purposes of the Authority. On June 15, 1992 and on 14each June 15 thereafter, the Authority shall repay to the 15State Treasurer all amounts paid to it under this Section and 16otherwise remaining available to the Authority after providing 17for (i) payment of principal and interest on, and other 18payments related to, its obligations issued or to be issued 19under Section 13 of the Act, including any deposits required 20to reserve funds created under any indenture or resolution 21authorizing issuance of the obligations and payments to 22providers of credit enhancement, (ii) payment of obligations 23under the provisions of any management agreement with respect 24to a facility or facilities owned by the Authority or of any 25assistance agreement with respect to any facility for which 26financial assistance is provided under this Act, and payment   HB3100- 21 -LRB104 08028 HLH 18074 b1of other capital and operating expenses of the Authority, 2including any deposits required to reserve funds created for 3repair and replacement of capital assets and to meet the 4obligations of the Authority under any management agreement or 5assistance agreement.
