Short title. This Act may be cited as the Let 5the People Lift the Ban Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that:7        (1) There is a significant shortage of safe, 8    affordable, and healthy rental housing in the State, 9    especially for hundreds of thousands of lower-income 10    renters. One-third of residents, or nearly 1.6 million 11    households, depend on rental housing.12        (2) The rate at which rent has increased in the State 13    has continued to outpace the increase in residents' real 14    wages, resulting in an increasing rent burden borne by 15    households, especially vulnerable populations. This 16    growing burden threatens the quality and stability of 17    housing available to renters.18        (3) Many households that depend on rental housing are 19    low-income and are rent-burdened, meaning that they pay 20    more than 30% of the household income on rent. 21    Additionally, some of these households are severely 22    cost-burdened, meaning that the household must devote more 23    than 50% of the household income to paying rent, leaving   HB3687- 2 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    little for other household necessities, such as health 2    care, education, vocational training, transportation, or 3    utilities.4        (4) An inability to find affordable housing negatively 5    impacts tenants' economic stability, health and 6    well-being, and capacity to participate in their 7    communities. A lack of stable housing may limit a parent's 8    ability to maintain employment, a child's capacity to 9    succeed at school, and, for lower-income families, the 10    potential to escape the cycle of poverty.11        (5) Tenants' inability to find and retain affordable 12    housing results in increased rates of involuntary 13    displacement, eviction, and property turnover, creating 14    additional burdens for landlords and property owners, 15    social service agencies, local governments, and the 16    judicial system, as well as renter households. 17    Section 10. Purpose. The purpose of this Act is to promote 18the maintenance and expansion of the supply of healthy, 19accessible, safe, and affordable rental housing, and to 20establish the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants 21in the rental of dwelling units in the State. This Act is 22remedial in its general purpose and shall be construed 23liberally to achieve its objectives. 24    Section 15. Definitions.

If the landlord fails to correct 7    the condition within 24 hours after being notified by the 8    tenant, the tenant may:9            (A) withhold from the monthly rent an amount that 10        reasonably reflects the reduced value of the premises 11        due to the material noncompliance or failure;12            (B) procure reasonable amounts of heat, running 13        water, hot water, electricity, gas, or plumbing 14        service and, upon presentation to the landlord of paid 15        receipts, deduct the cost from the tenant's rent;16            (C) recover damages based upon the diminution in 17        the fair rental value of the dwelling unit and 18        reasonable attorney fees; or19            (D) procure substitute housing and not pay rent 20        for the period of noncompliance.

If the tenant does not vacate the 14    property within 30 days after the notification of 15    termination or the end of the next rental period, 16    whichever is longer, then the tenant's written notice 17    shall be deemed withdrawn and the rental agreement shall 18    remain in full force and effect.19        (3) The tenant may not exercise the tenant's rights 20    under subsection (c) of Section 35 if the condition was 21    caused by the inability of a utility supplier or Internet 22    provider to provide service, unless the landlord caused 23    the inability of the utility supplier or Internet 24    provider, or by the deliberate or negligent act or 25    omission of the tenant, a member of the tenant's family, 26    or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent.  HB3687- 23 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    (e) A tenant has the following remedies if there is a fire 2or casualty:3        (1) If the dwelling unit or premises is damaged or 4    destroyed by fire or casualty to an extent that the 5    dwelling unit or premises is in material noncompliance 6    with the rental agreement or with subsection (c) of 7    Section 35, the tenant may immediately vacate the premises 8    and notify the landlord in writing within 14 days after 9    vacating the premises of the tenant's intention to 10    terminate the rental agreement, in which case the rental 11    agreement terminates as of the date of fire or casualty.12        (2) If continued occupancy is lawful, the tenant may 13    vacate any part of the dwelling unit rendered unusable by 14    the fire or casualty, in which case the tenant's liability 15    for rent is reduced in proportion to the diminution in the 16    fair rental value of the dwelling unit.17        (3) If the tenant desires to continue the tenancy and 18    if the landlord has promised or begun work to repair the 19    damage or destruction but fails to carry out the work to 20    restore the dwelling unit or common area diligently and 21    within a reasonable time, the tenant may notify the 22    landlord in writing within 14 days after the tenant 23    becomes aware that work is not being carried out 24    diligently or within a reasonable time of the tenant's 25    intention to terminate the rental agreement, in which case 26    the rental agreement terminates as of the date of the fire   HB3687- 24 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    or casualty.2        (4) If the rental agreement is terminated, the 3    landlord shall return the security deposit within 48 4    hours. When the landlord accounts for rent after the 5    tenant has terminated the rental agreement, the landlord 6    may not charge rent to the tenant for any date after the 7    date of the fire or casualty.8        (5) A tenant may not exercise remedies in this 9    subsection if the fire or casualty damage was caused by 10    the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, 11    a member of the tenant's family, or a person on the 12    premises with the tenant's consent.13    (f) A tenant may withhold rent to undertake minor repairs 14as follows:15        (1) If the landlord is not in material compliance with 16    the rental agreement or with Section 30 and the reasonable 17    cost of compliance does not exceed $500 or one-half 18    month's rent, whichever amount is greater, the tenant may 19    notify the landlord in writing that, if the landlord does 20    not remedy the condition within 14 days after receipt of 21    the written notice or as promptly as conditions require in 22    case of emergency, the tenant will correct the condition 23    and withhold the cost of the repair from the tenant's next 24    rent payment. The tenant shall have work done in a 25    workmanlike manner. The tenant shall submit to the 26    landlord a paid bill from an appropriate tradesperson or   HB3687- 25 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    supplier at the same time as deducting the amount from the 2    tenant's rent. The tenant may not expend or deduct more 3    than the amount specified in this subsection.4        (2) A tenant shall not repair at the landlord's 5    expense or deduct rent if the condition was caused by the 6    deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a 7    member of the tenant's family, or other person on the 8    premises with the tenant's permission.9        (3) Before correcting a condition affecting facilities 10    shared by more than one dwelling unit, the tenant shall 11    notify all other affected tenants of the tenant's plans 12    and so arrange the work as to create the least practicable 13    inconvenience to the other tenants. 14    Section 40.

The landlord shall 20        provide this written notice directly to each dwelling 21        unit by mail, telephone, or written notice or by other 22        reasonable means designed in good faith to provide 23        written notice to the tenant.

When access is 2        authorized due to an emergency, the landlord shall 3        give the tenant written notice of entry within 2 days 4        after the entry.5            (D) If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, 6        the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel 7        access or terminate the rental agreement. In either 8        case, the landlord may recover damages and reasonable 9        attorney's fees.10            (E) If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or 11        entry in an unreasonable manner, or makes repeated 12        unreasonable demands for entry that have the effect of 13        harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive 14        relief to prevent the recurrence of the conduct or 15        terminate the rental agreement. In each case, the 16        tenant may recover an amount equal to one month's rent 17        or twice the damages sustained, whichever is greater, 18        and reasonable attorney's fees.19    (c) A landlord has a right to adopt rules and regulations 20as follows:21        (1) The landlord may adopt general rules or 22    regulations concerning the tenant's use and occupancy of 23    the premises.

Landlord remedies.19    (a) The landlord has the following remedies when the 20tenant fails to pay rent:21        (1) If the tenant is not in material compliance with 22    the obligation to pay rent, the landlord may deliver to 23    the tenant a written notice of the landlord's intention to 24    terminate the rental agreement. The landlord shall serve 25    the written notice in compliance with State law. If the   HB3687- 30 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    tenant does not materially comply with the written notice 2    within 5 days after receipt, the landlord may file an 3    eviction action to terminate the rental agreement.4        (2) Nothing in this subsection shall affect a 5    landlord's obligation to provide notice of termination of 6    tenancy in subsidized housing as required under federal 7    law or regulations.8        (3) A landlord may also maintain an action for rent or 9    damages without terminating the rental agreement.10    (b) If the landlord alleges that the tenant is not in 11material compliance with a rental agreement or the obligations 12in Section 40, the landlord may deliver written notice to the 13tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the 14alleged breach. The landlord shall serve the written notice in 15compliance with State law. The written notice may provide that 16the rental agreement will terminate upon a date no less than 10 17days after the date of the written notice. The tenant shall 18have the amount of time specified in the written notice to 19remedy any alleged breach by the tenant prior to the date of 20termination. If the breach is not remedied, the landlord may 21file an eviction to terminate the rental agreement, as 22provided in the written notice. The landlord may recover 23damages and obtain injunctive relief for any material 24noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or the 25obligations in Section 40. If the landlord does not file an 26eviction action within 30 days after the notification of   HB3687- 31 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1termination or the end of the next rental period, whichever is 2longer, then the landlord's written notice shall be deemed 3withdrawn and the rental agreement shall remain in full force 4and effect.5    (c) The landlord has the right to determine abandonment of 6the dwelling unit and dispose of personal property. The 7landlord may determine that the tenant has abandoned the 8dwelling unit and personal property in the following 9circumstances:10        (1) The tenant has provided written notice to the 11    landlord indicating the tenant's intention not to return 12    to the dwelling unit.13        (2) All persons entitled under a rental agreement have 14    been absent from the dwelling unit for a period of 32 days, 15    or for one rental period when the rental agreement is for 16    less than a month, and the persons have removed their 17    personal property from the premises and rent for that 18    period is unpaid. However, if any person entitled to 19    occupancy provides the landlord with written notice 20    indicating that a tenant intends to occupy the dwelling 21    unit and make full payments of all amounts due to the 22    landlord, then the landlord may not determine that the 23    tenant has abandoned the property.24        (3) If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the 25    landlord shall make a good faith effort to rent it at a 26    fair rental value. A good faith effort includes the   HB3687- 32 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    acceptance of reasonable subleases. If the landlord 2    succeeds in renting the dwelling unit at a fair rental 3    value, the tenant shall only be liable for the amount by 4    which the rent due from the date of abandonment to the 5    termination of the initial rental agreement exceeds the 6    fair rental value subsequently received by the landlord 7    from the date of abandonment to the termination of the 8    initial rental agreement. If the landlord makes a good 9    faith effort to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental 10    value and is unsuccessful, the tenant shall be liable for 11    the rent due for the period of the rental agreement. The 12    tenant shall also be liable for reasonable advertising and 13    redecoration costs incurred by the landlord in re-renting 14    the dwelling unit.15        (4) Unless otherwise agreed, if, upon termination of a 16    tenancy, including, but not limited to, a termination 17    after expiration of a lease or by surrender or abandonment 18    of the premises, a tenant has left personal property on 19    the premises, and the landlord reasonably believes that 20    the tenant has abandoned the personal property, the 21    landlord may dispose of the property according to the 22    following procedures:23            (A) If the landlord in good faith reasonably 24        determines that the tenant has left personal property 25        that is valueless or of such little value that the cost 26        of storing and conducting a sale would probably exceed   HB3687- 33 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1        the amount that would be realized from the sale, the 2        landlord shall retain the property either in the 3        dwelling unit or remove and store the abandoned 4        property from the dwelling unit and may dispose of the 5        property after 7 days. The landlord shall not be 6        required to provide written notice to the tenant of 7        the landlord's intent to dispose of property pursuant 8        to this subsection.9            (B) If the landlord in good faith reasonably 10        determines that the tenant has left personal property 11        that has value, the landlord shall notify the tenant 12        in writing of the landlord's demand that the tenant 13        remove the property within dates set forth in the 14        written notice, but no less than 7 days after delivery 15        of the written notice. The landlord may deliver this 16        written notice by posting it in a prominent location 17        inside the dwelling unit or on the front door of the 18        dwelling unit or by electronic means if the parties 19        had previously communicated electronically.20            (C) If the tenant does not remove the property 21        within the time specified, the landlord may sell the 22        property at a public sale or at a commercially 23        reasonable private sale. The landlord may retain the 24        proceeds of the sale to recover any rent owed by the 25        tenant to the landlord. If the proceeds, less 26        reasonable costs incurred by the sale or storage,   HB3687- 34 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1        exceed any rent owed to the landlord, the landlord 2        shall retain the proceeds for one year. If the tenant 3        does not claim the proceeds within one year, the 4        proceeds shall be the property of the landlord.5        (5) At any time that the landlord is storing personal 6    property pursuant to this subsection, the landlord shall 7    exercise reasonable care of the property, but shall not be 8    responsible to the tenant for any loss except for damage 9    caused by the landlord's deliberate or negligent act or 10    omission. The landlord may elect to store the property in 11    or about the previously vacated premises. The landlord 12    shall be entitled to the cost of storage for the period of 13    time that the property has remained in the landlord's 14    safekeeping. In this case, the storage shall not exceed 15    commercially reasonable storage rates. If the tenant's 16    property is removed to a commercial storage company, the 17    storage cost shall include the actual charge for the 18    storage and removal from the premises to the place of 19    storage.20        (6) If the tenant timely responds in writing of the 21    tenant's intention to remove the personal property from 22    the premises and does not do so within the time period in 23    the landlord's written notice or a mutually agreeable 24    date, whichever is later, it is conclusively presumed that 25    they have abandoned the property.26    (d) If the landlord accepts rent, including holding   HB3687- 35 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1payment, knowing that the landlord alleges a lease violation, 2including a default in the payment of rent by the tenant, the 3landlord waives the right to terminate the rental agreement 4for that breach.5    (e) If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord 6may file a claim for possession or for rent and a separate 7claim for damages for breach of the rental agreement.8    (f) No tenant shall be required to renew a rental 9agreement more than 60 days prior to the termination date of 10the rental agreement. If the landlord violates this 11subsection, the tenant shall recover one month's rent or 12actual damages, whichever is greater.13    The landlord shall notify the tenant in writing at least 1460 days prior to the stated termination date of the rental 15agreement of the landlord's intent to terminate a 16month-to-month tenancy or not renew an existing rental 17agreement. If the landlord fails to give required written 18notice, the tenant may remain in the dwelling unit for up to 19120 days after the date on which the required written notice is 20given to the tenant, regardless of the date specified in the 21existing rental agreement. During the 120 days, the terms and 22conditions of the tenancy shall be the same as the terms and 23conditions during the last month of tenancy. 24    Section 55. Landlord obligations.25    (a) The landlord shall maintain the premises in compliance   HB3687- 36 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1with all applicable provisions of law, including subsection 2(c) of Section 30, and shall promptly make any and all repairs 3to fulfill this obligation.4    (b) The landlord and tenant of any dwelling unit may agree 5that the tenant is to perform specified repairs, maintenance 6tasks, alterations, or remodeling only if:7        (1) the agreement of the parties is entered into in 8    good faith and not for the purpose of evading obligations 9    of the landlord and is set forth in a separate writing 10    signed by the parties and supported by adequate 11    consideration; and12        (2) the agreement does not diminish or affect the 13    obligation of the landlord to other tenants on the 14    premises.15    (c) A landlord has the following obligations relating to 16providing a written notice concerning habitability:17        (1) Before a tenant initially enters into or renews a 18    rental agreement for a dwelling unit, the landlord, or any 19    person authorized to enter into a rental agreement on the 20    landlord's behalf, shall disclose to the tenant in 21    writing:22            (A) any code violations which have been cited by 23        the municipality or other oversight body during the 24        previous 12 months for the dwelling unit and common 25        areas and provide written notice of the pendency of 26        any code enforcement litigation or administrative   HB3687- 37 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1        hearing. The written notice shall provide the case 2        number of the litigation or the identification number 3        of the administrative hearing proceeding and a listing 4        of any code violations cited; and5            (B) any notice of intent by the municipality or 6        any utility provider to terminate water, gas, 7        electrical, or other utility service to the dwelling 8        unit or common areas. The disclosure shall state the 9        type of service being terminated, the intended date of 10        termination, and whether the termination will affect 11        the dwelling unit, common areas, or both.12        (2) If the landlord fails to comply with this 13    subsection, the tenant may terminate the rental agreement 14    by written notice. The written notice shall specify the 15    date of termination no later than 30 days after the date of 16    written notice.

Security Deposits shall be returned in full to the 9tenant, provided that the tenant has paid all rent due in full 10for the term of the lease and has caused no actual damage to 11the premises.12    The park owner shall furnish the tenant, within 15 days 13after termination or expiration of the lease, an itemized list 14of the damages incurred upon the premises and the estimated 15cost for the repair of each item. The tenant's failure to 16object to the itemized list within 15 days shall constitute an 17agreement upon the amount of damages specified therein. The 18park owner's failure to furnish such itemized list of damages 19shall constitute an agreement that no damages have been 20incurred upon the premises and the entire security deposit 21shall become immediately due and owing to the tenant.22    The tenant's failure to furnish the park owner a 23forwarding address shall excuse the park owner from furnishing 24the list required by this Section.25    (b) A park owner of any park regularly containing 25 or 26more mobile homes shall pay interest to the tenant, on any   HB3687- 62 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1deposit held by the park owner, computed from the date of the 2deposit at a rate equal to the interest paid by the largest 3commercial bank, as measured by total assets, having its main 4banking premises in this State on minimum deposit passbook 5savings accounts as of December 31 of the preceding year on any 6such deposit held by the park owner for more than 6 months. 7However, in the event that any portion of the amount deposited 8is utilized during the period for which it is deposited in 9order to compensate the owner for non-payment of rent or to 10make a good faith reimbursement to the owner for damage caused 11by the tenant, the principal on which the interest accrues may 12be recomputed to reflect the reduction for the period 13commencing on the first day of the calendar month following 14the reduction.15    The park owner shall, within 30 days after the end of each 1612-month period, pay to the tenant any interest owed under 17this Section in cash, provided, however, that the amount owed 18may be applied to rent due if the owner and tenant agree 19thereto.20    A park owner who willfully fails or refuses to pay the 21interest required by this Act shall, upon a finding by a 22circuit court that he willfully failed or refused to pay, be 23liable for an amount equal to the amount of the security 24deposit, together with court costs and a reasonable attorney's 25fee.26    (c) A park owner, as landlord, shall hold in trust all   HB3687- 63 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1security deposits received from a tenant in one or more banks, 2savings banks, or credit unions, the accounts of which are 3insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the 4National Credit Union Administration Share Insurance Fund, or 5other applicable entity under law. A security deposit and the 6interest due under subsection (b) of this Section is the 7property of the tenant until the deposit is returned to the 8tenant or used to compensate, or applied to the tenant's 9obligations to, the park owner, as landlord, in accordance 10with the lease or applicable State and local law. The security 11deposit shall not be commingled with the assets of the park 12owner, and shall not be subject to the claims of any creditor 13of the park owner or any party claiming an interest in the 14deposit through the park owner, including a foreclosing 15mortgagee or trustee in bankruptcy; provided that this 16subsection does not prevent a foreclosing mortgagee, receiver, 17or trustee from taking over control of the applicable bank 18account holding the security deposits, which may include 19moving the security deposits to another bank account meeting 20the requirements of this Section, provided that the mortgagee, 21receiver, or trustee:22        (1) shall continue to hold the security deposits in 23    trust as provided in, and subject to, the provisions of 24    this Section; and25        (2) is entitled to use a security deposit to 26    compensate, and apply a security deposit to discharge the   HB3687- 64 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    obligations of the tenant to, the park owner as permitted 2    by the lease or applicable State and local law.3(Source: P.A. 98-1062, eff. 1-1-15.) 4    Section 999.

Short title. This Act may be cited as the Let 5the People Lift the Ban Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that:7        (1) There is a significant shortage of safe, 8    affordable, and healthy rental housing in the State, 9    especially for hundreds of thousands of lower-income 10    renters. One-third of residents, or nearly 1.6 million 11    households, depend on rental housing.12        (2) The rate at which rent has increased in the State 13    has continued to outpace the increase in residents' real 14    wages, resulting in an increasing rent burden borne by 15    households, especially vulnerable populations. This 16    growing burden threatens the quality and stability of 17    housing available to renters.18        (3) Many households that depend on rental housing are 19    low-income and are rent-burdened, meaning that they pay 20    more than 30% of the household income on rent. 21    Additionally, some of these households are severely 22    cost-burdened, meaning that the household must devote more 23    than 50% of the household income to paying rent, leaving   HB3687- 2 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    little for other household necessities, such as health 2    care, education, vocational training, transportation, or 3    utilities.4        (4) An inability to find affordable housing negatively 5    impacts tenants' economic stability, health and 6    well-being, and capacity to participate in their 7    communities. A lack of stable housing may limit a parent's 8    ability to maintain employment, a child's capacity to 9    succeed at school, and, for lower-income families, the 10    potential to escape the cycle of poverty.11        (5) Tenants' inability to find and retain affordable 12    housing results in increased rates of involuntary 13    displacement, eviction, and property turnover, creating 14    additional burdens for landlords and property owners, 15    social service agencies, local governments, and the 16    judicial system, as well as renter households. 17    Section 10. Purpose. The purpose of this Act is to promote 18the maintenance and expansion of the supply of healthy, 19accessible, safe, and affordable rental housing, and to 20establish the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants 21in the rental of dwelling units in the State. This Act is 22remedial in its general purpose and shall be construed 23liberally to achieve its objectives. 24    Section 15. Definitions.

In each case, the 17    tenant may recover an amount equal to not more than 2 18    months' rent or twice the damages sustained by the tenant, 19    whichever is greater, and reasonable attorney's fees.20    (f) At any time prior to the issuance of any order of 21possession or eviction order made under Article IX of the Code 22of Civil Procedure, the tenant has a one-time right to cure the 23nonpayment of rent by paying the landlord unpaid rent, owed 24from the date of nonpayment to the date of payment, together 25with all filing fees and costs paid by the landlord and all 26fees and costs expended by the landlord for service of   HB3687- 19 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1process, but not including attorney fees.

If the tenant does not vacate the 8property within one month after the expiration of the 14-day 9period or the end of the next rental period, whichever is 10longer, then the tenant's written notice shall be deemed 11withdrawn and the rental agreement shall remain in full force 12and effect. If the rental agreement is terminated, the 13landlord shall return the security deposit immediately upon 14the tenant tendering possession.15    (c) If the landlord is not in material compliance with the 16rental agreement or with Section 30, the tenant may recover 17damages and obtain injunctive relief for any material 18noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or 19with Section 30.

If the landlord fails to correct 7    the condition within 24 hours after being notified by the 8    tenant, the tenant may:9            (A) withhold from the monthly rent an amount that 10        reasonably reflects the reduced value of the premises 11        due to the material noncompliance or failure;12            (B) procure reasonable amounts of heat, running 13        water, hot water, electricity, gas, or plumbing 14        service and, upon presentation to the landlord of paid 15        receipts, deduct the cost from the tenant's rent;16            (C) recover damages based upon the diminution in 17        the fair rental value of the dwelling unit and 18        reasonable attorney fees; or19            (D) procure substitute housing and not pay rent 20        for the period of noncompliance. The tenant may 21        recover the cost of reasonable value of the substitute 22        housing up to an amount equal to the monthly rent and 23        reasonable fees.24        (2) In addition to the remedy under paragraph (1), the 25    tenant may terminate the rental agreement by written 26    notice to the landlord if the landlord fails to supply   HB3687- 22 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    heat, running water, hot water, electricity, gas, or 2    plumbing that the rental agreement requires the landlord 3    to provide, or Internet access if the rental agreement 4    requires the landlord to provide Internet access, for more 5    than 72 hours after the tenant has notified the landlord. 6    If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall 7    return all security deposits and the tenant shall deliver 8    possession of the dwelling unit to the landlord within 30 9    days after the expiration of the 72-hour time period 10    specified in the written notice or the end of the next 11    rental period, whichever is longer. The landlord shall 12    return the security deposit immediately upon the tenant 13    delivering possession. If the tenant does not vacate the 14    property within 30 days after the notification of 15    termination or the end of the next rental period, 16    whichever is longer, then the tenant's written notice 17    shall be deemed withdrawn and the rental agreement shall 18    remain in full force and effect.19        (3) The tenant may not exercise the tenant's rights 20    under subsection (c) of Section 35 if the condition was 21    caused by the inability of a utility supplier or Internet 22    provider to provide service, unless the landlord caused 23    the inability of the utility supplier or Internet 24    provider, or by the deliberate or negligent act or 25    omission of the tenant, a member of the tenant's family, 26    or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent.  HB3687- 23 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    (e) A tenant has the following remedies if there is a fire 2or casualty:3        (1) If the dwelling unit or premises is damaged or 4    destroyed by fire or casualty to an extent that the 5    dwelling unit or premises is in material noncompliance 6    with the rental agreement or with subsection (c) of 7    Section 35, the tenant may immediately vacate the premises 8    and notify the landlord in writing within 14 days after 9    vacating the premises of the tenant's intention to 10    terminate the rental agreement, in which case the rental 11    agreement terminates as of the date of fire or casualty.12        (2) If continued occupancy is lawful, the tenant may 13    vacate any part of the dwelling unit rendered unusable by 14    the fire or casualty, in which case the tenant's liability 15    for rent is reduced in proportion to the diminution in the 16    fair rental value of the dwelling unit.17        (3) If the tenant desires to continue the tenancy and 18    if the landlord has promised or begun work to repair the 19    damage or destruction but fails to carry out the work to 20    restore the dwelling unit or common area diligently and 21    within a reasonable time, the tenant may notify the 22    landlord in writing within 14 days after the tenant 23    becomes aware that work is not being carried out 24    diligently or within a reasonable time of the tenant's 25    intention to terminate the rental agreement, in which case 26    the rental agreement terminates as of the date of the fire   HB3687- 24 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    or casualty.2        (4) If the rental agreement is terminated, the 3    landlord shall return the security deposit within 48 4    hours. When the landlord accounts for rent after the 5    tenant has terminated the rental agreement, the landlord 6    may not charge rent to the tenant for any date after the 7    date of the fire or casualty.8        (5) A tenant may not exercise remedies in this 9    subsection if the fire or casualty damage was caused by 10    the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, 11    a member of the tenant's family, or a person on the 12    premises with the tenant's consent.13    (f) A tenant may withhold rent to undertake minor repairs 14as follows:15        (1) If the landlord is not in material compliance with 16    the rental agreement or with Section 30 and the reasonable 17    cost of compliance does not exceed $500 or one-half 18    month's rent, whichever amount is greater, the tenant may 19    notify the landlord in writing that, if the landlord does 20    not remedy the condition within 14 days after receipt of 21    the written notice or as promptly as conditions require in 22    case of emergency, the tenant will correct the condition 23    and withhold the cost of the repair from the tenant's next 24    rent payment. The tenant shall have work done in a 25    workmanlike manner. The tenant shall submit to the 26    landlord a paid bill from an appropriate tradesperson or   HB3687- 25 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    supplier at the same time as deducting the amount from the 2    tenant's rent. The tenant may not expend or deduct more 3    than the amount specified in this subsection.4        (2) A tenant shall not repair at the landlord's 5    expense or deduct rent if the condition was caused by the 6    deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a 7    member of the tenant's family, or other person on the 8    premises with the tenant's permission.9        (3) Before correcting a condition affecting facilities 10    shared by more than one dwelling unit, the tenant shall 11    notify all other affected tenants of the tenant's plans 12    and so arrange the work as to create the least practicable 13    inconvenience to the other tenants. 14    Section 40. Tenant obligations. The tenant shall:15        (1) comply with all obligations imposed upon tenants 16    by law applicable to the dwelling unit;17        (2) keep the part of the premises that the tenant 18    occupies and uses as safe as the condition of the premises 19    permits;20        (3) dispose from the dwelling unit all ashes, rubbish, 21    garbage, and other waste in a clean and safe manner;22        (4) keep all plumbing fixtures in the dwelling unit or 23    used by the tenant as clean as conditions permits;24        (5) reasonably use all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, 25    heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and other   HB3687- 26 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    facilities and appliances, including elevators, in the 2    premises;3        (6) not deliberately destroy, deface, damage, impair, 4    or remove any part of the premises or knowingly permit any 5    person to do so;6        (7) not disturb the tenant's neighbors' peaceful 7    enjoyment of the premises; and8        (8) unless otherwise agreed, only occupy the dwelling 9    unit as a dwelling unit. 10    Section 45. Landlord rights.11    (a) In addition to any rights provided under federal and 12State law, a landlord has the rights specified in this 13Section.14    (b) A landlord has the following rights of entry and 15restrictions on entry:16        (1) A tenant shall not unreasonably withhold consent 17    to allow the landlord to enter the dwelling unit to:18            (A) inspect the premises or conduct inspections 19        authorized or required by any governmental agency;20            (B) make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, 21        alterations, or improvements, including when work 22        elsewhere in the building requires access through the 23        tenant's premises;24            (C) supply necessary or agreed upon services;25            (D) exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or   HB3687- 27 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1        actual purchasers, mortgagees, workers, or 2        contractors;3            (E) exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective 4        tenants 60 days or less prior to the expiration of the 5        existing rental agreement; or6            (F) determine a tenant's compliance with 7        provisions in the rental agreement.8        (2) The landlord may only enter at reasonable times, 9    except in case of an emergency. An entry between 8:00 a.m. 10    and 8:00 p.m. or at any other time expressly requested by 11    the tenant shall be presumed reasonable. The following 12    also apply to the landlord's entry:13            (A) A landlord may enter the dwelling unit without 14        consent of the tenant in case of an emergency.15            (B) The landlord shall not abuse the right of 16        access or use it to harass the tenant.17            (C) Except in cases of an emergency, the landlord 18        shall give the tenant at least 2 days' written notice 19        of the landlord's intent to enter. The landlord shall 20        provide this written notice directly to each dwelling 21        unit by mail, telephone, or written notice or by other 22        reasonable means designed in good faith to provide 23        written notice to the tenant. If access is required 24        because of repair work for common facilities or 25        multiple apartments, a general written notice may be 26        given by the landlord to all potentially affected   HB3687- 28 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1        tenants that entry may be required. When access is 2        authorized due to an emergency, the landlord shall 3        give the tenant written notice of entry within 2 days 4        after the entry.5            (D) If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, 6        the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel 7        access or terminate the rental agreement. In either 8        case, the landlord may recover damages and reasonable 9        attorney's fees.10            (E) If the landlord makes an unlawful entry or 11        entry in an unreasonable manner, or makes repeated 12        unreasonable demands for entry that have the effect of 13        harassing the tenant, the tenant may obtain injunctive 14        relief to prevent the recurrence of the conduct or 15        terminate the rental agreement. In each case, the 16        tenant may recover an amount equal to one month's rent 17        or twice the damages sustained, whichever is greater, 18        and reasonable attorney's fees.19    (c) A landlord has a right to adopt rules and regulations 20as follows:21        (1) The landlord may adopt general rules or 22    regulations concerning the tenant's use and occupancy of 23    the premises.

Landlord remedies.19    (a) The landlord has the following remedies when the 20tenant fails to pay rent:21        (1) If the tenant is not in material compliance with 22    the obligation to pay rent, the landlord may deliver to 23    the tenant a written notice of the landlord's intention to 24    terminate the rental agreement. The landlord shall serve 25    the written notice in compliance with State law. If the   HB3687- 30 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    tenant does not materially comply with the written notice 2    within 5 days after receipt, the landlord may file an 3    eviction action to terminate the rental agreement.4        (2) Nothing in this subsection shall affect a 5    landlord's obligation to provide notice of termination of 6    tenancy in subsidized housing as required under federal 7    law or regulations.8        (3) A landlord may also maintain an action for rent or 9    damages without terminating the rental agreement.10    (b) If the landlord alleges that the tenant is not in 11material compliance with a rental agreement or the obligations 12in Section 40, the landlord may deliver written notice to the 13tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the 14alleged breach. The landlord shall serve the written notice in 15compliance with State law. The written notice may provide that 16the rental agreement will terminate upon a date no less than 10 17days after the date of the written notice. The tenant shall 18have the amount of time specified in the written notice to 19remedy any alleged breach by the tenant prior to the date of 20termination. If the breach is not remedied, the landlord may 21file an eviction to terminate the rental agreement, as 22provided in the written notice. The landlord may recover 23damages and obtain injunctive relief for any material 24noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or the 25obligations in Section 40. If the landlord does not file an 26eviction action within 30 days after the notification of   HB3687- 31 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1termination or the end of the next rental period, whichever is 2longer, then the landlord's written notice shall be deemed 3withdrawn and the rental agreement shall remain in full force 4and effect.5    (c) The landlord has the right to determine abandonment of 6the dwelling unit and dispose of personal property. The 7landlord may determine that the tenant has abandoned the 8dwelling unit and personal property in the following 9circumstances:10        (1) The tenant has provided written notice to the 11    landlord indicating the tenant's intention not to return 12    to the dwelling unit.13        (2) All persons entitled under a rental agreement have 14    been absent from the dwelling unit for a period of 32 days, 15    or for one rental period when the rental agreement is for 16    less than a month, and the persons have removed their 17    personal property from the premises and rent for that 18    period is unpaid. However, if any person entitled to 19    occupancy provides the landlord with written notice 20    indicating that a tenant intends to occupy the dwelling 21    unit and make full payments of all amounts due to the 22    landlord, then the landlord may not determine that the 23    tenant has abandoned the property.24        (3) If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the 25    landlord shall make a good faith effort to rent it at a 26    fair rental value. A good faith effort includes the   HB3687- 32 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    acceptance of reasonable subleases. If the landlord 2    succeeds in renting the dwelling unit at a fair rental 3    value, the tenant shall only be liable for the amount by 4    which the rent due from the date of abandonment to the 5    termination of the initial rental agreement exceeds the 6    fair rental value subsequently received by the landlord 7    from the date of abandonment to the termination of the 8    initial rental agreement. If the landlord makes a good 9    faith effort to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental 10    value and is unsuccessful, the tenant shall be liable for 11    the rent due for the period of the rental agreement. The 12    tenant shall also be liable for reasonable advertising and 13    redecoration costs incurred by the landlord in re-renting 14    the dwelling unit.15        (4) Unless otherwise agreed, if, upon termination of a 16    tenancy, including, but not limited to, a termination 17    after expiration of a lease or by surrender or abandonment 18    of the premises, a tenant has left personal property on 19    the premises, and the landlord reasonably believes that 20    the tenant has abandoned the personal property, the 21    landlord may dispose of the property according to the 22    following procedures:23            (A) If the landlord in good faith reasonably 24        determines that the tenant has left personal property 25        that is valueless or of such little value that the cost 26        of storing and conducting a sale would probably exceed   HB3687- 33 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1        the amount that would be realized from the sale, the 2        landlord shall retain the property either in the 3        dwelling unit or remove and store the abandoned 4        property from the dwelling unit and may dispose of the 5        property after 7 days. The landlord shall not be 6        required to provide written notice to the tenant of 7        the landlord's intent to dispose of property pursuant 8        to this subsection.9            (B) If the landlord in good faith reasonably 10        determines that the tenant has left personal property 11        that has value, the landlord shall notify the tenant 12        in writing of the landlord's demand that the tenant 13        remove the property within dates set forth in the 14        written notice, but no less than 7 days after delivery 15        of the written notice. The landlord may deliver this 16        written notice by posting it in a prominent location 17        inside the dwelling unit or on the front door of the 18        dwelling unit or by electronic means if the parties 19        had previously communicated electronically.20            (C) If the tenant does not remove the property 21        within the time specified, the landlord may sell the 22        property at a public sale or at a commercially 23        reasonable private sale. The landlord may retain the 24        proceeds of the sale to recover any rent owed by the 25        tenant to the landlord. If the proceeds, less 26        reasonable costs incurred by the sale or storage,   HB3687- 34 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1        exceed any rent owed to the landlord, the landlord 2        shall retain the proceeds for one year. If the tenant 3        does not claim the proceeds within one year, the 4        proceeds shall be the property of the landlord.5        (5) At any time that the landlord is storing personal 6    property pursuant to this subsection, the landlord shall 7    exercise reasonable care of the property, but shall not be 8    responsible to the tenant for any loss except for damage 9    caused by the landlord's deliberate or negligent act or 10    omission. The landlord may elect to store the property in 11    or about the previously vacated premises. The landlord 12    shall be entitled to the cost of storage for the period of 13    time that the property has remained in the landlord's 14    safekeeping. In this case, the storage shall not exceed 15    commercially reasonable storage rates. If the tenant's 16    property is removed to a commercial storage company, the 17    storage cost shall include the actual charge for the 18    storage and removal from the premises to the place of 19    storage.20        (6) If the tenant timely responds in writing of the 21    tenant's intention to remove the personal property from 22    the premises and does not do so within the time period in 23    the landlord's written notice or a mutually agreeable 24    date, whichever is later, it is conclusively presumed that 25    they have abandoned the property.26    (d) If the landlord accepts rent, including holding   HB3687- 35 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1payment, knowing that the landlord alleges a lease violation, 2including a default in the payment of rent by the tenant, the 3landlord waives the right to terminate the rental agreement 4for that breach.5    (e) If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord 6may file a claim for possession or for rent and a separate 7claim for damages for breach of the rental agreement.8    (f) No tenant shall be required to renew a rental 9agreement more than 60 days prior to the termination date of 10the rental agreement. If the landlord violates this 11subsection, the tenant shall recover one month's rent or 12actual damages, whichever is greater.13    The landlord shall notify the tenant in writing at least 1460 days prior to the stated termination date of the rental 15agreement of the landlord's intent to terminate a 16month-to-month tenancy or not renew an existing rental 17agreement. If the landlord fails to give required written 18notice, the tenant may remain in the dwelling unit for up to 19120 days after the date on which the required written notice is 20given to the tenant, regardless of the date specified in the 21existing rental agreement. During the 120 days, the terms and 22conditions of the tenancy shall be the same as the terms and 23conditions during the last month of tenancy. 24    Section 55. Landlord obligations.25    (a) The landlord shall maintain the premises in compliance   HB3687- 36 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1with all applicable provisions of law, including subsection 2(c) of Section 30, and shall promptly make any and all repairs 3to fulfill this obligation.4    (b) The landlord and tenant of any dwelling unit may agree 5that the tenant is to perform specified repairs, maintenance 6tasks, alterations, or remodeling only if:7        (1) the agreement of the parties is entered into in 8    good faith and not for the purpose of evading obligations 9    of the landlord and is set forth in a separate writing 10    signed by the parties and supported by adequate 11    consideration; and12        (2) the agreement does not diminish or affect the 13    obligation of the landlord to other tenants on the 14    premises.15    (c) A landlord has the following obligations relating to 16providing a written notice concerning habitability:17        (1) Before a tenant initially enters into or renews a 18    rental agreement for a dwelling unit, the landlord, or any 19    person authorized to enter into a rental agreement on the 20    landlord's behalf, shall disclose to the tenant in 21    writing:22            (A) any code violations which have been cited by 23        the municipality or other oversight body during the 24        previous 12 months for the dwelling unit and common 25        areas and provide written notice of the pendency of 26        any code enforcement litigation or administrative   HB3687- 37 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1        hearing. The written notice shall provide the case 2        number of the litigation or the identification number 3        of the administrative hearing proceeding and a listing 4        of any code violations cited; and5            (B) any notice of intent by the municipality or 6        any utility provider to terminate water, gas, 7        electrical, or other utility service to the dwelling 8        unit or common areas.

Security deposits and 3interest under this Act are governed by Section 60 of the Let 4the People Lift the Ban Act. 5    (a) If the lease requires the tenant to provide any 6deposit with the park owner for the term of the lease, or any 7part thereof, said deposit shall be considered a Security 8Deposit. Security Deposits shall be returned in full to the 9tenant, provided that the tenant has paid all rent due in full 10for the term of the lease and has caused no actual damage to 11the premises.12    The park owner shall furnish the tenant, within 15 days 13after termination or expiration of the lease, an itemized list 14of the damages incurred upon the premises and the estimated 15cost for the repair of each item. The tenant's failure to 16object to the itemized list within 15 days shall constitute an 17agreement upon the amount of damages specified therein. The 18park owner's failure to furnish such itemized list of damages 19shall constitute an agreement that no damages have been 20incurred upon the premises and the entire security deposit 21shall become immediately due and owing to the tenant.22    The tenant's failure to furnish the park owner a 23forwarding address shall excuse the park owner from furnishing 24the list required by this Section.25    (b) A park owner of any park regularly containing 25 or 26more mobile homes shall pay interest to the tenant, on any   HB3687- 62 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1deposit held by the park owner, computed from the date of the 2deposit at a rate equal to the interest paid by the largest 3commercial bank, as measured by total assets, having its main 4banking premises in this State on minimum deposit passbook 5savings accounts as of December 31 of the preceding year on any 6such deposit held by the park owner for more than 6 months. 7However, in the event that any portion of the amount deposited 8is utilized during the period for which it is deposited in 9order to compensate the owner for non-payment of rent or to 10make a good faith reimbursement to the owner for damage caused 11by the tenant, the principal on which the interest accrues may 12be recomputed to reflect the reduction for the period 13commencing on the first day of the calendar month following 14the reduction.15    The park owner shall, within 30 days after the end of each 1612-month period, pay to the tenant any interest owed under 17this Section in cash, provided, however, that the amount owed 18may be applied to rent due if the owner and tenant agree 19thereto.20    A park owner who willfully fails or refuses to pay the 21interest required by this Act shall, upon a finding by a 22circuit court that he willfully failed or refused to pay, be 23liable for an amount equal to the amount of the security 24deposit, together with court costs and a reasonable attorney's 25fee.26    (c) A park owner, as landlord, shall hold in trust all   HB3687- 63 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1security deposits received from a tenant in one or more banks, 2savings banks, or credit unions, the accounts of which are 3insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the 4National Credit Union Administration Share Insurance Fund, or 5other applicable entity under law. A security deposit and the 6interest due under subsection (b) of this Section is the 7property of the tenant until the deposit is returned to the 8tenant or used to compensate, or applied to the tenant's 9obligations to, the park owner, as landlord, in accordance 10with the lease or applicable State and local law. The security 11deposit shall not be commingled with the assets of the park 12owner, and shall not be subject to the claims of any creditor 13of the park owner or any party claiming an interest in the 14deposit through the park owner, including a foreclosing 15mortgagee or trustee in bankruptcy; provided that this 16subsection does not prevent a foreclosing mortgagee, receiver, 17or trustee from taking over control of the applicable bank 18account holding the security deposits, which may include 19moving the security deposits to another bank account meeting 20the requirements of this Section, provided that the mortgagee, 21receiver, or trustee:22        (1) shall continue to hold the security deposits in 23    trust as provided in, and subject to, the provisions of 24    this Section; and25        (2) is entitled to use a security deposit to 26    compensate, and apply a security deposit to discharge the   HB3687- 64 -LRB104 09704 RTM 19770 b1    obligations of the tenant to, the park owner as permitted 2    by the lease or applicable State and local law.3(Source: P.A. 98-1062, eff. 1-1-15.) 4    Section 999.
