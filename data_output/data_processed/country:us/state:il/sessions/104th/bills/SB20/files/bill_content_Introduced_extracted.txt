If a total amount of less 6than $1 is payable, refundable, or creditable, the amount 7shall be disregarded if it is less than $0.50 and shall be 8increased to $1 if it is $0.50 or more. Notwithstanding any 9other provision of this Article concerning the time within 10which a taxpayer may file a return, any such taxpayer who 11ceases to engage in the kind of business that makes the person 12responsible for filing returns under this Article shall file a 13final return under this Article with the Department within one 14month after discontinuing such business.15    Each taxpayer under this Article shall make estimated 16payments to the Department on or before the 7th, 15th, 22nd, 17and last day of the month during which tax liability to the 18Department is incurred. The payments shall be in an amount not 19less than the lower of either 22.5% of the taxpayer's actual 20tax liability for the month or 25% of the taxpayer's actual tax 21liability for the same calendar month of the preceding year. 22The amount of the quarter-monthly payments shall be credited 23against the final tax liability of the taxpayer's return for 24that month.

The credit 11evidenced by the credit memorandum may be assigned by the 12taxpayer to a similar taxpayer under this Act, in accordance 13with reasonable rules to be prescribed by the Department. If 14no such request is made, the taxpayer may credit the excess 15payment against tax liability subsequently to be remitted to 16the Department under this Act, in accordance with reasonable 17rules prescribed by the Department. If the Department 18subsequently determines that all or any part of the credit 19taken was not actually due to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's 20discount shall be reduced, if necessary, to reflect the 21difference between the credit taken and that actually due, and 22that taxpayer shall be liable for penalties and interest on 23the difference.24    If a taxpayer fails to sign a return within 30 days after 25the proper notice and demand for signature by the Department 26is received by the taxpayer, the return shall be considered   SB0020- 91 -LRB104 07738 BDA 17783 b1valid and any amount shown to be due on the return shall be 2deemed assessed.3(Source: P.A. 101-27, eff. 6-25-19; 101-593, eff. 12-4-19.) 4    Section 820.

The credit 11evidenced by the credit memorandum may be assigned by the 12taxpayer to a similar taxpayer under this Act, in accordance 13with reasonable rules to be prescribed by the Department. If 14no such request is made, the taxpayer may credit the excess 15payment against tax liability subsequently to be remitted to 16the Department under this Act, in accordance with reasonable 17rules prescribed by the Department. If the Department 18subsequently determines that all or any part of the credit 19taken was not actually due to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's 20discount shall be reduced, if necessary, to reflect the 21difference between the credit taken and that actually due, and 22that taxpayer shall be liable for penalties and interest on 23the difference.24    If a taxpayer fails to sign a return within 30 days after 25the proper notice and demand for signature by the Department 26is received by the taxpayer, the return shall be considered   SB0020- 91 -LRB104 07738 BDA 17783 b1valid and any amount shown to be due on the return shall be 2deemed assessed.3(Source: P.A. 101-27, eff. 6-25-19; 101-593, eff. 12-4-19.) 4    Section 820.
