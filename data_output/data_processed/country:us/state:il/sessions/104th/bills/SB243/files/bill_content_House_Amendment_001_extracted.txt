Failure to comply with a written request, extend the time 24for response, or deny a request within 5 business days after 25its receipt shall be considered a denial of the request. A 26public body that fails to respond to a request within the   10400SB0243ham001- 31 -LRB104 07181 SPS 27125 a1requisite periods in this Section but thereafter provides the 2requester with copies of the requested public records may not 3impose a fee for such copies.

If the requester and the public 11body agree to extend the period for compliance, a failure by 12the public body to comply with any previous deadlines shall 13not be treated as a denial of the request for the records. 14    (f) When additional time is required for any of the above 15reasons, the public body shall, within 5 business days after 16receipt of the request, notify the person making the request 17of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the 18response will be forthcoming. Failure to respond within the 19time permitted for extension shall be considered a denial of 20the request. A public body that fails to respond to a request 21within the time permitted for extension but thereafter 22provides the requester with copies of the requested public 23records may not impose a fee for those copies. A public body 24that requests an extension and subsequently fails to respond 25to the request may not treat the request as unduly burdensome 26under subsection (g).  10400SB0243ham001- 33 -LRB104 07181 SPS 27125 a1    (g) Requests calling for all records falling within a 2category shall be complied with unless compliance with the 3request would be unduly burdensome for the complying public 4body and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden 5on the public body outweighs the public interest in the 6information. Before invoking this exemption, the public body 7shall extend to the person making the request an opportunity 8to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to 9manageable proportions. If any public body responds to a 10categorical request by stating that compliance would unduly 11burden its operation and the conditions described above are 12met, it shall do so in writing, specifying the reasons why it 13would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance 14will so burden the operations of the public body. Such a 15response shall be treated as a denial of the request for 16information. 17    Repeated requests from the same person for the same 18records that are unchanged or identical to records previously 19provided or properly denied under this Act shall be deemed 20unduly burdensome under this provision.21    (h) Each public body may promulgate rules and regulations 22in conformity with the provisions of this Section pertaining 23to the availability of records and procedures to be followed, 24including:25        (i) the times and places where such records will be 26    made available, and  10400SB0243ham001- 34 -LRB104 07181 SPS 27125 a1        (ii) the persons from whom such records may be 2    obtained.3    (i) The time periods for compliance or denial of a request 4to inspect or copy records set out in this Section shall not 5apply to requests for records made for a commercial purpose, 6requests by a recurrent requester, or voluminous requests. 7Such requests shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 83.1, 3.2, and 3.6 of this Act, as applicable. 9    (j) Within 5 business days after its receipt of the 10request, a public body that has a reasonable belief that a 11request was not submitted by a person may require the 12requester to verify orally or in writing that the requester is 13a person. The deadline for the public body to respond to the 14request shall be tolled until the requester verifies that he 15or she is a person. If the requester fails to verify that he or 16she is a person within 30 days after the public body requests 17such a verification, then the public body may deny the 18request. For purposes of this subsection (j), a public body 19may not require the requester to submit personal information, 20private information, or identifying information to verify that 21the requester is a person.22(Source: P.A. 101-81, eff. 7-12-19.) 23    (5 ILCS 140/4)  (from Ch. 116, par. 204)24    Sec. 4.

If the requester and the public 11body agree to extend the period for compliance, a failure by 12the public body to comply with any previous deadlines shall 13not be treated as a denial of the request for the records. 14    (f) When additional time is required for any of the above 15reasons, the public body shall, within 5 business days after 16receipt of the request, notify the person making the request 17of the reasons for the extension and the date by which the 18response will be forthcoming. Failure to respond within the 19time permitted for extension shall be considered a denial of 20the request. A public body that fails to respond to a request 21within the time permitted for extension but thereafter 22provides the requester with copies of the requested public 23records may not impose a fee for those copies.

Before invoking this exemption, the public body 7shall extend to the person making the request an opportunity 8to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to 9manageable proportions. If any public body responds to a 10categorical request by stating that compliance would unduly 11burden its operation and the conditions described above are 12met, it shall do so in writing, specifying the reasons why it 13would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance 14will so burden the operations of the public body. Such a 15response shall be treated as a denial of the request for 16information. 17    Repeated requests from the same person for the same 18records that are unchanged or identical to records previously 19provided or properly denied under this Act shall be deemed 20unduly burdensome under this provision.21    (h) Each public body may promulgate rules and regulations 22in conformity with the provisions of this Section pertaining 23to the availability of records and procedures to be followed, 24including:25        (i) the times and places where such records will be 26    made available, and  10400SB0243ham001- 34 -LRB104 07181 SPS 27125 a1        (ii) the persons from whom such records may be 2    obtained.3    (i) The time periods for compliance or denial of a request 4to inspect or copy records set out in this Section shall not 5apply to requests for records made for a commercial purpose, 6requests by a recurrent requester, or voluminous requests. 7Such requests shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 83.1, 3.2, and 3.6 of this Act, as applicable. 9    (j) Within 5 business days after its receipt of the 10request, a public body that has a reasonable belief that a 11request was not submitted by a person may require the 12requester to verify orally or in writing that the requester is 13a person. The deadline for the public body to respond to the 14request shall be tolled until the requester verifies that he 15or she is a person. If the requester fails to verify that he or 16she is a person within 30 days after the public body requests 17such a verification, then the public body may deny the 18request. For purposes of this subsection (j), a public body 19may not require the requester to submit personal information, 20private information, or identifying information to verify that 21the requester is a person.22(Source: P.A. 101-81, eff. 7-12-19.) 23    (5 ILCS 140/4)  (from Ch. 116, par. 204)24    Sec. 4.
