This presumption shall also apply to any hernia or 10hearing loss suffered by an employee employed as a 11firefighter, EMT, EMT-I, A-EMT, or paramedic. However, this 12presumption shall not apply to any employee who has been 13employed as a firefighter, EMT, or paramedic for less than 5 14years at the time he or she files an Application for Adjustment 15of Claim concerning this condition or impairment with the 16Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission. The rebuttable 17presumption established under this subsection is intended to 18be a strong presumption supported by compelling policy 19considerations to compensate the victims and their families 20who succumb to the conditions described in this subsection. 21This presumption is intended to shift the burden of proof to 22the employing entity and any party attacking the presumption 23must establish by clear and convincing evidence an independent 24and non-work related cause for the condition or disability 25listed in this subsection and prove that no aspect of the 26employment contributed to the condition. The rebuttable   HB1309- 8 -LRB104 07506 SPS 17550 b1presumption relating to hearing loss cannot be overcome with 2evidence allegedly showing that the injured employee did not 3meet the exposure thresholds listed in subsections (e) and (f) 4of Section 8. The rebuttable presumption established under 5this subsection, however, does not apply to an emergency 6medical technician (EMT), emergency medical 7technician-intermediate (EMT-I), advanced emergency medical 8technician (A-EMT), or paramedic employed by a private 9employer if the employee spends the preponderance of his or 10her work time for that employer engaged in medical transfers 11between medical care facilities or non-emergency medical 12transfers to or from medical care facilities. The changes made 13to this subsection by Public Act 98-291 shall be narrowly 14construed. The Finding and Decision of the Illinois Workers' 15Compensation Commission under only the rebuttable presumption 16provision of this subsection shall not be admissible or be 17deemed res judicata in any disability claim under the Illinois 18Pension Code arising out of the same medical condition; 19however, this sentence makes no change to the law set forth in 20Krohe v. City of Bloomington, 204 Ill.2d 392. 21(Source: P.A. 102-493, eff. 8-20-21.)
