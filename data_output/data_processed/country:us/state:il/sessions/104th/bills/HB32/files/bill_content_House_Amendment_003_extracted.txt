The requirement of a regular 7meeting agenda shall not preclude the consideration of items 8not specifically set forth in the agenda. Public notice of any 9special meeting except a meeting held in the event of a bona 10fide emergency, or of any rescheduled regular meeting, or of 11any reconvened meeting, shall be given at least 48 hours 12before such meeting, which notice shall also include the 13agenda for the special, rescheduled, or reconvened meeting, 14but the validity of any action taken by the public body which 15is germane to a subject on the agenda shall not be affected by 16other errors or omissions in the agenda. For the purposes of 17this Section, "bona fide emergency" includes the appointment 18of a temporary deputy township supervisor under the Township 19Code. The requirement of public notice of reconvened meetings 20does not apply to any case where the meeting was open to the 21public and (1) it is to be reconvened within 24 hours, or (2) 22an announcement of the time and place of the reconvened 23meeting was made at the original meeting and there is no change 24in the agenda.
