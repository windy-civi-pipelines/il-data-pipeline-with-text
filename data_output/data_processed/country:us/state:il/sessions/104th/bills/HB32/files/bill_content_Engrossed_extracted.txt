An agenda for each regular meeting 13shall be posted at the principal office of the public body and 14at the location where the meeting is to be held at least 48 15hours in advance of the holding of the meeting. A public body 16that has a website that the full-time staff of the public body 17maintains shall also post on its website the agenda of any 18regular meetings of the governing body of that public body. 19Any agenda of a regular meeting that is posted on a public 20body's website shall remain posted on the website until the 21regular meeting is concluded. The requirement of a regular 22meeting agenda shall not preclude the consideration of items 23not specifically set forth in the agenda. Public notice of any   HB0032 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 05560 RTM 15590 b1special meeting except a meeting held in the event of a bona 2fide emergency, or of any rescheduled regular meeting, or of 3any reconvened meeting, shall be given at least 48 hours 4before such meeting, which notice shall also include the 5agenda for the special, rescheduled, or reconvened meeting, 6but the validity of any action taken by the public body which 7is germane to a subject on the agenda shall not be affected by 8other errors or omissions in the agenda. For the purposes of 9this Section, "bona fide emergency" includes the appointment 10of a temporary deputy township supervisor under the Township 11Code. The requirement of public notice of reconvened meetings 12does not apply to any case where the meeting was open to the 13public and (1) it is to be reconvened within 24 hours, or (2) 14an announcement of the time and place of the reconvened 15meeting was made at the original meeting and there is no change 16in the agenda. Notice of an emergency meeting shall be given as 17soon as practicable, but in any event prior to the holding of 18such meeting, to any news medium which has filed an annual 19request for notice under subsection (b) of this Section.20    (b) Public notice shall be given by posting a copy of the 21notice at the principal office of the body holding the meeting 22or, if no such office exists, at the building in which the 23meeting is to be held. In addition, a public body that has a 24website that the full-time staff of the public body maintains 25shall post notice on its website of all meetings of the 26governing body of the public body. Any notice of an annual   HB0032 Engrossed- 3 -LRB104 05560 RTM 15590 b1schedule of meetings shall remain on the website until a new 2public notice of the schedule of regular meetings is approved. 3Any notice of a regular meeting that is posted on a public 4body's website shall remain posted on the website until the 5regular meeting is concluded.

The failure of a public body 15to post on its website notice of any meeting or the agenda of 16any meeting shall not invalidate any meeting or any actions 17taken at a meeting. 18    (c) Any agenda required under this Section shall set forth 19the general subject matter of any resolution or ordinance that 20will be the subject of final action at the meeting. The public 21body conducting a public meeting shall ensure that at least 22one copy of any requested notice and agenda for the meeting is 23continuously available for public review during the entire 2448-hour period preceding the meeting. Posting of the notice 25and agenda on a website that is maintained by the public body 26satisfies the requirement for continuous posting under this   HB0032 Engrossed- 4 -LRB104 05560 RTM 15590 b1subsection (c). If a notice or agenda is not continuously 2available for the full 48-hour period due to actions outside 3of the control of the public body, then that lack of 4availability does not invalidate any meeting or action taken 5at a meeting. 6(Source: P.A. 97-827, eff. 1-1-13.) 7    Section 10.

The Open Meetings Act is amended by changing 5Section 2.02 as follows: 6    (5 ILCS 120/2.02)  (from Ch. 102, par. 42.02)7    Sec. 2.02. Public notice of all meetings, whether open or 8closed to the public, shall be given as follows:9    (a) Every public body shall give public notice of the 10schedule of regular meetings at the beginning of each calendar 11or fiscal year and shall state the regular dates, times, and 12places of such meetings. An agenda for each regular meeting 13shall be posted at the principal office of the public body and 14at the location where the meeting is to be held at least 48 15hours in advance of the holding of the meeting. A public body 16that has a website that the full-time staff of the public body 17maintains shall also post on its website the agenda of any 18regular meetings of the governing body of that public body. 19Any agenda of a regular meeting that is posted on a public 20body's website shall remain posted on the website until the 21regular meeting is concluded. The requirement of a regular 22meeting agenda shall not preclude the consideration of items 23not specifically set forth in the agenda. Public notice of any   HB0032 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 05560 RTM 15590 b1special meeting except a meeting held in the event of a bona 2fide emergency, or of any rescheduled regular meeting, or of 3any reconvened meeting, shall be given at least 48 hours 4before such meeting, which notice shall also include the 5agenda for the special, rescheduled, or reconvened meeting, 6but the validity of any action taken by the public body which 7is germane to a subject on the agenda shall not be affected by 8other errors or omissions in the agenda. For the purposes of 9this Section, "bona fide emergency" includes the appointment 10of a temporary deputy township supervisor under the Township 11Code. The requirement of public notice of reconvened meetings 12does not apply to any case where the meeting was open to the 13public and (1) it is to be reconvened within 24 hours, or (2) 14an announcement of the time and place of the reconvened 15meeting was made at the original meeting and there is no change 16in the agenda. Notice of an emergency meeting shall be given as 17soon as practicable, but in any event prior to the holding of 18such meeting, to any news medium which has filed an annual 19request for notice under subsection (b) of this Section.20    (b) Public notice shall be given by posting a copy of the 21notice at the principal office of the body holding the meeting 22or, if no such office exists, at the building in which the 23meeting is to be held. In addition, a public body that has a 24website that the full-time staff of the public body maintains 25shall post notice on its website of all meetings of the 26governing body of the public body. Any notice of an annual   HB0032 Engrossed- 3 -LRB104 05560 RTM 15590 b1schedule of meetings shall remain on the website until a new 2public notice of the schedule of regular meetings is approved. 3Any notice of a regular meeting that is posted on a public 4body's website shall remain posted on the website until the 5regular meeting is concluded. The body shall supply copies of 6the notice of its regular meetings, and of the notice of any 7special, emergency, rescheduled or reconvened meeting, to any 8news medium that has filed an annual request for such notice. 9Any such news medium shall also be given the same notice of all 10special, emergency, rescheduled or reconvened meetings in the 11same manner as is given to members of the body provided such 12news medium has given the public body an address or telephone 13number within the territorial jurisdiction of the public body 14at which such notice may be given. The failure of a public body 15to post on its website notice of any meeting or the agenda of 16any meeting shall not invalidate any meeting or any actions 17taken at a meeting. 18    (c) Any agenda required under this Section shall set forth 19the general subject matter of any resolution or ordinance that 20will be the subject of final action at the meeting. The public 21body conducting a public meeting shall ensure that at least 22one copy of any requested notice and agenda for the meeting is 23continuously available for public review during the entire 2448-hour period preceding the meeting. Posting of the notice 25and agenda on a website that is maintained by the public body 26satisfies the requirement for continuous posting under this   HB0032 Engrossed- 4 -LRB104 05560 RTM 15590 b1subsection (c). If a notice or agenda is not continuously 2available for the full 48-hour period due to actions outside 3of the control of the public body, then that lack of 4availability does not invalidate any meeting or action taken 5at a meeting. 6(Source: P.A. 97-827, eff. 1-1-13.) 7    Section 10.
