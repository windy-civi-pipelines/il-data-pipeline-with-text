Public notice of all meetings, whether open or 9closed to the public, shall be given as follows:10    (a) Every public body shall give public notice of the 11schedule of regular meetings at the beginning of each calendar 12or fiscal year and shall state the regular dates, times, and 13places of such meetings. An agenda for each regular meeting 14shall be posted at the principal office of the public body and 15at the location where the meeting is to be held at least 48 16hours in advance of the holding of the meeting. A public body   10400HB0032ham004- 2 -LRB104 05560 RTM 24516 a1that has a website that the full-time staff of the public body 2maintains shall also post on its website the agenda of any 3regular meetings of the governing body of that public body. 4Any agenda of a regular meeting that is posted on a public 5body's website shall remain posted on the website until the 6regular meeting is concluded. The requirement of a regular 7meeting agenda shall not preclude the consideration of items 8not specifically set forth in the agenda. Public notice of any 9special meeting except a meeting held in the event of a bona 10fide emergency, or of any rescheduled regular meeting, or of 11any reconvened meeting, shall be given at least 48 hours 12before such meeting, which notice shall also include the 13agenda for the special, rescheduled, or reconvened meeting, 14but the validity of any action taken by the public body which 15is germane to a subject on the agenda shall not be affected by 16other errors or omissions in the agenda. For the purposes of 17this Section, "bona fide emergency" includes the appointment 18of a temporary deputy township supervisor under the Township 19Code. The requirement of public notice of reconvened meetings 20does not apply to any case where the meeting was open to the 21public and (1) it is to be reconvened within 24 hours, or (2) 22an announcement of the time and place of the reconvened 23meeting was made at the original meeting and there is no change 24in the agenda. Notice of an emergency meeting shall be given as 25soon as practicable, but in any event prior to the holding of 26such meeting, to any news medium which has filed an annual   10400HB0032ham004- 3 -LRB104 05560 RTM 24516 a1request for notice under subsection (b) of this Section.2    (b) Public notice shall be given by posting a copy of the 3notice at the principal office of the body holding the meeting 4or, if no such office exists, at the building in which the 5meeting is to be held. In addition, a public body that has a 6website that the full-time staff of the public body maintains 7shall post notice on its website of all meetings of the 8governing body of the public body. Any notice of an annual 9schedule of meetings shall remain on the website until a new 10public notice of the schedule of regular meetings is approved. 11Any notice of a regular meeting that is posted on a public 12body's website shall remain posted on the website until the 13regular meeting is concluded. The body shall supply copies of 14the notice of its regular meetings, and of the notice of any 15special, emergency, rescheduled or reconvened meeting, to any 16news medium that has filed an annual request for such notice. 17Any such news medium shall also be given the same notice of all 18special, emergency, rescheduled or reconvened meetings in the 19same manner as is given to members of the body provided such 20news medium has given the public body an address or telephone 21number within the territorial jurisdiction of the public body 22at which such notice may be given. The failure of a public body 23to post on its website notice of any meeting or the agenda of 24any meeting shall not invalidate any meeting or any actions 25taken at a meeting. 26    (c) Any agenda required under this Section shall set forth   10400HB0032ham004- 4 -LRB104 05560 RTM 24516 a1the general subject matter of any resolution or ordinance that 2will be the subject of final action at the meeting. The public 3body conducting a public meeting shall ensure that at least 4one copy of any requested notice and agenda for the meeting is 5continuously available for public review during the entire 648-hour period preceding the meeting. Posting of the notice 7and agenda on a website that is maintained by the public body 8satisfies the requirement for continuous posting under this 9subsection (c). If a notice or agenda is not continuously 10available for the full 48-hour period due to actions outside 11of the control of the public body, then that lack of 12availability does not invalidate any meeting or action taken 13at a meeting. 14(Source: P.A. 97-827, eff. 1-1-13.) 15    Section 10.

An agenda for each regular meeting 14shall be posted at the principal office of the public body and 15at the location where the meeting is to be held at least 48 16hours in advance of the holding of the meeting. A public body   10400HB0032ham004- 2 -LRB104 05560 RTM 24516 a1that has a website that the full-time staff of the public body 2maintains shall also post on its website the agenda of any 3regular meetings of the governing body of that public body. 4Any agenda of a regular meeting that is posted on a public 5body's website shall remain posted on the website until the 6regular meeting is concluded. The requirement of a regular 7meeting agenda shall not preclude the consideration of items 8not specifically set forth in the agenda. Public notice of any 9special meeting except a meeting held in the event of a bona 10fide emergency, or of any rescheduled regular meeting, or of 11any reconvened meeting, shall be given at least 48 hours 12before such meeting, which notice shall also include the 13agenda for the special, rescheduled, or reconvened meeting, 14but the validity of any action taken by the public body which 15is germane to a subject on the agenda shall not be affected by 16other errors or omissions in the agenda. For the purposes of 17this Section, "bona fide emergency" includes the appointment 18of a temporary deputy township supervisor under the Township 19Code. The requirement of public notice of reconvened meetings 20does not apply to any case where the meeting was open to the 21public and (1) it is to be reconvened within 24 hours, or (2) 22an announcement of the time and place of the reconvened 23meeting was made at the original meeting and there is no change 24in the agenda. Notice of an emergency meeting shall be given as 25soon as practicable, but in any event prior to the holding of 26such meeting, to any news medium which has filed an annual   10400HB0032ham004- 3 -LRB104 05560 RTM 24516 a1request for notice under subsection (b) of this Section.2    (b) Public notice shall be given by posting a copy of the 3notice at the principal office of the body holding the meeting 4or, if no such office exists, at the building in which the 5meeting is to be held. In addition, a public body that has a 6website that the full-time staff of the public body maintains 7shall post notice on its website of all meetings of the 8governing body of the public body. Any notice of an annual 9schedule of meetings shall remain on the website until a new 10public notice of the schedule of regular meetings is approved. 11Any notice of a regular meeting that is posted on a public 12body's website shall remain posted on the website until the 13regular meeting is concluded.

Posting of the notice 7and agenda on a website that is maintained by the public body 8satisfies the requirement for continuous posting under this 9subsection (c). If a notice or agenda is not continuously 10available for the full 48-hour period due to actions outside 11of the control of the public body, then that lack of 12availability does not invalidate any meeting or action taken 13at a meeting. 14(Source: P.A. 97-827, eff. 1-1-13.) 15    Section 10.
