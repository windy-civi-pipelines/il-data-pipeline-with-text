Application for 17such license shall be made to the Department upon blanks 18furnished by it. The application shall be signed and verified, 19and shall contain such information as the Department deems 20necessary. A blender shall, in addition to securing a 21distributor's license, make application to the Department for 22a blender's permit, setting forth in the application such 23information as the Department deems necessary.

The Department shall fix the penalty of such 6bond in each case taking into consideration the amount of 7motor fuel expected to be sold, distributed, exported, and 8used by such applicant and the penalty fixed by the Department 9shall be such, as in its opinion, will protect the State of 10Illinois against failure to pay the amount hereinafter 11provided on motor fuel sold, distributed, exported, and used, 12but the amount of the penalty fixed by the Department shall not 13exceed twice the monthly amount that would be collectable as a 14tax in the event of a sale on all the motor fuel sold, 15distributed, exported, and used by the distributor inclusive 16of tax-free sales, exports, use, or distribution. Upon receipt 17of the application and bond in proper form, the Department 18shall issue to the applicant a license to act as a distributor. 19No person who is in default to the State for monies due under 20this Act for the sale, distribution, export, or use of motor 21fuel shall receive a license to act as a distributor.22    (b) A license shall not be granted to any person whose 23principal place of business is in a state other than Illinois, 24unless such person is licensed for motor fuel distribution or 25export in the state in which the principal place of business is 26located and that such person is not in default to that State   10400HB1390ham001- 5 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1for any monies due for the sale, distribution, export, or use 2of motor fuel.3    (c) On January 1, 2026, all valid and unrevoked supplier's 4licenses and their corresponding receiver's licenses issued by 5the Department shall be converted by the Department to 6distributor's licenses and corresponding receiver's licenses. 7Beginning on January 1, 2026, holders of these converted 8distributor's licenses shall be subject to the same provisions 9and requirements as other licensed distributors under this 10Law. 11(Source: P.A. 96-1384, eff. 7-29-10.) 12    (35 ILCS 505/3d)13    Sec. 3d. Right to blend.14    (a) A distributor who is properly licensed and permitted 15as a blender pursuant to this Act may blend petroleum-based 16diesel fuel with biodiesel and sell the blended or unblended 17product on any premises owned and operated by the distributor 18for the purpose of supporting or facilitating the retail sale 19of motor fuel. 20    (b) A refiner or distributor supplier of petroleum-based 21diesel fuel or biodiesel shall not refuse to sell or transport 22to a distributor who is properly licensed and permitted as a 23blender pursuant to this Act any petroleum-based diesel fuel 24or biodiesel based on the distributor's or dealer's intent to 25use that product for blending.   10400HB1390ham001- 6 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1(Source: P.A. 102-700, eff. 4-19-22.) 2    (35 ILCS 505/5)  (from Ch. 120, par. 421)3    Sec. 5. Distributor's monthly return. Except as 4hereinafter provided, a person holding a valid unrevoked 5license to act as a distributor of motor fuel shall, between 6the 1st and 20th days of each calendar month, make return to 7the Department, showing an itemized statement of the number of 8invoiced gallons of motor fuel of the types specified in this 9Section which were purchased, acquired, received, or exported 10during the preceding calendar month; the amount of such motor 11fuel produced, refined, compounded, manufactured, blended, 12sold, distributed, exported, and used by the licensed 13distributor during the preceding calendar month; the amount of 14such motor fuel lost or destroyed during the preceding 15calendar month; the amount of such motor fuel on hand at the 16close of business for such month; and such other reasonable 17information as the Department may require. If a distributor's 18only activities with respect to motor fuel are either: (1) 19production of alcohol in quantities of less than 10,000 proof 20gallons per year or (2) blending alcohol in quantities of less 21than 10,000 proof gallons per year which such distributor has 22produced, he shall file returns on an annual basis with the 23return for a given year being due by January 20 of the 24following year. Distributors whose total production of alcohol 25(whether blended or not) exceeds 10,000 proof gallons per   10400HB1390ham001- 7 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1year, based on production during the preceding (calendar) year 2or as reasonably projected by the Department if one calendar 3year's record of production cannot be established, shall file 4returns between the 1st and 20th days of each calendar month as 5hereinabove provided.6    The types of motor fuel referred to in the preceding 7paragraph are: (A) All products commonly or commercially known 8or sold as gasoline (including casing-head and absorption or 9natural gasoline), gasohol, motor benzol or motor benzene 10regardless of their classification or uses; and (B) all 11combustible gases, not including liquefied natural gas, which 12exist in a gaseous state at 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at 14.7 13pounds per square inch absolute including, but not limited to, 14liquefied petroleum gases used for highway purposes; and (C) 15special fuel. Only those quantities of combustible gases 16(example (B) above) which are used or sold by the distributor 17to be used to propel motor vehicles on the public highways, or 18which are delivered into a storage tank that is located at a 19facility that has withdrawal facilities which are readily 20accessible to and are capable of dispensing combustible gases 21into the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles, shall be subject 22to return. Distributors of liquefied natural gas are not 23required to make returns under this Section with respect to 24that liquefied natural gas unless (i) the liquefied natural 25gas is dispensed into the fuel supply tank of any motor vehicle 26or (ii) the liquefied natural gas is delivered into a storage   10400HB1390ham001- 8 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1tank that is located at a facility that has withdrawal 2facilities which are readily accessible to and are capable of 3dispensing liquefied natural gas into the fuel supply tanks of 4motor vehicles. For purposes of this Section, a facility is 5considered to have withdrawal facilities that are not "readily 6accessible to and capable of dispensing combustible gases into 7the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles" only if the 8combustible gases or liquefied natural gas are delivered from: 9(i) a dispenser hose that is short enough so that it will not 10reach the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle or (ii) a 11dispenser that is enclosed by a fence or other physical 12barrier so that a vehicle cannot pull alongside the dispenser 13to permit fueling. For the purposes of this Act, liquefied 14petroleum gases shall mean and include any material having a 15vapor pressure not exceeding that allowed for commercial 16propane composed predominantly of the following hydrocarbons, 17either by themselves or as mixtures: Propane, Propylene, 18Butane (normal butane or iso-butane) and Butylene (including 19isomers).20    In case of a sale of special fuel to someone other than a 21licensed distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other 22than in motor vehicles, the distributor shall show in his 23return the amount of invoiced gallons sold and the name and 24address of the purchaser in addition to any other information 25the Department may require.26    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes   10400HB1390ham001- 9 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 2Law.3    In case of a tax-free sale, as provided in Section 6, of 4motor fuel which the distributor is required by this Section 5to include in his return to the Department, the distributor in 6his return shall show: (1) If the sale is made to another 7licensed distributor the amount sold and the name, address and 8license number of the purchasing distributor; (2) if the sale 9is made to a person where delivery is made outside of this 10State the name and address of such purchaser and the point of 11delivery together with the date and amount delivered; (3) if 12the sale is made to the Federal Government or its 13instrumentalities the amount sold; (4) if the sale is made to a 14municipal corporation owning and operating a local 15transportation system for public service in this State the 16name and address of such purchaser, and the amount sold, as 17evidenced by official forms of exemption certificates properly 18executed and furnished by such purchaser; (5) if the sale is 19made to a privately owned public utility owning and operating 202-axle vehicles designed and used for transporting more than 7 21passengers, which vehicles are used as common carriers in 22general transportation of passengers, are not devoted to any 23specialized purpose and are operated entirely within the 24territorial limits of a single municipality or of any group of 25contiguous municipalities or in a close radius thereof, and 26the operations of which are subject to the regulations of the   10400HB1390ham001- 10 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1Illinois Commerce Commission, then the name and address of 2such purchaser and the amount sold as evidenced by official 3forms of exemption certificates properly executed and 4furnished by the purchaser; (6) if the product sold is special 5fuel and if the sale is made to a licensed supplier under 6conditions which qualify the sale for tax exemption under 7Section 6 of this Act, the amount sold and the name, address 8and license number of the purchaser; and (6) (7) if a sale of 9special fuel is made to someone other than a licensed 10distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other than in 11motor vehicles, by making a specific notation thereof on the 12invoice or sales slip covering such sales and obtaining such 13supporting documentation as may be required by the Department.14    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes 15must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 16Law.17    A person whose license to act as a distributor of motor 18fuel has been revoked shall make a return to the Department 19covering the period from the date of the last return to the 20date of the revocation of the license, which return shall be 21delivered to the Department not later than 10 days from the 22date of the revocation or termination of the license of such 23distributor; the return shall in all other respects be subject 24to the same provisions and conditions as returns by 25distributors licensed under the provisions of this Act.26    The records, waybills and supporting documents kept by   10400HB1390ham001- 11 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1railroads and other common carriers in the regular course of 2business shall be prima facie evidence of the contents and 3receipt of cars or tanks covered by those records, waybills or 4supporting documents.5    If the Department has reason to believe and does believe 6that the amount shown on the return as purchased, acquired, 7received, exported, sold, used, lost or destroyed is 8incorrect, or that an amount of motor fuel of the types 9required by the second paragraph of this Section to be 10reported to the Department has not been correctly reported the 11Department shall fix an amount for such receipt, sales, 12export, use, loss or destruction according to its best 13judgment and information, which amount so fixed by the 14Department shall be prima facie correct. All returns shall be 15made on forms prepared and furnished by the Department, and 16shall contain such other information as the Department may 17reasonably require. The return must be accompanied by 18appropriate computer-generated magnetic media supporting 19schedule data in the format required by the Department, 20unless, as provided by rule, the Department grants an 21exception upon petition of a taxpayer. All licensed 22distributors shall report all losses of motor fuel sustained 23on account of fire, theft, spillage, spoilage, leakage, or any 24other provable cause when filing the return for the period 25during which the loss occurred. If the distributor reports 26losses due to fire or theft, then the distributor must include   10400HB1390ham001- 12 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1fire department or police department reports and any other 2documentation that the Department may require. The mere making 3of the report does not assure the allowance of the loss as a 4reduction in tax liability. Losses of motor fuel as the result 5of evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may 6not exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning 7of the month, plus the receipts of gallonage during the month, 8minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the end of the 9month. Any loss reported that is in excess of 1% shall be 10subject to the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. On and 11after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month period January through 12June, net losses of motor fuel (for each category of motor fuel 13that is required to be reported on a return) as the result of 14evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may not 15exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning of 16each January, plus the receipts of gallonage each January 17through June, minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the 18end of each June. On and after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month 19period July through December, net losses of motor fuel (for 20each category of motor fuel that is required to be reported on 21a return) as the result of evaporation or shrinkage due to 22temperature variations may not exceed 1% of the total gallons 23in storage at the beginning of each July, plus the receipts of 24gallonage each July through December, minus the gallonage 25remaining in storage at the end of each December. Any net loss 26reported that is in excess of this amount shall be subject to   10400HB1390ham001- 13 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. For purposes of this 2Section, "net loss" means the number of gallons gained through 3temperature variations minus the number of gallons lost 4through temperature variations or evaporation for each of the 5respective 6-month periods.6    If any payment provided for in this Section exceeds the 7distributor's liabilities under this Act, as shown on an 8original return, the Department may authorize the distributor 9to credit such excess payment against liability subsequently 10to be remitted to the Department under this Act, in accordance 11with reasonable rules adopted by the Department. If the 12Department subsequently determines that all or any part of the 13credit taken was not actually due to the distributor, the 14distributor's discount shall be reduced by an amount equal to 15the difference between the discount as applied to the credit 16taken and that actually due, and that distributor shall be 17liable for penalties and interest on such difference. 18(Source: P.A. 100-9, eff. 7-1-17; 100-1171, eff. 1-4-19.) 19    (35 ILCS 505/6)  (from Ch. 120, par. 422)20    Sec. 6. Collection of tax; distributors. A distributor who 21sells or distributes any motor fuel, which he is required by 22Section 5 to report to the Department when filing a return, 23shall (except as hereinafter provided) collect at the time of 24such sale and distribution, the amount of tax imposed under 25this Act on all such motor fuel sold and distributed, and at   10400HB1390ham001- 14 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1the time of making a return, the distributor shall pay to the 2Department the amount so collected less a discount of 2% 3through June 30, 2003 and 1.75% thereafter which is allowed to 4reimburse the distributor for the expenses incurred in keeping 5records, preparing and filing returns, collecting and 6remitting the tax and supplying data to the Department on 7request, and shall also pay to the Department an amount equal 8to the amount that would be collectible as a tax in the event 9of a sale thereof on all such motor fuel used by said 10distributor during the period covered by the return. However, 11no payment shall be made based upon dyed diesel fuel used by 12the distributor for non-highway purposes. The discount shall 13only be applicable to the amount of tax payment which 14accompanies a return which is filed timely in accordance with 15Section 5 of this Act. In each subsequent sale of motor fuel on 16which the amount of tax imposed under this Act has been 17collected as provided in this Section, the amount so collected 18shall be added to the selling price, so that the amount of tax 19is paid ultimately by the user of the motor fuel. However, no 20collection or payment shall be made in the case of the sale or 21use of any motor fuel to the extent to which such sale or use 22of motor fuel may not, under the constitution and statutes of 23the United States, be made the subject of taxation by this 24State. A person whose license to act as a distributor of fuel 25has been revoked shall, at the time of making a return, also 26pay to the Department an amount equal to the amount that would   10400HB1390ham001- 15 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1be collectible as a tax in the event of a sale thereof on all 2motor fuel, which he is required by the second paragraph of 3Section 5 to report to the Department in making a return, and 4which he had on hand on the date on which the license was 5revoked, and with respect to which no tax had been previously 6paid under this Act.7    A distributor may make tax free sales of motor fuel, with 8respect to which he is otherwise required to collect the tax, 9only as specified in the following items 1 through 7.10        1. When the sale is made to a person holding a valid 11    unrevoked license as a distributor, by making a specific 12    notation thereof on invoices or sales slip covering each 13    sale.14        2. When the sale is made with delivery to a purchaser 15    outside of this State.16        3. When the sale is made to the Federal Government or 17    its instrumentalities.18        4. When the sale is made to a municipal corporation 19    owning and operating a local transportation system for 20    public service in this State when an official certificate 21    of exemption is obtained in lieu of the tax.22        5. When the sale is made to a privately owned public 23    utility owning and operating 2 axle vehicles designed and 24    used for transporting more than 7 passengers, which 25    vehicles are used as common carriers in general 26    transportation of passengers, are not devoted to any   10400HB1390ham001- 16 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1    specialized purpose and are operated entirely within the 2    territorial limits of a single municipality or of any 3    group of contiguous municipalities, or in a close radius 4    thereof, and the operations of which are subject to the 5    regulations of the Illinois Commerce Commission, when an 6    official certificate of exemption is obtained in lieu of 7    the tax.8        6. (Blank). When a sale of special fuel is made to a 9    person holding a valid, unrevoked license as a supplier, 10    by making a specific notation thereof on the invoice or 11    sales slip covering each such sale.12        7. When a sale of dyed diesel fuel is made by the 13    licensed distributor to the end user of the fuel who is not 14    a licensed distributor or a licensed supplier for 15    non-highway purposes and the fuel is (i) delivered from a 16    vehicle designed for the specific purpose of such sales 17    and delivered directly into a stationary bulk storage tank 18    that displays the notice required by Section 4f of this 19    Act, (ii) delivered from a vehicle designed for the 20    specific purpose of such sales and delivered directly into 21    the fuel supply tanks of non-highway vehicles that are not 22    required to be registered for highway use, or (iii) 23    dispensed from a dyed diesel fuel dispensing facility that 24    has withdrawal facilities that are not readily accessible 25    to and are not capable of dispensing dyed diesel fuel into 26    the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle.   10400HB1390ham001- 17 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1        A specific notation is required on the invoice or 2    sales slip covering such sales, and any supporting 3    documentation that may be required by the Department must 4    be obtained by the distributor. The distributor shall 5    obtain and keep the supporting documentation in such form 6    as the Department may require by rule.7        For purposes of this item 7, a dyed diesel fuel 8    dispensing facility is considered to have withdrawal 9    facilities that are "not readily accessible to and not 10    capable of dispensing dyed diesel fuel into the fuel 11    supply tank of a motor vehicle" only if the dyed diesel 12    fuel is delivered from: (i) a dispenser hose that is short 13    enough so that it will not reach the fuel supply tank of a 14    motor vehicle or (ii) a dispenser that is enclosed by a 15    fence or other physical barrier so that a vehicle cannot 16    pull alongside the dispenser to permit fueling. 17        8. (Blank).18    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes 19must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 20Law.21    All suits or other proceedings brought for the purpose of 22recovering any taxes, interest or penalties due the State of 23Illinois under this Act may be maintained in the name of the 24Department.25(Source: P.A. 102-1019, eff. 5-27-22.)   10400HB1390ham001- 18 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1    (35 ILCS 505/7)  (from Ch. 120, par. 423)2    Sec. 7. Any person who is , not licensed as a receiver or , 3distributor and who purchases or supplier, purchasing fuel or 4motor fuel as to which there has been no charge made to him of 5the tax imposed by Section 2 or 2a, or both, shall make payment 6of the tax imposed by Section 2a of this Act and if the same be 7thereafter used in the operation of a motor vehicle upon the 8public highways, make payment of the motor fuel tax computed 9at the rate prescribed in Section 2 of this Act on the amount 10so used, such payment to be made to the Department not later 11than the 20th day of the month succeeding the month in which 12the motor fuel was so used.13    This Section does not apply in cases of such use of motor 14fuel which was obtained tax-free under an official certificate 15of exemption mentioned in Sections 6 and 6a of this Act.16(Source: P.A. 86-125.) 17    (35 ILCS 505/11.5)  (from Ch. 120, par. 427a)18    Sec. 11.5. In the event that liability upon the bond filed 19by a distributor, supplier, or receiver with the Department 20shall be discharged or reduced, whether by judgment rendered, 21payment made or otherwise, or if in the opinion of the 22Department the bond of any distributor, supplier, or receiver 23theretofore given shall become unsatisfactory, then the 24distributor, supplier, or receiver shall forthwith, upon the 25written demand of the Department, file a new bond in the same   10400HB1390ham001- 19 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1manner and form and in an amount and with sureties 2satisfactory to the Department, failing which the Department 3shall forthwith revoke the license of the distributor, 4supplier, or receiver.5    If such new bond shall be furnished by the distributor, 6supplier, or receiver as above provided, the Department shall 7cancel the bond for which such new bond shall be substituted.8    Any surety on any bond furnished by any distributor, 9supplier, or receiver shall be released and discharged from 10any and all liability to the State of Illinois accruing on such 11bond after the expiration of 60 days from the date upon which 12such surety shall have filed with the Department written 13request so to be released and discharged. But such request 14shall not operate to relieve, release or discharge such surety 15from any liability already accrued, or which shall accrue, 16before the expiration of said 60-day period.

Reimbursement 8and repayment shall be made by the Department upon receipt of 9adequate proof of taxes directly paid to another state and the 10amount of motor fuel used in that state.11    Claims based in whole or in part on taxes paid to another 12state shall include (i) a certified copy of the tax return 13filed with such other state by the claimant; (ii) a copy of 14either the cancelled check paying the tax due on such return, 15or a receipt acknowledging payment of the tax due on such tax 16return; and (iii) such other information as the Department may 17reasonably require. This paragraph shall not apply to taxes 18paid on returns filed under Section 13a.3 of this Act.19    Any person who purchases motor fuel use tax decals as 20required by Section 13a.4 and pays an amount of fees for such 21decals that exceeds the amount due shall be reimbursed and 22repaid the amount of the decal fees that are deemed by the 23department to be in excess of the amount due. Alternatively, 24any person who purchases motor fuel use tax decals as required 25by Section 13a.4 may credit any excess decal payment verified 26by the Department against amounts subsequently due for the   10400HB1390ham001- 25 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1purchase of additional decals, until such time as no excess 2payment remains. 3    Claims for such reimbursement must be made to the 4Department of Revenue, duly verified by the claimant (or by 5the claimant's legal representative if the claimant has died 6or become a person under legal disability), upon forms 7prescribed by the Department. The claim must state such facts 8relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture or 9production of the motor fuel by the claimant as the Department 10may deem necessary, and the time when, and the circumstances 11of its loss or the specific purpose for which it was used (as 12the case may be), together with such other information as the 13Department may reasonably require. No claim based upon idle 14time shall be allowed. Claims for reimbursement for 15overpayment of decal fees shall be made to the Department of 16Revenue, duly verified by the claimant (or by the claimant's 17legal representative if the claimant has died or become a 18person under legal disability), upon forms prescribed by the 19Department. The claim shall state facts relating to the 20overpayment of decal fees, together with such other 21information as the Department may reasonably require. Claims 22for reimbursement of overpayment of decal fees paid on or 23after January 1, 2011 must be filed not later than one year 24after the date on which the fees were paid by the claimant. If 25it is determined that the Department should reimburse a 26claimant for overpayment of decal fees, the Department shall   10400HB1390ham001- 26 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1first apply the amount of such refund against any tax or 2penalty or interest due by the claimant under Section 13a of 3this Act. 4    Claims for full reimbursement for taxes paid on or before 5December 31, 1999 must be filed not later than one year after 6the date on which the tax was paid by the claimant. If, 7however, a claim for such reimbursement otherwise meeting the 8requirements of this Section is filed more than one year but 9less than 2 years after that date, the claimant shall be 10reimbursed at the rate of 80% of the amount to which he would 11have been entitled if his claim had been timely filed.12    Claims for full reimbursement for taxes paid on or after 13January 1, 2000 must be filed not later than 2 years after the 14date on which the tax was paid by the claimant.15    The Department may make such investigation of the 16correctness of the facts stated in such claims as it deems 17necessary. When the Department has approved any such claim, it 18shall pay to the claimant (or to the claimant's legal 19representative, as such if the claimant has died or become a 20person under legal disability) the reimbursement provided in 21this Section, out of any moneys appropriated to it for that 22purpose.23    Any distributor or supplier who has paid the tax imposed 24by Section 2 of this Act upon motor fuel lost or used by such 25distributor or supplier for any purpose other than operating a 26motor vehicle upon the public highways or waters may file a   10400HB1390ham001- 27 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1claim for credit or refund to recover the amount so paid. Such 2claims shall be filed on forms prescribed by the Department. 3Such claims shall be made to the Department, duly verified by 4the claimant (or by the claimant's legal representative if the 5claimant has died or become a person under legal disability), 6upon forms prescribed by the Department. The claim shall state 7such facts relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture 8or production of the motor fuel by the claimant as the 9Department may deem necessary and the time when the loss or 10nontaxable use occurred, and the circumstances of its loss or 11the specific purpose for which it was used (as the case may 12be), together with such other information as the Department 13may reasonably require. Claims must be filed not later than 14one year after the date on which the tax was paid by the 15claimant.16    The Department may make such investigation of the 17correctness of the facts stated in such claims as it deems 18necessary. When the Department approves a claim, the 19Department shall issue a refund or credit memorandum as 20requested by the taxpayer, to the distributor or supplier who 21made the payment for which the refund or credit is being given 22or, if the distributor or supplier has died or become 23incompetent, to such distributor's or supplier's legal 24representative, as such. The amount of such credit memorandum 25shall be credited against any tax due or to become due under 26this Act from the distributor or supplier who made the payment   10400HB1390ham001- 28 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1for which credit has been given.2    Any credit or refund that is allowed under this Section 3shall bear interest at the rate and in the manner specified in 4the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act.5    In case the distributor or supplier requests and the 6Department determines that the claimant is entitled to a 7refund, such refund shall be made only from such appropriation 8as may be available for that purpose. If it appears unlikely 9that the amount appropriated would permit everyone having a 10claim allowed during the period covered by such appropriation 11to elect to receive a cash refund, the Department, by rule or 12regulation, shall provide for the payment of refunds in 13hardship cases and shall define what types of cases qualify as 14hardship cases.15    In any case in which there has been an erroneous refund of 16tax or fees payable under this Section, a notice of tax 17liability may be issued at any time within 3 years from the 18making of that refund, or within 5 years from the making of 19that refund if it appears that any part of the refund was 20induced by fraud or the misrepresentation of material fact. 21The amount of any proposed assessment set forth by the 22Department shall be limited to the amount of the erroneous 23refund.24    If no tax is due and no proceeding is pending to determine 25whether such distributor or supplier is indebted to the 26Department for tax, the credit memorandum so issued may be   10400HB1390ham001- 29 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1assigned and set over by the lawful holder thereof, subject to 2reasonable rules of the Department, to any other licensed 3distributor or supplier who is subject to this Act, and the 4amount thereof applied by the Department against any tax due 5or to become due under this Act from such assignee.6    If the payment for which the distributor's or supplier's 7claim is filed is held in the protest fund of the State 8Treasury during the pendency of the claim for credit 9proceedings pursuant to the order of the court in accordance 10with Section 2a of the State Officers and Employees Money 11Disposition Act and if it is determined by the Department or by 12the final order of a reviewing court under the Administrative 13Review Law that the claimant is entitled to all or a part of 14the credit claimed, the claimant, instead of receiving a 15credit memorandum from the Department, shall receive a cash 16refund from the protest fund as provided for in Section 2a of 17the State Officers and Employees Money Disposition Act.18    If any person ceases to be licensed as a distributor or 19supplier while still holding an unused credit memorandum 20issued under this Act, such person may, at his election 21(instead of assigning the credit memorandum to a licensed 22distributor or licensed supplier under this Act), surrender 23such unused credit memorandum to the Department and receive a 24refund of the amount to which such person is entitled.25    For claims based upon taxes paid on or before December 31, 262000, a claim based upon the use of undyed diesel fuel shall   10400HB1390ham001- 30 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1not be allowed except (i) if allowed under the following 2paragraph or (ii) for undyed diesel fuel used by a commercial 3vehicle, as that term is defined in Section 1-111.8 of the 4Illinois Vehicle Code, for any purpose other than operating 5the commercial vehicle upon the public highways and unlicensed 6commercial vehicles operating on private property.

Any claim under this 2    item (8) may be made only by a claimant that owns tugs and 3    spotter equipment and operates that equipment on both 4    private and airport property. The aggregate of all credits 5    or refunds resulting from claims filed under this item (8) 6    by a claimant in any calendar year may not exceed 7    $100,000.

The Department shall fix the penalty of such 6bond in each case taking into consideration the amount of 7motor fuel expected to be sold, distributed, exported, and 8used by such applicant and the penalty fixed by the Department 9shall be such, as in its opinion, will protect the State of 10Illinois against failure to pay the amount hereinafter 11provided on motor fuel sold, distributed, exported, and used, 12but the amount of the penalty fixed by the Department shall not 13exceed twice the monthly amount that would be collectable as a 14tax in the event of a sale on all the motor fuel sold, 15distributed, exported, and used by the distributor inclusive 16of tax-free sales, exports, use, or distribution. Upon receipt 17of the application and bond in proper form, the Department 18shall issue to the applicant a license to act as a distributor. 19No person who is in default to the State for monies due under 20this Act for the sale, distribution, export, or use of motor 21fuel shall receive a license to act as a distributor.22    (b) A license shall not be granted to any person whose 23principal place of business is in a state other than Illinois, 24unless such person is licensed for motor fuel distribution or 25export in the state in which the principal place of business is 26located and that such person is not in default to that State   10400HB1390ham001- 5 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1for any monies due for the sale, distribution, export, or use 2of motor fuel.3    (c) On January 1, 2026, all valid and unrevoked supplier's 4licenses and their corresponding receiver's licenses issued by 5the Department shall be converted by the Department to 6distributor's licenses and corresponding receiver's licenses. 7Beginning on January 1, 2026, holders of these converted 8distributor's licenses shall be subject to the same provisions 9and requirements as other licensed distributors under this 10Law. 11(Source: P.A. 96-1384, eff. 7-29-10.) 12    (35 ILCS 505/3d)13    Sec. 3d.

If a distributor's 18only activities with respect to motor fuel are either: (1) 19production of alcohol in quantities of less than 10,000 proof 20gallons per year or (2) blending alcohol in quantities of less 21than 10,000 proof gallons per year which such distributor has 22produced, he shall file returns on an annual basis with the 23return for a given year being due by January 20 of the 24following year. Distributors whose total production of alcohol 25(whether blended or not) exceeds 10,000 proof gallons per   10400HB1390ham001- 7 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1year, based on production during the preceding (calendar) year 2or as reasonably projected by the Department if one calendar 3year's record of production cannot be established, shall file 4returns between the 1st and 20th days of each calendar month as 5hereinabove provided.6    The types of motor fuel referred to in the preceding 7paragraph are: (A) All products commonly or commercially known 8or sold as gasoline (including casing-head and absorption or 9natural gasoline), gasohol, motor benzol or motor benzene 10regardless of their classification or uses; and (B) all 11combustible gases, not including liquefied natural gas, which 12exist in a gaseous state at 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at 14.7 13pounds per square inch absolute including, but not limited to, 14liquefied petroleum gases used for highway purposes; and (C) 15special fuel. Only those quantities of combustible gases 16(example (B) above) which are used or sold by the distributor 17to be used to propel motor vehicles on the public highways, or 18which are delivered into a storage tank that is located at a 19facility that has withdrawal facilities which are readily 20accessible to and are capable of dispensing combustible gases 21into the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles, shall be subject 22to return. Distributors of liquefied natural gas are not 23required to make returns under this Section with respect to 24that liquefied natural gas unless (i) the liquefied natural 25gas is dispensed into the fuel supply tank of any motor vehicle 26or (ii) the liquefied natural gas is delivered into a storage   10400HB1390ham001- 8 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1tank that is located at a facility that has withdrawal 2facilities which are readily accessible to and are capable of 3dispensing liquefied natural gas into the fuel supply tanks of 4motor vehicles. For purposes of this Section, a facility is 5considered to have withdrawal facilities that are not "readily 6accessible to and capable of dispensing combustible gases into 7the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles" only if the 8combustible gases or liquefied natural gas are delivered from: 9(i) a dispenser hose that is short enough so that it will not 10reach the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle or (ii) a 11dispenser that is enclosed by a fence or other physical 12barrier so that a vehicle cannot pull alongside the dispenser 13to permit fueling. For the purposes of this Act, liquefied 14petroleum gases shall mean and include any material having a 15vapor pressure not exceeding that allowed for commercial 16propane composed predominantly of the following hydrocarbons, 17either by themselves or as mixtures: Propane, Propylene, 18Butane (normal butane or iso-butane) and Butylene (including 19isomers).20    In case of a sale of special fuel to someone other than a 21licensed distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other 22than in motor vehicles, the distributor shall show in his 23return the amount of invoiced gallons sold and the name and 24address of the purchaser in addition to any other information 25the Department may require.26    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes   10400HB1390ham001- 9 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 2Law.3    In case of a tax-free sale, as provided in Section 6, of 4motor fuel which the distributor is required by this Section 5to include in his return to the Department, the distributor in 6his return shall show: (1) If the sale is made to another 7licensed distributor the amount sold and the name, address and 8license number of the purchasing distributor; (2) if the sale 9is made to a person where delivery is made outside of this 10State the name and address of such purchaser and the point of 11delivery together with the date and amount delivered; (3) if 12the sale is made to the Federal Government or its 13instrumentalities the amount sold; (4) if the sale is made to a 14municipal corporation owning and operating a local 15transportation system for public service in this State the 16name and address of such purchaser, and the amount sold, as 17evidenced by official forms of exemption certificates properly 18executed and furnished by such purchaser; (5) if the sale is 19made to a privately owned public utility owning and operating 202-axle vehicles designed and used for transporting more than 7 21passengers, which vehicles are used as common carriers in 22general transportation of passengers, are not devoted to any 23specialized purpose and are operated entirely within the 24territorial limits of a single municipality or of any group of 25contiguous municipalities or in a close radius thereof, and 26the operations of which are subject to the regulations of the   10400HB1390ham001- 10 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1Illinois Commerce Commission, then the name and address of 2such purchaser and the amount sold as evidenced by official 3forms of exemption certificates properly executed and 4furnished by the purchaser; (6) if the product sold is special 5fuel and if the sale is made to a licensed supplier under 6conditions which qualify the sale for tax exemption under 7Section 6 of this Act, the amount sold and the name, address 8and license number of the purchaser; and (6) (7) if a sale of 9special fuel is made to someone other than a licensed 10distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other than in 11motor vehicles, by making a specific notation thereof on the 12invoice or sales slip covering such sales and obtaining such 13supporting documentation as may be required by the Department.14    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes 15must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 16Law.17    A person whose license to act as a distributor of motor 18fuel has been revoked shall make a return to the Department 19covering the period from the date of the last return to the 20date of the revocation of the license, which return shall be 21delivered to the Department not later than 10 days from the 22date of the revocation or termination of the license of such 23distributor; the return shall in all other respects be subject 24to the same provisions and conditions as returns by 25distributors licensed under the provisions of this Act.26    The records, waybills and supporting documents kept by   10400HB1390ham001- 11 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1railroads and other common carriers in the regular course of 2business shall be prima facie evidence of the contents and 3receipt of cars or tanks covered by those records, waybills or 4supporting documents.5    If the Department has reason to believe and does believe 6that the amount shown on the return as purchased, acquired, 7received, exported, sold, used, lost or destroyed is 8incorrect, or that an amount of motor fuel of the types 9required by the second paragraph of this Section to be 10reported to the Department has not been correctly reported the 11Department shall fix an amount for such receipt, sales, 12export, use, loss or destruction according to its best 13judgment and information, which amount so fixed by the 14Department shall be prima facie correct. All returns shall be 15made on forms prepared and furnished by the Department, and 16shall contain such other information as the Department may 17reasonably require. The return must be accompanied by 18appropriate computer-generated magnetic media supporting 19schedule data in the format required by the Department, 20unless, as provided by rule, the Department grants an 21exception upon petition of a taxpayer. All licensed 22distributors shall report all losses of motor fuel sustained 23on account of fire, theft, spillage, spoilage, leakage, or any 24other provable cause when filing the return for the period 25during which the loss occurred. If the distributor reports 26losses due to fire or theft, then the distributor must include   10400HB1390ham001- 12 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1fire department or police department reports and any other 2documentation that the Department may require. The mere making 3of the report does not assure the allowance of the loss as a 4reduction in tax liability. Losses of motor fuel as the result 5of evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may 6not exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning 7of the month, plus the receipts of gallonage during the month, 8minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the end of the 9month. Any loss reported that is in excess of 1% shall be 10subject to the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. On and 11after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month period January through 12June, net losses of motor fuel (for each category of motor fuel 13that is required to be reported on a return) as the result of 14evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may not 15exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning of 16each January, plus the receipts of gallonage each January 17through June, minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the 18end of each June. On and after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month 19period July through December, net losses of motor fuel (for 20each category of motor fuel that is required to be reported on 21a return) as the result of evaporation or shrinkage due to 22temperature variations may not exceed 1% of the total gallons 23in storage at the beginning of each July, plus the receipts of 24gallonage each July through December, minus the gallonage 25remaining in storage at the end of each December. Any net loss 26reported that is in excess of this amount shall be subject to   10400HB1390ham001- 13 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. For purposes of this 2Section, "net loss" means the number of gallons gained through 3temperature variations minus the number of gallons lost 4through temperature variations or evaporation for each of the 5respective 6-month periods.6    If any payment provided for in this Section exceeds the 7distributor's liabilities under this Act, as shown on an 8original return, the Department may authorize the distributor 9to credit such excess payment against liability subsequently 10to be remitted to the Department under this Act, in accordance 11with reasonable rules adopted by the Department. If the 12Department subsequently determines that all or any part of the 13credit taken was not actually due to the distributor, the 14distributor's discount shall be reduced by an amount equal to 15the difference between the discount as applied to the credit 16taken and that actually due, and that distributor shall be 17liable for penalties and interest on such difference. 18(Source: P.A. 100-9, eff. 7-1-17; 100-1171, eff. 1-4-19.) 19    (35 ILCS 505/6)  (from Ch. 120, par. 422)20    Sec. 6. Collection of tax; distributors. A distributor who 21sells or distributes any motor fuel, which he is required by 22Section 5 to report to the Department when filing a return, 23shall (except as hereinafter provided) collect at the time of 24such sale and distribution, the amount of tax imposed under 25this Act on all such motor fuel sold and distributed, and at   10400HB1390ham001- 14 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1the time of making a return, the distributor shall pay to the 2Department the amount so collected less a discount of 2% 3through June 30, 2003 and 1.75% thereafter which is allowed to 4reimburse the distributor for the expenses incurred in keeping 5records, preparing and filing returns, collecting and 6remitting the tax and supplying data to the Department on 7request, and shall also pay to the Department an amount equal 8to the amount that would be collectible as a tax in the event 9of a sale thereof on all such motor fuel used by said 10distributor during the period covered by the return. However, 11no payment shall be made based upon dyed diesel fuel used by 12the distributor for non-highway purposes. The discount shall 13only be applicable to the amount of tax payment which 14accompanies a return which is filed timely in accordance with 15Section 5 of this Act. In each subsequent sale of motor fuel on 16which the amount of tax imposed under this Act has been 17collected as provided in this Section, the amount so collected 18shall be added to the selling price, so that the amount of tax 19is paid ultimately by the user of the motor fuel. However, no 20collection or payment shall be made in the case of the sale or 21use of any motor fuel to the extent to which such sale or use 22of motor fuel may not, under the constitution and statutes of 23the United States, be made the subject of taxation by this 24State. A person whose license to act as a distributor of fuel 25has been revoked shall, at the time of making a return, also 26pay to the Department an amount equal to the amount that would   10400HB1390ham001- 15 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1be collectible as a tax in the event of a sale thereof on all 2motor fuel, which he is required by the second paragraph of 3Section 5 to report to the Department in making a return, and 4which he had on hand on the date on which the license was 5revoked, and with respect to which no tax had been previously 6paid under this Act.7    A distributor may make tax free sales of motor fuel, with 8respect to which he is otherwise required to collect the tax, 9only as specified in the following items 1 through 7.10        1. When the sale is made to a person holding a valid 11    unrevoked license as a distributor, by making a specific 12    notation thereof on invoices or sales slip covering each 13    sale.14        2.

The claim must state such facts 8relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture or 9production of the motor fuel by the claimant as the Department 10may deem necessary, and the time when, and the circumstances 11of its loss or the specific purpose for which it was used (as 12the case may be), together with such other information as the 13Department may reasonably require. No claim based upon idle 14time shall be allowed.

The amount of such credit memorandum 25shall be credited against any tax due or to become due under 26this Act from the distributor or supplier who made the payment   10400HB1390ham001- 28 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1for which credit has been given.2    Any credit or refund that is allowed under this Section 3shall bear interest at the rate and in the manner specified in 4the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act.5    In case the distributor or supplier requests and the 6Department determines that the claimant is entitled to a 7refund, such refund shall be made only from such appropriation 8as may be available for that purpose. If it appears unlikely 9that the amount appropriated would permit everyone having a 10claim allowed during the period covered by such appropriation 11to elect to receive a cash refund, the Department, by rule or 12regulation, shall provide for the payment of refunds in 13hardship cases and shall define what types of cases qualify as 14hardship cases.15    In any case in which there has been an erroneous refund of 16tax or fees payable under this Section, a notice of tax 17liability may be issued at any time within 3 years from the 18making of that refund, or within 5 years from the making of 19that refund if it appears that any part of the refund was 20induced by fraud or the misrepresentation of material fact. 21The amount of any proposed assessment set forth by the 22Department shall be limited to the amount of the erroneous 23refund.24    If no tax is due and no proceeding is pending to determine 25whether such distributor or supplier is indebted to the 26Department for tax, the credit memorandum so issued may be   10400HB1390ham001- 29 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1assigned and set over by the lawful holder thereof, subject to 2reasonable rules of the Department, to any other licensed 3distributor or supplier who is subject to this Act, and the 4amount thereof applied by the Department against any tax due 5or to become due under this Act from such assignee.6    If the payment for which the distributor's or supplier's 7claim is filed is held in the protest fund of the State 8Treasury during the pendency of the claim for credit 9proceedings pursuant to the order of the court in accordance 10with Section 2a of the State Officers and Employees Money 11Disposition Act and if it is determined by the Department or by 12the final order of a reviewing court under the Administrative 13Review Law that the claimant is entitled to all or a part of 14the credit claimed, the claimant, instead of receiving a 15credit memorandum from the Department, shall receive a cash 16refund from the protest fund as provided for in Section 2a of 17the State Officers and Employees Money Disposition Act.18    If any person ceases to be licensed as a distributor or 19supplier while still holding an unused credit memorandum 20issued under this Act, such person may, at his election 21(instead of assigning the credit memorandum to a licensed 22distributor or licensed supplier under this Act), surrender 23such unused credit memorandum to the Department and receive a 24refund of the amount to which such person is entitled.25    For claims based upon taxes paid on or before December 31, 262000, a claim based upon the use of undyed diesel fuel shall   10400HB1390ham001- 30 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22458 a1not be allowed except (i) if allowed under the following 2paragraph or (ii) for undyed diesel fuel used by a commercial 3vehicle, as that term is defined in Section 1-111.8 of the 4Illinois Vehicle Code, for any purpose other than operating 5the commercial vehicle upon the public highways and unlicensed 6commercial vehicles operating on private property.
