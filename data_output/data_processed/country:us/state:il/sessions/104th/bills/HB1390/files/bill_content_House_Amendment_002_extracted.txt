The Department shall fix the penalty of such 7bond in each case taking into consideration the amount of 8motor fuel expected to be sold, distributed, exported, and 9used by such applicant and the penalty fixed by the Department 10shall be such, as in its opinion, will protect the State of 11Illinois against failure to pay the amount hereinafter 12provided on motor fuel sold, distributed, exported, and used, 13but the amount of the penalty fixed by the Department shall not 14exceed twice the monthly amount that would be collectable as a 15tax in the event of a sale on all the motor fuel sold, 16distributed, exported, and used by the distributor inclusive 17of tax-free sales, exports, use, or distribution. Upon receipt 18of the application and bond in proper form, the Department 19shall issue to the applicant a license to act as a distributor. 20No person who is in default to the State for monies due under 21this Act for the sale, distribution, export, or use of motor 22fuel shall receive a license to act as a distributor.23    (b) A license shall not be granted to any person whose 24principal place of business is in a state other than Illinois, 25unless such person is licensed for motor fuel distribution or 26export in the state in which the principal place of business is   10400HB1390ham002- 5 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1located and that such person is not in default to that State 2for any monies due for the sale, distribution, export, or use 3of motor fuel.4    (c) On January 1, 2026, all valid and unrevoked supplier's 5licenses and their corresponding receiver's licenses issued by 6the Department shall be converted by the Department to 7distributor's licenses and corresponding receiver's licenses. 8Beginning on January 1, 2026, holders of these converted 9distributor's licenses shall be subject to the same provisions 10and requirements as other licensed distributors under this 11Law. 12(Source: P.A. 96-1384, eff. 7-29-10.) 13    (35 ILCS 505/3d)14    Sec. 3d.

Distributor's monthly return. Except as 5hereinafter provided, a person holding a valid unrevoked 6license to act as a distributor of motor fuel shall, between 7the 1st and 20th days of each calendar month, make return to 8the Department, showing an itemized statement of the number of 9invoiced gallons of motor fuel of the types specified in this 10Section which were purchased, acquired, received, or exported 11during the preceding calendar month; the amount of such motor 12fuel produced, refined, compounded, manufactured, blended, 13sold, distributed, exported, and used by the licensed 14distributor during the preceding calendar month; the amount of 15such motor fuel lost or destroyed during the preceding 16calendar month; the amount of such motor fuel on hand at the 17close of business for such month; and such other reasonable 18information as the Department may require. If a distributor's 19only activities with respect to motor fuel are either: (1) 20production of alcohol in quantities of less than 10,000 proof 21gallons per year or (2) blending alcohol in quantities of less 22than 10,000 proof gallons per year which such distributor has 23produced, he shall file returns on an annual basis with the 24return for a given year being due by January 20 of the 25following year. Distributors whose total production of alcohol   10400HB1390ham002- 7 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1(whether blended or not) exceeds 10,000 proof gallons per 2year, based on production during the preceding (calendar) year 3or as reasonably projected by the Department if one calendar 4year's record of production cannot be established, shall file 5returns between the 1st and 20th days of each calendar month as 6hereinabove provided.7    The types of motor fuel referred to in the preceding 8paragraph are: (A) All products commonly or commercially known 9or sold as gasoline (including casing-head and absorption or 10natural gasoline), gasohol, motor benzol or motor benzene 11regardless of their classification or uses; and (B) all 12combustible gases, not including liquefied natural gas, which 13exist in a gaseous state at 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at 14.7 14pounds per square inch absolute including, but not limited to, 15liquefied petroleum gases used for highway purposes; and (C) 16special fuel. Only those quantities of combustible gases 17(example (B) above) which are used or sold by the distributor 18to be used to propel motor vehicles on the public highways, or 19which are delivered into a storage tank that is located at a 20facility that has withdrawal facilities which are readily 21accessible to and are capable of dispensing combustible gases 22into the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles, shall be subject 23to return. Distributors of liquefied natural gas are not 24required to make returns under this Section with respect to 25that liquefied natural gas unless (i) the liquefied natural 26gas is dispensed into the fuel supply tank of any motor vehicle   10400HB1390ham002- 8 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1or (ii) the liquefied natural gas is delivered into a storage 2tank that is located at a facility that has withdrawal 3facilities which are readily accessible to and are capable of 4dispensing liquefied natural gas into the fuel supply tanks of 5motor vehicles. For purposes of this Section, a facility is 6considered to have withdrawal facilities that are not "readily 7accessible to and capable of dispensing combustible gases into 8the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles" only if the 9combustible gases or liquefied natural gas are delivered from: 10(i) a dispenser hose that is short enough so that it will not 11reach the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle or (ii) a 12dispenser that is enclosed by a fence or other physical 13barrier so that a vehicle cannot pull alongside the dispenser 14to permit fueling. For the purposes of this Act, liquefied 15petroleum gases shall mean and include any material having a 16vapor pressure not exceeding that allowed for commercial 17propane composed predominantly of the following hydrocarbons, 18either by themselves or as mixtures: Propane, Propylene, 19Butane (normal butane or iso-butane) and Butylene (including 20isomers).21    In case of a sale of special fuel to someone other than a 22licensed distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other 23than in motor vehicles, the distributor shall show in his 24return the amount of invoiced gallons sold and the name and 25address of the purchaser in addition to any other information 26the Department may require.  10400HB1390ham002- 9 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes 2must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 3Law.4    In case of a tax-free sale, as provided in Section 6, of 5motor fuel which the distributor is required by this Section 6to include in his return to the Department, the distributor in 7his return shall show: (1) If the sale is made to another 8licensed distributor the amount sold and the name, address and 9license number of the purchasing distributor; (2) if the sale 10is made to a person where delivery is made outside of this 11State the name and address of such purchaser and the point of 12delivery together with the date and amount delivered; (3) if 13the sale is made to the Federal Government or its 14instrumentalities the amount sold; (4) if the sale is made to a 15municipal corporation owning and operating a local 16transportation system for public service in this State the 17name and address of such purchaser, and the amount sold, as 18evidenced by official forms of exemption certificates properly 19executed and furnished by such purchaser; (5) if the sale is 20made to a privately owned public utility owning and operating 212-axle vehicles designed and used for transporting more than 7 22passengers, which vehicles are used as common carriers in 23general transportation of passengers, are not devoted to any 24specialized purpose and are operated entirely within the 25territorial limits of a single municipality or of any group of 26contiguous municipalities or in a close radius thereof, and   10400HB1390ham002- 10 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1the operations of which are subject to the regulations of the 2Illinois Commerce Commission, then the name and address of 3such purchaser and the amount sold as evidenced by official 4forms of exemption certificates properly executed and 5furnished by the purchaser; (6) if the product sold is special 6fuel and if the sale is made to a licensed supplier under 7conditions which qualify the sale for tax exemption under 8Section 6 of this Act, the amount sold and the name, address 9and license number of the purchaser; and (6) (7) if a sale of 10special fuel is made to someone other than a licensed 11distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other than in 12motor vehicles, by making a specific notation thereof on the 13invoice or sales slip covering such sales and obtaining such 14supporting documentation as may be required by the Department.15    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes 16must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 17Law.18    A person whose license to act as a distributor of motor 19fuel has been revoked shall make a return to the Department 20covering the period from the date of the last return to the 21date of the revocation of the license, which return shall be 22delivered to the Department not later than 10 days from the 23date of the revocation or termination of the license of such 24distributor; the return shall in all other respects be subject 25to the same provisions and conditions as returns by 26distributors licensed under the provisions of this Act.  10400HB1390ham002- 11 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1    The records, waybills and supporting documents kept by 2railroads and other common carriers in the regular course of 3business shall be prima facie evidence of the contents and 4receipt of cars or tanks covered by those records, waybills or 5supporting documents.6    If the Department has reason to believe and does believe 7that the amount shown on the return as purchased, acquired, 8received, exported, sold, used, lost or destroyed is 9incorrect, or that an amount of motor fuel of the types 10required by the second paragraph of this Section to be 11reported to the Department has not been correctly reported the 12Department shall fix an amount for such receipt, sales, 13export, use, loss or destruction according to its best 14judgment and information, which amount so fixed by the 15Department shall be prima facie correct. All returns shall be 16made on forms prepared and furnished by the Department, and 17shall contain such other information as the Department may 18reasonably require. The return must be accompanied by 19appropriate computer-generated magnetic media supporting 20schedule data in the format required by the Department, 21unless, as provided by rule, the Department grants an 22exception upon petition of a taxpayer. All licensed 23distributors shall report all losses of motor fuel sustained 24on account of fire, theft, spillage, spoilage, leakage, or any 25other provable cause when filing the return for the period 26during which the loss occurred. If the distributor reports   10400HB1390ham002- 12 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1losses due to fire or theft, then the distributor must include 2fire department or police department reports and any other 3documentation that the Department may require. The mere making 4of the report does not assure the allowance of the loss as a 5reduction in tax liability. Losses of motor fuel as the result 6of evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may 7not exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning 8of the month, plus the receipts of gallonage during the month, 9minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the end of the 10month. Any loss reported that is in excess of 1% shall be 11subject to the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. On and 12after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month period January through 13June, net losses of motor fuel (for each category of motor fuel 14that is required to be reported on a return) as the result of 15evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may not 16exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning of 17each January, plus the receipts of gallonage each January 18through June, minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the 19end of each June. On and after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month 20period July through December, net losses of motor fuel (for 21each category of motor fuel that is required to be reported on 22a return) as the result of evaporation or shrinkage due to 23temperature variations may not exceed 1% of the total gallons 24in storage at the beginning of each July, plus the receipts of 25gallonage each July through December, minus the gallonage 26remaining in storage at the end of each December. Any net loss   10400HB1390ham002- 13 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1reported that is in excess of this amount shall be subject to 2the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. For purposes of this 3Section, "net loss" means the number of gallons gained through 4temperature variations minus the number of gallons lost 5through temperature variations or evaporation for each of the 6respective 6-month periods.7    If any payment provided for in this Section exceeds the 8distributor's liabilities under this Act, as shown on an 9original return, the Department may authorize the distributor 10to credit such excess payment against liability subsequently 11to be remitted to the Department under this Act, in accordance 12with reasonable rules adopted by the Department. If the 13Department subsequently determines that all or any part of the 14credit taken was not actually due to the distributor, the 15distributor's discount shall be reduced by an amount equal to 16the difference between the discount as applied to the credit 17taken and that actually due, and that distributor shall be 18liable for penalties and interest on such difference. 19(Source: P.A. 100-9, eff. 7-1-17; 100-1171, eff. 1-4-19.) 20    (35 ILCS 505/6)  (from Ch. 120, par. 422)21    Sec. 6. Collection of tax; distributors. A distributor who 22sells or distributes any motor fuel, which he is required by 23Section 5 to report to the Department when filing a return, 24shall (except as hereinafter provided) collect at the time of 25such sale and distribution, the amount of tax imposed under   10400HB1390ham002- 14 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1this Act on all such motor fuel sold and distributed, and at 2the time of making a return, the distributor shall pay to the 3Department the amount so collected less a discount of 2% 4through June 30, 2003 and 1.75% thereafter which is allowed to 5reimburse the distributor for the expenses incurred in keeping 6records, preparing and filing returns, collecting and 7remitting the tax and supplying data to the Department on 8request, and shall also pay to the Department an amount equal 9to the amount that would be collectible as a tax in the event 10of a sale thereof on all such motor fuel used by said 11distributor during the period covered by the return. However, 12no payment shall be made based upon dyed diesel fuel used by 13the distributor for non-highway purposes. The discount shall 14only be applicable to the amount of tax payment which 15accompanies a return which is filed timely in accordance with 16Section 5 of this Act. In each subsequent sale of motor fuel on 17which the amount of tax imposed under this Act has been 18collected as provided in this Section, the amount so collected 19shall be added to the selling price, so that the amount of tax 20is paid ultimately by the user of the motor fuel. However, no 21collection or payment shall be made in the case of the sale or 22use of any motor fuel to the extent to which such sale or use 23of motor fuel may not, under the constitution and statutes of 24the United States, be made the subject of taxation by this 25State. A person whose license to act as a distributor of fuel 26has been revoked shall, at the time of making a return, also   10400HB1390ham002- 15 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1pay to the Department an amount equal to the amount that would 2be collectible as a tax in the event of a sale thereof on all 3motor fuel, which he is required by the second paragraph of 4Section 5 to report to the Department in making a return, and 5which he had on hand on the date on which the license was 6revoked, and with respect to which no tax had been previously 7paid under this Act.8    A distributor may make tax free sales of motor fuel, with 9respect to which he is otherwise required to collect the tax, 10only as specified in the following items 1 through 7.11        1. When the sale is made to a person holding a valid 12    unrevoked license as a distributor, by making a specific 13    notation thereof on invoices or sales slip covering each 14    sale.15        2. When the sale is made with delivery to a purchaser 16    outside of this State.17        3. When the sale is made to the Federal Government or 18    its instrumentalities.19        4. When the sale is made to a municipal corporation 20    owning and operating a local transportation system for 21    public service in this State when an official certificate 22    of exemption is obtained in lieu of the tax.23        5. When the sale is made to a privately owned public 24    utility owning and operating 2 axle vehicles designed and 25    used for transporting more than 7 passengers, which 26    vehicles are used as common carriers in general   10400HB1390ham002- 16 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1    transportation of passengers, are not devoted to any 2    specialized purpose and are operated entirely within the 3    territorial limits of a single municipality or of any 4    group of contiguous municipalities, or in a close radius 5    thereof, and the operations of which are subject to the 6    regulations of the Illinois Commerce Commission, when an 7    official certificate of exemption is obtained in lieu of 8    the tax.9        6. (Blank). When a sale of special fuel is made to a 10    person holding a valid, unrevoked license as a supplier, 11    by making a specific notation thereof on the invoice or 12    sales slip covering each such sale.13        7. When a sale of dyed diesel fuel is made by the 14    licensed distributor to the end user of the fuel who is not 15    a licensed distributor or a licensed supplier for 16    non-highway purposes and the fuel is (i) delivered from a 17    vehicle designed for the specific purpose of such sales 18    and delivered directly into a stationary bulk storage tank 19    that displays the notice required by Section 4f of this 20    Act, (ii) delivered from a vehicle designed for the 21    specific purpose of such sales and delivered directly into 22    the fuel supply tanks of non-highway vehicles that are not 23    required to be registered for highway use, or (iii) 24    dispensed from a dyed diesel fuel dispensing facility that 25    has withdrawal facilities that are not readily accessible 26    to and are not capable of dispensing dyed diesel fuel into   10400HB1390ham002- 17 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1    the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle. 2        A specific notation is required on the invoice or 3    sales slip covering such sales, and any supporting 4    documentation that may be required by the Department must 5    be obtained by the distributor. The distributor shall 6    obtain and keep the supporting documentation in such form 7    as the Department may require by rule.8        For purposes of this item 7, a dyed diesel fuel 9    dispensing facility is considered to have withdrawal 10    facilities that are "not readily accessible to and not 11    capable of dispensing dyed diesel fuel into the fuel 12    supply tank of a motor vehicle" only if the dyed diesel 13    fuel is delivered from: (i) a dispenser hose that is short 14    enough so that it will not reach the fuel supply tank of a 15    motor vehicle or (ii) a dispenser that is enclosed by a 16    fence or other physical barrier so that a vehicle cannot 17    pull alongside the dispenser to permit fueling. 18        8. (Blank).19    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes 20must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 21Law.22    All suits or other proceedings brought for the purpose of 23recovering any taxes, interest or penalties due the State of 24Illinois under this Act may be maintained in the name of the 25Department.26(Source: P.A. 102-1019, eff. 5-27-22.)   10400HB1390ham002- 18 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1    (35 ILCS 505/7)  (from Ch. 120, par. 423)2    Sec. 7. Any person who is , not licensed as a receiver or , 3distributor and who purchases or supplier, purchasing fuel or 4motor fuel as to which there has been no charge made to him of 5the tax imposed by Section 2 or 2a, or both, shall make payment 6of the tax imposed by Section 2a of this Act and if the same be 7thereafter used in the operation of a motor vehicle upon the 8public highways, make payment of the motor fuel tax computed 9at the rate prescribed in Section 2 of this Act on the amount 10so used, such payment to be made to the Department not later 11than the 20th day of the month succeeding the month in which 12the motor fuel was so used.13    This Section does not apply in cases of such use of motor 14fuel which was obtained tax-free under an official certificate 15of exemption mentioned in Sections 6 and 6a of this Act.16(Source: P.A. 86-125.) 17    (35 ILCS 505/11.5)  (from Ch. 120, par. 427a)18    Sec. 11.5. In the event that liability upon the bond filed 19by a distributor, supplier, or receiver with the Department 20shall be discharged or reduced, whether by judgment rendered, 21payment made or otherwise, or if in the opinion of the 22Department the bond of any distributor, supplier, or receiver 23theretofore given shall become unsatisfactory, then the 24distributor, supplier, or receiver shall forthwith, upon the   10400HB1390ham002- 19 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1written demand of the Department, file a new bond in the same 2manner and form and in an amount and with sureties 3satisfactory to the Department, failing which the Department 4shall forthwith revoke the license of the distributor, 5supplier, or receiver.6    If such new bond shall be furnished by the distributor, 7supplier, or receiver as above provided, the Department shall 8cancel the bond for which such new bond shall be substituted.9    Any surety on any bond furnished by any distributor, 10supplier, or receiver shall be released and discharged from 11any and all liability to the State of Illinois accruing on such 12bond after the expiration of 60 days from the date upon which 13such surety shall have filed with the Department written 14request so to be released and discharged. But such request 15shall not operate to relieve, release or discharge such surety 16from any liability already accrued, or which shall accrue, 17before the expiration of said 60-day period.

Reimbursement 9and repayment shall be made by the Department upon receipt of 10adequate proof of taxes directly paid to another state and the 11amount of motor fuel used in that state.12    Claims based in whole or in part on taxes paid to another 13state shall include (i) a certified copy of the tax return 14filed with such other state by the claimant; (ii) a copy of 15either the cancelled check paying the tax due on such return, 16or a receipt acknowledging payment of the tax due on such tax 17return; and (iii) such other information as the Department may 18reasonably require. This paragraph shall not apply to taxes 19paid on returns filed under Section 13a.3 of this Act.20    Any person who purchases motor fuel use tax decals as 21required by Section 13a.4 and pays an amount of fees for such 22decals that exceeds the amount due shall be reimbursed and 23repaid the amount of the decal fees that are deemed by the 24department to be in excess of the amount due. Alternatively, 25any person who purchases motor fuel use tax decals as required 26by Section 13a.4 may credit any excess decal payment verified   10400HB1390ham002- 25 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1by the Department against amounts subsequently due for the 2purchase of additional decals, until such time as no excess 3payment remains. 4    Claims for such reimbursement must be made to the 5Department of Revenue, duly verified by the claimant (or by 6the claimant's legal representative if the claimant has died 7or become a person under legal disability), upon forms 8prescribed by the Department. The claim must state such facts 9relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture or 10production of the motor fuel by the claimant as the Department 11may deem necessary, and the time when, and the circumstances 12of its loss or the specific purpose for which it was used (as 13the case may be), together with such other information as the 14Department may reasonably require. No claim based upon idle 15time shall be allowed. Claims for reimbursement for 16overpayment of decal fees shall be made to the Department of 17Revenue, duly verified by the claimant (or by the claimant's 18legal representative if the claimant has died or become a 19person under legal disability), upon forms prescribed by the 20Department. The claim shall state facts relating to the 21overpayment of decal fees, together with such other 22information as the Department may reasonably require. Claims 23for reimbursement of overpayment of decal fees paid on or 24after January 1, 2011 must be filed not later than one year 25after the date on which the fees were paid by the claimant. If 26it is determined that the Department should reimburse a   10400HB1390ham002- 26 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1claimant for overpayment of decal fees, the Department shall 2first apply the amount of such refund against any tax or 3penalty or interest due by the claimant under Section 13a of 4this Act. 5    Claims for full reimbursement for taxes paid on or before 6December 31, 1999 must be filed not later than one year after 7the date on which the tax was paid by the claimant. If, 8however, a claim for such reimbursement otherwise meeting the 9requirements of this Section is filed more than one year but 10less than 2 years after that date, the claimant shall be 11reimbursed at the rate of 80% of the amount to which he would 12have been entitled if his claim had been timely filed.13    Claims for full reimbursement for taxes paid on or after 14January 1, 2000 must be filed not later than 2 years after the 15date on which the tax was paid by the claimant.16    The Department may make such investigation of the 17correctness of the facts stated in such claims as it deems 18necessary. When the Department has approved any such claim, it 19shall pay to the claimant (or to the claimant's legal 20representative, as such if the claimant has died or become a 21person under legal disability) the reimbursement provided in 22this Section, out of any moneys appropriated to it for that 23purpose.24    Any distributor or supplier who has paid the tax imposed 25by Section 2 of this Act upon motor fuel lost or used by such 26distributor or supplier for any purpose other than operating a   10400HB1390ham002- 27 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1motor vehicle upon the public highways or waters may file a 2claim for credit or refund to recover the amount so paid. Such 3claims shall be filed on forms prescribed by the Department. 4Such claims shall be made to the Department, duly verified by 5the claimant (or by the claimant's legal representative if the 6claimant has died or become a person under legal disability), 7upon forms prescribed by the Department. The claim shall state 8such facts relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture 9or production of the motor fuel by the claimant as the 10Department may deem necessary and the time when the loss or 11nontaxable use occurred, and the circumstances of its loss or 12the specific purpose for which it was used (as the case may 13be), together with such other information as the Department 14may reasonably require. Claims must be filed not later than 15one year after the date on which the tax was paid by the 16claimant.17    The Department may make such investigation of the 18correctness of the facts stated in such claims as it deems 19necessary. When the Department approves a claim, the 20Department shall issue a refund or credit memorandum as 21requested by the taxpayer, to the distributor or supplier who 22made the payment for which the refund or credit is being given 23or, if the distributor or supplier has died or become 24incompetent, to such distributor's or supplier's legal 25representative, as such. The amount of such credit memorandum 26shall be credited against any tax due or to become due under   10400HB1390ham002- 28 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1this Act from the distributor or supplier who made the payment 2for which credit has been given.3    Any credit or refund that is allowed under this Section 4shall bear interest at the rate and in the manner specified in 5the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act.6    In case the distributor or supplier requests and the 7Department determines that the claimant is entitled to a 8refund, such refund shall be made only from such appropriation 9as may be available for that purpose. If it appears unlikely 10that the amount appropriated would permit everyone having a 11claim allowed during the period covered by such appropriation 12to elect to receive a cash refund, the Department, by rule or 13regulation, shall provide for the payment of refunds in 14hardship cases and shall define what types of cases qualify as 15hardship cases.16    In any case in which there has been an erroneous refund of 17tax or fees payable under this Section, a notice of tax 18liability may be issued at any time within 3 years from the 19making of that refund, or within 5 years from the making of 20that refund if it appears that any part of the refund was 21induced by fraud or the misrepresentation of material fact. 22The amount of any proposed assessment set forth by the 23Department shall be limited to the amount of the erroneous 24refund.25    If no tax is due and no proceeding is pending to determine 26whether such distributor or supplier is indebted to the   10400HB1390ham002- 29 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1Department for tax, the credit memorandum so issued may be 2assigned and set over by the lawful holder thereof, subject to 3reasonable rules of the Department, to any other licensed 4distributor or supplier who is subject to this Act, and the 5amount thereof applied by the Department against any tax due 6or to become due under this Act from such assignee.7    If the payment for which the distributor's or supplier's 8claim is filed is held in the protest fund of the State 9Treasury during the pendency of the claim for credit 10proceedings pursuant to the order of the court in accordance 11with Section 2a of the State Officers and Employees Money 12Disposition Act and if it is determined by the Department or by 13the final order of a reviewing court under the Administrative 14Review Law that the claimant is entitled to all or a part of 15the credit claimed, the claimant, instead of receiving a 16credit memorandum from the Department, shall receive a cash 17refund from the protest fund as provided for in Section 2a of 18the State Officers and Employees Money Disposition Act.19    If any person ceases to be licensed as a distributor or 20supplier while still holding an unused credit memorandum 21issued under this Act, such person may, at his election 22(instead of assigning the credit memorandum to a licensed 23distributor or licensed supplier under this Act), surrender 24such unused credit memorandum to the Department and receive a 25refund of the amount to which such person is entitled.26    For claims based upon taxes paid on or before December 31,   10400HB1390ham002- 30 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a12000, a claim based upon the use of undyed diesel fuel shall 2not be allowed except (i) if allowed under the following 3paragraph or (ii) for undyed diesel fuel used by a commercial 4vehicle, as that term is defined in Section 1-111.8 of the 5Illinois Vehicle Code, for any purpose other than operating 6the commercial vehicle upon the public highways and unlicensed 7commercial vehicles operating on private property. Claims 8shall be limited to commercial vehicles that are operated for 9both highway purposes and any purposes other than operating 10such vehicles upon the public highways.11    For claims based upon taxes paid on or after January 1, 122000, a claim based upon the use of undyed diesel fuel shall 13not be allowed except (i) if allowed under the preceding 14paragraph or (ii) for claims for the following: 15        (1) Undyed diesel fuel used (i) in a manufacturing 16    process, as defined in Section 2-45 of the Retailers' 17    Occupation Tax Act, wherein the undyed diesel fuel becomes 18    a component part of a product or by-product, other than 19    fuel or motor fuel, when the use of dyed diesel fuel in 20    that manufacturing process results in a product that is 21    unsuitable for its intended use or (ii) for testing 22    machinery and equipment in a manufacturing process, as 23    defined in Section 2-45 of the Retailers' Occupation Tax 24    Act, wherein the testing takes place on private property. 25        (2) Undyed diesel fuel used by a manufacturer on 26    private property in the research and development, as   10400HB1390ham002- 31 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1    defined in Section 1.29, of machinery or equipment 2    intended for manufacture. 3        (3) Undyed diesel fuel used by a single unit 4    self-propelled agricultural fertilizer implement, 5    designed for on and off road use, equipped with flotation 6    tires and specially adapted for the application of plant 7    food materials or agricultural chemicals. 8        (4) Undyed diesel fuel used by a commercial motor 9    vehicle for any purpose other than operating the 10    commercial motor vehicle upon the public highways. Claims 11    shall be limited to commercial motor vehicles that are 12    operated for both highway purposes and any purposes other 13    than operating such vehicles upon the public highways. 14        (5) Undyed diesel fuel used by a unit of local 15    government in its operation of an airport if the undyed 16    diesel fuel is used directly in airport operations on 17    airport property. 18        (6) Undyed diesel fuel used by refrigeration units 19    that are permanently mounted to a semitrailer, as defined 20    in Section 1.28 of this Law, wherein the refrigeration 21    units have a fuel supply system dedicated solely for the 22    operation of the refrigeration units. 23        (7) Undyed diesel fuel used by power take-off 24    equipment as defined in Section 1.27 of this Law.25        (8) Beginning on the effective date of this amendatory 26    Act of the 94th General Assembly, undyed diesel fuel used   10400HB1390ham002- 32 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1    by tugs and spotter equipment to shift vehicles or parcels 2    on both private and airport property. Any claim under this 3    item (8) may be made only by a claimant that owns tugs and 4    spotter equipment and operates that equipment on both 5    private and airport property. The aggregate of all credits 6    or refunds resulting from claims filed under this item (8) 7    by a claimant in any calendar year may not exceed 8    $100,000. A claim may not be made under this item (8) by 9    the same claimant more often than once each quarter.

The Department shall fix the penalty of such 7bond in each case taking into consideration the amount of 8motor fuel expected to be sold, distributed, exported, and 9used by such applicant and the penalty fixed by the Department 10shall be such, as in its opinion, will protect the State of 11Illinois against failure to pay the amount hereinafter 12provided on motor fuel sold, distributed, exported, and used, 13but the amount of the penalty fixed by the Department shall not 14exceed twice the monthly amount that would be collectable as a 15tax in the event of a sale on all the motor fuel sold, 16distributed, exported, and used by the distributor inclusive 17of tax-free sales, exports, use, or distribution. Upon receipt 18of the application and bond in proper form, the Department 19shall issue to the applicant a license to act as a distributor. 20No person who is in default to the State for monies due under 21this Act for the sale, distribution, export, or use of motor 22fuel shall receive a license to act as a distributor.23    (b) A license shall not be granted to any person whose 24principal place of business is in a state other than Illinois, 25unless such person is licensed for motor fuel distribution or 26export in the state in which the principal place of business is   10400HB1390ham002- 5 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1located and that such person is not in default to that State 2for any monies due for the sale, distribution, export, or use 3of motor fuel.4    (c) On January 1, 2026, all valid and unrevoked supplier's 5licenses and their corresponding receiver's licenses issued by 6the Department shall be converted by the Department to 7distributor's licenses and corresponding receiver's licenses. 8Beginning on January 1, 2026, holders of these converted 9distributor's licenses shall be subject to the same provisions 10and requirements as other licensed distributors under this 11Law. 12(Source: P.A. 96-1384, eff. 7-29-10.) 13    (35 ILCS 505/3d)14    Sec. 3d.

If a distributor's 19only activities with respect to motor fuel are either: (1) 20production of alcohol in quantities of less than 10,000 proof 21gallons per year or (2) blending alcohol in quantities of less 22than 10,000 proof gallons per year which such distributor has 23produced, he shall file returns on an annual basis with the 24return for a given year being due by January 20 of the 25following year. Distributors whose total production of alcohol   10400HB1390ham002- 7 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1(whether blended or not) exceeds 10,000 proof gallons per 2year, based on production during the preceding (calendar) year 3or as reasonably projected by the Department if one calendar 4year's record of production cannot be established, shall file 5returns between the 1st and 20th days of each calendar month as 6hereinabove provided.7    The types of motor fuel referred to in the preceding 8paragraph are: (A) All products commonly or commercially known 9or sold as gasoline (including casing-head and absorption or 10natural gasoline), gasohol, motor benzol or motor benzene 11regardless of their classification or uses; and (B) all 12combustible gases, not including liquefied natural gas, which 13exist in a gaseous state at 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at 14.7 14pounds per square inch absolute including, but not limited to, 15liquefied petroleum gases used for highway purposes; and (C) 16special fuel. Only those quantities of combustible gases 17(example (B) above) which are used or sold by the distributor 18to be used to propel motor vehicles on the public highways, or 19which are delivered into a storage tank that is located at a 20facility that has withdrawal facilities which are readily 21accessible to and are capable of dispensing combustible gases 22into the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles, shall be subject 23to return. Distributors of liquefied natural gas are not 24required to make returns under this Section with respect to 25that liquefied natural gas unless (i) the liquefied natural 26gas is dispensed into the fuel supply tank of any motor vehicle   10400HB1390ham002- 8 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1or (ii) the liquefied natural gas is delivered into a storage 2tank that is located at a facility that has withdrawal 3facilities which are readily accessible to and are capable of 4dispensing liquefied natural gas into the fuel supply tanks of 5motor vehicles. For purposes of this Section, a facility is 6considered to have withdrawal facilities that are not "readily 7accessible to and capable of dispensing combustible gases into 8the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles" only if the 9combustible gases or liquefied natural gas are delivered from: 10(i) a dispenser hose that is short enough so that it will not 11reach the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle or (ii) a 12dispenser that is enclosed by a fence or other physical 13barrier so that a vehicle cannot pull alongside the dispenser 14to permit fueling. For the purposes of this Act, liquefied 15petroleum gases shall mean and include any material having a 16vapor pressure not exceeding that allowed for commercial 17propane composed predominantly of the following hydrocarbons, 18either by themselves or as mixtures: Propane, Propylene, 19Butane (normal butane or iso-butane) and Butylene (including 20isomers).21    In case of a sale of special fuel to someone other than a 22licensed distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other 23than in motor vehicles, the distributor shall show in his 24return the amount of invoiced gallons sold and the name and 25address of the purchaser in addition to any other information 26the Department may require.  10400HB1390ham002- 9 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes 2must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 3Law.4    In case of a tax-free sale, as provided in Section 6, of 5motor fuel which the distributor is required by this Section 6to include in his return to the Department, the distributor in 7his return shall show: (1) If the sale is made to another 8licensed distributor the amount sold and the name, address and 9license number of the purchasing distributor; (2) if the sale 10is made to a person where delivery is made outside of this 11State the name and address of such purchaser and the point of 12delivery together with the date and amount delivered; (3) if 13the sale is made to the Federal Government or its 14instrumentalities the amount sold; (4) if the sale is made to a 15municipal corporation owning and operating a local 16transportation system for public service in this State the 17name and address of such purchaser, and the amount sold, as 18evidenced by official forms of exemption certificates properly 19executed and furnished by such purchaser; (5) if the sale is 20made to a privately owned public utility owning and operating 212-axle vehicles designed and used for transporting more than 7 22passengers, which vehicles are used as common carriers in 23general transportation of passengers, are not devoted to any 24specialized purpose and are operated entirely within the 25territorial limits of a single municipality or of any group of 26contiguous municipalities or in a close radius thereof, and   10400HB1390ham002- 10 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1the operations of which are subject to the regulations of the 2Illinois Commerce Commission, then the name and address of 3such purchaser and the amount sold as evidenced by official 4forms of exemption certificates properly executed and 5furnished by the purchaser; (6) if the product sold is special 6fuel and if the sale is made to a licensed supplier under 7conditions which qualify the sale for tax exemption under 8Section 6 of this Act, the amount sold and the name, address 9and license number of the purchaser; and (6) (7) if a sale of 10special fuel is made to someone other than a licensed 11distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other than in 12motor vehicles, by making a specific notation thereof on the 13invoice or sales slip covering such sales and obtaining such 14supporting documentation as may be required by the Department.15    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes 16must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 17Law.18    A person whose license to act as a distributor of motor 19fuel has been revoked shall make a return to the Department 20covering the period from the date of the last return to the 21date of the revocation of the license, which return shall be 22delivered to the Department not later than 10 days from the 23date of the revocation or termination of the license of such 24distributor; the return shall in all other respects be subject 25to the same provisions and conditions as returns by 26distributors licensed under the provisions of this Act.  10400HB1390ham002- 11 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1    The records, waybills and supporting documents kept by 2railroads and other common carriers in the regular course of 3business shall be prima facie evidence of the contents and 4receipt of cars or tanks covered by those records, waybills or 5supporting documents.6    If the Department has reason to believe and does believe 7that the amount shown on the return as purchased, acquired, 8received, exported, sold, used, lost or destroyed is 9incorrect, or that an amount of motor fuel of the types 10required by the second paragraph of this Section to be 11reported to the Department has not been correctly reported the 12Department shall fix an amount for such receipt, sales, 13export, use, loss or destruction according to its best 14judgment and information, which amount so fixed by the 15Department shall be prima facie correct. All returns shall be 16made on forms prepared and furnished by the Department, and 17shall contain such other information as the Department may 18reasonably require. The return must be accompanied by 19appropriate computer-generated magnetic media supporting 20schedule data in the format required by the Department, 21unless, as provided by rule, the Department grants an 22exception upon petition of a taxpayer. All licensed 23distributors shall report all losses of motor fuel sustained 24on account of fire, theft, spillage, spoilage, leakage, or any 25other provable cause when filing the return for the period 26during which the loss occurred. If the distributor reports   10400HB1390ham002- 12 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1losses due to fire or theft, then the distributor must include 2fire department or police department reports and any other 3documentation that the Department may require. The mere making 4of the report does not assure the allowance of the loss as a 5reduction in tax liability. Losses of motor fuel as the result 6of evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may 7not exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning 8of the month, plus the receipts of gallonage during the month, 9minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the end of the 10month. Any loss reported that is in excess of 1% shall be 11subject to the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. On and 12after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month period January through 13June, net losses of motor fuel (for each category of motor fuel 14that is required to be reported on a return) as the result of 15evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may not 16exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning of 17each January, plus the receipts of gallonage each January 18through June, minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the 19end of each June. On and after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month 20period July through December, net losses of motor fuel (for 21each category of motor fuel that is required to be reported on 22a return) as the result of evaporation or shrinkage due to 23temperature variations may not exceed 1% of the total gallons 24in storage at the beginning of each July, plus the receipts of 25gallonage each July through December, minus the gallonage 26remaining in storage at the end of each December. Any net loss   10400HB1390ham002- 13 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1reported that is in excess of this amount shall be subject to 2the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. For purposes of this 3Section, "net loss" means the number of gallons gained through 4temperature variations minus the number of gallons lost 5through temperature variations or evaporation for each of the 6respective 6-month periods.7    If any payment provided for in this Section exceeds the 8distributor's liabilities under this Act, as shown on an 9original return, the Department may authorize the distributor 10to credit such excess payment against liability subsequently 11to be remitted to the Department under this Act, in accordance 12with reasonable rules adopted by the Department. If the 13Department subsequently determines that all or any part of the 14credit taken was not actually due to the distributor, the 15distributor's discount shall be reduced by an amount equal to 16the difference between the discount as applied to the credit 17taken and that actually due, and that distributor shall be 18liable for penalties and interest on such difference. 19(Source: P.A. 100-9, eff. 7-1-17; 100-1171, eff. 1-4-19.) 20    (35 ILCS 505/6)  (from Ch. 120, par. 422)21    Sec. 6. Collection of tax; distributors. A distributor who 22sells or distributes any motor fuel, which he is required by 23Section 5 to report to the Department when filing a return, 24shall (except as hereinafter provided) collect at the time of 25such sale and distribution, the amount of tax imposed under   10400HB1390ham002- 14 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1this Act on all such motor fuel sold and distributed, and at 2the time of making a return, the distributor shall pay to the 3Department the amount so collected less a discount of 2% 4through June 30, 2003 and 1.75% thereafter which is allowed to 5reimburse the distributor for the expenses incurred in keeping 6records, preparing and filing returns, collecting and 7remitting the tax and supplying data to the Department on 8request, and shall also pay to the Department an amount equal 9to the amount that would be collectible as a tax in the event 10of a sale thereof on all such motor fuel used by said 11distributor during the period covered by the return. However, 12no payment shall be made based upon dyed diesel fuel used by 13the distributor for non-highway purposes. The discount shall 14only be applicable to the amount of tax payment which 15accompanies a return which is filed timely in accordance with 16Section 5 of this Act. In each subsequent sale of motor fuel on 17which the amount of tax imposed under this Act has been 18collected as provided in this Section, the amount so collected 19shall be added to the selling price, so that the amount of tax 20is paid ultimately by the user of the motor fuel. However, no 21collection or payment shall be made in the case of the sale or 22use of any motor fuel to the extent to which such sale or use 23of motor fuel may not, under the constitution and statutes of 24the United States, be made the subject of taxation by this 25State. A person whose license to act as a distributor of fuel 26has been revoked shall, at the time of making a return, also   10400HB1390ham002- 15 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1pay to the Department an amount equal to the amount that would 2be collectible as a tax in the event of a sale thereof on all 3motor fuel, which he is required by the second paragraph of 4Section 5 to report to the Department in making a return, and 5which he had on hand on the date on which the license was 6revoked, and with respect to which no tax had been previously 7paid under this Act.8    A distributor may make tax free sales of motor fuel, with 9respect to which he is otherwise required to collect the tax, 10only as specified in the following items 1 through 7.11        1. When the sale is made to a person holding a valid 12    unrevoked license as a distributor, by making a specific 13    notation thereof on invoices or sales slip covering each 14    sale.15        2.

The claim must state such facts 9relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture or 10production of the motor fuel by the claimant as the Department 11may deem necessary, and the time when, and the circumstances 12of its loss or the specific purpose for which it was used (as 13the case may be), together with such other information as the 14Department may reasonably require. No claim based upon idle 15time shall be allowed. Claims for reimbursement for 16overpayment of decal fees shall be made to the Department of 17Revenue, duly verified by the claimant (or by the claimant's 18legal representative if the claimant has died or become a 19person under legal disability), upon forms prescribed by the 20Department.

If, 8however, a claim for such reimbursement otherwise meeting the 9requirements of this Section is filed more than one year but 10less than 2 years after that date, the claimant shall be 11reimbursed at the rate of 80% of the amount to which he would 12have been entitled if his claim had been timely filed.13    Claims for full reimbursement for taxes paid on or after 14January 1, 2000 must be filed not later than 2 years after the 15date on which the tax was paid by the claimant.16    The Department may make such investigation of the 17correctness of the facts stated in such claims as it deems 18necessary. When the Department has approved any such claim, it 19shall pay to the claimant (or to the claimant's legal 20representative, as such if the claimant has died or become a 21person under legal disability) the reimbursement provided in 22this Section, out of any moneys appropriated to it for that 23purpose.24    Any distributor or supplier who has paid the tax imposed 25by Section 2 of this Act upon motor fuel lost or used by such 26distributor or supplier for any purpose other than operating a   10400HB1390ham002- 27 -LRB104 07494 HLH 22870 a1motor vehicle upon the public highways or waters may file a 2claim for credit or refund to recover the amount so paid. Such 3claims shall be filed on forms prescribed by the Department. 4Such claims shall be made to the Department, duly verified by 5the claimant (or by the claimant's legal representative if the 6claimant has died or become a person under legal disability), 7upon forms prescribed by the Department. The claim shall state 8such facts relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture 9or production of the motor fuel by the claimant as the 10Department may deem necessary and the time when the loss or 11nontaxable use occurred, and the circumstances of its loss or 12the specific purpose for which it was used (as the case may 13be), together with such other information as the Department 14may reasonably require. Claims must be filed not later than 15one year after the date on which the tax was paid by the 16claimant.17    The Department may make such investigation of the 18correctness of the facts stated in such claims as it deems 19necessary.
