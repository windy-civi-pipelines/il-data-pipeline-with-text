The Motor Fuel Tax Law is amended by changing 5Sections 1.2, 1.20, 3d, 5, 6, 7, 11.5, 12, 12a, 13, 14a, 15, 6and 16 as follows: 7    (35 ILCS 505/1.2)  (from Ch. 120, par. 417.2)8    Sec. 1.2. Distributor. "Distributor" means a person who 9does any of the following: (1) either (i) produces motor fuel 10in this State; (2) , refines motor fuel in this State; (3) , 11blends motor fuel in this State; (4) , compounds motor fuel in 12this State; (5) or manufactures motor fuel in this State; (6) , 13or (ii) transports motor fuel into this State; (7) , or (iii) 14exports motor fuel out of this State; or (8) , or (iv) engages 15in the distribution of motor fuel primarily by tank car or tank 16truck, or both, and who operates an Illinois bulk plant where 17he or she has active bulk storage capacity of not less than 1830,000 gallons for gasoline as defined in item (A) of Section 5 19of this Law.20    "Distributor" does not, however, include a person who 21receives or transports into this State and sells or uses motor 22fuel under such circumstances as preclude the collection of 23the tax herein imposed, by reason of the provisions of the   HB1390- 2 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1constitution and statutes of the United States. However, a 2person operating a motor vehicle into the State, may transport 3motor fuel in the ordinary fuel tank attached to the motor 4vehicle for the operation of the motor vehicle, without being 5considered a distributor. Any railroad registered under 6Section 18c-7201 of the Illinois Vehicle Code may deliver 7special fuel directly into the fuel supply tank of a 8locomotive owned, operated, or controlled by any other 9railroad registered under Section 18c-7201 of the Illinois 10Vehicle Code without being considered a distributor or 11supplier.12(Source: P.A. 96-1384, eff. 7-29-10.) 13    (35 ILCS 505/1.20)  (from Ch. 120, par. 417.20)14    Sec. 1.20.

Right to blend.  HB1390- 3 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1    (a) A distributor who is properly licensed and permitted 2as a blender pursuant to this Act may blend petroleum-based 3diesel fuel with biodiesel and sell the blended or unblended 4product on any premises owned and operated by the distributor 5for the purpose of supporting or facilitating the retail sale 6of motor fuel. 7    (b) A refiner or distributor supplier of petroleum-based 8diesel fuel or biodiesel shall not refuse to sell or transport 9to a distributor who is properly licensed and permitted as a 10blender pursuant to this Act any petroleum-based diesel fuel 11or biodiesel based on the distributor's or dealer's intent to 12use that product for blending. 13(Source: P.A. 102-700, eff. 4-19-22.) 14    (35 ILCS 505/5)  (from Ch. 120, par. 421)15    Sec. 5. Distributor's monthly return. Except as 16hereinafter provided, a person holding a valid unrevoked 17license to act as a distributor of motor fuel shall, between 18the 1st and 20th days of each calendar month, make return to 19the Department, showing an itemized statement of the number of 20invoiced gallons of motor fuel of the types specified in this 21Section which were purchased, acquired, received, or exported 22during the preceding calendar month; the amount of such motor 23fuel produced, refined, compounded, manufactured, blended, 24sold, distributed, exported, and used by the licensed 25distributor during the preceding calendar month; the amount of   HB1390- 4 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1such motor fuel lost or destroyed during the preceding 2calendar month; the amount of such motor fuel on hand at the 3close of business for such month; and such other reasonable 4information as the Department may require. If a distributor's 5only activities with respect to motor fuel are either: (1) 6production of alcohol in quantities of less than 10,000 proof 7gallons per year or (2) blending alcohol in quantities of less 8than 10,000 proof gallons per year which such distributor has 9produced, he shall file returns on an annual basis with the 10return for a given year being due by January 20 of the 11following year. Distributors whose total production of alcohol 12(whether blended or not) exceeds 10,000 proof gallons per 13year, based on production during the preceding (calendar) year 14or as reasonably projected by the Department if one calendar 15year's record of production cannot be established, shall file 16returns between the 1st and 20th days of each calendar month as 17hereinabove provided.18    The types of motor fuel referred to in the preceding 19paragraph are: (A) All products commonly or commercially known 20or sold as gasoline (including casing-head and absorption or 21natural gasoline), gasohol, motor benzol or motor benzene 22regardless of their classification or uses; and (B) all 23combustible gases, not including liquefied natural gas, which 24exist in a gaseous state at 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at 14.7 25pounds per square inch absolute including, but not limited to, 26liquefied petroleum gases used for highway purposes; and (C)   HB1390- 5 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1special fuel. Only those quantities of combustible gases 2(example (B) above) which are used or sold by the distributor 3to be used to propel motor vehicles on the public highways, or 4which are delivered into a storage tank that is located at a 5facility that has withdrawal facilities which are readily 6accessible to and are capable of dispensing combustible gases 7into the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles, shall be subject 8to return. Distributors of liquefied natural gas are not 9required to make returns under this Section with respect to 10that liquefied natural gas unless (i) the liquefied natural 11gas is dispensed into the fuel supply tank of any motor vehicle 12or (ii) the liquefied natural gas is delivered into a storage 13tank that is located at a facility that has withdrawal 14facilities which are readily accessible to and are capable of 15dispensing liquefied natural gas into the fuel supply tanks of 16motor vehicles. For purposes of this Section, a facility is 17considered to have withdrawal facilities that are not "readily 18accessible to and capable of dispensing combustible gases into 19the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles" only if the 20combustible gases or liquefied natural gas are delivered from: 21(i) a dispenser hose that is short enough so that it will not 22reach the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle or (ii) a 23dispenser that is enclosed by a fence or other physical 24barrier so that a vehicle cannot pull alongside the dispenser 25to permit fueling. For the purposes of this Act, liquefied 26petroleum gases shall mean and include any material having a   HB1390- 6 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1vapor pressure not exceeding that allowed for commercial 2propane composed predominantly of the following hydrocarbons, 3either by themselves or as mixtures: Propane, Propylene, 4Butane (normal butane or iso-butane) and Butylene (including 5isomers).6    In case of a sale of special fuel to someone other than a 7licensed distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other 8than in motor vehicles, the distributor shall show in his 9return the amount of invoiced gallons sold and the name and 10address of the purchaser in addition to any other information 11the Department may require.12    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes 13must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 14Law.15    In case of a tax-free sale, as provided in Section 6, of 16motor fuel which the distributor is required by this Section 17to include in his return to the Department, the distributor in 18his return shall show: (1) If the sale is made to another 19licensed distributor the amount sold and the name, address and 20license number of the purchasing distributor; (2) if the sale 21is made to a person where delivery is made outside of this 22State the name and address of such purchaser and the point of 23delivery together with the date and amount delivered; (3) if 24the sale is made to the Federal Government or its 25instrumentalities the amount sold; (4) if the sale is made to a 26municipal corporation owning and operating a local   HB1390- 7 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1transportation system for public service in this State the 2name and address of such purchaser, and the amount sold, as 3evidenced by official forms of exemption certificates properly 4executed and furnished by such purchaser; (5) if the sale is 5made to a privately owned public utility owning and operating 62-axle vehicles designed and used for transporting more than 7 7passengers, which vehicles are used as common carriers in 8general transportation of passengers, are not devoted to any 9specialized purpose and are operated entirely within the 10territorial limits of a single municipality or of any group of 11contiguous municipalities or in a close radius thereof, and 12the operations of which are subject to the regulations of the 13Illinois Commerce Commission, then the name and address of 14such purchaser and the amount sold as evidenced by official 15forms of exemption certificates properly executed and 16furnished by the purchaser; (6) if the product sold is special 17fuel and if the sale is made to a licensed supplier under 18conditions which qualify the sale for tax exemption under 19Section 6 of this Act, the amount sold and the name, address 20and license number of the purchaser; and (6) (7) if a sale of 21special fuel is made to someone other than a licensed 22distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other than in 23motor vehicles, by making a specific notation thereof on the 24invoice or sales slip covering such sales and obtaining such 25supporting documentation as may be required by the Department.26    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes   HB1390- 8 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 2Law.3    A person whose license to act as a distributor of motor 4fuel has been revoked shall make a return to the Department 5covering the period from the date of the last return to the 6date of the revocation of the license, which return shall be 7delivered to the Department not later than 10 days from the 8date of the revocation or termination of the license of such 9distributor; the return shall in all other respects be subject 10to the same provisions and conditions as returns by 11distributors licensed under the provisions of this Act.12    The records, waybills and supporting documents kept by 13railroads and other common carriers in the regular course of 14business shall be prima facie evidence of the contents and 15receipt of cars or tanks covered by those records, waybills or 16supporting documents.17    If the Department has reason to believe and does believe 18that the amount shown on the return as purchased, acquired, 19received, exported, sold, used, lost or destroyed is 20incorrect, or that an amount of motor fuel of the types 21required by the second paragraph of this Section to be 22reported to the Department has not been correctly reported the 23Department shall fix an amount for such receipt, sales, 24export, use, loss or destruction according to its best 25judgment and information, which amount so fixed by the 26Department shall be prima facie correct. All returns shall be   HB1390- 9 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1made on forms prepared and furnished by the Department, and 2shall contain such other information as the Department may 3reasonably require. The return must be accompanied by 4appropriate computer-generated magnetic media supporting 5schedule data in the format required by the Department, 6unless, as provided by rule, the Department grants an 7exception upon petition of a taxpayer. All licensed 8distributors shall report all losses of motor fuel sustained 9on account of fire, theft, spillage, spoilage, leakage, or any 10other provable cause when filing the return for the period 11during which the loss occurred. If the distributor reports 12losses due to fire or theft, then the distributor must include 13fire department or police department reports and any other 14documentation that the Department may require. The mere making 15of the report does not assure the allowance of the loss as a 16reduction in tax liability. Losses of motor fuel as the result 17of evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may 18not exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning 19of the month, plus the receipts of gallonage during the month, 20minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the end of the 21month. Any loss reported that is in excess of 1% shall be 22subject to the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. On and 23after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month period January through 24June, net losses of motor fuel (for each category of motor fuel 25that is required to be reported on a return) as the result of 26evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may not   HB1390- 10 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning of 2each January, plus the receipts of gallonage each January 3through June, minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the 4end of each June. On and after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month 5period July through December, net losses of motor fuel (for 6each category of motor fuel that is required to be reported on 7a return) as the result of evaporation or shrinkage due to 8temperature variations may not exceed 1% of the total gallons 9in storage at the beginning of each July, plus the receipts of 10gallonage each July through December, minus the gallonage 11remaining in storage at the end of each December. Any net loss 12reported that is in excess of this amount shall be subject to 13the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. For purposes of this 14Section, "net loss" means the number of gallons gained through 15temperature variations minus the number of gallons lost 16through temperature variations or evaporation for each of the 17respective 6-month periods.18    If any payment provided for in this Section exceeds the 19distributor's liabilities under this Act, as shown on an 20original return, the Department may authorize the distributor 21to credit such excess payment against liability subsequently 22to be remitted to the Department under this Act, in accordance 23with reasonable rules adopted by the Department. If the 24Department subsequently determines that all or any part of the 25credit taken was not actually due to the distributor, the 26distributor's discount shall be reduced by an amount equal to   HB1390- 11 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1the difference between the discount as applied to the credit 2taken and that actually due, and that distributor shall be 3liable for penalties and interest on such difference. 4(Source: P.A. 100-9, eff. 7-1-17; 100-1171, eff. 1-4-19.) 5    (35 ILCS 505/6)  (from Ch. 120, par. 422)6    Sec. 6. Collection of tax; distributors. A distributor who 7sells or distributes any motor fuel, which he is required by 8Section 5 to report to the Department when filing a return, 9shall (except as hereinafter provided) collect at the time of 10such sale and distribution, the amount of tax imposed under 11this Act on all such motor fuel sold and distributed, and at 12the time of making a return, the distributor shall pay to the 13Department the amount so collected less a discount of 2% 14through June 30, 2003 and 1.75% thereafter which is allowed to 15reimburse the distributor for the expenses incurred in keeping 16records, preparing and filing returns, collecting and 17remitting the tax and supplying data to the Department on 18request, and shall also pay to the Department an amount equal 19to the amount that would be collectible as a tax in the event 20of a sale thereof on all such motor fuel used by said 21distributor during the period covered by the return. However, 22no payment shall be made based upon dyed diesel fuel used by 23the distributor for non-highway purposes. The discount shall 24only be applicable to the amount of tax payment which 25accompanies a return which is filed timely in accordance with   HB1390- 12 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1Section 5 of this Act. In each subsequent sale of motor fuel on 2which the amount of tax imposed under this Act has been 3collected as provided in this Section, the amount so collected 4shall be added to the selling price, so that the amount of tax 5is paid ultimately by the user of the motor fuel. However, no 6collection or payment shall be made in the case of the sale or 7use of any motor fuel to the extent to which such sale or use 8of motor fuel may not, under the constitution and statutes of 9the United States, be made the subject of taxation by this 10State. A person whose license to act as a distributor of fuel 11has been revoked shall, at the time of making a return, also 12pay to the Department an amount equal to the amount that would 13be collectible as a tax in the event of a sale thereof on all 14motor fuel, which he is required by the second paragraph of 15Section 5 to report to the Department in making a return, and 16which he had on hand on the date on which the license was 17revoked, and with respect to which no tax had been previously 18paid under this Act.19    A distributor may make tax free sales of motor fuel, with 20respect to which he is otherwise required to collect the tax, 21only as specified in the following items 1 through 7.22        1. When the sale is made to a person holding a valid 23    unrevoked license as a distributor, by making a specific 24    notation thereof on invoices or sales slip covering each 25    sale.26        2. When the sale is made with delivery to a purchaser   HB1390- 13 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1    outside of this State.2        3. When the sale is made to the Federal Government or 3    its instrumentalities.4        4. When the sale is made to a municipal corporation 5    owning and operating a local transportation system for 6    public service in this State when an official certificate 7    of exemption is obtained in lieu of the tax.8        5. When the sale is made to a privately owned public 9    utility owning and operating 2 axle vehicles designed and 10    used for transporting more than 7 passengers, which 11    vehicles are used as common carriers in general 12    transportation of passengers, are not devoted to any 13    specialized purpose and are operated entirely within the 14    territorial limits of a single municipality or of any 15    group of contiguous municipalities, or in a close radius 16    thereof, and the operations of which are subject to the 17    regulations of the Illinois Commerce Commission, when an 18    official certificate of exemption is obtained in lieu of 19    the tax.20        6. (Blank). When a sale of special fuel is made to a 21    person holding a valid, unrevoked license as a supplier, 22    by making a specific notation thereof on the invoice or 23    sales slip covering each such sale.24        7. When a sale of dyed diesel fuel is made by the 25    licensed distributor to the end user of the fuel who is not 26    a licensed distributor or a licensed supplier for   HB1390- 14 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1    non-highway purposes and the fuel is (i) delivered from a 2    vehicle designed for the specific purpose of such sales 3    and delivered directly into a stationary bulk storage tank 4    that displays the notice required by Section 4f of this 5    Act, (ii) delivered from a vehicle designed for the 6    specific purpose of such sales and delivered directly into 7    the fuel supply tanks of non-highway vehicles that are not 8    required to be registered for highway use, or (iii) 9    dispensed from a dyed diesel fuel dispensing facility that 10    has withdrawal facilities that are not readily accessible 11    to and are not capable of dispensing dyed diesel fuel into 12    the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle. 13        A specific notation is required on the invoice or 14    sales slip covering such sales, and any supporting 15    documentation that may be required by the Department must 16    be obtained by the distributor. The distributor shall 17    obtain and keep the supporting documentation in such form 18    as the Department may require by rule.19        For purposes of this item 7, a dyed diesel fuel 20    dispensing facility is considered to have withdrawal 21    facilities that are "not readily accessible to and not 22    capable of dispensing dyed diesel fuel into the fuel 23    supply tank of a motor vehicle" only if the dyed diesel 24    fuel is delivered from: (i) a dispenser hose that is short 25    enough so that it will not reach the fuel supply tank of a 26    motor vehicle or (ii) a dispenser that is enclosed by a   HB1390- 15 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1    fence or other physical barrier so that a vehicle cannot 2    pull alongside the dispenser to permit fueling. 3        8. (Blank).4    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes 5must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 6Law.7    All suits or other proceedings brought for the purpose of 8recovering any taxes, interest or penalties due the State of 9Illinois under this Act may be maintained in the name of the 10Department.11(Source: P.A. 102-1019, eff. 5-27-22.) 12    (35 ILCS 505/7)  (from Ch. 120, par. 423)13    Sec. 7. Any person who is , not licensed as a receiver or , 14distributor and who purchases or supplier, purchasing fuel or 15motor fuel as to which there has been no charge made to him of 16the tax imposed by Section 2 or 2a, or both, shall make payment 17of the tax imposed by Section 2a of this Act and if the same be 18thereafter used in the operation of a motor vehicle upon the 19public highways, make payment of the motor fuel tax computed 20at the rate prescribed in Section 2 of this Act on the amount 21so used, such payment to be made to the Department not later 22than the 20th day of the month succeeding the month in which 23the motor fuel was so used.24    This Section does not apply in cases of such use of motor 25fuel which was obtained tax-free under an official certificate   HB1390- 16 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1of exemption mentioned in Sections 6 and 6a of this Act.2(Source: P.A. 86-125.) 3    (35 ILCS 505/11.5)  (from Ch. 120, par. 427a)4    Sec. 11.5. In the event that liability upon the bond filed 5by a distributor, supplier, or receiver with the Department 6shall be discharged or reduced, whether by judgment rendered, 7payment made or otherwise, or if in the opinion of the 8Department the bond of any distributor, supplier, or receiver 9theretofore given shall become unsatisfactory, then the 10distributor, supplier, or receiver shall forthwith, upon the 11written demand of the Department, file a new bond in the same 12manner and form and in an amount and with sureties 13satisfactory to the Department, failing which the Department 14shall forthwith revoke the license of the distributor, 15supplier, or receiver.16    If such new bond shall be furnished by the distributor, 17supplier, or receiver as above provided, the Department shall 18cancel the bond for which such new bond shall be substituted.19    Any surety on any bond furnished by any distributor, 20supplier, or receiver shall be released and discharged from 21any and all liability to the State of Illinois accruing on such 22bond after the expiration of 60 days from the date upon which 23such surety shall have filed with the Department written 24request so to be released and discharged. But such request 25shall not operate to relieve, release or discharge such surety   HB1390- 17 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1from any liability already accrued, or which shall accrue, 2before the expiration of said 60-day period. The Department 3shall, promptly on receipt of such request, notify the 4distributor, supplier, or receiver and, unless such 5distributor, supplier, or receiver shall on or before the 6expiration of such 60-day period file with the Department a 7new bond with a surety or sureties satisfactory to the 8Department in the amount and form hereinbefore provided, the 9Department shall forthwith cancel the license of such 10distributor, supplier, or receiver. If such new bond shall be 11furnished by said distributor, supplier, or receiver as above 12provided, the Department shall cancel the bond for which such 13new bond shall be substituted.14(Source: P.A. 91-173, eff. 1-1-00.) 15    (35 ILCS 505/12)  (from Ch. 120, par. 428)16    Sec. 12. It is the duty of every distributor and , 17receiver, and supplier under this Act to keep within this 18State or at some office outside this State for any period for 19which the Department is authorized to issue a Notice of Tax 20Liability to the distributor or , receiver, or supplier 21records and books showing all purchases, receipts, losses 22through any cause, sales, distribution and use of motor fuel, 23aviation fuels, home heating oils, and kerosene, and products 24used for the purpose of blending to produce motor fuel, which 25records and books shall, at all times during business hours of   HB1390- 18 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1the day, be subject to inspection by the Department, or its 2duly authorized agents and employees.

Any person other than a 8distributor or supplier, who loses motor fuel through any 9cause or uses motor fuel (upon which he has paid the amount 10required to be collected under Section 2 of this Act) for any 11purpose other than operating a motor vehicle upon the public 12highways or waters, shall be reimbursed and repaid the amount 13so paid.14    Any person who purchases motor fuel in Illinois and uses 15that motor fuel in another state and that other state imposes a 16tax on the use of such motor fuel shall be reimbursed and 17repaid the amount of Illinois tax paid under Section 2 of this 18Act on the motor fuel used in such other state. Reimbursement 19and repayment shall be made by the Department upon receipt of 20adequate proof of taxes directly paid to another state and the 21amount of motor fuel used in that state.22    Claims based in whole or in part on taxes paid to another 23state shall include (i) a certified copy of the tax return 24filed with such other state by the claimant; (ii) a copy of 25either the cancelled check paying the tax due on such return,   HB1390- 22 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1or a receipt acknowledging payment of the tax due on such tax 2return; and (iii) such other information as the Department may 3reasonably require. This paragraph shall not apply to taxes 4paid on returns filed under Section 13a.3 of this Act.5    Any person who purchases motor fuel use tax decals as 6required by Section 13a.4 and pays an amount of fees for such 7decals that exceeds the amount due shall be reimbursed and 8repaid the amount of the decal fees that are deemed by the 9department to be in excess of the amount due. Alternatively, 10any person who purchases motor fuel use tax decals as required 11by Section 13a.4 may credit any excess decal payment verified 12by the Department against amounts subsequently due for the 13purchase of additional decals, until such time as no excess 14payment remains. 15    Claims for such reimbursement must be made to the 16Department of Revenue, duly verified by the claimant (or by 17the claimant's legal representative if the claimant has died 18or become a person under legal disability), upon forms 19prescribed by the Department. The claim must state such facts 20relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture or 21production of the motor fuel by the claimant as the Department 22may deem necessary, and the time when, and the circumstances 23of its loss or the specific purpose for which it was used (as 24the case may be), together with such other information as the 25Department may reasonably require. No claim based upon idle 26time shall be allowed. Claims for reimbursement for   HB1390- 23 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1overpayment of decal fees shall be made to the Department of 2Revenue, duly verified by the claimant (or by the claimant's 3legal representative if the claimant has died or become a 4person under legal disability), upon forms prescribed by the 5Department. The claim shall state facts relating to the 6overpayment of decal fees, together with such other 7information as the Department may reasonably require. Claims 8for reimbursement of overpayment of decal fees paid on or 9after January 1, 2011 must be filed not later than one year 10after the date on which the fees were paid by the claimant. If 11it is determined that the Department should reimburse a 12claimant for overpayment of decal fees, the Department shall 13first apply the amount of such refund against any tax or 14penalty or interest due by the claimant under Section 13a of 15this Act. 16    Claims for full reimbursement for taxes paid on or before 17December 31, 1999 must be filed not later than one year after 18the date on which the tax was paid by the claimant. If, 19however, a claim for such reimbursement otherwise meeting the 20requirements of this Section is filed more than one year but 21less than 2 years after that date, the claimant shall be 22reimbursed at the rate of 80% of the amount to which he would 23have been entitled if his claim had been timely filed.24    Claims for full reimbursement for taxes paid on or after 25January 1, 2000 must be filed not later than 2 years after the 26date on which the tax was paid by the claimant.  HB1390- 24 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1    The Department may make such investigation of the 2correctness of the facts stated in such claims as it deems 3necessary. When the Department has approved any such claim, it 4shall pay to the claimant (or to the claimant's legal 5representative, as such if the claimant has died or become a 6person under legal disability) the reimbursement provided in 7this Section, out of any moneys appropriated to it for that 8purpose.9    Any distributor or supplier who has paid the tax imposed 10by Section 2 of this Act upon motor fuel lost or used by such 11distributor or supplier for any purpose other than operating a 12motor vehicle upon the public highways or waters may file a 13claim for credit or refund to recover the amount so paid. Such 14claims shall be filed on forms prescribed by the Department. 15Such claims shall be made to the Department, duly verified by 16the claimant (or by the claimant's legal representative if the 17claimant has died or become a person under legal disability), 18upon forms prescribed by the Department. The claim shall state 19such facts relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture 20or production of the motor fuel by the claimant as the 21Department may deem necessary and the time when the loss or 22nontaxable use occurred, and the circumstances of its loss or 23the specific purpose for which it was used (as the case may 24be), together with such other information as the Department 25may reasonably require. Claims must be filed not later than 26one year after the date on which the tax was paid by the   HB1390- 25 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1claimant.2    The Department may make such investigation of the 3correctness of the facts stated in such claims as it deems 4necessary. When the Department approves a claim, the 5Department shall issue a refund or credit memorandum as 6requested by the taxpayer, to the distributor or supplier who 7made the payment for which the refund or credit is being given 8or, if the distributor or supplier has died or become 9incompetent, to such distributor's or supplier's legal 10representative, as such. The amount of such credit memorandum 11shall be credited against any tax due or to become due under 12this Act from the distributor or supplier who made the payment 13for which credit has been given.14    Any credit or refund that is allowed under this Section 15shall bear interest at the rate and in the manner specified in 16the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act.17    In case the distributor or supplier requests and the 18Department determines that the claimant is entitled to a 19refund, such refund shall be made only from such appropriation 20as may be available for that purpose. If it appears unlikely 21that the amount appropriated would permit everyone having a 22claim allowed during the period covered by such appropriation 23to elect to receive a cash refund, the Department, by rule or 24regulation, shall provide for the payment of refunds in 25hardship cases and shall define what types of cases qualify as 26hardship cases.  HB1390- 26 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1    In any case in which there has been an erroneous refund of 2tax or fees payable under this Section, a notice of tax 3liability may be issued at any time within 3 years from the 4making of that refund, or within 5 years from the making of 5that refund if it appears that any part of the refund was 6induced by fraud or the misrepresentation of material fact. 7The amount of any proposed assessment set forth by the 8Department shall be limited to the amount of the erroneous 9refund.10    If no tax is due and no proceeding is pending to determine 11whether such distributor or supplier is indebted to the 12Department for tax, the credit memorandum so issued may be 13assigned and set over by the lawful holder thereof, subject to 14reasonable rules of the Department, to any other licensed 15distributor or supplier who is subject to this Act, and the 16amount thereof applied by the Department against any tax due 17or to become due under this Act from such assignee.18    If the payment for which the distributor's or supplier's 19claim is filed is held in the protest fund of the State 20Treasury during the pendency of the claim for credit 21proceedings pursuant to the order of the court in accordance 22with Section 2a of the State Officers and Employees Money 23Disposition Act and if it is determined by the Department or by 24the final order of a reviewing court under the Administrative 25Review Law that the claimant is entitled to all or a part of 26the credit claimed, the claimant, instead of receiving a   HB1390- 27 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1credit memorandum from the Department, shall receive a cash 2refund from the protest fund as provided for in Section 2a of 3the State Officers and Employees Money Disposition Act.4    If any person ceases to be licensed as a distributor or 5supplier while still holding an unused credit memorandum 6issued under this Act, such person may, at his election 7(instead of assigning the credit memorandum to a licensed 8distributor or licensed supplier under this Act), surrender 9such unused credit memorandum to the Department and receive a 10refund of the amount to which such person is entitled.11    For claims based upon taxes paid on or before December 31, 122000, a claim based upon the use of undyed diesel fuel shall 13not be allowed except (i) if allowed under the following 14paragraph or (ii) for undyed diesel fuel used by a commercial 15vehicle, as that term is defined in Section 1-111.8 of the 16Illinois Vehicle Code, for any purpose other than operating 17the commercial vehicle upon the public highways and unlicensed 18commercial vehicles operating on private property.

The Motor Fuel Tax Law is amended by changing 5Sections 1.2, 1.20, 3d, 5, 6, 7, 11.5, 12, 12a, 13, 14a, 15, 6and 16 as follows: 7    (35 ILCS 505/1.2)  (from Ch. 120, par. 417.2)8    Sec. 1.2. Distributor. "Distributor" means a person who 9does any of the following: (1) either (i) produces motor fuel 10in this State; (2) , refines motor fuel in this State; (3) , 11blends motor fuel in this State; (4) , compounds motor fuel in 12this State; (5) or manufactures motor fuel in this State; (6) , 13or (ii) transports motor fuel into this State; (7) , or (iii) 14exports motor fuel out of this State; or (8) , or (iv) engages 15in the distribution of motor fuel primarily by tank car or tank 16truck, or both, and who operates an Illinois bulk plant where 17he or she has active bulk storage capacity of not less than 1830,000 gallons for gasoline as defined in item (A) of Section 5 19of this Law.20    "Distributor" does not, however, include a person who 21receives or transports into this State and sells or uses motor 22fuel under such circumstances as preclude the collection of 23the tax herein imposed, by reason of the provisions of the   HB1390- 2 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1constitution and statutes of the United States. However, a 2person operating a motor vehicle into the State, may transport 3motor fuel in the ordinary fuel tank attached to the motor 4vehicle for the operation of the motor vehicle, without being 5considered a distributor. Any railroad registered under 6Section 18c-7201 of the Illinois Vehicle Code may deliver 7special fuel directly into the fuel supply tank of a 8locomotive owned, operated, or controlled by any other 9railroad registered under Section 18c-7201 of the Illinois 10Vehicle Code without being considered a distributor or 11supplier.12(Source: P.A. 96-1384, eff. 7-29-10.) 13    (35 ILCS 505/1.20)  (from Ch. 120, par. 417.20)14    Sec. 1.20.

Distributor's monthly return. Except as 16hereinafter provided, a person holding a valid unrevoked 17license to act as a distributor of motor fuel shall, between 18the 1st and 20th days of each calendar month, make return to 19the Department, showing an itemized statement of the number of 20invoiced gallons of motor fuel of the types specified in this 21Section which were purchased, acquired, received, or exported 22during the preceding calendar month; the amount of such motor 23fuel produced, refined, compounded, manufactured, blended, 24sold, distributed, exported, and used by the licensed 25distributor during the preceding calendar month; the amount of   HB1390- 4 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1such motor fuel lost or destroyed during the preceding 2calendar month; the amount of such motor fuel on hand at the 3close of business for such month; and such other reasonable 4information as the Department may require. If a distributor's 5only activities with respect to motor fuel are either: (1) 6production of alcohol in quantities of less than 10,000 proof 7gallons per year or (2) blending alcohol in quantities of less 8than 10,000 proof gallons per year which such distributor has 9produced, he shall file returns on an annual basis with the 10return for a given year being due by January 20 of the 11following year. Distributors whose total production of alcohol 12(whether blended or not) exceeds 10,000 proof gallons per 13year, based on production during the preceding (calendar) year 14or as reasonably projected by the Department if one calendar 15year's record of production cannot be established, shall file 16returns between the 1st and 20th days of each calendar month as 17hereinabove provided.18    The types of motor fuel referred to in the preceding 19paragraph are: (A) All products commonly or commercially known 20or sold as gasoline (including casing-head and absorption or 21natural gasoline), gasohol, motor benzol or motor benzene 22regardless of their classification or uses; and (B) all 23combustible gases, not including liquefied natural gas, which 24exist in a gaseous state at 60 degrees Fahrenheit and at 14.7 25pounds per square inch absolute including, but not limited to, 26liquefied petroleum gases used for highway purposes; and (C)   HB1390- 5 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1special fuel. Only those quantities of combustible gases 2(example (B) above) which are used or sold by the distributor 3to be used to propel motor vehicles on the public highways, or 4which are delivered into a storage tank that is located at a 5facility that has withdrawal facilities which are readily 6accessible to and are capable of dispensing combustible gases 7into the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles, shall be subject 8to return. Distributors of liquefied natural gas are not 9required to make returns under this Section with respect to 10that liquefied natural gas unless (i) the liquefied natural 11gas is dispensed into the fuel supply tank of any motor vehicle 12or (ii) the liquefied natural gas is delivered into a storage 13tank that is located at a facility that has withdrawal 14facilities which are readily accessible to and are capable of 15dispensing liquefied natural gas into the fuel supply tanks of 16motor vehicles. For purposes of this Section, a facility is 17considered to have withdrawal facilities that are not "readily 18accessible to and capable of dispensing combustible gases into 19the fuel supply tanks of motor vehicles" only if the 20combustible gases or liquefied natural gas are delivered from: 21(i) a dispenser hose that is short enough so that it will not 22reach the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle or (ii) a 23dispenser that is enclosed by a fence or other physical 24barrier so that a vehicle cannot pull alongside the dispenser 25to permit fueling. For the purposes of this Act, liquefied 26petroleum gases shall mean and include any material having a   HB1390- 6 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1vapor pressure not exceeding that allowed for commercial 2propane composed predominantly of the following hydrocarbons, 3either by themselves or as mixtures: Propane, Propylene, 4Butane (normal butane or iso-butane) and Butylene (including 5isomers).6    In case of a sale of special fuel to someone other than a 7licensed distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other 8than in motor vehicles, the distributor shall show in his 9return the amount of invoiced gallons sold and the name and 10address of the purchaser in addition to any other information 11the Department may require.12    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes 13must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 14Law.15    In case of a tax-free sale, as provided in Section 6, of 16motor fuel which the distributor is required by this Section 17to include in his return to the Department, the distributor in 18his return shall show: (1) If the sale is made to another 19licensed distributor the amount sold and the name, address and 20license number of the purchasing distributor; (2) if the sale 21is made to a person where delivery is made outside of this 22State the name and address of such purchaser and the point of 23delivery together with the date and amount delivered; (3) if 24the sale is made to the Federal Government or its 25instrumentalities the amount sold; (4) if the sale is made to a 26municipal corporation owning and operating a local   HB1390- 7 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1transportation system for public service in this State the 2name and address of such purchaser, and the amount sold, as 3evidenced by official forms of exemption certificates properly 4executed and furnished by such purchaser; (5) if the sale is 5made to a privately owned public utility owning and operating 62-axle vehicles designed and used for transporting more than 7 7passengers, which vehicles are used as common carriers in 8general transportation of passengers, are not devoted to any 9specialized purpose and are operated entirely within the 10territorial limits of a single municipality or of any group of 11contiguous municipalities or in a close radius thereof, and 12the operations of which are subject to the regulations of the 13Illinois Commerce Commission, then the name and address of 14such purchaser and the amount sold as evidenced by official 15forms of exemption certificates properly executed and 16furnished by the purchaser; (6) if the product sold is special 17fuel and if the sale is made to a licensed supplier under 18conditions which qualify the sale for tax exemption under 19Section 6 of this Act, the amount sold and the name, address 20and license number of the purchaser; and (6) (7) if a sale of 21special fuel is made to someone other than a licensed 22distributor, or a licensed supplier, for a use other than in 23motor vehicles, by making a specific notation thereof on the 24invoice or sales slip covering such sales and obtaining such 25supporting documentation as may be required by the Department.26    All special fuel sold or used for non-highway purposes   HB1390- 8 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1must have a dye added in accordance with Section 4d of this 2Law.3    A person whose license to act as a distributor of motor 4fuel has been revoked shall make a return to the Department 5covering the period from the date of the last return to the 6date of the revocation of the license, which return shall be 7delivered to the Department not later than 10 days from the 8date of the revocation or termination of the license of such 9distributor; the return shall in all other respects be subject 10to the same provisions and conditions as returns by 11distributors licensed under the provisions of this Act.12    The records, waybills and supporting documents kept by 13railroads and other common carriers in the regular course of 14business shall be prima facie evidence of the contents and 15receipt of cars or tanks covered by those records, waybills or 16supporting documents.17    If the Department has reason to believe and does believe 18that the amount shown on the return as purchased, acquired, 19received, exported, sold, used, lost or destroyed is 20incorrect, or that an amount of motor fuel of the types 21required by the second paragraph of this Section to be 22reported to the Department has not been correctly reported the 23Department shall fix an amount for such receipt, sales, 24export, use, loss or destruction according to its best 25judgment and information, which amount so fixed by the 26Department shall be prima facie correct. All returns shall be   HB1390- 9 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1made on forms prepared and furnished by the Department, and 2shall contain such other information as the Department may 3reasonably require. The return must be accompanied by 4appropriate computer-generated magnetic media supporting 5schedule data in the format required by the Department, 6unless, as provided by rule, the Department grants an 7exception upon petition of a taxpayer. All licensed 8distributors shall report all losses of motor fuel sustained 9on account of fire, theft, spillage, spoilage, leakage, or any 10other provable cause when filing the return for the period 11during which the loss occurred. If the distributor reports 12losses due to fire or theft, then the distributor must include 13fire department or police department reports and any other 14documentation that the Department may require. The mere making 15of the report does not assure the allowance of the loss as a 16reduction in tax liability. Losses of motor fuel as the result 17of evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may 18not exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning 19of the month, plus the receipts of gallonage during the month, 20minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the end of the 21month. Any loss reported that is in excess of 1% shall be 22subject to the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. On and 23after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month period January through 24June, net losses of motor fuel (for each category of motor fuel 25that is required to be reported on a return) as the result of 26evaporation or shrinkage due to temperature variations may not   HB1390- 10 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1exceed 1% of the total gallons in storage at the beginning of 2each January, plus the receipts of gallonage each January 3through June, minus the gallonage remaining in storage at the 4end of each June. On and after July 1, 2001, for each 6-month 5period July through December, net losses of motor fuel (for 6each category of motor fuel that is required to be reported on 7a return) as the result of evaporation or shrinkage due to 8temperature variations may not exceed 1% of the total gallons 9in storage at the beginning of each July, plus the receipts of 10gallonage each July through December, minus the gallonage 11remaining in storage at the end of each December. Any net loss 12reported that is in excess of this amount shall be subject to 13the tax imposed by Section 2 of this Law. For purposes of this 14Section, "net loss" means the number of gallons gained through 15temperature variations minus the number of gallons lost 16through temperature variations or evaporation for each of the 17respective 6-month periods.18    If any payment provided for in this Section exceeds the 19distributor's liabilities under this Act, as shown on an 20original return, the Department may authorize the distributor 21to credit such excess payment against liability subsequently 22to be remitted to the Department under this Act, in accordance 23with reasonable rules adopted by the Department. If the 24Department subsequently determines that all or any part of the 25credit taken was not actually due to the distributor, the 26distributor's discount shall be reduced by an amount equal to   HB1390- 11 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1the difference between the discount as applied to the credit 2taken and that actually due, and that distributor shall be 3liable for penalties and interest on such difference. 4(Source: P.A. 100-9, eff. 7-1-17; 100-1171, eff. 1-4-19.) 5    (35 ILCS 505/6)  (from Ch. 120, par. 422)6    Sec. 6. Collection of tax; distributors. A distributor who 7sells or distributes any motor fuel, which he is required by 8Section 5 to report to the Department when filing a return, 9shall (except as hereinafter provided) collect at the time of 10such sale and distribution, the amount of tax imposed under 11this Act on all such motor fuel sold and distributed, and at 12the time of making a return, the distributor shall pay to the 13Department the amount so collected less a discount of 2% 14through June 30, 2003 and 1.75% thereafter which is allowed to 15reimburse the distributor for the expenses incurred in keeping 16records, preparing and filing returns, collecting and 17remitting the tax and supplying data to the Department on 18request, and shall also pay to the Department an amount equal 19to the amount that would be collectible as a tax in the event 20of a sale thereof on all such motor fuel used by said 21distributor during the period covered by the return. However, 22no payment shall be made based upon dyed diesel fuel used by 23the distributor for non-highway purposes. The discount shall 24only be applicable to the amount of tax payment which 25accompanies a return which is filed timely in accordance with   HB1390- 12 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1Section 5 of this Act. In each subsequent sale of motor fuel on 2which the amount of tax imposed under this Act has been 3collected as provided in this Section, the amount so collected 4shall be added to the selling price, so that the amount of tax 5is paid ultimately by the user of the motor fuel. However, no 6collection or payment shall be made in the case of the sale or 7use of any motor fuel to the extent to which such sale or use 8of motor fuel may not, under the constitution and statutes of 9the United States, be made the subject of taxation by this 10State. A person whose license to act as a distributor of fuel 11has been revoked shall, at the time of making a return, also 12pay to the Department an amount equal to the amount that would 13be collectible as a tax in the event of a sale thereof on all 14motor fuel, which he is required by the second paragraph of 15Section 5 to report to the Department in making a return, and 16which he had on hand on the date on which the license was 17revoked, and with respect to which no tax had been previously 18paid under this Act.19    A distributor may make tax free sales of motor fuel, with 20respect to which he is otherwise required to collect the tax, 21only as specified in the following items 1 through 7.22        1. When the sale is made to a person holding a valid 23    unrevoked license as a distributor, by making a specific 24    notation thereof on invoices or sales slip covering each 25    sale.26        2. When the sale is made with delivery to a purchaser   HB1390- 13 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1    outside of this State.2        3. When the sale is made to the Federal Government or 3    its instrumentalities.4        4. When the sale is made to a municipal corporation 5    owning and operating a local transportation system for 6    public service in this State when an official certificate 7    of exemption is obtained in lieu of the tax.8        5. When the sale is made to a privately owned public 9    utility owning and operating 2 axle vehicles designed and 10    used for transporting more than 7 passengers, which 11    vehicles are used as common carriers in general 12    transportation of passengers, are not devoted to any 13    specialized purpose and are operated entirely within the 14    territorial limits of a single municipality or of any 15    group of contiguous municipalities, or in a close radius 16    thereof, and the operations of which are subject to the 17    regulations of the Illinois Commerce Commission, when an 18    official certificate of exemption is obtained in lieu of 19    the tax.20        6. (Blank). When a sale of special fuel is made to a 21    person holding a valid, unrevoked license as a supplier, 22    by making a specific notation thereof on the invoice or 23    sales slip covering each such sale.24        7. When a sale of dyed diesel fuel is made by the 25    licensed distributor to the end user of the fuel who is not 26    a licensed distributor or a licensed supplier for   HB1390- 14 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1    non-highway purposes and the fuel is (i) delivered from a 2    vehicle designed for the specific purpose of such sales 3    and delivered directly into a stationary bulk storage tank 4    that displays the notice required by Section 4f of this 5    Act, (ii) delivered from a vehicle designed for the 6    specific purpose of such sales and delivered directly into 7    the fuel supply tanks of non-highway vehicles that are not 8    required to be registered for highway use, or (iii) 9    dispensed from a dyed diesel fuel dispensing facility that 10    has withdrawal facilities that are not readily accessible 11    to and are not capable of dispensing dyed diesel fuel into 12    the fuel supply tank of a motor vehicle. 13        A specific notation is required on the invoice or 14    sales slip covering such sales, and any supporting 15    documentation that may be required by the Department must 16    be obtained by the distributor. The distributor shall 17    obtain and keep the supporting documentation in such form 18    as the Department may require by rule.19        For purposes of this item 7, a dyed diesel fuel 20    dispensing facility is considered to have withdrawal 21    facilities that are "not readily accessible to and not 22    capable of dispensing dyed diesel fuel into the fuel 23    supply tank of a motor vehicle" only if the dyed diesel 24    fuel is delivered from: (i) a dispenser hose that is short 25    enough so that it will not reach the fuel supply tank of a 26    motor vehicle or (ii) a dispenser that is enclosed by a   HB1390- 15 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1    fence or other physical barrier so that a vehicle cannot 2    pull alongside the dispenser to permit fueling. 3        8.

Alternatively, 10any person who purchases motor fuel use tax decals as required 11by Section 13a.4 may credit any excess decal payment verified 12by the Department against amounts subsequently due for the 13purchase of additional decals, until such time as no excess 14payment remains. 15    Claims for such reimbursement must be made to the 16Department of Revenue, duly verified by the claimant (or by 17the claimant's legal representative if the claimant has died 18or become a person under legal disability), upon forms 19prescribed by the Department. The claim must state such facts 20relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture or 21production of the motor fuel by the claimant as the Department 22may deem necessary, and the time when, and the circumstances 23of its loss or the specific purpose for which it was used (as 24the case may be), together with such other information as the 25Department may reasonably require. No claim based upon idle 26time shall be allowed. Claims for reimbursement for   HB1390- 23 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1overpayment of decal fees shall be made to the Department of 2Revenue, duly verified by the claimant (or by the claimant's 3legal representative if the claimant has died or become a 4person under legal disability), upon forms prescribed by the 5Department.

Claims 8for reimbursement of overpayment of decal fees paid on or 9after January 1, 2011 must be filed not later than one year 10after the date on which the fees were paid by the claimant.

If, 19however, a claim for such reimbursement otherwise meeting the 20requirements of this Section is filed more than one year but 21less than 2 years after that date, the claimant shall be 22reimbursed at the rate of 80% of the amount to which he would 23have been entitled if his claim had been timely filed.24    Claims for full reimbursement for taxes paid on or after 25January 1, 2000 must be filed not later than 2 years after the 26date on which the tax was paid by the claimant.  HB1390- 24 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1    The Department may make such investigation of the 2correctness of the facts stated in such claims as it deems 3necessary.

Such 14claims shall be filed on forms prescribed by the Department. 15Such claims shall be made to the Department, duly verified by 16the claimant (or by the claimant's legal representative if the 17claimant has died or become a person under legal disability), 18upon forms prescribed by the Department. The claim shall state 19such facts relating to the purchase, importation, manufacture 20or production of the motor fuel by the claimant as the 21Department may deem necessary and the time when the loss or 22nontaxable use occurred, and the circumstances of its loss or 23the specific purpose for which it was used (as the case may 24be), together with such other information as the Department 25may reasonably require.

If it appears unlikely 21that the amount appropriated would permit everyone having a 22claim allowed during the period covered by such appropriation 23to elect to receive a cash refund, the Department, by rule or 24regulation, shall provide for the payment of refunds in 25hardship cases and shall define what types of cases qualify as 26hardship cases.  HB1390- 26 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1    In any case in which there has been an erroneous refund of 2tax or fees payable under this Section, a notice of tax 3liability may be issued at any time within 3 years from the 4making of that refund, or within 5 years from the making of 5that refund if it appears that any part of the refund was 6induced by fraud or the misrepresentation of material fact. 7The amount of any proposed assessment set forth by the 8Department shall be limited to the amount of the erroneous 9refund.10    If no tax is due and no proceeding is pending to determine 11whether such distributor or supplier is indebted to the 12Department for tax, the credit memorandum so issued may be 13assigned and set over by the lawful holder thereof, subject to 14reasonable rules of the Department, to any other licensed 15distributor or supplier who is subject to this Act, and the 16amount thereof applied by the Department against any tax due 17or to become due under this Act from such assignee.18    If the payment for which the distributor's or supplier's 19claim is filed is held in the protest fund of the State 20Treasury during the pendency of the claim for credit 21proceedings pursuant to the order of the court in accordance 22with Section 2a of the State Officers and Employees Money 23Disposition Act and if it is determined by the Department or by 24the final order of a reviewing court under the Administrative 25Review Law that the claimant is entitled to all or a part of 26the credit claimed, the claimant, instead of receiving a   HB1390- 27 -LRB104 07494 HLH 17537 b1credit memorandum from the Department, shall receive a cash 2refund from the protest fund as provided for in Section 2a of 3the State Officers and Employees Money Disposition Act.4    If any person ceases to be licensed as a distributor or 5supplier while still holding an unused credit memorandum 6issued under this Act, such person may, at his election 7(instead of assigning the credit memorandum to a licensed 8distributor or licensed supplier under this Act), surrender 9such unused credit memorandum to the Department and receive a 10refund of the amount to which such person is entitled.11    For claims based upon taxes paid on or before December 31, 122000, a claim based upon the use of undyed diesel fuel shall 13not be allowed except (i) if allowed under the following 14paragraph or (ii) for undyed diesel fuel used by a commercial 15vehicle, as that term is defined in Section 1-111.8 of the 16Illinois Vehicle Code, for any purpose other than operating 17the commercial vehicle upon the public highways and unlicensed 18commercial vehicles operating on private property.
