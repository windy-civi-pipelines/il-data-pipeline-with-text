Full Text of SB2375 ILGA.GOV SB2375 - 104th General Assembly 104TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY State of Illinois 2025 and 2026SB2375 Introduced 2/7/2025, by Sen. Sara Feigenholtz SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 765 ILCS 1085/15    Amends the Electric Vehicle Charging Act. Changes the definition of "electric vehicle" by removing language stating that the vehicle is "exclusively" powered by and refuled by electricity, and by removing language stating that it does not include a hybrid electric vehicle. Changes the definition of "electric vehicle charging station" by including a device that is used to provide electricity to a plug-in hybrid.LRB104 11350 JRC 21438 b  A BILL FOR SB2375LRB104 11350 JRC 21438 b1    AN ACT concerning civil law. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Electric Vehicle Charging Act is amended by 5changing Section 15 as follows: 6    (765 ILCS 1085/15)7    Sec. 15. Definitions. As used in this Act: 8    "Affordable housing development" means (i) any housing 9that is subsidized by the federal or State government or (ii) 10any housing in which at least 20% of the dwelling units are 11subject to covenants or restrictions that require that the 12dwelling units to be sold or rented at prices that preserve 13them as affordable housing for a period of at least 10 years. 14    "Association" has the meaning set forth in subsection (o) 15of Section 2 of the Condominium Property Act or Section 1-5 of 16the Common Interest Community Association Act, as applicable. 17    "Electric vehicle" means a vehicle that is exclusively 18powered by and refueled by electricity, plugs in to charge, 19and is licensed to drive on public roadways. "Electric 20vehicle" does not include electric mopeds, electric 21off-highway vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, or 22extended-range electric vehicles that are equipped, fully or 23partially, with conventional fueled propulsion or auxiliary   SB2375- 2 -LRB104 11350 JRC 21438 b1engines. 2    "Electric vehicle charging system" means a device that is: 3        (1) used to provide electricity to an electric vehicle 4    or a plug-in hybrid; 5        (2) designed to ensure that a safe connection has been 6    made between the electric grid and the electric vehicle; 7    and 8        (3) able to communicate with the vehicle's control 9    system so that electricity flows at an appropriate voltage 10    and current level. An electric vehicle charging system may 11    be wall mounted or pedestal style, may provide multiple 12    cords to connect with electric vehicles, and shall: 13            (i) be certified by Underwriters Laboratories or 14        have been granted an equivalent certification; and 15            (ii) comply with the current version of Article 16        625 of the National Electrical Code. 17    "Electric vehicle supply equipment" or "EVSE" means a 18conductor, including an ungrounded, grounded, and equipment 19grounding conductor, and electric vehicle connectors, 20attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power 21outlets, and apparatuses installed specifically for the 22purpose of transferring energy between the premises wiring and 23the electric vehicle.24    "EV-capable" means parking spaces that have the electrical 25panel capacity and conduit installed during construction to 26support future implementation of electric vehicle charging   SB2375- 3 -LRB104 11350 JRC 21438 b1with 208-volt or 240-volt or greater, 40-ampere or greater 2circuits. Each EV-capable space shall feature a continuous 3raceway or cable assembly installed between an enclosure or 4outlet located within 3 feet of the EV-capable space and a 5suitable panelboard or other onsite electrical distribution 6equipment. The electrical distribution equipment to which the 7raceway or cable assembly connects shall have sufficient 8dedicated space and spare electrical capacity for a 2-pole 9circuit breaker or set of fuses. Reserved capacity shall be no 10less than 40A 208/240V for each EV-capable space unless 11EV-capable spaces will be controlled by an energy management 12system providing load management in accordance with NFPA 70, 13shall have a minimum capacity of 4.1 kilovolt-ampere per 14space, or have a minimum capacity of 2.7 kilovolt-ampere per 15space when all of the parking spaces are designed to be 16EV-capable spaces, EV-ready spaces, or EVSE-installed spaces. 17The electrical enclosure or outlet and the electrical 18distribution equipment directory shall be marked "For future 19electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE)." This strategy 20ensures the reduction of up-front costs for electric vehicle 21charging station installation by providing the electrical 22elements that are difficult to install during a retrofit. 23Anticipating the use of dual-head EVSE, the same circuit may 24be used to support charging in adjacent EV-capable spaces. For 25purposes of this Act, "EV-capable" shall not be construed to 26require a developer or builder to install or run wire or cable   SB2375- 4 -LRB104 11350 JRC 21438 b1from the electrical panel through the conduit or raceway to 2the terminus of the conduit.3    "EV-ready" means parking spaces that are provided with a 4branch circuit and either an outlet, junction box, or 5receptacle that will support an installed EVSE. Each branch 6circuit serving EV-ready spaces shall terminate at an outlet 7or enclosure, located within 3 feet of each EV-ready space it 8serves. The panelboard or other electrical distribution 9equipment directory shall designate the branch circuit as "For 10electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE)" and the outlet or 11enclosure shall be marked "For electric vehicle supply 12equipment (EVSE)." The capacity of each branch circuit serving 13multiple EV-ready spaces designed to be controlled by an 14energy management system providing load management in 15accordance with NFPA 70, shall have a minimum capacity of 4.1 16kilovolt-ampere per space, or have a minimum capacity of 2.7 17kilovolt-ampere per space when all of the parking spaces are 18designed to be EV-capable spaces, EV-ready spaces, or EVSE 19spaces.20    "EVSE-installed" means electric vehicle supply equipment 21that is fully installed from the electrical panel to the 22parking space. 23    "Large multifamily residence" means a single residential 24building that accommodates 5 families or more. 25    "Level 1" means a 120-volt 20-ampere minimum branch 26circuit.  SB2375- 5 -LRB104 11350 JRC 21438 b1    "Level 2" means a 208-volt to 240-volt 40-ampere branch 2circuit.3    "New" means newly constructed. 4    "Reasonable restriction" means a restriction that does not 5significantly increase the cost of the electric vehicle 6charging station or electric vehicle charging system or 7significantly decrease its efficiency or specified 8performance. 9    "Single-family residence" means a detached single-family 10residence on a single lot. 11    "Small multifamily residence" means a single residential 12building that accommodates 2 to 4 families. 13(Source: P.A. 103-53, eff. 1-1-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24.)
