The 14State Board of Education shall require local school districts 15to administer non-discriminatory procedures or tests to 16English learners coming from homes in which a language other 17than English is used to determine their eligibility to receive 18special education. The placement of low English proficiency 19students in special education programs and facilities shall be 20made in accordance with the test results reflecting the 21student's linguistic, cultural and special education needs. 22For purposes of determining the eligibility of children the 23State Board of Education shall include in the rules   SB1231 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 05906 LNS 15938 b1definitions of "case study", "staff conference", 2"individualized educational program", and "qualified 3specialist" appropriate to each category of children with 4disabilities as defined in this Article. For purposes of 5determining the eligibility of children from homes in which a 6language other than English is used, the State Board of 7Education shall include in the rules definitions for 8"qualified bilingual specialists" and "linguistically and 9culturally appropriate individualized educational programs". 10For purposes of this Section, as well as Sections 14-8.02a, 1114-8.02b, and 14-8.02c of this Code, "parent" means a parent 12as defined in the federal Individuals with Disabilities 13Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401(23)). 14    (b) No child shall be eligible for special education 15facilities except with a carefully completed case study fully 16reviewed by professional personnel in a multidisciplinary 17staff conference and only upon the recommendation of qualified 18specialists or a qualified bilingual specialist, if available. 19At the conclusion of the multidisciplinary staff conference, 20the parent of the child and, if the child is in the legal 21custody of the Department of Children and Family Services, the 22Department's Office of Education and Transition Services shall 23be given a copy of the multidisciplinary conference summary 24report and recommendations, which includes options considered, 25and, in the case of the parent, be informed of his or her right 26to obtain an independent educational evaluation if he or she   SB1231 Engrossed- 3 -LRB104 05906 LNS 15938 b1disagrees with the evaluation findings conducted or obtained 2by the school district.

An independent educational evaluation at public 26expense must be completed within 60 school 30 days of a   SB1231 Engrossed- 4 -LRB104 05906 LNS 15938 b1parent's written request unless the school district initiates 2an impartial due process hearing or the parent or school 3district offers reasonable grounds to show that such 30-day 4time period should be extended. If the due process hearing 5decision indicates that the parent is entitled to an 6independent educational evaluation, it must be completed 7within 60 school 30 days of the decision unless the parent or 8the school district offers reasonable grounds to show that 9such 30-day period should be extended.

The school district may evaluate the child 25if that is the decision resulting from the impartial due 26process hearing and the decision is not appealed or if the   SB1231 Engrossed- 5 -LRB104 05906 LNS 15938 b1decision is affirmed on appeal.

Students who are not currently identified 25as functionally blind who are also entitled to Braille 26instruction include: (i) those whose vision loss is so severe   SB1231 Engrossed- 9 -LRB104 05906 LNS 15938 b1that they are unable to read and write at a level comparable to 2their peers solely through the use of vision, and (ii) those 3who show evidence of progressive vision loss that may result 4in functional blindness.
