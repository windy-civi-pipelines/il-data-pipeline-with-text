The placement of English learners with 11disabilities shall be in non-restrictive environments which 12provide for integration with peers who do not have 13disabilities in bilingual classrooms.

If there is a disagreement 18between parties involved regarding the special education 19placement of any child, either in-state or out-of-state, the 20placement is subject to impartial due process procedures 21described in Article 10 of the Rules and Regulations to Govern 22the Administration and Operation of Special Education.23    (e) No child who comes from a home in which a language 24other than English is the principal language used may be 25assigned to any class or program under this Article until he 26has been given, in the principal language used by the child and   SB1231- 11 -LRB104 05906 LNS 15938 b1used in his home, tests reasonably related to his cultural 2environment. All testing and evaluation materials and 3procedures utilized for evaluation and placement shall not be 4linguistically, racially or culturally discriminatory.5    (f) Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require 6any child to undergo any physical examination or medical 7treatment whose parents object thereto on the grounds that 8such examination or treatment conflicts with his religious 9beliefs.10    (g) School boards or their designee shall provide to the 11parents of a child or, if applicable, the Department of 12Children and Family Services' Office of Education and 13Transition Services prior written notice of any decision (a) 14proposing to initiate or change, or (b) refusing to initiate 15or change, the identification, evaluation, or educational 16placement of the child or the provision of a free appropriate 17public education to their child, and the reasons therefor.

Students who are not currently identified 24as functionally blind who are also entitled to Braille 25instruction include: (i) those whose vision loss is so severe 26that they are unable to read and write at a level comparable to   SB1231- 9 -LRB104 05906 LNS 15938 b1their peers solely through the use of vision, and (ii) those 2who show evidence of progressive vision loss that may result 3in functional blindness.
