The 8denominator shall not include new property or the recovered 9tax increment value. If a new rate, a rate decrease, or a 10limiting rate increase has been approved at an election held 11after March 21, 2006, then (i) the otherwise applicable 12limiting rate shall be increased by the amount of the new rate 13or shall be reduced by the amount of the rate decrease, as the 14case may be, or (ii) in the case of a limiting rate increase, 15the limiting rate shall be equal to the rate set forth in the 16proposition approved by the voters for each of the years 17specified in the proposition, after which the limiting rate of 18the taxing district shall be calculated as otherwise provided. 19In the case of a taxing district that obtained referendum 20approval for an increased limiting rate on March 20, 2012, the 21limiting rate for tax year 2012 shall be the rate that 22generates the approximate total amount of taxes extendable for 23that tax year, as set forth in the proposition approved by the 24voters; this rate shall be the final rate applied by the county 25clerk for the aggregate of all capped funds of the district for 26tax year 2012.  HB3841- 21 -LRB104 11444 HLH 21532 b1(Source: P.A. 102-263, eff. 8-6-21; 102-311, eff. 8-6-21; 2102-519, eff. 8-20-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-707, eff. 34-22-22; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-895, eff. 5-23-22; 4103-154, eff. 6-30-23; 103-587, eff. 5-28-24; 103-591, eff. 57-1-24; 103-592, eff. 6-7-24; revised 7-9-24.)
