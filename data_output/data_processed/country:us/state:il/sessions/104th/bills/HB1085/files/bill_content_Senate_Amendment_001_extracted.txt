The Illinois Insurance Code is amended by 12adding Section 370c.3 as follows: 13    (215 ILCS 5/370c.3 new)14    Sec. 370c.3. Mental health and substance use parity.15    (a) In this Section:16    "Application" means a person's or facility's application 17to become a participating provider with an insurer in at least 18one of the insurer's provider networks.19    "Applying provider" means a provider or facility that has 20submitted a completed application to become a participating 21provider or facility with an insurer.22    "Behavioral health trainee" means any person: (1) engaged 23in the provision of mental health or substance use disorder 24clinical services as part of that person's supervised course   10400HB1085sam001- 7 -LRB104 05991 BAB 26790 a1of study while enrolled in a master's or doctoral psychology, 2social work, counseling, or marriage or family therapy program 3or as a postdoctoral graduate working toward licensure; and 4(2) who is working toward clinical State licensure under the 5clinical supervision of a fully licensed mental health or 6substance use disorder treatment provider.7    "Completed application" means a person's or facility's 8application to become a participating provider that has been 9submitted to the insurer and includes all the required 10information for the application to be considered by the 11insurer according to the insurer's policies and procedures for 12verifying a provider's or facility's credentials.13    "Contracting process" means the process by which a mental 14health or substance use disorder treatment provider or 15facility makes a completed application with an insurer to 16become a participating provider with the insurer until the 17effective date of a final contract between the provider or 18facility and the insurer. "Contracting process" includes the 19process of verifying a provider's credentials.20    "Participating provider" means any mental health or 21substance use disorder treatment provider that has a contract 22to provide mental health or substance use disorder services 23with an insurer.24    (b) Consistent with the principles of the federal Mental 25Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, and for the 26purposes of strengthening network adequacy for mental health   10400HB1085sam001- 8 -LRB104 05991 BAB 26790 a1and substance use disorder services and lowering 2out-of-network utilization, the Department of Human Services, 3by rule, shall determine a reimbursement rate floor for all 4in-network mental health and substance use disorder services, 5including inpatient services, outpatient services, office 6visits, and residential care, delivered by Illinois providers 7and facilities using the Illinois data in Research Triangle 8Institute International's study, Behavioral Health Parity - 9Pervasive Disparities in Access to In-Network Care Continue, 10Mark, T.L., & Parish, W. (April 2024). The reimbursement rate 11floor for mental health and substance use disorder services 12requires that reimbursement for each service, classified by 13Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System and Current 14Procedural Terminology codes, must be equal to or greater than 15the rate set by the Department of Human Services and shall 16apply to all group or individual policies of accident and 17health insurance or managed care plans that are amended, 18delivered, issued, or renewed on or after January 1, 2027 or 19any contracted third party administering the behavioral health 20benefits for the insurer. The Department of Human Services 21shall use the benchmark it deems appropriate for setting a 22reimbursement rate floor for mental health and substance use 23disorder services, but it shall have the effect of the 24reimbursement rate floor being between the average 25reimbursement and the 75th percentile of reimbursement for all 26medical and surgical reimbursement using Appendix C-13 of the   10400HB1085sam001- 9 -LRB104 05991 BAB 26790 a1Research Triangle Institute International study. In 2establishing the rate floor, the Department of Human Services 3shall take into consideration the need to reimburse above the 4average reimbursement to incentivize providers in short supply 5to participate in-network and shall set a reimbursement rate 6floor that is above the average reimbursement rate paid by the 7preferred provider organizations operated by the largest 8health insurer in the State of Illinois for mental health and 9substance use disorder services. If the Department of Human 10Services uses a rate benchmark that is tied to a federal health 11care program in which the reimbursement rates fluctuate, for 12any year the benchmark selected by the Department of Human 13Services decreases, the reimbursement rate floor for the 14purposes of this Section shall remain at the level it was the 15previous year. If at any time the average reimbursement for 16in-network medical and surgical services delivered by Illinois 17providers exceeds the rate floor the Department of Human 18Services establishes for mental health and substance use 19disorder services, then the reimbursement for mental health 20and substance use disorder treatment services must be equal to 21or greater than that average. Nothing in this Section gives 22the Department of Human Services any regulatory authority over 23an insurer. The Department of Insurance has the authority to 24enforce and monitor the reimbursement rate floor set pursuant 25to this Section and shall publish the rate floor set by the 26Department of Human Services in Title 50 of the Illinois   10400HB1085sam001- 10 -LRB104 05991 BAB 26790 a1Administrative Code.2    (c) A group or individual policy of accident and health 3insurance or managed care plan that is amended, delivered, 4issued, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, or contracted 5third party administering the behavioral health benefits for 6the insurer, shall cover all medically necessary mental health 7or substance use disorder services received by the same 8insured on the same day from the same or different mental 9health or substance use provider or facility for both 10outpatient and inpatient care.11    (d) A group or individual policy of accident and health 12insurance or managed care plan that is amended, delivered, 13issued, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, or any 14contracted third party administering the behavioral health 15benefits for the insurer, shall cover any medically necessary 16mental health or substance use disorder service provided by a 17behavioral health trainee when the trainee is working toward 18clinical State licensure and is under the supervision of a 19fully licensed mental health or substance use disorder 20treatment provider, which is a physician licensed to practice 21medicine in all its branches, licensed clinical psychologist, 22licensed clinical social worker, licensed clinical 23professional counselor, licensed marriage and family 24therapist, licensed speech-language pathologist, or other 25licensed or certified professional at a program licensed 26pursuant to the Substance Use Disorder Act who is engaged in   10400HB1085sam001- 11 -LRB104 05991 BAB 26790 a1treating mental, emotional, nervous, or substance use 2disorders or conditions.

The Illinois Insurance Code is amended by 12adding Section 370c.3 as follows: 13    (215 ILCS 5/370c.3 new)14    Sec. 370c.3. Mental health and substance use parity.15    (a) In this Section:16    "Application" means a person's or facility's application 17to become a participating provider with an insurer in at least 18one of the insurer's provider networks.19    "Applying provider" means a provider or facility that has 20submitted a completed application to become a participating 21provider or facility with an insurer.22    "Behavioral health trainee" means any person: (1) engaged 23in the provision of mental health or substance use disorder 24clinical services as part of that person's supervised course   10400HB1085sam001- 7 -LRB104 05991 BAB 26790 a1of study while enrolled in a master's or doctoral psychology, 2social work, counseling, or marriage or family therapy program 3or as a postdoctoral graduate working toward licensure; and 4(2) who is working toward clinical State licensure under the 5clinical supervision of a fully licensed mental health or 6substance use disorder treatment provider.7    "Completed application" means a person's or facility's 8application to become a participating provider that has been 9submitted to the insurer and includes all the required 10information for the application to be considered by the 11insurer according to the insurer's policies and procedures for 12verifying a provider's or facility's credentials.13    "Contracting process" means the process by which a mental 14health or substance use disorder treatment provider or 15facility makes a completed application with an insurer to 16become a participating provider with the insurer until the 17effective date of a final contract between the provider or 18facility and the insurer. "Contracting process" includes the 19process of verifying a provider's credentials.20    "Participating provider" means any mental health or 21substance use disorder treatment provider that has a contract 22to provide mental health or substance use disorder services 23with an insurer.24    (b) Consistent with the principles of the federal Mental 25Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, and for the 26purposes of strengthening network adequacy for mental health   10400HB1085sam001- 8 -LRB104 05991 BAB 26790 a1and substance use disorder services and lowering 2out-of-network utilization, the Department of Human Services, 3by rule, shall determine a reimbursement rate floor for all 4in-network mental health and substance use disorder services, 5including inpatient services, outpatient services, office 6visits, and residential care, delivered by Illinois providers 7and facilities using the Illinois data in Research Triangle 8Institute International's study, Behavioral Health Parity - 9Pervasive Disparities in Access to In-Network Care Continue, 10Mark, T.L., & Parish, W. (April 2024). The reimbursement rate 11floor for mental health and substance use disorder services 12requires that reimbursement for each service, classified by 13Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System and Current 14Procedural Terminology codes, must be equal to or greater than 15the rate set by the Department of Human Services and shall 16apply to all group or individual policies of accident and 17health insurance or managed care plans that are amended, 18delivered, issued, or renewed on or after January 1, 2027 or 19any contracted third party administering the behavioral health 20benefits for the insurer. The Department of Human Services 21shall use the benchmark it deems appropriate for setting a 22reimbursement rate floor for mental health and substance use 23disorder services, but it shall have the effect of the 24reimbursement rate floor being between the average 25reimbursement and the 75th percentile of reimbursement for all 26medical and surgical reimbursement using Appendix C-13 of the   10400HB1085sam001- 9 -LRB104 05991 BAB 26790 a1Research Triangle Institute International study. In 2establishing the rate floor, the Department of Human Services 3shall take into consideration the need to reimburse above the 4average reimbursement to incentivize providers in short supply 5to participate in-network and shall set a reimbursement rate 6floor that is above the average reimbursement rate paid by the 7preferred provider organizations operated by the largest 8health insurer in the State of Illinois for mental health and 9substance use disorder services. If the Department of Human 10Services uses a rate benchmark that is tied to a federal health 11care program in which the reimbursement rates fluctuate, for 12any year the benchmark selected by the Department of Human 13Services decreases, the reimbursement rate floor for the 14purposes of this Section shall remain at the level it was the 15previous year. If at any time the average reimbursement for 16in-network medical and surgical services delivered by Illinois 17providers exceeds the rate floor the Department of Human 18Services establishes for mental health and substance use 19disorder services, then the reimbursement for mental health 20and substance use disorder treatment services must be equal to 21or greater than that average. Nothing in this Section gives 22the Department of Human Services any regulatory authority over 23an insurer. The Department of Insurance has the authority to 24enforce and monitor the reimbursement rate floor set pursuant 25to this Section and shall publish the rate floor set by the 26Department of Human Services in Title 50 of the Illinois   10400HB1085sam001- 10 -LRB104 05991 BAB 26790 a1Administrative Code.2    (c) A group or individual policy of accident and health 3insurance or managed care plan that is amended, delivered, 4issued, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, or contracted 5third party administering the behavioral health benefits for 6the insurer, shall cover all medically necessary mental health 7or substance use disorder services received by the same 8insured on the same day from the same or different mental 9health or substance use provider or facility for both 10outpatient and inpatient care.11    (d) A group or individual policy of accident and health 12insurance or managed care plan that is amended, delivered, 13issued, or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, or any 14contracted third party administering the behavioral health 15benefits for the insurer, shall cover any medically necessary 16mental health or substance use disorder service provided by a 17behavioral health trainee when the trainee is working toward 18clinical State licensure and is under the supervision of a 19fully licensed mental health or substance use disorder 20treatment provider, which is a physician licensed to practice 21medicine in all its branches, licensed clinical psychologist, 22licensed clinical social worker, licensed clinical 23professional counselor, licensed marriage and family 24therapist, licensed speech-language pathologist, or other 25licensed or certified professional at a program licensed 26pursuant to the Substance Use Disorder Act who is engaged in   10400HB1085sam001- 11 -LRB104 05991 BAB 26790 a1treating mental, emotional, nervous, or substance use 2disorders or conditions.
