The Illinois Insurance Code is amended by 8adding Section 370c.3 as follows: 9    (215 ILCS 5/370c.3 new)10    Sec. 370c.3. Mental health and substance use parity.11    (a) In this Section:12    "Application" means a person's or facility's application 13to become a participating provider with an insurer in at least 14one of the insurer's provider networks.15    "Applying provider" means a provider or facility that has 16submitted a completed application to become a participating 17provider or facility with an insurer.18    "Behavioral health trainee" means any person: (1) engaged 19in the provision of mental health or substance use disorder 20clinical services as part of that person's supervised course 21of study while enrolled in a master's or doctoral psychology, 22social work, counseling, or marriage or family therapy program 23or as a postdoctoral graduate working toward licensure; and 24(2) who is working toward clinical State licensure under the   10400HB1085sam002- 8 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1clinical supervision of a fully licensed mental health or 2substance use disorder treatment provider.3    "Completed application" means a person's or facility's 4application to become a participating provider that has been 5submitted to the insurer and includes all the required 6information for the application to be considered by the 7insurer according to the insurer's policies and procedures for 8verifying a provider's or facility's credentials.9    "Contracting process" means the process by which a mental 10health or substance use disorder treatment provider or 11facility makes a completed application with an insurer to 12become a participating provider with the insurer until the 13effective date of a final contract between the provider or 14facility and the insurer. "Contracting process" includes the 15process of verifying a provider's credentials.16    "Participating provider" means any mental health or 17substance use disorder treatment provider that has a contract 18to provide mental health or substance use disorder services 19with an insurer.20    (b) Consistent with the principles of the federal Mental 21Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, and for the 22purposes of strengthening network adequacy for mental health 23and substance use disorder services and lowering 24out-of-network utilization, the University of Illinois at 25Chicago School of Public Health shall determine a 26reimbursement rate floor for all in-network mental health and   10400HB1085sam002- 9 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1substance use disorder services, including inpatient services, 2outpatient services, office visits, and residential care, 3delivered by Illinois providers and facilities using the 4Illinois data in Research Triangle Institute International's 5study, Behavioral Health Parity - Pervasive Disparities in 6Access to In-Network Care Continue, Mark, T.L., & Parish, W. 7(April 2024). The reimbursement rate floor for mental health 8and substance use disorder services requires that 9reimbursement for each service, classified by Healthcare 10Common Procedure Coding System and Current Procedural 11Terminology codes, must be equal to or greater than the rate 12set by the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public 13Health and shall apply to all group or individual policies of 14accident and health insurance that are amended, delivered, 15issued, or renewed on or after January 1, 2027 or any 16contracted third party administering the behavioral health 17benefits for the insurer. The University of Illinois at 18Chicago School of Public Health shall use the benchmark it 19deems appropriate for setting a reimbursement rate floor for 20mental health and substance use disorder services, but it 21shall have the effect of the reimbursement rate floor being 22between the average reimbursement and the 75th percentile of 23reimbursement for all medical and surgical reimbursement using 24Appendix C-13 of the Research Triangle Institute International 25study. In establishing the rate floor, the University of 26Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health shall take into   10400HB1085sam002- 10 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1consideration the need to reimburse above the average 2reimbursement to incentivize providers in short supply to 3participate in-network and shall set a reimbursement rate 4floor that is above the average reimbursement rate paid by the 5preferred provider organizations operated by the largest 6health insurer in the State of Illinois for mental health and 7substance use disorder services. If the University of Illinois 8at Chicago School of Public Health uses a rate benchmark that 9is tied to a federal health care program in which the 10reimbursement rates fluctuate, for any year the benchmark 11selected by the University of Illinois at Chicago School of 12Public Health decreases, the reimbursement rate floor for the 13purposes of this Section shall remain at the level it was the 14previous year. If at any time the average reimbursement for 15in-network medical and surgical services delivered by Illinois 16providers exceeds the rate floor the University of Illinois at 17Chicago School of Public Health establishes for mental health 18and substance use disorder services, then the reimbursement 19for mental health and substance use disorder treatment 20services must be equal to or greater than that average. 21Nothing in this Section gives the University of Illinois at 22Chicago School of Public Health any regulatory authority over 23an insurer or its contracted third party administering the 24behavioral health benefits. The University of Illinois at 25Chicago School of Public Health shall issue a report to the 26General Assembly by May 1, 2026 detailing a reimbursement rate   10400HB1085sam002- 11 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1floor. The report shall explain the University of Illinois at 2Chicago School of Public Health's specific methodology and 3data sources used to arrive at the rate floor and shall 4identify the relevant provisions of this Section authorizing 5the use of the methodology and data sources. The rate floor 6shall become effective and legally binding on insurers and 7their contracted third parties administering behavioral health 8benefits starting January 1, 2027. The Department of Insurance 9has the authority to enforce and monitor insurers' and their 10contracted third parties' compliance with the reimbursement 11rate floor set by the University of Illinois at Chicago School 12of Public Health pursuant to this Section, but the Department 13of Insurance shall have no authority to set or modify a rate 14floor or to approve or disapprove a rate floor set by the 15University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health.16    (c) A group or individual policy of accident and health 17insurance that is amended, delivered, issued, or renewed on or 18after January 1, 2026, or contracted third party administering 19the behavioral health benefits for the insurer, shall cover 20all medically necessary mental health or substance use 21disorder services received by the same insured on the same day 22from the same or different mental health or substance use 23provider or facility for both outpatient and inpatient care.24    (d) A group or individual policy of accident and health 25insurance that is amended, delivered, issued, or renewed on or 26after January 1, 2026, or any contracted third party   10400HB1085sam002- 12 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1administering the behavioral health benefits for the insurer, 2shall cover any medically necessary mental health or substance 3use disorder service provided by a behavioral health trainee 4when the trainee is working toward clinical State licensure 5and is under the supervision of a fully licensed mental health 6or substance use disorder treatment provider, which is a 7physician licensed to practice medicine in all its branches, 8licensed clinical psychologist, licensed clinical social 9worker, licensed clinical professional counselor, licensed 10marriage and family therapist, licensed speech-language 11pathologist, or other licensed or certified professional at a 12program licensed pursuant to the Substance Use Disorder Act 13who is engaged in treating mental, emotional, nervous, or 14substance use disorders or conditions. Services provided by 15the trainee must be billed under the supervising clinician's 16rendering National Provider Identifier.17    (e) A group or individual policy of accident and health 18insurance that is amended, delivered, issued, or renewed on or 19after January 1, 2026, or any contracted third party 20administering the behavioral health benefits for the insurer, 21shall:22        (1) cover medically necessary 60-minute psychotherapy 23    billed using the Current Procedural Terminology Code 90837 24    for Individual Therapy;25        (2) not impose more onerous documentation requirements 26    on the provider than is required for other psychotherapy   10400HB1085sam002- 13 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1    Current Procedural Terminology Codes; and2        (3) not audit the use of Current Procedural 3    Terminology Code 90837 any more frequently than audits for 4    the use of other psychotherapy Current Procedural 5    Terminology Codes.6    (f)(1) Any group or individual policy of accident and 7health insurance that is amended, delivered, issued, or 8renewed on or after January 1, 2026, or any contracted third 9party administering the behavioral health benefits for the 10insurer, shall complete the contracting process with a mental 11health or substance use disorder treatment provider or 12facility for becoming a participating provider in the 13insurer's network, including the verification of the 14provider's credentials, within 60 days from the date of a 15completed application to the insurer to become a participating 16provider. Nothing in this paragraph (1), however, presumes or 17establishes a contract between an insurer and a provider.18    (2) Any group or individual policy of accident and health 19insurance that is amended, delivered, issued, or renewed on or 20after January 1, 2026, or any contracted third party 21administering the behavioral health benefits for the insurer, 22shall reimburse a participating mental health or substance use 23disorder treatment provider or facility at the contracted 24reimbursement rate for any medically necessary services 25provided to an insured from the date of submission of the 26provider's or facility's completed application to become a   10400HB1085sam002- 14 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1participating provider with the insurer up to the effective 2date of the provider's contract. The provider's claims for 3such services shall be reimbursed only when submitted after 4the effective date of the provider's contract with the 5insurer. This paragraph (2) does not apply to a provider that 6does not have a completed contract with an insurer. If a 7provider opts to submit claims for medically necessary mental 8health or substance use disorder services pursuant to this 9paragraph (2), the provider must notify the insured following 10submission of the claims to the insurer that the services 11provided to the insured may be treated as in-network services.12    (3) Any group or individual policy of accident and health 13insurance that is amended, delivered, issued, or renewed on or 14after January 1, 2026, or any contracted third party 15administering the behavioral health benefits for the insurer, 16shall cover any medically necessary mental health or substance 17use disorder service provided by a fully licensed mental 18health or substance use disorder treatment provider affiliated 19with a mental health or substance use disorder treatment group 20practice who has submitted a completed application to become a 21participating provider with an insurer who is delivering 22services under the supervision of another fully licensed 23participating mental health or substance use disorder 24treatment provider within the same group practice up to the 25effective date of the applying provider's contract with the 26insurer as a participating provider.

The Illinois Insurance Code is amended by 8adding Section 370c.3 as follows: 9    (215 ILCS 5/370c.3 new)10    Sec. 370c.3. Mental health and substance use parity.11    (a) In this Section:12    "Application" means a person's or facility's application 13to become a participating provider with an insurer in at least 14one of the insurer's provider networks.15    "Applying provider" means a provider or facility that has 16submitted a completed application to become a participating 17provider or facility with an insurer.18    "Behavioral health trainee" means any person: (1) engaged 19in the provision of mental health or substance use disorder 20clinical services as part of that person's supervised course 21of study while enrolled in a master's or doctoral psychology, 22social work, counseling, or marriage or family therapy program 23or as a postdoctoral graduate working toward licensure; and 24(2) who is working toward clinical State licensure under the   10400HB1085sam002- 8 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1clinical supervision of a fully licensed mental health or 2substance use disorder treatment provider.3    "Completed application" means a person's or facility's 4application to become a participating provider that has been 5submitted to the insurer and includes all the required 6information for the application to be considered by the 7insurer according to the insurer's policies and procedures for 8verifying a provider's or facility's credentials.9    "Contracting process" means the process by which a mental 10health or substance use disorder treatment provider or 11facility makes a completed application with an insurer to 12become a participating provider with the insurer until the 13effective date of a final contract between the provider or 14facility and the insurer. "Contracting process" includes the 15process of verifying a provider's credentials.16    "Participating provider" means any mental health or 17substance use disorder treatment provider that has a contract 18to provide mental health or substance use disorder services 19with an insurer.20    (b) Consistent with the principles of the federal Mental 21Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008, and for the 22purposes of strengthening network adequacy for mental health 23and substance use disorder services and lowering 24out-of-network utilization, the University of Illinois at 25Chicago School of Public Health shall determine a 26reimbursement rate floor for all in-network mental health and   10400HB1085sam002- 9 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1substance use disorder services, including inpatient services, 2outpatient services, office visits, and residential care, 3delivered by Illinois providers and facilities using the 4Illinois data in Research Triangle Institute International's 5study, Behavioral Health Parity - Pervasive Disparities in 6Access to In-Network Care Continue, Mark, T.L., & Parish, W. 7(April 2024). The reimbursement rate floor for mental health 8and substance use disorder services requires that 9reimbursement for each service, classified by Healthcare 10Common Procedure Coding System and Current Procedural 11Terminology codes, must be equal to or greater than the rate 12set by the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public 13Health and shall apply to all group or individual policies of 14accident and health insurance that are amended, delivered, 15issued, or renewed on or after January 1, 2027 or any 16contracted third party administering the behavioral health 17benefits for the insurer. The University of Illinois at 18Chicago School of Public Health shall use the benchmark it 19deems appropriate for setting a reimbursement rate floor for 20mental health and substance use disorder services, but it 21shall have the effect of the reimbursement rate floor being 22between the average reimbursement and the 75th percentile of 23reimbursement for all medical and surgical reimbursement using 24Appendix C-13 of the Research Triangle Institute International 25study. In establishing the rate floor, the University of 26Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health shall take into   10400HB1085sam002- 10 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1consideration the need to reimburse above the average 2reimbursement to incentivize providers in short supply to 3participate in-network and shall set a reimbursement rate 4floor that is above the average reimbursement rate paid by the 5preferred provider organizations operated by the largest 6health insurer in the State of Illinois for mental health and 7substance use disorder services. If the University of Illinois 8at Chicago School of Public Health uses a rate benchmark that 9is tied to a federal health care program in which the 10reimbursement rates fluctuate, for any year the benchmark 11selected by the University of Illinois at Chicago School of 12Public Health decreases, the reimbursement rate floor for the 13purposes of this Section shall remain at the level it was the 14previous year. If at any time the average reimbursement for 15in-network medical and surgical services delivered by Illinois 16providers exceeds the rate floor the University of Illinois at 17Chicago School of Public Health establishes for mental health 18and substance use disorder services, then the reimbursement 19for mental health and substance use disorder treatment 20services must be equal to or greater than that average. 21Nothing in this Section gives the University of Illinois at 22Chicago School of Public Health any regulatory authority over 23an insurer or its contracted third party administering the 24behavioral health benefits. The University of Illinois at 25Chicago School of Public Health shall issue a report to the 26General Assembly by May 1, 2026 detailing a reimbursement rate   10400HB1085sam002- 11 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1floor. The report shall explain the University of Illinois at 2Chicago School of Public Health's specific methodology and 3data sources used to arrive at the rate floor and shall 4identify the relevant provisions of this Section authorizing 5the use of the methodology and data sources. The rate floor 6shall become effective and legally binding on insurers and 7their contracted third parties administering behavioral health 8benefits starting January 1, 2027. The Department of Insurance 9has the authority to enforce and monitor insurers' and their 10contracted third parties' compliance with the reimbursement 11rate floor set by the University of Illinois at Chicago School 12of Public Health pursuant to this Section, but the Department 13of Insurance shall have no authority to set or modify a rate 14floor or to approve or disapprove a rate floor set by the 15University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health.16    (c) A group or individual policy of accident and health 17insurance that is amended, delivered, issued, or renewed on or 18after January 1, 2026, or contracted third party administering 19the behavioral health benefits for the insurer, shall cover 20all medically necessary mental health or substance use 21disorder services received by the same insured on the same day 22from the same or different mental health or substance use 23provider or facility for both outpatient and inpatient care.24    (d) A group or individual policy of accident and health 25insurance that is amended, delivered, issued, or renewed on or 26after January 1, 2026, or any contracted third party   10400HB1085sam002- 12 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1administering the behavioral health benefits for the insurer, 2shall cover any medically necessary mental health or substance 3use disorder service provided by a behavioral health trainee 4when the trainee is working toward clinical State licensure 5and is under the supervision of a fully licensed mental health 6or substance use disorder treatment provider, which is a 7physician licensed to practice medicine in all its branches, 8licensed clinical psychologist, licensed clinical social 9worker, licensed clinical professional counselor, licensed 10marriage and family therapist, licensed speech-language 11pathologist, or other licensed or certified professional at a 12program licensed pursuant to the Substance Use Disorder Act 13who is engaged in treating mental, emotional, nervous, or 14substance use disorders or conditions. Services provided by 15the trainee must be billed under the supervising clinician's 16rendering National Provider Identifier.17    (e) A group or individual policy of accident and health 18insurance that is amended, delivered, issued, or renewed on or 19after January 1, 2026, or any contracted third party 20administering the behavioral health benefits for the insurer, 21shall:22        (1) cover medically necessary 60-minute psychotherapy 23    billed using the Current Procedural Terminology Code 90837 24    for Individual Therapy;25        (2) not impose more onerous documentation requirements 26    on the provider than is required for other psychotherapy   10400HB1085sam002- 13 -LRB104 05991 BAB 27049 a1    Current Procedural Terminology Codes; and2        (3) not audit the use of Current Procedural 3    Terminology Code 90837 any more frequently than audits for 4    the use of other psychotherapy Current Procedural 5    Terminology Codes.6    (f)(1) Any group or individual policy of accident and 7health insurance that is amended, delivered, issued, or 8renewed on or after January 1, 2026, or any contracted third 9party administering the behavioral health benefits for the 10insurer, shall complete the contracting process with a mental 11health or substance use disorder treatment provider or 12facility for becoming a participating provider in the 13insurer's network, including the verification of the 14provider's credentials, within 60 days from the date of a 15completed application to the insurer to become a participating 16provider.
