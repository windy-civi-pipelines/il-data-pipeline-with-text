The Illinois Municipal Code is amended by 5changing Sections 10-1-7.1 and 10-2.1-6.3 and by adding 6Section 10-4-15 as follows: 7    (65 ILCS 5/10-1-7.1)8    Sec. 10-1-7.1.

Unless a commission elects to follow 11the provisions of Section 10-1-7.2, this Section shall apply 12to all original appointments to an affected full-time fire 13department. Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 14be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 15years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 1697-251).17    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law 18to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 19department to which this Section applies shall be administered 20in the manner provided for in this Section. Provisions of the 21Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 22adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 23initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall   SB0193- 2 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 2Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 3and any other law, this Section shall control.4    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 5administer its fire department process for original 6appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 7Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 8Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 9concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 10functions exercised by the State.11    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 12consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 13fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 14Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 15Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree. 16    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 17(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 18than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 19    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 20to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 21eligibles established in accordance with the processes 22established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 23the performance standards required by this Section shall be 24placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 25an affected fire department.26    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire   SB0193- 3 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 2firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 3position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 4death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 5any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 6that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 7eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 8conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 9minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 10authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 11the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 12the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 13either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 14register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 15highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 16of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 17eligibles is less than 5 people.18    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 19losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 20candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 21by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 22not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 23future examinations, including an examination held during the 24time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 25eligibles.26    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment   SB0193- 4 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1shall be vested in the Civil Service Commission. All 2certificates of appointment issued to any officer or member of 3an affected department shall be signed by the chairperson and 4secretary, respectively, of the commission upon appointment of 5such officer or member to the affected department by the 6commission. After being selected from the register of 7eligibles to fill a vacancy in the affected department, each 8appointee shall be presented with his or her certificate of 9appointment on the day on which he or she is sworn in as a 10classified member of the affected department. Firefighters who 11were not issued a certificate of appointment when originally 12appointed shall be provided with a certificate within 10 days 13after making a written request to the chairperson of the Civil 14Service Commission. Each person who accepts a certificate of 15appointment and successfully completes his or her probationary 16period shall be enrolled as a firefighter and as a regular 17member of the fire department.18    For the purposes of this Section, "firefighter" means any 19person who has been prior to, on, or after August 4, 2011 (the 20effective date of Public Act 97-251) appointed to a fire 21department or fire protection district or employed by a State 22university and sworn or commissioned to perform firefighter 23duties or paramedic duties, or both, except that the following 24persons are not included: part-time firefighters; auxiliary, 25reserve, or voluntary firefighters, including paid-on-call 26firefighters; clerks and dispatchers or other civilian   SB0193- 5 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1employees of a fire department or fire protection district who 2are not routinely expected to perform firefighter duties; and 3elected officials.4    (c) Qualification for placement on register of eligibles. 5The purpose of establishing a register of eligibles is to 6identify applicants who possess and demonstrate the mental 7aptitude and physical ability to perform the duties required 8of members of the fire department in order to provide the 9highest quality of service to the public. To this end, all 10applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 11department shall be subject to examination and testing which 12shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 13unless the municipality shall by ordinance limit applicants to 14residents of the municipality, county or counties in which the 15municipality is located, State, or nation. Any examination and 16testing procedure utilized under subsection (e) of this 17Section shall be supported by appropriate validation evidence 18and shall comply with all applicable State and federal laws. 19Municipalities may establish educational, emergency medical 20service licensure, and other prerequisites for participation 21in an examination or for hire as a firefighter. Any 22municipality may charge a fee to cover the costs of the 23application process.24    Residency requirements in effect at the time an individual 25enters the fire service of a municipality cannot be made more 26restrictive for that individual during his or her period of   SB0193- 6 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1service for that municipality, or be made a condition of 2promotion, except for the rank or position of fire chief and 3for no more than 2 positions that rank immediately below that 4of the chief rank which are appointed positions pursuant to 5the Fire Department Promotion Act.6    No person who is 35 years of age or older shall be eligible 7to take an examination for a position as a firefighter unless 8the person has had previous employment status as a firefighter 9in the regularly constituted fire department of the 10municipality, except as provided in this Section. The age 11limitation does not apply to:12        (1) any person previously employed as a full-time 13    firefighter in a regularly constituted fire department of 14    (i) any municipality or fire protection district located 15    in Illinois, (ii) a fire protection district whose 16    obligations were assumed by a municipality under Section 17    21 of the Fire Protection District Act, or (iii) a 18    municipality whose obligations were taken over by a fire 19    protection district,20        (2) any person who has served a municipality as a 21    regularly enrolled volunteer, paid-on-call, or part-time 22    firefighter, or23        (3) any person who turned 35 while serving as a member 24    of the active or reserve components of any of the branches 25    of the Armed Forces of the United States or the National 26    Guard of any state, whose service was characterized as   SB0193- 7 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1    honorable or under honorable, if separated from the 2    military, and is currently under the age of 40. 3    No person who is under 21 years of age shall be eligible 4for employment as a firefighter unless hired as a volunteer 5apprentice firefighter through an apprenticeship program 6established under Section 10-4-15.7    No applicant shall be examined concerning his or her 8political or religious opinions or affiliations.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 17Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 18extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 19employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 20sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 21hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 22licensure.23    In the event that any applicant who has been found 24eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 25the final eligibility register provided for in this Division 1 26has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one   SB0193- 8 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1year after the date of his or her physical ability 2examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 3be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 4her appointment.

The 8applicant's name may be retained upon the register of 9candidates eligible for appointment and when next reached for 10certification and appointment that applicant may be again 11examined as provided in this Section, and if the physical 12ability of that applicant is found to be less than the minimum 13standard fixed by the rules of the commission, the applicant 14shall not be appointed, and the name of the applicant shall be 15removed from the register.16    (d) Notice, examination, and testing components.

All candidates shall be required to 20undergo an examination of their physical ability to perform 21the essential functions included in the duties they may be 22called upon to perform as a member of a fire department. For 23the purposes of this Section, essential functions of the job 24are functions associated with duties that a firefighter may be 25called upon to perform in response to emergency calls. The 26frequency of the occurrence of those duties as part of the fire   SB0193- 10 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1department's regular routine shall not be a controlling factor 2in the design of examination criteria or evolutions selected 3for testing. These physical examinations shall be open, 4competitive, and based on industry standards designed to test 5each applicant's physical abilities in the following 6dimensions:7        (1) Muscular strength to perform tasks and evolutions 8    that may be required in the performance of duties 9    including grip strength, leg strength, and arm strength. 10    Tests shall be conducted under anaerobic as well as 11    aerobic conditions to test both the candidate's speed and 12    endurance in performing tasks and evolutions.

Appointing 8authorities may create a preliminary eligibility register. A 9person shall be placed on the list based upon his or her 10passage of the written examination or the passage of the 11written examination and the physical ability component. 12Passage of the written examination means attaining the minimum 13score set by the commission. Minimum scores should be set by 14the commission so as to demonstrate a candidate's ability to 15perform the essential functions of the job. The minimum score 16set by the commission shall be supported by appropriate 17validation evidence and shall comply with all applicable State 18and federal laws. The appointing authority may conduct the 19physical ability component and any subjective components 20subsequent to the posting of the preliminary eligibility 21register.22    The examination components for an initial eligibility 23register shall be graded on a 100-point scale. A person's 24position on the list shall be determined by the following: (i) 25the person's score on the written examination, (ii) the person 26successfully passing the physical ability component, and (iii)   SB0193- 12 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1the person's results on any subjective component as described 2in subsection (d). 3    In order to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 4register, an applicant's score on the written examination, 5before any applicable preference points or subjective points 6are applied, shall be at or above the minimum score set by the 7commission. The local appointing authority may prescribe the 8score to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 9register, but the score shall not be less than the minimum 10score set by the commission.11    The commission shall prepare and keep a register of 12persons whose total score is not less than the minimum score 13for passage and who have passed the physical ability 14examination.

Provisions of the 15Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 16adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 17initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 18continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 19Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 20and any other law, this Section shall control.21    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 22administer its fire department process for original 23appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 24Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 25Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the   SB0193- 22 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 2functions exercised by the State.3    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 4consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 5fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 6Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 7Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree.8    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 9(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 10than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 11    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 12to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 13eligibles established in accordance with the processes 14established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 15the performance standards required by this Section shall be 16placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 17an affected fire department.18    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 19a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 20firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 21position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 22death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 23any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 24that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 25eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 26conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the   SB0193- 23 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 2authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 3the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 4the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 5either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 6register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 7highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 8of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 9eligibles is less than 5 people.10    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 11losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 12candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 13by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 14not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 15future examinations, including an examination held during the 16time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 17eligibles.18    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 19shall be vested in the board of fire and police commissioners. 20All certificates of appointment issued to any officer or 21member of an affected department shall be signed by the 22chairperson and secretary, respectively, of the board upon 23appointment of such officer or member to the affected 24department by action of the board.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 10Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 11extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 12employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 13sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 14hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 15licensure.16    In the event that any applicant who has been found 17eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 18the final eligibility register provided for in this Section 19has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 20year after the date of his or her physical ability 21examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 22be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 23her appointment.

Provisions of the Illinois Municipal Code, Fire 19Protection District Act, fire district ordinances, and rules 20adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 21initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 22continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 23Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 24and any other law, this Section shall control.  SB0193- 43 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1    A fire protection district that is operating under a court 2order or consent decree regarding original appointments to a 3full-time fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective 4date of Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of 5this Section for the duration of the court order or consent 6decree.7    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 8to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 9eligibles established in accordance with the processes 10required by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed the 11performance standards required by the Section shall be placed 12on a register of eligibles for original appointment to an 13affected fire department.14    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 15a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 16firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 17position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 18death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 19any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 20that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 21eligibility list.

To this end, all   SB0193- 46 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 2department shall be subject to examination and testing which 3shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 4unless the district shall by ordinance limit applicants to 5residents of the district, county or counties in which the 6district is located, State, or nation.

Provisions of the 21Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 22adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 23initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall   SB0193- 2 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 2Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 3and any other law, this Section shall control.4    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 5administer its fire department process for original 6appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 7Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 8Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 9concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 10functions exercised by the State.11    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 12consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 13fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 14Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 15Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree. 16    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 17(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 18than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 19    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 20to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 21eligibles established in accordance with the processes 22established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 23the performance standards required by this Section shall be 24placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 25an affected fire department.26    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire   SB0193- 3 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 2firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 3position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 4death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 5any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 6that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 7eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 8conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 9minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 10authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 11the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 12the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 13either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 14register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 15highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 16of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 17eligibles is less than 5 people.18    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 19losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 20candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 21by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 22not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 23future examinations, including an examination held during the 24time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 25eligibles.26    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment   SB0193- 4 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1shall be vested in the Civil Service Commission. All 2certificates of appointment issued to any officer or member of 3an affected department shall be signed by the chairperson and 4secretary, respectively, of the commission upon appointment of 5such officer or member to the affected department by the 6commission.

To this end, all 10applicants for original appointment to an affected fire 11department shall be subject to examination and testing which 12shall be public, competitive, and open to all applicants 13unless the municipality shall by ordinance limit applicants to 14residents of the municipality, county or counties in which the 15municipality is located, State, or nation. Any examination and 16testing procedure utilized under subsection (e) of this 17Section shall be supported by appropriate validation evidence 18and shall comply with all applicable State and federal laws. 19Municipalities may establish educational, emergency medical 20service licensure, and other prerequisites for participation 21in an examination or for hire as a firefighter.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 17Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 18extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 19employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 20sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 21hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 22licensure.23    In the event that any applicant who has been found 24eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 25the final eligibility register provided for in this Division 1 26has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one   SB0193- 8 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1year after the date of his or her physical ability 2examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 3be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 4her appointment.

Existing registers of eligibles shall continue to 8be valid until their expiration dates, or up to a maximum of 2 9years after August 4, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 1097-251).11    Notwithstanding any statute, ordinance, rule, or other law 12to the contrary, all original appointments to an affected 13department to which this Section applies shall be administered 14in the manner provided for in this Section. Provisions of the 15Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 16adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 17initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall 18continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 19Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 20and any other law, this Section shall control.21    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 22administer its fire department process for original 23appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 24Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 25Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the   SB0193- 22 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 2functions exercised by the State.3    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 4consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 5fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 6Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 7Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree.8    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 9(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 10than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 11    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 12to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 13eligibles established in accordance with the processes 14established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 15the performance standards required by this Section shall be 16placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 17an affected fire department.18    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 19a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 20firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 21position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 22death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 23any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 24that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 25eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 26conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the   SB0193- 23 -LRB104 02963 RTM 12979 b1minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 2authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 3the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 4the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 5either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 6register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 7highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 8of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 9eligibles is less than 5 people.10    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 11losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 12candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 13by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 14not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 15future examinations, including an examination held during the 16time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 17eligibles.18    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 19shall be vested in the board of fire and police commissioners. 20All certificates of appointment issued to any officer or 21member of an affected department shall be signed by the 22chairperson and secretary, respectively, of the board upon 23appointment of such officer or member to the affected 24department by action of the board.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 10Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 11extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 12employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 13sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 14hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 15licensure.16    In the event that any applicant who has been found 17eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 18the final eligibility register provided for in this Section 19has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 20year after the date of his or her physical ability 21examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 22be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 23her appointment.
