Return to work by affected annuitant; 8notice and contribution by employer.9    (a) An employer who employs or re-employs a person 10receiving a retirement annuity from the System in an academic 11year beginning on or after August 1, 2013 must notify the 12System of that employment within 60 days after employing the 13annuitant. The notice must include a summary of the contract 14of employment or specify the rate of compensation and the 15anticipated length of employment of that annuitant. The notice 16must specify whether the annuitant will be compensated from 17federal, corporate, foundation, or trust funds or grants of 18State funds that identify the principal investigator by name. 19The notice must include the employer's determination of 20whether or not the annuitant is an "affected annuitant" as 21defined in subsection (b).22    The employer must also record, document, and certify to 23the System (i) the amount of compensation paid to the   SB1374- 2 -LRB104 09777 RPS 19843 b1annuitant for employment during the academic year, and (ii) 2the amount of that compensation, if any, that comes from 3either federal, corporate, foundation, or trust funds or 4grants of State funds that identify the principal investigator 5by name.6    As used in this Section, "academic year" means the 712-month period beginning September 1. 8    For the purposes of this Section, an annuitant whose 9employment by an employer extends over more than one academic 10year shall be deemed to be re-employed by that employer in each 11of those academic years. 12    The System may specify the time, form, and manner of 13providing the determinations, notifications, certifications, 14and documentation required under this Section. 15    (b) A person receiving a retirement annuity from the 16System becomes an "affected annuitant" on the first day of the 17academic year following the academic year in which the 18annuitant first meets the following conditions:19        (1) (Blank). 20        (2) While receiving a retirement annuity under this 21    Article, the annuitant was employed on or after August 1, 22    2013 by one or more employers under this Article and 23    received or became entitled to receive during an academic 24    year compensation for that employment in excess of 40% of 25    his or her highest annual earnings prior to retirement; 26    except that compensation paid from federal, corporate,   SB1374- 3 -LRB104 09777 RPS 19843 b1    foundation, or trust funds or grants of State funds that 2    identify the principal investigator by name is excluded.3        (3) The annuitant received an annualized retirement 4    annuity under this Article of at least $10,000. 5    A person who becomes an affected annuitant remains an 6affected annuitant, except for (i) any period during which the 7person returns to active service and does not receive a 8retirement annuity from the System; or (ii) any period on or 9after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 100th 10General Assembly during which an annuitant received an 11annualized retirement annuity under this Article that is less 12than $10,000; or (iii) any period during which the annuitant 13received, or became entitled to receive, during an academic 14year compensation for that employment equal to 40% or less of 15his or her highest annual earnings prior to retirement. 16    (c) It is the obligation of the employer to determine 17whether an annuitant is an affected annuitant before employing 18the annuitant. For that purpose the employer may require the 19annuitant to disclose and document his or her relevant prior 20employment and earnings history. Failure of the employer to 21make this determination correctly and in a timely manner or to 22include this determination with the notification required 23under subsection (a) does not excuse the employer from making 24the contribution required under subsection (e).25    The System may assist the employer in determining whether 26a person is an affected annuitant. The System shall inform the   SB1374- 4 -LRB104 09777 RPS 19843 b1employer if it discovers that the employer's determination is 2inconsistent with the employment and earnings information in 3the System's records. 4    (d) Upon the request of an annuitant, the System shall 5certify to the annuitant or the employer the following 6information as reported by the employers, as that information 7is indicated in the records of the System: (i) the annuitant's 8highest annual earnings prior to retirement, (ii) the 9compensation paid for that employment in each academic year, 10and (iii) whether any of that employment or compensation has 11been certified to the System as being paid from federal, 12corporate, foundation, or trust funds or grants of State funds 13that identify the principal investigator by name. The System 14shall only be required to certify information that is received 15from the employers. 16    (e) In addition to the requirements of subsection (a), an 17employer who employs an affected annuitant must pay to the 18System an employer contribution in the amount and manner 19provided in this Section, unless the annuitant is compensated 20by that employer solely from federal, corporate, foundation, 21or trust funds or grants of State funds that identify the 22principal investigator by name.23    The employer contribution required under this Section for 24employment of an affected annuitant in an academic year shall 25be equal to the lesser of: (1) 3 12 times the amount of the 26gross monthly retirement annuity payable to the annuitant for   SB1374- 5 -LRB104 09777 RPS 19843 b1the month in which the first paid day of that employment in 2that academic year occurs, after any reduction in that annuity 3that may be imposed under subsection (b) of Section 15-139; or 4(2) $100,000.5    If an affected annuitant is employed by more than one 6employer in an academic year, the employer contribution 7required under this Section shall be divided among those 8employers in proportion to their respective portions of the 9total compensation paid to the affected annuitant for that 10employment during that academic year. 11    If the System determines that an employer, without 12reasonable justification, has failed to make the determination 13of affected annuitant status correctly and in a timely manner, 14or has failed to notify the System or to correctly document or 15certify to the System any of the information required by this 16Section, and that failure results in a delayed determination 17by the System that a contribution is payable under this 18Section, then the amount of that employer's contribution 19otherwise determined under this Section shall be doubled. 20    The System shall deem a failure to correctly determine the 21annuitant's status to be justified if the employer establishes 22to the System's satisfaction that the employer, after due 23diligence, made an erroneous determination that the annuitant 24was not an affected annuitant due to reasonable reliance on 25false or misleading information provided by the annuitant or 26another employer, or an error in the annuitant's official   SB1374- 6 -LRB104 09777 RPS 19843 b1employment or earnings records. 2    The changes to this subsection (e) made by this amendatory 3Act of the 104th General Assembly apply to employer 4contributions required on or after January 1, 2021. 5    (f) Whenever the System determines that an employer is 6liable for a contribution under this Section, it shall so 7notify the employer and certify the amount of the 8contribution. The employer may pay the required contribution 9without interest at any time within one year after receipt of 10the certification. If the employer fails to pay within that 11year, then interest shall be charged at a rate equal to the 12System's prescribed rate of interest, compounded annually from 13the 366th day after receipt of the certification from the 14System. Payment must be concluded within 2 years after receipt 15of the certification by the employer. If the employer fails to 16make complete payment, including applicable interest, within 2 17years, then the System may, after giving notice to the 18employer, certify the delinquent amount to the State 19Comptroller, and the Comptroller shall thereupon deduct the 20certified delinquent amount from State funds payable to the 21employer and pay them instead to the System. 22    (g) If an employer is required to make a contribution to 23the System as a result of employing an affected annuitant and 24the annuitant later elects to forgo his or her annuity in that 25same academic year pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 2615-139, then the required contribution by the employer shall   SB1374- 7 -LRB104 09777 RPS 19843 b1be waived, and if the contribution has already been paid, it 2shall be refunded to the employer without interest. 3    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, 4the employer contribution required under this Section shall 5not be included in the determination of any benefit under this 6Article or any other Article of this Code, regardless of 7whether the annuitant returns to active service, and is in 8addition to any other State or employer contribution required 9under this Article. 10    (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section to 11the contrary, if an employer employs an affected annuitant in 12order to continue critical operations in the event of either 13an employee's unforeseen illness, accident, or death or a 14catastrophic incident or disaster, then, for one and only one 15academic year, the employer is not required to pay the 16contribution set forth in this Section for that annuitant. The 17employer shall, however, immediately notify the System upon 18employing a person subject to this subsection (i). For the 19purposes of this subsection (i), "critical operations" means 20teaching services, medical services, student welfare services, 21and any other services that are critical to the mission of the 22employer. 23    (j) This Section shall be applied and coordinated with the 24regulatory obligations contained in the State Universities 25Civil Service Act. This Section shall not apply to an 26annuitant if the employer of that annuitant provides   SB1374- 8 -LRB104 09777 RPS 19843 b1documentation to the System that (1) the annuitant is employed 2in a status appointment position, as that term is defined in 80 3Ill. Adm. Code 250.80, and (2) due to obligations contained 4under the State Universities Civil Service Act, the employer 5does not have the ability to limit the earnings or duration of 6employment for the annuitant while employed in the status 7appointment position. 8(Source: P.A. 100-556, eff. 12-8-17.) 9    Section 99. Effective date. This Act takes effect upon 10becoming law.
