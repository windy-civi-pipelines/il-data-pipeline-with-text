Ford SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: See Index    Creates the Inclusive History Act. Establishes the Inclusive History Commission to (i) address the deficiencies and inadequacies in both perspective and content in traditional history course material and instruction and (ii) develop multiperspective, inclusive, and comprehensive standards that a school may use as a guide in replacing or developing its curricula for history education. Sets forth the membership of the Commission. Contains provisions concerning meetings, duties, and reporting. Repeals the provisions on December 31, 2026. Amends the Courses of Study Article of the School Code. Beginning with the 2025-2026 school year, requires schools to suspend all instruction in history education, with exceptions. Not later than June 30, 2026, requires the State Superintendent of Education to provide to schools instructional guidelines and standards based on the recommendations of the Commission so that schools may develop alternative curricula to replace traditional course material and instruction to ensure that students obtain a multiperspective, inclusive, and comprehensive understanding about history. Provides that beginning with the 2026-2027 school year, schools shall resume instruction in history, which shall require the use of age-appropriate discussion, textbooks, and other course material that reframe the study of history by presenting to students an examination of history through the inclusion of diverse perspectives, contrary interpretations, and the viewpoints of various groups of people whose voices have traditionally been excluded from the conventional teaching of history.

Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Inclusive History Act. 6    Section 5. Statement of findings; Inclusive History 7Commission creation and purpose.8    (a) In an effort to create a well-informed, tolerant, and 9equitable society, students in grades kindergarten through 12 10in this State should receive an unbiased, objective, and 11thorough education in history. Traditional course material and 12instruction have failed to provide to students a comprehensive 13education in history because the historical narrative has 14always been presented and interpreted from the perspective of 15one rather than from the perspective of many. To the detriment 16of our society, this limited narrative in history instruction 17and course material rarely teaches our students about the 18contributions made by or the marginalization of women, Black 19people, indigenous people, Latinx people, and people of color, 20faith-based minorities, ethnic minorities, immigrants, members 21of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, 22persons with disabilities, and many others. Traditional 23teaching materials so often fail to provide for any study   HB2927- 2 -LRB104 03391 LNS 13413 b1about slavery, racism, and civil rights that teachers must 2often purchase their own supplementary materials in order to 3teach their students about these subjects. The objective in 4the reframing of history education in this State is not to 5exclude, prohibit, or deny the narrative, perspective, or 6accomplishments of any cultural group or people, but rather to 7recognize and include the narrative, perspective, and 8accomplishments of all. The reframing of history education 9must present to students a fair and accurate historical 10narrative that acknowledges both the triumphs and the failures 11of a society. Therefore, the teaching of history to students 12in this State must be reformed and reframed in order to provide 13our students with a multiperspective, inclusive, and 14comprehensive understanding of history. Rather than requiring 15each school to be responsible for the research, study, and 16investigation necessary to develop alternative or revised 17instructional standards for the teaching of history, 18instructional guidelines and standards should be provided to 19schools statewide so that each school may develop the 20alternative curricula it needs to replace traditional course 21material and instruction.22    (b) The Inclusive History Commission is created to (i) 23address the deficiencies and inadequacies in both perspective 24and content in traditional course material and instruction and 25(ii) develop multiperspective, inclusive, and comprehensive 26standards that a school may use as a guide in replacing or   HB2927- 3 -LRB104 03391 LNS 13413 b1developing its curricula for history education.  2    Section 10.

Ford SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: See Index    Creates the Inclusive History Act. Establishes the Inclusive History Commission to (i) address the deficiencies and inadequacies in both perspective and content in traditional history course material and instruction and (ii) develop multiperspective, inclusive, and comprehensive standards that a school may use as a guide in replacing or developing its curricula for history education. Sets forth the membership of the Commission. Contains provisions concerning meetings, duties, and reporting. Repeals the provisions on December 31, 2026. Amends the Courses of Study Article of the School Code. Beginning with the 2025-2026 school year, requires schools to suspend all instruction in history education, with exceptions. Not later than June 30, 2026, requires the State Superintendent of Education to provide to schools instructional guidelines and standards based on the recommendations of the Commission so that schools may develop alternative curricula to replace traditional course material and instruction to ensure that students obtain a multiperspective, inclusive, and comprehensive understanding about history. Provides that beginning with the 2026-2027 school year, schools shall resume instruction in history, which shall require the use of age-appropriate discussion, textbooks, and other course material that reframe the study of history by presenting to students an examination of history through the inclusion of diverse perspectives, contrary interpretations, and the viewpoints of various groups of people whose voices have traditionally been excluded from the conventional teaching of history.

Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Inclusive History Act. 6    Section 5. Statement of findings; Inclusive History 7Commission creation and purpose.8    (a) In an effort to create a well-informed, tolerant, and 9equitable society, students in grades kindergarten through 12 10in this State should receive an unbiased, objective, and 11thorough education in history. Traditional course material and 12instruction have failed to provide to students a comprehensive 13education in history because the historical narrative has 14always been presented and interpreted from the perspective of 15one rather than from the perspective of many. To the detriment 16of our society, this limited narrative in history instruction 17and course material rarely teaches our students about the 18contributions made by or the marginalization of women, Black 19people, indigenous people, Latinx people, and people of color, 20faith-based minorities, ethnic minorities, immigrants, members 21of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, 22persons with disabilities, and many others. Traditional 23teaching materials so often fail to provide for any study   HB2927- 2 -LRB104 03391 LNS 13413 b1about slavery, racism, and civil rights that teachers must 2often purchase their own supplementary materials in order to 3teach their students about these subjects. The objective in 4the reframing of history education in this State is not to 5exclude, prohibit, or deny the narrative, perspective, or 6accomplishments of any cultural group or people, but rather to 7recognize and include the narrative, perspective, and 8accomplishments of all. The reframing of history education 9must present to students a fair and accurate historical 10narrative that acknowledges both the triumphs and the failures 11of a society. Therefore, the teaching of history to students 12in this State must be reformed and reframed in order to provide 13our students with a multiperspective, inclusive, and 14comprehensive understanding of history. Rather than requiring 15each school to be responsible for the research, study, and 16investigation necessary to develop alternative or revised 17instructional standards for the teaching of history, 18instructional guidelines and standards should be provided to 19schools statewide so that each school may develop the 20alternative curricula it needs to replace traditional course 21material and instruction.22    (b) The Inclusive History Commission is created to (i) 23address the deficiencies and inadequacies in both perspective 24and content in traditional course material and instruction and 25(ii) develop multiperspective, inclusive, and comprehensive 26standards that a school may use as a guide in replacing or   HB2927- 3 -LRB104 03391 LNS 13413 b1developing its curricula for history education.  2    Section 10.
