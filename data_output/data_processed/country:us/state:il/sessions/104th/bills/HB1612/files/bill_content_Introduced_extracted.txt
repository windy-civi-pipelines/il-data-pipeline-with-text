Kam Buckner SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act    Creates the Illinois Appliance Standards Act. Directs the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to adopt minimum efficiency standards for covered products. Provides for testing, certification, and labeling of covered products. Contains provisions concerning enforcement of the Act's requirements. Provides for administrative rulemaking by the Agency. Makes findings. Defines terms.LRB104 08810 BDA 18865 b  A BILL FOR HB1612LRB104 08810 BDA 18865 b1    AN ACT concerning safety. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Illinois Appliance Standards Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that:7        (1) Efficiency standards for certain products sold or 8    installed in the State assure consumers and businesses 9    that the products meet minimum efficiency performance 10    levels, thus reducing energy and water waste and saving 11    consumers and businesses money on utility bills.12        (2) Efficiency standards save energy and reduce 13    climate-changing emissions and other environmental impacts 14    associated with the production, distribution, and use of 15    electricity, natural gas, and related fuels.16        (3) Efficiency standards also save water, mitigating 17    the effects of short-term and long-term droughts and 18    helping to conserve fresh water supplies.19        (4) Utility savings resulting from more efficient 20    products benefit all consumers but are especially 21    important to low-income families, who spend a 22    disproportionate share of their income on utilities. 23    Efficiency standards also help the State and local   HB1612- 2 -LRB104 08810 BDA 18865 b1    economies because bill savings can be spent on local goods 2    and services.3        (5) Energy and water savings help reduce or delay the 4    need for expensive investments in new power plants, 5    transmission lines, and distribution system upgrades, new 6    and expanded gas pipelines, and water and sewer 7    infrastructure improvements. 8    Section 10.

Kam Buckner SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act    Creates the Illinois Appliance Standards Act. Directs the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to adopt minimum efficiency standards for covered products. Provides for testing, certification, and labeling of covered products. Contains provisions concerning enforcement of the Act's requirements. Provides for administrative rulemaking by the Agency. Makes findings. Defines terms.LRB104 08810 BDA 18865 b  A BILL FOR HB1612LRB104 08810 BDA 18865 b1    AN ACT concerning safety. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Illinois Appliance Standards Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that:7        (1) Efficiency standards for certain products sold or 8    installed in the State assure consumers and businesses 9    that the products meet minimum efficiency performance 10    levels, thus reducing energy and water waste and saving 11    consumers and businesses money on utility bills.12        (2) Efficiency standards save energy and reduce 13    climate-changing emissions and other environmental impacts 14    associated with the production, distribution, and use of 15    electricity, natural gas, and related fuels.16        (3) Efficiency standards also save water, mitigating 17    the effects of short-term and long-term droughts and 18    helping to conserve fresh water supplies.19        (4) Utility savings resulting from more efficient 20    products benefit all consumers but are especially 21    important to low-income families, who spend a 22    disproportionate share of their income on utilities. 23    Efficiency standards also help the State and local   HB1612- 2 -LRB104 08810 BDA 18865 b1    economies because bill savings can be spent on local goods 2    and services.3        (5) Energy and water savings help reduce or delay the 4    need for expensive investments in new power plants, 5    transmission lines, and distribution system upgrades, new 6    and expanded gas pipelines, and water and sewer 7    infrastructure improvements. 8    Section 10.

The Agency shall adopt rules governing the 9identification of such products and packaging, which shall be 10coordinated to the greatest practical extent with the labeling 11programs of other states and federal agencies with equivalent 12efficiency standards. The Agency shall allow the use of 13existing marks, labels, or tags, which connote compliance with 14the efficiency requirements of this Act.15    (d) The Agency shall support compliance with the 16provisions of this Act through outreach and education to 17manufacturers and affected parties who sell or install covered 18products, such as distributors, retailers and contractors.

If products so 3tested are found not to be in compliance with the minimum 4efficiency standards adopted under Section 15, the Agency 5shall:6        (1) charge the manufacturer of such product for the 7    cost of product purchase and testing; and8        (2) make information available to the Attorney General 9    and the public on products found not to be in compliance 10    with the standards. 11    (g) The Agency may cause periodic inspections to be made 12of distributors or retailers of new covered products in order 13to determine compliance with the provisions of this Act. The 14Agency shall investigate complaints received concerning 15violations of this Act.16    (h) If the Agency finds that any person has committed a 17violation of any provision of this Act, the Agency shall issue 18a warning to such person.

Any 22further violations committed by such person after this second 23violation shall be subject to a civil penalty issued by the 24Agency of not more than $500 for each violation. Each product 25offered, sold, or distributed in violation of this Act shall 26constitute a separate violation, and each day that a violation   HB1612- 26 -LRB104 08810 BDA 18865 b1occurs shall constitute a separate violation. Penalties 2assessed under this subsection are in addition to costs 3assessed under subsection (f) of this Section. The Agency 4shall adopt rules that establish procedures under this 5subsection comporting with due process and that provide for 6the review of final decisions under the Administrative Review 7Law.8    (i) If the Agency finds repeated violations have occurred, 9it shall refer the matter to the Attorney General.
