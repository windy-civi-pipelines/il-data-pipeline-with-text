Engagement and compensation of professionals. 9    (a) With court approval, a receiver may engage one or more 10attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, brokers, or 11other professionals to assist the receiver in performing a 12duty or exercising a power of the receiver. The court may 13authorize the receiver's engagement of professionals on any 14reasonable terms and conditions of employment, including on a 15retainer, on an hourly basis, on a fixed or percentage fee 16basis, on a contingent fee basis or a combination of the 17foregoing. In connection with the proposed engagement of a 18professional, the receiver shall disclose to the court:19        (1) the identity and qualifications of the 20    professional;21        (2) the scope and nature of the proposed engagement;22        (3) any potential conflict of interest; and23        (4) the proposed compensation.24    (b) A person is not disqualified from engagement under 25this Section solely because of the person's engagement by,   HB0028 Engrossed- 25 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1representation of, or other relationship with the receiver, a 2creditor, or a party. This Act does not prevent the receiver 3from serving in the receivership as an attorney, accountant, 4appraiser, auctioneer, broker, or other professional when 5authorized by law.6    (c) Subject to any procedures that the court may impose, 7the receiver or professionals engaged by the receiver under 8subsection (a) may be paid reasonable compensation for their 9services on an interim basis in the same manner as other 10expenses of administration and without the necessity of court 11approval.12    (d) Except to the extent the fees and expenses of the 13receiver or professionals engaged by the receiver under 14subsection (a) have been approved by the court, any interim 15payments of fees and expenses shall be approved in connection 16with the receiver's final report as provided in Section 23. 17The receiver or professionals seeking court approval of their 18fees and expenses shall file with the court such information 19as may be necessary for the court to determine the 20reasonableness of the requested fees and expenses. If engaged 21on an hourly basis, a receiver or professional shall file with 22the court an itemized statement of the time spent, work 23performed, and billing rate of each person that performed the 24work and an itemized list of expenses. The receiver shall pay 25the amount approved by the court.   HB0028 Engrossed- 26 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1    Section 16. Use or transfer of receivership property not 2in ordinary course of business. 3    (a) In this Section, "good faith" means honesty in fact 4and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair 5dealing.6    (b) With court approval, a receiver may use receivership 7property other than in the ordinary course of business.8    (c) With court approval, a receiver may transfer 9receivership property other than in the ordinary course of 10business by sale, lease, license, exchange, or other 11disposition. Unless the agreement of sale provides otherwise, 12a sale under this Section is free and clear of a lien of the 13person that obtained appointment of the receiver, any 14subordinate lien, and any right of redemption. However, unless 15the holder of a senior lien consents, such a sale:16        (1) is subject to the senior lien and to the rights and 17    remedies of the holder of the senior lien under law other 18    than this Act; and19        (2) does not affect the obligation secured by the 20    senior lien.21    (d) A lien on receivership property which is extinguished 22by a transfer under subsection (c) attaches to the proceeds of 23the transfer with the same validity, perfection, and priority 24the lien had on the property immediately before the transfer, 25even if the proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy all 26obligations secured by the lien.   HB0028 Engrossed- 27 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1    (e) A transfer under subsection (c) may occur by means 2other than a public auction sale. A creditor holding a valid 3lien on the property to be transferred may purchase the 4property and offset against the purchase price part or all of 5the allowed amount secured by the lien, if the creditor 6tenders funds sufficient to satisfy in full the reasonable 7expenses of transfer and the obligation secured by any senior 8lien extinguished by the transfer. 9    (f) A reversal or modification of an order approving a 10transfer under subsection (c) does not affect the validity of 11the transfer to a person that acquired the property in good 12faith or revive against the person any lien extinguished by 13the transfer, whether the person knew before the transfer of 14the request for reversal or modification, unless the court 15stayed the order before the transfer. 16    Section 17. Executory contracts. 17    (a) In this Section, "timeshare interest" means an 18interest having a duration of more than three years which 19grants its holder the right to use and occupy an 20accommodation, facility, or recreational site, whether 21improved or not, for a specific period less than a full year 22during any given year.23    (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), with 24court approval, a receiver may assume or reject an executory 25contract of the owner relating to receivership property. An   HB0028 Engrossed- 28 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1executory contract may only be assumed or rejected by court 2order. The court may condition the receiver's assumption and 3continued performance of the executory contract on terms 4appropriate under the circumstances. If the receiver does not 5obtain court approval to assume or reject the executory 6contract by the termination of receivership, the receiver is 7deemed to have rejected the executory contract. At the request 8of the non-owner party to the executory contract, a court may 9set a reasonable time after the receiver's appointment to 10assume or reject an executory contract.11    (c) A receiver's performance of an executory contract 12before court approval under subsection (b) of its assumption 13or rejection is not an assumption of the contract and does not 14preclude the receiver from seeking approval to reject the 15contract.16    (d) A provision in an executory contract which requires or 17permits a forfeiture, modification, or termination of the 18contract because of the appointment of a receiver or the 19financial condition of the owner does not affect a receiver's 20power under subsection (b) to assume the contract.21    (e) A receiver's right to possess or use receivership 22property pursuant to an executory contract terminates upon 23rejection of the contract under subsection (b). Rejection of 24an executory contract constitutes a breach of the executory 25contract effective immediately before appointment of the 26receiver. A claim for damages for rejection of the contract   HB0028 Engrossed- 29 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1shall be presented or filed in the same manner as other claims 2in the receivership no later than:3        (1) the time set for submitting a claim in the 4    receivership; or5        (2) 30 days after the court approves the rejection.6    (f) If, at the time a receiver is appointed, the owner has 7the right to assign an executory contract relating to 8receivership property under law of this State other than this 9Act, the receiver may assign the contract with court approval 10and subject to the terms of the contract.11    (g) If a receiver rejects under subsection (b) an 12executory contract for the sale of receivership property that 13is real property in possession of the purchaser or a 14real-property timeshare interest, the purchaser may:15        (1) treat the rejection as a termination of the 16    contract, and in that case the purchaser has a lien on the 17    property for the recovery of any part of the purchase 18    price the purchaser paid; or19        (2) retain the purchaser's right to possession under 20    the contract, and in that case the purchaser shall 21    continue to perform all obligations arising under the 22    contract and may offset any damages caused by 23    nonperformance of an obligation of the owner after the 24    date of the rejection, but the purchaser has no right or 25    claim against other receivership property or the receiver 26    on account of the damages.  HB0028 Engrossed- 30 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1    (h) A receiver may not reject an unexpired lease of real 2property under which the owner is the landlord if:3        (1) the tenant occupies the leased premises as the 4    tenant's primary residence;5        (2) the receiver was appointed at the request of a 6    person other than a mortgagee; or7        (3) the receiver was appointed at the request of a 8    mortgagee and:9            (A) the lease is superior to the lien of the 10        mortgage;11            (B) the tenant has an enforceable agreement with 12        the mortgagee or the holder of a senior lien under 13        which the tenant's occupancy will not be disturbed as 14        long as the tenant performs its obligations under the 15        lease;16            (C) the mortgagee has consented to the lease, 17        either in a signed record or by its failure timely to 18        object that the lease violated the mortgage; or19            (D) the terms of the lease were commercially 20        reasonable at the time the lease was agreed to and the 21        tenant did not know or have reason to know that the 22        lease violated the mortgage. 23    Section 18. Defenses and immunities of receiver. 24    (a) A receiver is entitled to all defenses and immunities 25provided by law of this State for an act or omission within the   HB0028 Engrossed- 31 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1scope of the receiver's appointment.2    (b) Approval of the court that appointed the receiver must 3be obtained before the commencement of an action or proceeding 4against the receiver or a professional engaged by the receiver 5regarding an act or omission in administering receivership 6property.7    (c) A party or party in interest may conduct discovery of 8the receiver concerning any matter relating to the receiver's 9administration of the receivership property after obtaining an 10order authorizing the discovery. 11    Section 19. Interim report of receiver. A receiver may 12file or, if ordered by the court, shall file an interim report 13that includes:14        (1) the dates covered by the interim report;15        (2) the activities of the receiver since appointment 16    or a previous report;17        (3) receipts and disbursements, including a payment 18    made or proposed to be made to a professional engaged by 19    the receiver;20        (4) receipts and dispositions of receivership 21    property;22        (5) fees and expenses of the receiver and, if not 23    filed separately, a request for approval of payment of the 24    fees and expenses; and25        (6) any other information required by the court.   HB0028 Engrossed- 32 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1    Section 20. Notice of appointment; claim against 2receivership; distribution to creditors. 3    (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a 4receiver shall give notice of appointment of the receiver to 5all creditors of the owner by:6        (1) deposit for delivery through first-class mail or 7    other commercially reasonable delivery method to the 8    last-known address of each creditor; and9        (2) such other means as directed by the court.10    (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), the 11notice required by subsection (a) must specify the date by 12which each creditor holding a claim against the owner which 13arose before appointment of the receiver must file the claim 14with the court. The date specified must be at least 60 days 15after the date of the notice under subsection (a).

At any time before entry 11of an order approving a receiver's final report, the receiver 12or other person with an interest in the receivership may file 13with the court an objection to a claim of a creditor, stating 14the basis for the objection. The court shall allow or disallow 15the claim according to the law of this State other than this 16Act. 17    (f) Upon motion of the receiver or other person with an 18interest in the receivership, the following claims may be 19estimated for purpose of allowance under this Section:20        (1) any contingent or unliquidated claims, the fixing 21    or liquidation of which would unduly delay the 22    administration of the receivership; or23        (2) any right to payment arising from a right to an 24    equitable remedy for breach of performance.25    (g) Claims subject to estimation under subsection (f) 26shall be allowed in the estimated amount as determined by the   HB0028 Engrossed- 34 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1court.2    (h) If the court concludes that receivership property is 3likely to be insufficient to satisfy claims of each creditor 4holding a perfected lien on the property, the court may order 5that:6        (1) the receiver need not give notice under subsection 7    (a) of the appointment to all creditors of the owner, but 8    only such creditors as the court directs; and9        (2) unsecured creditors need not submit claims under 10    this Section.11    (i) Subject to Section 21:12        (1) a distribution of receivership property to a 13    creditor holding a perfected lien on the property must be 14    made in accordance with the creditor's priority under law 15    of this State other than this Act;16        (2) a distribution of receivership property to a 17    creditor with an allowed unsecured claim must be made as 18    the court directs on a pro rata basis according to law of 19    this State other than this Act; and 20        (3) if all of the creditors holding claims have been 21    paid in full, any residue shall be paid to the owner. 22    Section 21.

The court may 13authorize the receiver's engagement of professionals on any 14reasonable terms and conditions of employment, including on a 15retainer, on an hourly basis, on a fixed or percentage fee 16basis, on a contingent fee basis or a combination of the 17foregoing. In connection with the proposed engagement of a 18professional, the receiver shall disclose to the court:19        (1) the identity and qualifications of the 20    professional;21        (2) the scope and nature of the proposed engagement;22        (3) any potential conflict of interest; and23        (4) the proposed compensation.24    (b) A person is not disqualified from engagement under 25this Section solely because of the person's engagement by,   HB0028 Engrossed- 25 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1representation of, or other relationship with the receiver, a 2creditor, or a party. This Act does not prevent the receiver 3from serving in the receivership as an attorney, accountant, 4appraiser, auctioneer, broker, or other professional when 5authorized by law.6    (c) Subject to any procedures that the court may impose, 7the receiver or professionals engaged by the receiver under 8subsection (a) may be paid reasonable compensation for their 9services on an interim basis in the same manner as other 10expenses of administration and without the necessity of court 11approval.12    (d) Except to the extent the fees and expenses of the 13receiver or professionals engaged by the receiver under 14subsection (a) have been approved by the court, any interim 15payments of fees and expenses shall be approved in connection 16with the receiver's final report as provided in Section 23. 17The receiver or professionals seeking court approval of their 18fees and expenses shall file with the court such information 19as may be necessary for the court to determine the 20reasonableness of the requested fees and expenses.

Use or transfer of receivership property not 2in ordinary course of business. 3    (a) In this Section, "good faith" means honesty in fact 4and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair 5dealing.6    (b) With court approval, a receiver may use receivership 7property other than in the ordinary course of business.8    (c) With court approval, a receiver may transfer 9receivership property other than in the ordinary course of 10business by sale, lease, license, exchange, or other 11disposition. Unless the agreement of sale provides otherwise, 12a sale under this Section is free and clear of a lien of the 13person that obtained appointment of the receiver, any 14subordinate lien, and any right of redemption. However, unless 15the holder of a senior lien consents, such a sale:16        (1) is subject to the senior lien and to the rights and 17    remedies of the holder of the senior lien under law other 18    than this Act; and19        (2) does not affect the obligation secured by the 20    senior lien.21    (d) A lien on receivership property which is extinguished 22by a transfer under subsection (c) attaches to the proceeds of 23the transfer with the same validity, perfection, and priority 24the lien had on the property immediately before the transfer, 25even if the proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy all 26obligations secured by the lien.   HB0028 Engrossed- 27 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1    (e) A transfer under subsection (c) may occur by means 2other than a public auction sale. A creditor holding a valid 3lien on the property to be transferred may purchase the 4property and offset against the purchase price part or all of 5the allowed amount secured by the lien, if the creditor 6tenders funds sufficient to satisfy in full the reasonable 7expenses of transfer and the obligation secured by any senior 8lien extinguished by the transfer. 9    (f) A reversal or modification of an order approving a 10transfer under subsection (c) does not affect the validity of 11the transfer to a person that acquired the property in good 12faith or revive against the person any lien extinguished by 13the transfer, whether the person knew before the transfer of 14the request for reversal or modification, unless the court 15stayed the order before the transfer. 16    Section 17. Executory contracts. 17    (a) In this Section, "timeshare interest" means an 18interest having a duration of more than three years which 19grants its holder the right to use and occupy an 20accommodation, facility, or recreational site, whether 21improved or not, for a specific period less than a full year 22during any given year.23    (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), with 24court approval, a receiver may assume or reject an executory 25contract of the owner relating to receivership property. An   HB0028 Engrossed- 28 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1executory contract may only be assumed or rejected by court 2order. The court may condition the receiver's assumption and 3continued performance of the executory contract on terms 4appropriate under the circumstances. If the receiver does not 5obtain court approval to assume or reject the executory 6contract by the termination of receivership, the receiver is 7deemed to have rejected the executory contract. At the request 8of the non-owner party to the executory contract, a court may 9set a reasonable time after the receiver's appointment to 10assume or reject an executory contract.11    (c) A receiver's performance of an executory contract 12before court approval under subsection (b) of its assumption 13or rejection is not an assumption of the contract and does not 14preclude the receiver from seeking approval to reject the 15contract.16    (d) A provision in an executory contract which requires or 17permits a forfeiture, modification, or termination of the 18contract because of the appointment of a receiver or the 19financial condition of the owner does not affect a receiver's 20power under subsection (b) to assume the contract.21    (e) A receiver's right to possess or use receivership 22property pursuant to an executory contract terminates upon 23rejection of the contract under subsection (b). Rejection of 24an executory contract constitutes a breach of the executory 25contract effective immediately before appointment of the 26receiver. A claim for damages for rejection of the contract   HB0028 Engrossed- 29 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1shall be presented or filed in the same manner as other claims 2in the receivership no later than:3        (1) the time set for submitting a claim in the 4    receivership; or5        (2) 30 days after the court approves the rejection.6    (f) If, at the time a receiver is appointed, the owner has 7the right to assign an executory contract relating to 8receivership property under law of this State other than this 9Act, the receiver may assign the contract with court approval 10and subject to the terms of the contract.11    (g) If a receiver rejects under subsection (b) an 12executory contract for the sale of receivership property that 13is real property in possession of the purchaser or a 14real-property timeshare interest, the purchaser may:15        (1) treat the rejection as a termination of the 16    contract, and in that case the purchaser has a lien on the 17    property for the recovery of any part of the purchase 18    price the purchaser paid; or19        (2) retain the purchaser's right to possession under 20    the contract, and in that case the purchaser shall 21    continue to perform all obligations arising under the 22    contract and may offset any damages caused by 23    nonperformance of an obligation of the owner after the 24    date of the rejection, but the purchaser has no right or 25    claim against other receivership property or the receiver 26    on account of the damages.  HB0028 Engrossed- 30 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1    (h) A receiver may not reject an unexpired lease of real 2property under which the owner is the landlord if:3        (1) the tenant occupies the leased premises as the 4    tenant's primary residence;5        (2) the receiver was appointed at the request of a 6    person other than a mortgagee; or7        (3) the receiver was appointed at the request of a 8    mortgagee and:9            (A) the lease is superior to the lien of the 10        mortgage;11            (B) the tenant has an enforceable agreement with 12        the mortgagee or the holder of a senior lien under 13        which the tenant's occupancy will not be disturbed as 14        long as the tenant performs its obligations under the 15        lease;16            (C) the mortgagee has consented to the lease, 17        either in a signed record or by its failure timely to 18        object that the lease violated the mortgage; or19            (D) the terms of the lease were commercially 20        reasonable at the time the lease was agreed to and the 21        tenant did not know or have reason to know that the 22        lease violated the mortgage. 23    Section 18. Defenses and immunities of receiver. 24    (a) A receiver is entitled to all defenses and immunities 25provided by law of this State for an act or omission within the   HB0028 Engrossed- 31 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1scope of the receiver's appointment.2    (b) Approval of the court that appointed the receiver must 3be obtained before the commencement of an action or proceeding 4against the receiver or a professional engaged by the receiver 5regarding an act or omission in administering receivership 6property.7    (c) A party or party in interest may conduct discovery of 8the receiver concerning any matter relating to the receiver's 9administration of the receivership property after obtaining an 10order authorizing the discovery. 11    Section 19. Interim report of receiver. A receiver may 12file or, if ordered by the court, shall file an interim report 13that includes:14        (1) the dates covered by the interim report;15        (2) the activities of the receiver since appointment 16    or a previous report;17        (3) receipts and disbursements, including a payment 18    made or proposed to be made to a professional engaged by 19    the receiver;20        (4) receipts and dispositions of receivership 21    property;22        (5) fees and expenses of the receiver and, if not 23    filed separately, a request for approval of payment of the 24    fees and expenses; and25        (6) any other information required by the court.   HB0028 Engrossed- 32 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1    Section 20. Notice of appointment; claim against 2receivership; distribution to creditors. 3    (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a 4receiver shall give notice of appointment of the receiver to 5all creditors of the owner by:6        (1) deposit for delivery through first-class mail or 7    other commercially reasonable delivery method to the 8    last-known address of each creditor; and9        (2) such other means as directed by the court.10    (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), the 11notice required by subsection (a) must specify the date by 12which each creditor holding a claim against the owner which 13arose before appointment of the receiver must file the claim 14with the court. The date specified must be at least 60 days 15after the date of the notice under subsection (a). Unless the 16court orders otherwise, a claim that is not timely filed with 17the court is not entitled to a distribution from the 18receivership.19    (c) A claim filed by a creditor under this subsection 20shall be titled "Proof of Claim" and must:21        (1) state the name and address of the creditor;22        (2) state the amount and basis of the claim;23        (3) identify any property securing the claim;24        (4) be signed by the creditor or an authorized agent 25    under penalty of perjury; and  HB0028 Engrossed- 33 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1        (5) include a copy of any record on which the claim is 2    based.3    (d) An assignment by a creditor of a claim against the 4owner or receivership is effective against the receiver only 5if the assignee gives timely notice of the assignment to the 6receiver in a signed record prior to the entry of an order 7approving a receiver's final report.8    (e) A claim filed with the court in accordance with 9subsections (b) and (c) constitutes prima facie evidence of 10the validity and amount of the claim. At any time before entry 11of an order approving a receiver's final report, the receiver 12or other person with an interest in the receivership may file 13with the court an objection to a claim of a creditor, stating 14the basis for the objection. The court shall allow or disallow 15the claim according to the law of this State other than this 16Act. 17    (f) Upon motion of the receiver or other person with an 18interest in the receivership, the following claims may be 19estimated for purpose of allowance under this Section:20        (1) any contingent or unliquidated claims, the fixing 21    or liquidation of which would unduly delay the 22    administration of the receivership; or23        (2) any right to payment arising from a right to an 24    equitable remedy for breach of performance.25    (g) Claims subject to estimation under subsection (f) 26shall be allowed in the estimated amount as determined by the   HB0028 Engrossed- 34 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1court.2    (h) If the court concludes that receivership property is 3likely to be insufficient to satisfy claims of each creditor 4holding a perfected lien on the property, the court may order 5that:6        (1) the receiver need not give notice under subsection 7    (a) of the appointment to all creditors of the owner, but 8    only such creditors as the court directs; and9        (2) unsecured creditors need not submit claims under 10    this Section.11    (i) Subject to Section 21:12        (1) a distribution of receivership property to a 13    creditor holding a perfected lien on the property must be 14    made in accordance with the creditor's priority under law 15    of this State other than this Act;16        (2) a distribution of receivership property to a 17    creditor with an allowed unsecured claim must be made as 18    the court directs on a pro rata basis according to law of 19    this State other than this Act; and 20        (3) if all of the creditors holding claims have been 21    paid in full, any residue shall be paid to the owner. 22    Section 21.
