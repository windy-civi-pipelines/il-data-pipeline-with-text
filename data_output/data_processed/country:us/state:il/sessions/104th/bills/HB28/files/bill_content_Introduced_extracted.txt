This Act does not prevent the receiver 16from serving in the receivership as an attorney, accountant, 17appraiser, auctioneer, broker, or other professional when 18authorized by law.19    (c) Subject to any procedures that the court may impose, 20the receiver or professionals engaged by the receiver under 21subsection (a) may be paid reasonable compensation for their 22services on an interim basis in the same manner as other 23expenses of administration and without the necessity of court 24approval.25    (d) Except to the extent the fees and expenses of the 26receiver or professionals engaged by the receiver under   HB0028- 26 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1subsection (a) have been approved by the court, any interim 2payments of fees and expenses shall be approved in connection 3with the receiver's final report as provided in Section 23. 4The receiver or professionals seeking court approval of their 5fees and expenses shall file with the court such information 6as may be necessary for the court to determine the 7reasonableness of the requested fees and expenses.

The receiver shall pay 12the amount approved by the court. 13    Section 16. Use or transfer of receivership property not 14in ordinary course of business. 15    (a) In this Section, "good faith" means honesty in fact 16and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair 17dealing.18    (b) With court approval, a receiver may use receivership 19property other than in the ordinary course of business.20    (c) With court approval, a receiver may transfer 21receivership property other than in the ordinary course of 22business by sale, lease, license, exchange, or other 23disposition. Unless the agreement of sale provides otherwise, 24a sale under this Section is free and clear of a lien of the 25person that obtained appointment of the receiver, any   HB0028- 27 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1subordinate lien, and any right of redemption. However, unless 2the holder of a senior lien consents, such a sale:3        (1) is subject to the senior lien and to the rights and 4    remedies of the holder of the senior lien under law other 5    than this Act; and6        (2) does not affect the obligation secured by the 7    senior lien.8    (d) A lien on receivership property which is extinguished 9by a transfer under subsection (c) attaches to the proceeds of 10the transfer with the same validity, perfection, and priority 11the lien had on the property immediately before the transfer, 12even if the proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy all 13obligations secured by the lien. 14    (e) A transfer under subsection (c) may occur by means 15other than a public auction sale. A creditor holding a valid 16lien on the property to be transferred may purchase the 17property and offset against the purchase price part or all of 18the allowed amount secured by the lien, if the creditor 19tenders funds sufficient to satisfy in full the reasonable 20expenses of transfer and the obligation secured by any senior 21lien extinguished by the transfer. 22    (f) A reversal or modification of an order approving a 23transfer under subsection (c) does not affect the validity of 24the transfer to a person that acquired the property in good 25faith or revive against the person any lien extinguished by 26the transfer, whether the person knew before the transfer of   HB0028- 28 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1the request for reversal or modification, unless the court 2stayed the order before the transfer. 3    Section 17. Executory contracts. 4    (a) In this Section, "timeshare interest" means an 5interest having a duration of more than three years which 6grants its holder the right to use and occupy an 7accommodation, facility, or recreational site, whether 8improved or not, for a specific period less than a full year 9during any given year.10    (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), with 11court approval, a receiver may assume or reject an executory 12contract of the owner relating to receivership property. An 13executory contract may only be assumed or rejected by court 14order. The court may condition the receiver's assumption and 15continued performance of the executory contract on terms 16appropriate under the circumstances. If the receiver does not 17obtain court approval to assume or reject the executory 18contract by the termination of receivership, the receiver is 19deemed to have rejected the executory contract. At the request 20of the non-owner party to the executory contract, a court may 21set a reasonable time after the receiver's appointment to 22assume or reject an executory contract.23    (c) A receiver's performance of an executory contract 24before court approval under subsection (b) of its assumption 25or rejection is not an assumption of the contract and does not   HB0028- 29 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1preclude the receiver from seeking approval to reject the 2contract.3    (d) A provision in an executory contract which requires or 4permits a forfeiture, modification, or termination of the 5contract because of the appointment of a receiver or the 6financial condition of the owner does not affect a receiver's 7power under subsection (b) to assume the contract.8    (e) A receiver's right to possess or use receivership 9property pursuant to an executory contract terminates upon 10rejection of the contract under subsection (b). Rejection of 11an executory contract constitutes a breach of the executory 12contract effective immediately before appointment of the 13receiver. A claim for damages for rejection of the contract 14shall be presented or filed in the same manner as other claims 15in the receivership no later than:16        (1) the time set for submitting a claim in the 17    receivership; or18        (2) 30 days after the court approves the rejection.19    (f) If, at the time a receiver is appointed, the owner has 20the right to assign an executory contract relating to 21receivership property under law of this State other than this 22Act, the receiver may assign the contract with court approval 23and subject to the terms of the contract.24    (g) If a receiver rejects under subsection (b) an 25executory contract for the sale of receivership property that 26is real property in possession of the purchaser or a   HB0028- 30 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1real-property timeshare interest, the purchaser may:2        (1) treat the rejection as a termination of the 3    contract, and in that case the purchaser has a lien on the 4    property for the recovery of any part of the purchase 5    price the purchaser paid; or6        (2) retain the purchaser's right to possession under 7    the contract, and in that case the purchaser shall 8    continue to perform all obligations arising under the 9    contract and may offset any damages caused by 10    nonperformance of an obligation of the owner after the 11    date of the rejection, but the purchaser has no right or 12    claim against other receivership property or the receiver 13    on account of the damages.14    (h) A receiver may not reject an unexpired lease of real 15property under which the owner is the landlord if:16        (1) the tenant occupies the leased premises as the 17    tenant's primary residence;18        (2) the receiver was appointed at the request of a 19    person other than a mortgagee; or20        (3) the receiver was appointed at the request of a 21    mortgagee and:22            (A) the lease is superior to the lien of the 23        mortgage;24            (B) the tenant has an enforceable agreement with 25        the mortgagee or the holder of a senior lien under 26        which the tenant's occupancy will not be disturbed as   HB0028- 31 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1        long as the tenant performs its obligations under the 2        lease;3            (C) the mortgagee has consented to the lease, 4        either in a signed record or by its failure timely to 5        object that the lease violated the mortgage; or6            (D) the terms of the lease were commercially 7        reasonable at the time the lease was agreed to and the 8        tenant did not know or have reason to know that the 9        lease violated the mortgage. 10    Section 18. Defenses and immunities of receiver. 11    (a) A receiver is entitled to all defenses and immunities 12provided by law of this State for an act or omission within the 13scope of the receiver's appointment.14    (b) Approval of the court that appointed the receiver must 15be obtained before the commencement of an action or proceeding 16against the receiver or a professional engaged by the receiver 17regarding an act or omission in administering receivership 18property.19    (c) A party or party in interest may conduct discovery of 20the receiver concerning any matter relating to the receiver's 21administration of the receivership property after obtaining an 22order authorizing the discovery. 23    Section 19.

Notice of appointment; claim against 15receivership; distribution to creditors. 16    (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a 17receiver shall give notice of appointment of the receiver to 18all creditors of the owner by:19        (1) deposit for delivery through first-class mail or 20    other commercially reasonable delivery method to the 21    last-known address of each creditor; and22        (2) such other means as directed by the court.23    (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), the 24notice required by subsection (a) must specify the date by 25which each creditor holding a claim against the owner which   HB0028- 33 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1arose before appointment of the receiver must file the claim 2with the court.

At any time before entry 24of an order approving a receiver's final report, the receiver 25or other person with an interest in the receivership may file 26with the court an objection to a claim of a creditor, stating   HB0028- 34 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1the basis for the objection.

Engagement and compensation of professionals. 22    (a) With court approval, a receiver may engage one or more 23attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, brokers, or 24other professionals to assist the receiver in performing a 25duty or exercising a power of the receiver. The court may   HB0028- 25 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1authorize the receiver's engagement of professionals on any 2reasonable terms and conditions of employment, including on a 3retainer, on an hourly basis, on a fixed or percentage fee 4basis, on a contingent fee basis or a combination of the 5foregoing.

This Act does not prevent the receiver 16from serving in the receivership as an attorney, accountant, 17appraiser, auctioneer, broker, or other professional when 18authorized by law.19    (c) Subject to any procedures that the court may impose, 20the receiver or professionals engaged by the receiver under 21subsection (a) may be paid reasonable compensation for their 22services on an interim basis in the same manner as other 23expenses of administration and without the necessity of court 24approval.25    (d) Except to the extent the fees and expenses of the 26receiver or professionals engaged by the receiver under   HB0028- 26 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1subsection (a) have been approved by the court, any interim 2payments of fees and expenses shall be approved in connection 3with the receiver's final report as provided in Section 23. 4The receiver or professionals seeking court approval of their 5fees and expenses shall file with the court such information 6as may be necessary for the court to determine the 7reasonableness of the requested fees and expenses.

The receiver shall pay 12the amount approved by the court. 13    Section 16. Use or transfer of receivership property not 14in ordinary course of business. 15    (a) In this Section, "good faith" means honesty in fact 16and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair 17dealing.18    (b) With court approval, a receiver may use receivership 19property other than in the ordinary course of business.20    (c) With court approval, a receiver may transfer 21receivership property other than in the ordinary course of 22business by sale, lease, license, exchange, or other 23disposition. Unless the agreement of sale provides otherwise, 24a sale under this Section is free and clear of a lien of the 25person that obtained appointment of the receiver, any   HB0028- 27 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1subordinate lien, and any right of redemption. However, unless 2the holder of a senior lien consents, such a sale:3        (1) is subject to the senior lien and to the rights and 4    remedies of the holder of the senior lien under law other 5    than this Act; and6        (2) does not affect the obligation secured by the 7    senior lien.8    (d) A lien on receivership property which is extinguished 9by a transfer under subsection (c) attaches to the proceeds of 10the transfer with the same validity, perfection, and priority 11the lien had on the property immediately before the transfer, 12even if the proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy all 13obligations secured by the lien. 14    (e) A transfer under subsection (c) may occur by means 15other than a public auction sale. A creditor holding a valid 16lien on the property to be transferred may purchase the 17property and offset against the purchase price part or all of 18the allowed amount secured by the lien, if the creditor 19tenders funds sufficient to satisfy in full the reasonable 20expenses of transfer and the obligation secured by any senior 21lien extinguished by the transfer. 22    (f) A reversal or modification of an order approving a 23transfer under subsection (c) does not affect the validity of 24the transfer to a person that acquired the property in good 25faith or revive against the person any lien extinguished by 26the transfer, whether the person knew before the transfer of   HB0028- 28 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1the request for reversal or modification, unless the court 2stayed the order before the transfer. 3    Section 17. Executory contracts. 4    (a) In this Section, "timeshare interest" means an 5interest having a duration of more than three years which 6grants its holder the right to use and occupy an 7accommodation, facility, or recreational site, whether 8improved or not, for a specific period less than a full year 9during any given year.10    (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), with 11court approval, a receiver may assume or reject an executory 12contract of the owner relating to receivership property. An 13executory contract may only be assumed or rejected by court 14order. The court may condition the receiver's assumption and 15continued performance of the executory contract on terms 16appropriate under the circumstances. If the receiver does not 17obtain court approval to assume or reject the executory 18contract by the termination of receivership, the receiver is 19deemed to have rejected the executory contract. At the request 20of the non-owner party to the executory contract, a court may 21set a reasonable time after the receiver's appointment to 22assume or reject an executory contract.23    (c) A receiver's performance of an executory contract 24before court approval under subsection (b) of its assumption 25or rejection is not an assumption of the contract and does not   HB0028- 29 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1preclude the receiver from seeking approval to reject the 2contract.3    (d) A provision in an executory contract which requires or 4permits a forfeiture, modification, or termination of the 5contract because of the appointment of a receiver or the 6financial condition of the owner does not affect a receiver's 7power under subsection (b) to assume the contract.8    (e) A receiver's right to possess or use receivership 9property pursuant to an executory contract terminates upon 10rejection of the contract under subsection (b). Rejection of 11an executory contract constitutes a breach of the executory 12contract effective immediately before appointment of the 13receiver. A claim for damages for rejection of the contract 14shall be presented or filed in the same manner as other claims 15in the receivership no later than:16        (1) the time set for submitting a claim in the 17    receivership; or18        (2) 30 days after the court approves the rejection.19    (f) If, at the time a receiver is appointed, the owner has 20the right to assign an executory contract relating to 21receivership property under law of this State other than this 22Act, the receiver may assign the contract with court approval 23and subject to the terms of the contract.24    (g) If a receiver rejects under subsection (b) an 25executory contract for the sale of receivership property that 26is real property in possession of the purchaser or a   HB0028- 30 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1real-property timeshare interest, the purchaser may:2        (1) treat the rejection as a termination of the 3    contract, and in that case the purchaser has a lien on the 4    property for the recovery of any part of the purchase 5    price the purchaser paid; or6        (2) retain the purchaser's right to possession under 7    the contract, and in that case the purchaser shall 8    continue to perform all obligations arising under the 9    contract and may offset any damages caused by 10    nonperformance of an obligation of the owner after the 11    date of the rejection, but the purchaser has no right or 12    claim against other receivership property or the receiver 13    on account of the damages.14    (h) A receiver may not reject an unexpired lease of real 15property under which the owner is the landlord if:16        (1) the tenant occupies the leased premises as the 17    tenant's primary residence;18        (2) the receiver was appointed at the request of a 19    person other than a mortgagee; or20        (3) the receiver was appointed at the request of a 21    mortgagee and:22            (A) the lease is superior to the lien of the 23        mortgage;24            (B) the tenant has an enforceable agreement with 25        the mortgagee or the holder of a senior lien under 26        which the tenant's occupancy will not be disturbed as   HB0028- 31 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1        long as the tenant performs its obligations under the 2        lease;3            (C) the mortgagee has consented to the lease, 4        either in a signed record or by its failure timely to 5        object that the lease violated the mortgage; or6            (D) the terms of the lease were commercially 7        reasonable at the time the lease was agreed to and the 8        tenant did not know or have reason to know that the 9        lease violated the mortgage. 10    Section 18. Defenses and immunities of receiver. 11    (a) A receiver is entitled to all defenses and immunities 12provided by law of this State for an act or omission within the 13scope of the receiver's appointment.14    (b) Approval of the court that appointed the receiver must 15be obtained before the commencement of an action or proceeding 16against the receiver or a professional engaged by the receiver 17regarding an act or omission in administering receivership 18property.19    (c) A party or party in interest may conduct discovery of 20the receiver concerning any matter relating to the receiver's 21administration of the receivership property after obtaining an 22order authorizing the discovery. 23    Section 19. Interim report of receiver. A receiver may 24file or, if ordered by the court, shall file an interim report   HB0028- 32 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1that includes:2        (1) the dates covered by the interim report;3        (2) the activities of the receiver since appointment 4    or a previous report;5        (3) receipts and disbursements, including a payment 6    made or proposed to be made to a professional engaged by 7    the receiver;8        (4) receipts and dispositions of receivership 9    property;10        (5) fees and expenses of the receiver and, if not 11    filed separately, a request for approval of payment of the 12    fees and expenses; and13        (6) any other information required by the court. 14    Section 20. Notice of appointment; claim against 15receivership; distribution to creditors. 16    (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a 17receiver shall give notice of appointment of the receiver to 18all creditors of the owner by:19        (1) deposit for delivery through first-class mail or 20    other commercially reasonable delivery method to the 21    last-known address of each creditor; and22        (2) such other means as directed by the court.23    (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), the 24notice required by subsection (a) must specify the date by 25which each creditor holding a claim against the owner which   HB0028- 33 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1arose before appointment of the receiver must file the claim 2with the court. The date specified must be at least 60 days 3after the date of the notice under subsection (a). Unless the 4court orders otherwise, a claim that is not timely filed with 5the court is not entitled to a distribution from the 6receivership.7    (c) A claim filed by a creditor under this subsection 8shall be titled "Proof of Claim" and must:9        (1) state the name and address of the creditor;10        (2) state the amount and basis of the claim;11        (3) identify any property securing the claim;12        (4) be signed by the creditor or an authorized agent 13    under penalty of perjury; and14        (5) include a copy of any record on which the claim is 15    based.16    (d) An assignment by a creditor of a claim against the 17owner or receivership is effective against the receiver only 18if the assignee gives timely notice of the assignment to the 19receiver in a signed record prior to the entry of an order 20approving a receiver's final report.21    (e) A claim filed with the court in accordance with 22subsections (b) and (c) constitutes prima facie evidence of 23the validity and amount of the claim. At any time before entry 24of an order approving a receiver's final report, the receiver 25or other person with an interest in the receivership may file 26with the court an objection to a claim of a creditor, stating   HB0028- 34 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1the basis for the objection. The court shall allow or disallow 2the claim according to the law of this State other than this 3Act. 4    (f) Upon motion of the receiver or other person with an 5interest in the receivership, the following claims may be 6estimated for purpose of allowance under this Section:7        (1) any contingent or unliquidated claims, the fixing 8    or liquidation of which would unduly delay the 9    administration of the receivership; or10        (2) any right to payment arising from a right to an 11    equitable remedy for breach of performance.12    (g) Claims subject to estimation under subsection (f) 13shall be allowed in the estimated amount as determined by the 14court.15    (h) If the court concludes that receivership property is 16likely to be insufficient to satisfy claims of each creditor 17holding a perfected lien on the property, the court may order 18that:19        (1) the receiver need not give notice under subsection 20    (a) of the appointment to all creditors of the owner, but 21    only such creditors as the court directs; and22        (2) unsecured creditors need not submit claims under 23    this Section.24    (i) Subject to Section 21:25        (1) a distribution of receivership property to a 26    creditor holding a perfected lien on the property must be   HB0028- 35 -LRB104 03780 JRC 13804 b1    made in accordance with the creditor's priority under law 2    of this State other than this Act;3        (2) a distribution of receivership property to a 4    creditor with an allowed unsecured claim must be made as 5    the court directs on a pro rata basis according to law of 6    this State other than this Act; and 7        (3) if all of the creditors holding claims have been 8    paid in full, any residue shall be paid to the owner. 9    Section 21.
