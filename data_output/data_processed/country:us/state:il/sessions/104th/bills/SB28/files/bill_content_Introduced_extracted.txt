Lightford SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: See Index    Amends the School Code. In a provision regarding an optional alternative evaluative dismissal process for teacher evaluations, removes the definition of and references to "student growth components". Makes the following changes in the Evaluation of Certified Employees Article: Removes the definitions of and references to "implementation date", "Race to the Top Grant", and "School Improvement Grant". Provides that, beginning July 1, 2025, each school district may incorporate the use of data and indicators on student growth as a factor in rating teaching performance into its evaluation plan for all teachers in contractual continued service and teachers not in contractual continued service (now, a school district is required to incorporate student growth data and indicators as a significant factor). Makes other changes concerning student growth. Changes the components of an evaluation plan for a teacher's performance. Makes changes concerning a principal's or assistant principal's evaluation. With respect to the types of rules the State Board of Education may adopt, removes the inclusion of rules that (i) define the term "significant" factor" for purposes of including consideration of student growth in performance ratings and (ii) establish a model evaluation plan for use by school districts in which student growth shall comprise 50% of the performance rating. Allows a school district (rather than only a school district with 500,000 or more inhabitants) to use an annual State assessment as a measure of student growth for purposes of teacher or principal evaluations. Removes and changes outdated provisions. Makes other and conforming changes.

The 21optional dismissal process set forth in this Section is an 22alternative to those set forth in Sections 24-12 and 34-85 of 23this Code. Nothing in this Section is intended to change the 24existing practices or precedents under Section 24-12 or 34-85 25of this Code, nor shall this Section be interpreted as 26implying standards and procedures that should or must be used   SB0028- 4 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1as part of a remediation that precedes a dismissal sought 2under Section 24-12 or 34-85 of this Code.3    A board may dismiss a teacher who has entered upon 4contractual continued service under this Section if the 5following are met:6        (1) the cause of dismissal is that the teacher has 7    failed to complete a remediation plan with a rating equal 8    to or better than a "Proficient" rating;9        (2) the "Unsatisfactory" performance evaluation rating 10    that preceded remediation resulted from a PERA evaluation; 11    and12        (3) the school district has complied with subsection 13    (c) of this Section.14    A school district may not, through agreement with a 15teacher or its teacher representatives, waive its right to 16dismiss a teacher under this Section.17    (c) Each school district electing to use the dismissal 18process set forth in this Section must comply with the 19pre-remediation and remediation activities and requirements 20set forth in this subsection (c).21        (1) Before a school district's first remediation 22    relating to a dismissal under this Section, the school 23    district must create and establish a list of at least 2 24    evaluators who will be available to serve as second 25    evaluators under this Section. The school district shall 26    provide its teacher representatives with an opportunity to   SB0028- 5 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    submit additional names of teacher evaluators who will be 2    available to serve as second evaluators and who will be 3    added to the list created and established by the school 4    district, provided that, unless otherwise agreed to by the 5    school district, the teacher representatives may not 6    submit more teacher evaluators for inclusion on the list 7    than the number of evaluators submitted by the school 8    district.

If the teacher 17    representatives do not submit a list of teacher evaluators 18    within 21 days after the school district's request, the 19    school district may proceed with a remediation using a 20    list that includes only the school district's selections. 21    Either the school district or the teacher representatives 22    may revise or add to their selections for the list at any 23    time with notice to the other party, subject to the 24    limitations set forth in this paragraph (1).25        (2) Before a school district's first remediation 26    relating to a dismissal under this Section, the school   SB0028- 6 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    district shall, in good faith cooperation with its teacher 2    representatives, establish a process for the selection of 3    a second evaluator from the list created pursuant to 4    paragraph (1) of this subsection (c). Such process may be 5    amended at any time in good faith cooperation with the 6    teacher representatives. If the teacher representatives 7    are given an opportunity to cooperate with the school 8    district and elect not to do so, the school district may, 9    at its discretion, establish or amend the process for 10    selection. Before the hearing officer and as part of any 11    judicial review of a dismissal under this Section, a 12    teacher may not challenge a remediation or dismissal on 13    the grounds that the process used by the school district 14    to select a second evaluator was not established in good 15    faith cooperation with its teacher representatives.16        (3) For each remediation preceding a dismissal under 17    this Section, the school district shall select a second 18    evaluator from the list of second evaluators created 19    pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection (c), using 20    the selection process established pursuant to paragraph 21    (2) of this subsection (c). The selected second evaluator 22    may not be the same individual who determined the 23    teacher's "Unsatisfactory" performance evaluation rating 24    preceding remediation, and, if the second evaluator is an 25    administrator, may not be a direct report to the 26    individual who determined the teacher's "Unsatisfactory"   SB0028- 7 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    performance evaluation rating preceding remediation. The 2    school district's authority to select a second evaluator 3    from the list of second evaluators must not be delegated 4    or limited through any agreement with the teacher 5    representatives, provided that nothing shall prohibit a 6    school district and its teacher representatives from 7    agreeing to a formal peer evaluation process as permitted 8    under Article 24A of this Code that could be used to meet 9    the requirements for the selection of second evaluators 10    under this subsection (c).11        (4) The second evaluator selected pursuant to 12    paragraph (3) of this subsection (c) must either (i) 13    conduct the mid-point and final evaluation during 14    remediation or (ii) conduct an independent assessment of 15    whether the teacher completed the remediation plan with a 16    rating equal to or better than a "Proficient" rating, 17    which independent assessment shall include, but is not 18    limited to, personal or video-recorded observations of the 19    teacher that relate to the teacher practice components of 20    the remediation plan. Nothing in this subsection (c) shall 21    be construed to limit or preclude the participation of the 22    evaluator who rated a teacher as "Unsatisfactory" in 23    remediation.24    (d) To institute a dismissal proceeding under this 25Section, the board must first provide written notice to the 26teacher within 30 days after the completion of the final   SB0028- 8 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1remediation evaluation. The notice shall comply with the 2applicable hearing requirements and, in addition, must specify 3that dismissal is sought under this Section and include a copy 4of each performance evaluation relating to the scope of the 5hearing as described in this subsection (d).6    The applicable hearing requirements shall apply to the 7teacher's request for a hearing, the selection and 8qualifications of the hearing officer, and pre-hearing and 9hearing procedures, except that all of the following must be 10met:11        (1) The hearing officer must, in addition to meeting 12    the qualifications set forth in the applicable hearing 13    requirements, have successfully completed the 14    pre-qualification program described in subsection (b) of 15    Section 24A-3 of this Code, unless the State Board of 16    Education waives this requirement to provide an adequate 17    pool of hearing officers for consideration.18        (2) The scope of the hearing must be limited as 19    follows:20            (A) The school district must demonstrate the 21        following:22                (i) that the "Unsatisfactory" performance 23            evaluation rating that preceded remediation 24            applied the teacher practice components and 25            student growth components and determined an 26            overall evaluation rating of "Unsatisfactory" in   SB0028- 9 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1            accordance with the standards and requirements of 2            the school district's evaluation plan;3                (ii) that the remediation plan complied with 4            the requirements of Section 24A-5 of this Code;5                (iii) that the teacher failed to complete the 6            remediation plan with a performance evaluation 7            rating equal to or better than a "Proficient" 8            rating, based upon a final remediation evaluation 9            meeting the applicable standards and requirements 10            of the school district's evaluation plan; and11                (iv) that if the second evaluator selected 12            pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of 13            this Section does not conduct the mid-point and 14            final evaluation and makes an independent 15            assessment that the teacher completed the 16            remediation plan with a rating equal to or better 17            than a "Proficient" rating, the school district 18            must demonstrate that the final remediation 19            evaluation is a more valid assessment of the 20            teacher's performance than the assessment made by 21            the second evaluator.22            (B) The teacher may only challenge the substantive 23        and procedural aspects of (i) the "Unsatisfactory" 24        performance evaluation rating that led to the 25        remediation, (ii) the remediation plan, and (iii) the 26        final remediation evaluation. To the extent the   SB0028- 10 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1        teacher challenges procedural aspects, including any 2        in applicable collective bargaining agreement 3        provisions, of a relevant performance evaluation 4        rating or the remediation plan, the teacher must 5        demonstrate how an alleged procedural defect 6        materially affected the teacher's ability to 7        demonstrate a level of performance necessary to avoid 8        remediation or dismissal or successfully complete the 9        remediation plan. Without any such material effect, a 10        procedural defect shall not impact the assessment by 11        the hearing officer, board, or reviewing court of the 12        validity of a performance evaluation or a remediation 13        plan.14            (C) The hearing officer shall only consider and 15        give weight to performance evaluations relevant to the 16        scope of the hearing as described in clauses (A) and 17        (B) of this subdivision (2).18        (3) Each party shall be given only 2 days to present 19    evidence and testimony relating to the scope of the 20    hearing, unless a longer period is mutually agreed to by 21    the parties or deemed necessary by the hearing officer to 22    enable a party to present adequate evidence and testimony 23    to address the scope of the hearing, including due to the 24    other party's cross-examination of the party's witnesses.25    (e) The provisions of Sections 24-12 and 34-85 pertaining 26to the decision or recommendation of the hearing officer do   SB0028- 11 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1not apply to dismissal proceedings under this Section. For any 2dismissal proceedings under this Section, the hearing officer 3shall not issue a decision, and shall issue only findings of 4fact and a recommendation, including the reasons therefor, to 5the board to either retain or dismiss the teacher and shall 6give a copy of the report to both the teacher and the 7superintendent of the school district. The hearing officer's 8findings of fact and recommendation must be issued within 30 9days from the close of the record of the hearing.10    The State Board of Education shall adopt rules regarding 11the length of the hearing officer's findings of fact and 12recommendation. If a hearing officer fails without good cause, 13specifically provided in writing to both parties and the State 14Board of Education, to render a recommendation within 30 days 15after the hearing is concluded or the record is closed, 16whichever is later, the parties may mutually agree to select a 17hearing officer pursuant to the alternative procedure, as 18provided in Section 24-12 or 34-85, to rehear the charges 19heard by the hearing officer who failed to render a 20recommendation or to review the record and render a 21recommendation. If any hearing officer fails without good 22cause, specifically provided in writing to both parties and 23the State Board of Education, to render a recommendation 24within 30 days after the hearing is concluded or the record is 25closed, whichever is later, the hearing officer shall be 26removed from the master list of hearing officers maintained by   SB0028- 12 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1the State Board of Education for not more than 24 months. The 2parties and the State Board of Education may also take such 3other actions as it deems appropriate, including recovering, 4reducing, or withholding any fees paid or to be paid to the 5hearing officer. If any hearing officer repeats such failure, 6he or she shall be permanently removed from the master list of 7hearing officers maintained by the State Board of Education.8    (f) The board, within 45 days after receipt of the hearing 9officer's findings of fact and recommendation, shall decide, 10through adoption of a written order, whether the teacher must 11be dismissed from its employ or retained, provided that only 12PERA-trained board members may participate in the vote with 13respect to the decision.14    If the board dismisses the teacher notwithstanding the 15hearing officer's recommendation of retention, the board shall 16make a conclusion, giving its reasons therefor, and such 17conclusion and reasons must be included in its written order. 18The failure of the board to strictly adhere to the timelines 19contained in this Section does not render it without 20jurisdiction to dismiss the teacher. The board shall not lose 21jurisdiction to discharge the teacher if the hearing officer 22fails to render a recommendation within the time specified in 23this Section. The decision of the board is final, unless 24reviewed as provided in subsection (g) of this Section.25    If the board retains the teacher, the board shall enter a 26written order stating the amount of back pay and lost   SB0028- 13 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1benefits, less mitigation, to be paid to the teacher, within 245 days of its retention order.3    (g) A teacher dismissed under this Section may apply for 4and obtain judicial review of a decision of the board in 5accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Review 6Law, except as follows:7        (1) for a teacher dismissed by a school district 8    having 500,000 inhabitants or more, such judicial review 9    must be taken directly to the appellate court of the 10    judicial district in which the board maintains its primary 11    administrative office, and any direct appeal to the 12    appellate court must be filed within 35 days from the date 13    that a copy of the decision sought to be reviewed was 14    served upon the teacher;15        (2) for a teacher dismissed by a school district 16    having less than 500,000 inhabitants after the hearing 17    officer recommended dismissal, such judicial review must 18    be taken directly to the appellate court of the judicial 19    district in which the board maintains its primary 20    administrative office, and any direct appeal to the 21    appellate court must be filed within 35 days from the date 22    that a copy of the decision sought to be reviewed was 23    served upon the teacher; and24        (3) for all school districts, if the hearing officer 25    recommended dismissal, the decision of the board may be 26    reversed only if it is found to be arbitrary, capricious,   SB0028- 14 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with law.2    In the event judicial review is instituted by a teacher, 3any costs of preparing and filing the record of proceedings 4must be paid by the teacher. If a decision of the board is 5adjudicated upon judicial review in favor of the teacher, then 6the court shall remand the matter to the board with direction 7for entry of an order setting the amount of back pay, lost 8benefits, and costs, less mitigation.

This Section does 14not apply to teachers assigned to schools identified in an 15agreement entered into between the board of a school district 16operating under Article 34 of this Code and the exclusive 17representative of the district's teachers in accordance with 18Section 34-85c of this Code. 19    Each school district to which this Article applies shall 20establish a teacher evaluation plan which ensures that each 21teacher in contractual continued service is evaluated at least 22once in the course of every 2 or 3 school years as provided in 23this Section.24    Each school district shall establish a teacher evaluation 25plan that ensures that:  SB0028- 20 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1        (1) each teacher not in contractual continued service 2    is evaluated at least once every school year; and3        (2) except as otherwise provided in this Section, each 4    teacher in contractual continued service is evaluated at 5    least once in the course of every 2 school years. However, 6    any teacher in contractual continued service whose 7    performance is rated as either "needs improvement" or 8    "unsatisfactory" must be evaluated at least once in the 9    school year following the receipt of such rating.10    No later than September 1, 2022, each school district must 11establish a teacher evaluation plan that ensures that each 12teacher in contractual continued service whose performance is 13rated as either "excellent" or "proficient" is evaluated at 14least once in the course of the 3 school years after receipt of 15the rating and implement an informal teacher observation plan 16established by agency rule and by agreement of the joint 17committee established under subsection (b) of Section 24A-4 of 18this Code that ensures that each teacher in contractual 19continued service whose performance is rated as either 20"excellent" or "proficient" is informally observed at least 21once in the course of the 2 school years after receipt of the 22rating. 23    For the 2022-2023 school year only, if the Governor has 24declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant 25to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, 26a school district may waive the evaluation requirement of all   SB0028- 21 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1teachers in contractual continued service whose performances 2were rated as either "excellent" or "proficient" during the 3last school year in which the teachers were evaluated under 4this Section.5    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6or any other Section of this Code, a principal shall not be 7prohibited from evaluating any teachers within a school during 8his or her first year as principal of such school. If a 9first-year principal exercises this option in a school 10district where the evaluation plan provides for a teacher in 11contractual continued service to be evaluated once in the 12course of every 2 or 3 school years, as applicable, then a new 132-year or 3-year evaluation plan must be established. 14    The evaluation plan shall comply with the requirements of 15this Section and of any rules adopted by the State Board of 16Education pursuant to this Section.17    The plan shall include a description of each teacher's 18duties and responsibilities and of the standards to which that 19teacher is expected to conform, and shall include at least the 20following components:21        (a) personal observation of the teacher in the 22    classroom by the evaluator, unless the teacher has no 23    classroom duties.24        (b) consideration of the teacher's attendance, 25    planning, instructional methods, classroom management, 26    where relevant, and competency in the subject matter   SB0028- 22 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    taught.2        (c) (blank). by no later than the applicable 3    implementation date, consideration of student growth as a 4    significant factor in the rating of the teacher's 5    performance.6        (d) (blank). prior to September 1, 2012, rating of the 7    performance of teachers in contractual continued service 8    as either: 9            (i) "excellent", "satisfactory" or 10        "unsatisfactory"; or11            (ii) "excellent", "proficient", "needs 12        improvement" or "unsatisfactory".13        (e) on and after September 1, 2012, rating of the 14    performance of all teachers as "excellent", "proficient", 15    "needs improvement" or "unsatisfactory".16        (f) specification as to the teacher's strengths and 17    weaknesses, with supporting reasons for the comments made.18        (g) inclusion of a copy of the evaluation in the 19    teacher's personnel file and provision of a copy to the 20    teacher.21        (h) within 30 school days after the completion of an 22    evaluation rating a teacher in contractual continued 23    service as "needs improvement", development by the 24    evaluator, in consultation with the teacher, and taking 25    into account the teacher's ongoing on-going professional 26    responsibilities including his or her regular teaching   SB0028- 23 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    assignments, of a professional development plan directed 2    to the areas that need improvement and any supports that 3    the district will provide to address the areas identified 4    as needing improvement.5        (i) within 30 school days after completion of an 6    evaluation rating a teacher in contractual continued 7    service as "unsatisfactory", development and commencement 8    by the district of a remediation plan designed to correct 9    deficiencies cited, provided the deficiencies are deemed 10    remediable. In all school districts the remediation plan 11    for unsatisfactory, tenured teachers shall provide for 90 12    school days of remediation within the classroom, unless an 13    applicable collective bargaining agreement provides for a 14    shorter duration. In all school districts evaluations 15    issued pursuant to this Section shall be issued within 10 16    days after the conclusion of the respective remediation 17    plan. However, the school board or other governing 18    authority of the district shall not lose jurisdiction to 19    discharge a teacher in the event the evaluation is not 20    issued within 10 days after the conclusion of the 21    respective remediation plan.22        (j) participation in the remediation plan by the 23    teacher in contractual continued service rated 24    "unsatisfactory", an evaluator and a consulting teacher 25    selected by the evaluator of the teacher who was rated 26    "unsatisfactory", which consulting teacher is an   SB0028- 24 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    educational employee as defined in the Illinois 2    Educational Labor Relations Act, has at least 5 years' 3    teaching experience, and a reasonable familiarity with the 4    assignment of the teacher being evaluated, and who 5    received an "excellent" rating on his or her most recent 6    evaluation. Where no teachers who meet these criteria are 7    available within the district, the district shall request 8    and the applicable regional office of education shall 9    supply, to participate in the remediation process, an 10    individual who meets these criteria.11        In a district having a population of less than 500,000 12    with an exclusive bargaining agent, the bargaining agent 13    may, if it so chooses, supply a roster of qualified 14    teachers from whom the consulting teacher is to be 15    selected. That roster shall, however, contain the names of 16    at least 5 teachers, each of whom meets the criteria for 17    consulting teacher with regard to the teacher being 18    evaluated, or the names of all teachers so qualified if 19    that number is less than 5. In the event of a dispute as to 20    qualification, the State Board shall determine 21    qualification.22        (k) a mid-point and final evaluation by an evaluator 23    during and at the end of the remediation period, 24    immediately following receipt of a remediation plan 25    provided for under subsections (i) and (j) of this 26    Section. Each evaluation shall assess the teacher's   SB0028- 25 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    performance during the time period since the prior 2    evaluation; provided that the last evaluation shall also 3    include an overall evaluation of the teacher's performance 4    during the remediation period. A written copy of the 5    evaluations and ratings, in which any deficiencies in 6    performance and recommendations for correction are 7    identified, shall be provided to and discussed with the 8    teacher within 10 school days after the date of the 9    evaluation, unless an applicable collective bargaining 10    agreement provides to the contrary. These subsequent 11    evaluations shall be conducted by an evaluator. The 12    consulting teacher shall provide advice to the teacher 13    rated "unsatisfactory" on how to improve teaching skills 14    and to successfully complete the remediation plan. The 15    consulting teacher shall participate in developing the 16    remediation plan, but the final decision as to the 17    evaluation shall be done solely by the evaluator, unless 18    an applicable collective bargaining agreement provides to 19    the contrary. Evaluations at the conclusion of the 20    remediation process shall be separate and distinct from 21    the required annual evaluations of teachers and shall not 22    be subject to the guidelines and procedures relating to 23    those annual evaluations. The evaluator may but is not 24    required to use the forms provided for the annual 25    evaluation of teachers in the district's evaluation plan.26        (l) reinstatement to the evaluation schedule set forth   SB0028- 26 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    in the district's evaluation plan for any teacher in 2    contractual continued service who achieves a rating equal 3    to or better than "satisfactory" or "proficient" in the 4    school year following a rating of "needs improvement" or 5    "unsatisfactory".6        (m) dismissal in accordance with subsection (d) of 7    Section 24-12 or Section 24-16.5 or 34-85 of this Code of 8    any teacher who fails to complete any applicable 9    remediation plan with a rating equal to or better than a 10    "satisfactory" or "proficient" rating. Districts and 11    teachers subject to dismissal hearings are precluded from 12    compelling the testimony of consulting teachers at such 13    hearings under subsection (d) of Section 24-12 or Section 14    24-16.5 or 34-85 of this Code, either as to the rating 15    process or for opinions of performances by teachers under 16    remediation.17        (n) If After the implementation date of an evaluation 18    system for teachers in a district as specified in Section 19    24A-2.5 of this Code, if a teacher in contractual 20    continued service successfully completes a remediation 21    plan following a rating of "unsatisfactory" in an overall 22    performance evaluation received after the foregoing 23    implementation date and receives a subsequent rating of 24    "unsatisfactory" in any of the teacher's overall 25    performance evaluation ratings received during the 26    36-month period following the teacher's completion of the   SB0028- 27 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    remediation plan, then the school district may forgo 2    remediation and seek dismissal in accordance with 3    subsection (d) of Section 24-12 or Section 34-85 of this 4    Code. 5        (o) Teachers who are due to be evaluated in the last 6    year before they are set to retire shall be offered the 7    opportunity to waive their evaluation and to retain their 8    most recent rating, unless the teacher was last rated as 9    "needs improvement" or "unsatisfactory". The school 10    district may still reserve the right to evaluate a teacher 11    provided the district gives notice to the teacher at least 12    14 days before the evaluation and a reason for evaluating 13    the teacher. 14    Nothing in this Section or Section 24A-4 shall be 15construed as preventing immediate dismissal of a teacher for 16deficiencies which are deemed irremediable or for actions 17which are injurious to or endanger the health or person of 18students in the classroom or school, or preventing the 19dismissal or non-renewal of teachers not in contractual 20continued service for any reason not prohibited by applicable 21employment, labor, and civil rights laws. Failure to strictly 22comply with the time requirements contained in Section 24A-5 23shall not invalidate the results of the remediation plan.24    Nothing contained in Public Act 98-648 repeals, 25supersedes, invalidates, or nullifies final decisions in 26lawsuits pending on July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public   SB0028- 28 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1Act 98-648) in Illinois courts involving the interpretation of 2Public Act 97-8. 3    If the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public 4health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois 5Emergency Management Agency Act that suspends in-person 6instruction, the timelines in this Section connected to the 7commencement and completion of any remediation plan are 8waived. Except if the parties mutually agree otherwise and the 9agreement is in writing, any remediation plan that had been in 10place for more than 45 days prior to the suspension of 11in-person instruction shall resume when in-person instruction 12resumes and any remediation plan that had been in place for 13fewer than 45 days prior to the suspension of in-person 14instruction shall be discontinued and a new remediation period 15shall begin when in-person instruction resumes.

Lightford SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: See Index    Amends the School Code. In a provision regarding an optional alternative evaluative dismissal process for teacher evaluations, removes the definition of and references to "student growth components". Makes the following changes in the Evaluation of Certified Employees Article: Removes the definitions of and references to "implementation date", "Race to the Top Grant", and "School Improvement Grant". Provides that, beginning July 1, 2025, each school district may incorporate the use of data and indicators on student growth as a factor in rating teaching performance into its evaluation plan for all teachers in contractual continued service and teachers not in contractual continued service (now, a school district is required to incorporate student growth data and indicators as a significant factor). Makes other changes concerning student growth. Changes the components of an evaluation plan for a teacher's performance. Makes changes concerning a principal's or assistant principal's evaluation. With respect to the types of rules the State Board of Education may adopt, removes the inclusion of rules that (i) define the term "significant" factor" for purposes of including consideration of student growth in performance ratings and (ii) establish a model evaluation plan for use by school districts in which student growth shall comprise 50% of the performance rating. Allows a school district (rather than only a school district with 500,000 or more inhabitants) to use an annual State assessment as a measure of student growth for purposes of teacher or principal evaluations. Removes and changes outdated provisions. Makes other and conforming changes.

The school district shall 26    provide its teacher representatives with an opportunity to   SB0028- 5 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    submit additional names of teacher evaluators who will be 2    available to serve as second evaluators and who will be 3    added to the list created and established by the school 4    district, provided that, unless otherwise agreed to by the 5    school district, the teacher representatives may not 6    submit more teacher evaluators for inclusion on the list 7    than the number of evaluators submitted by the school 8    district.

If the teacher representatives 7    are given an opportunity to cooperate with the school 8    district and elect not to do so, the school district may, 9    at its discretion, establish or amend the process for 10    selection. Before the hearing officer and as part of any 11    judicial review of a dismissal under this Section, a 12    teacher may not challenge a remediation or dismissal on 13    the grounds that the process used by the school district 14    to select a second evaluator was not established in good 15    faith cooperation with its teacher representatives.16        (3) For each remediation preceding a dismissal under 17    this Section, the school district shall select a second 18    evaluator from the list of second evaluators created 19    pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection (c), using 20    the selection process established pursuant to paragraph 21    (2) of this subsection (c).

The 2    school district's authority to select a second evaluator 3    from the list of second evaluators must not be delegated 4    or limited through any agreement with the teacher 5    representatives, provided that nothing shall prohibit a 6    school district and its teacher representatives from 7    agreeing to a formal peer evaluation process as permitted 8    under Article 24A of this Code that could be used to meet 9    the requirements for the selection of second evaluators 10    under this subsection (c).11        (4) The second evaluator selected pursuant to 12    paragraph (3) of this subsection (c) must either (i) 13    conduct the mid-point and final evaluation during 14    remediation or (ii) conduct an independent assessment of 15    whether the teacher completed the remediation plan with a 16    rating equal to or better than a "Proficient" rating, 17    which independent assessment shall include, but is not 18    limited to, personal or video-recorded observations of the 19    teacher that relate to the teacher practice components of 20    the remediation plan. Nothing in this subsection (c) shall 21    be construed to limit or preclude the participation of the 22    evaluator who rated a teacher as "Unsatisfactory" in 23    remediation.24    (d) To institute a dismissal proceeding under this 25Section, the board must first provide written notice to the 26teacher within 30 days after the completion of the final   SB0028- 8 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1remediation evaluation. The notice shall comply with the 2applicable hearing requirements and, in addition, must specify 3that dismissal is sought under this Section and include a copy 4of each performance evaluation relating to the scope of the 5hearing as described in this subsection (d).6    The applicable hearing requirements shall apply to the 7teacher's request for a hearing, the selection and 8qualifications of the hearing officer, and pre-hearing and 9hearing procedures, except that all of the following must be 10met:11        (1) The hearing officer must, in addition to meeting 12    the qualifications set forth in the applicable hearing 13    requirements, have successfully completed the 14    pre-qualification program described in subsection (b) of 15    Section 24A-3 of this Code, unless the State Board of 16    Education waives this requirement to provide an adequate 17    pool of hearing officers for consideration.18        (2) The scope of the hearing must be limited as 19    follows:20            (A) The school district must demonstrate the 21        following:22                (i) that the "Unsatisfactory" performance 23            evaluation rating that preceded remediation 24            applied the teacher practice components and 25            student growth components and determined an 26            overall evaluation rating of "Unsatisfactory" in   SB0028- 9 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1            accordance with the standards and requirements of 2            the school district's evaluation plan;3                (ii) that the remediation plan complied with 4            the requirements of Section 24A-5 of this Code;5                (iii) that the teacher failed to complete the 6            remediation plan with a performance evaluation 7            rating equal to or better than a "Proficient" 8            rating, based upon a final remediation evaluation 9            meeting the applicable standards and requirements 10            of the school district's evaluation plan; and11                (iv) that if the second evaluator selected 12            pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of 13            this Section does not conduct the mid-point and 14            final evaluation and makes an independent 15            assessment that the teacher completed the 16            remediation plan with a rating equal to or better 17            than a "Proficient" rating, the school district 18            must demonstrate that the final remediation 19            evaluation is a more valid assessment of the 20            teacher's performance than the assessment made by 21            the second evaluator.22            (B) The teacher may only challenge the substantive 23        and procedural aspects of (i) the "Unsatisfactory" 24        performance evaluation rating that led to the 25        remediation, (ii) the remediation plan, and (iii) the 26        final remediation evaluation. To the extent the   SB0028- 10 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1        teacher challenges procedural aspects, including any 2        in applicable collective bargaining agreement 3        provisions, of a relevant performance evaluation 4        rating or the remediation plan, the teacher must 5        demonstrate how an alleged procedural defect 6        materially affected the teacher's ability to 7        demonstrate a level of performance necessary to avoid 8        remediation or dismissal or successfully complete the 9        remediation plan. Without any such material effect, a 10        procedural defect shall not impact the assessment by 11        the hearing officer, board, or reviewing court of the 12        validity of a performance evaluation or a remediation 13        plan.14            (C) The hearing officer shall only consider and 15        give weight to performance evaluations relevant to the 16        scope of the hearing as described in clauses (A) and 17        (B) of this subdivision (2).18        (3) Each party shall be given only 2 days to present 19    evidence and testimony relating to the scope of the 20    hearing, unless a longer period is mutually agreed to by 21    the parties or deemed necessary by the hearing officer to 22    enable a party to present adequate evidence and testimony 23    to address the scope of the hearing, including due to the 24    other party's cross-examination of the party's witnesses.25    (e) The provisions of Sections 24-12 and 34-85 pertaining 26to the decision or recommendation of the hearing officer do   SB0028- 11 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1not apply to dismissal proceedings under this Section. For any 2dismissal proceedings under this Section, the hearing officer 3shall not issue a decision, and shall issue only findings of 4fact and a recommendation, including the reasons therefor, to 5the board to either retain or dismiss the teacher and shall 6give a copy of the report to both the teacher and the 7superintendent of the school district. The hearing officer's 8findings of fact and recommendation must be issued within 30 9days from the close of the record of the hearing.10    The State Board of Education shall adopt rules regarding 11the length of the hearing officer's findings of fact and 12recommendation.

If any hearing officer fails without good 22cause, specifically provided in writing to both parties and 23the State Board of Education, to render a recommendation 24within 30 days after the hearing is concluded or the record is 25closed, whichever is later, the hearing officer shall be 26removed from the master list of hearing officers maintained by   SB0028- 12 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1the State Board of Education for not more than 24 months. The 2parties and the State Board of Education may also take such 3other actions as it deems appropriate, including recovering, 4reducing, or withholding any fees paid or to be paid to the 5hearing officer. If any hearing officer repeats such failure, 6he or she shall be permanently removed from the master list of 7hearing officers maintained by the State Board of Education.8    (f) The board, within 45 days after receipt of the hearing 9officer's findings of fact and recommendation, shall decide, 10through adoption of a written order, whether the teacher must 11be dismissed from its employ or retained, provided that only 12PERA-trained board members may participate in the vote with 13respect to the decision.14    If the board dismisses the teacher notwithstanding the 15hearing officer's recommendation of retention, the board shall 16make a conclusion, giving its reasons therefor, and such 17conclusion and reasons must be included in its written order. 18The failure of the board to strictly adhere to the timelines 19contained in this Section does not render it without 20jurisdiction to dismiss the teacher. The board shall not lose 21jurisdiction to discharge the teacher if the hearing officer 22fails to render a recommendation within the time specified in 23this Section. The decision of the board is final, unless 24reviewed as provided in subsection (g) of this Section.25    If the board retains the teacher, the board shall enter a 26written order stating the amount of back pay and lost   SB0028- 13 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1benefits, less mitigation, to be paid to the teacher, within 245 days of its retention order.3    (g) A teacher dismissed under this Section may apply for 4and obtain judicial review of a decision of the board in 5accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Review 6Law, except as follows:7        (1) for a teacher dismissed by a school district 8    having 500,000 inhabitants or more, such judicial review 9    must be taken directly to the appellate court of the 10    judicial district in which the board maintains its primary 11    administrative office, and any direct appeal to the 12    appellate court must be filed within 35 days from the date 13    that a copy of the decision sought to be reviewed was 14    served upon the teacher;15        (2) for a teacher dismissed by a school district 16    having less than 500,000 inhabitants after the hearing 17    officer recommended dismissal, such judicial review must 18    be taken directly to the appellate court of the judicial 19    district in which the board maintains its primary 20    administrative office, and any direct appeal to the 21    appellate court must be filed within 35 days from the date 22    that a copy of the decision sought to be reviewed was 23    served upon the teacher; and24        (3) for all school districts, if the hearing officer 25    recommended dismissal, the decision of the board may be 26    reversed only if it is found to be arbitrary, capricious,   SB0028- 14 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with law.2    In the event judicial review is instituted by a teacher, 3any costs of preparing and filing the record of proceedings 4must be paid by the teacher. If a decision of the board is 5adjudicated upon judicial review in favor of the teacher, then 6the court shall remand the matter to the board with direction 7for entry of an order setting the amount of back pay, lost 8benefits, and costs, less mitigation. The teacher may 9challenge the board's order setting the amount of back pay, 10lost benefits, and costs, less mitigation, through an 11expedited arbitration procedure with the costs of the 12arbitrator borne by the board.13(Source: P.A. 97-8, eff. 6-13-11; 98-513, eff. 1-1-14.) 14    (105 ILCS 5/24A-2.5)15    Sec. 24A-2.5.

If, within 180 9calendar days of the committee's first meeting, the committee 10does not reach agreement on the plan, then the district shall 11implement the model evaluation plan established under Section 1224A-7 with respect to the use of data and indicators on student 13growth as a significant factor in rating teacher performance.14    Nothing in this subsection (b) shall make decisions on the 15use of data and indicators on student growth as a significant 16factor in rating teaching performance mandatory subjects of 17bargaining under the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Act 18that are not currently mandatory subjects of bargaining under 19the Act.20    The provisions of the Open Meetings Act shall not apply to 21meetings of a joint committee formed under this subsection 22(b). 23    (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsection 24(b) of this Section, if the joint committee referred to in that 25subsection does not reach agreement on the plan within 90 26calendar days after the committee's first meeting, a school   SB0028- 19 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1district having 500,000 or more inhabitants shall not be 2required to implement any aspect of the model evaluation plan 3and may implement its last best proposal. 4    (d) The Beginning the first school year following the 5effective date of this amendatory Act of the 100th General 6Assembly, the joint committee referred to in subsections 7subsection (b) and (c) of this Section shall meet no less than 8one time annually to assess and review the effectiveness of 9the district's evaluation plan for the purposes of continuous 10improvement of instruction and evaluation practices. 11(Source: P.A. 100-768, eff. 1-1-19.) 12    (105 ILCS 5/24A-5)  (from Ch. 122, par. 24A-5)13    Sec. 24A-5. Content of evaluation plans. This Section does 14not apply to teachers assigned to schools identified in an 15agreement entered into between the board of a school district 16operating under Article 34 of this Code and the exclusive 17representative of the district's teachers in accordance with 18Section 34-85c of this Code. 19    Each school district to which this Article applies shall 20establish a teacher evaluation plan which ensures that each 21teacher in contractual continued service is evaluated at least 22once in the course of every 2 or 3 school years as provided in 23this Section.24    Each school district shall establish a teacher evaluation 25plan that ensures that:  SB0028- 20 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1        (1) each teacher not in contractual continued service 2    is evaluated at least once every school year; and3        (2) except as otherwise provided in this Section, each 4    teacher in contractual continued service is evaluated at 5    least once in the course of every 2 school years. However, 6    any teacher in contractual continued service whose 7    performance is rated as either "needs improvement" or 8    "unsatisfactory" must be evaluated at least once in the 9    school year following the receipt of such rating.10    No later than September 1, 2022, each school district must 11establish a teacher evaluation plan that ensures that each 12teacher in contractual continued service whose performance is 13rated as either "excellent" or "proficient" is evaluated at 14least once in the course of the 3 school years after receipt of 15the rating and implement an informal teacher observation plan 16established by agency rule and by agreement of the joint 17committee established under subsection (b) of Section 24A-4 of 18this Code that ensures that each teacher in contractual 19continued service whose performance is rated as either 20"excellent" or "proficient" is informally observed at least 21once in the course of the 2 school years after receipt of the 22rating. 23    For the 2022-2023 school year only, if the Governor has 24declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant 25to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, 26a school district may waive the evaluation requirement of all   SB0028- 21 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1teachers in contractual continued service whose performances 2were rated as either "excellent" or "proficient" during the 3last school year in which the teachers were evaluated under 4this Section.5    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6or any other Section of this Code, a principal shall not be 7prohibited from evaluating any teachers within a school during 8his or her first year as principal of such school.

Where no teachers who meet these criteria are 7    available within the district, the district shall request 8    and the applicable regional office of education shall 9    supply, to participate in the remediation process, an 10    individual who meets these criteria.11        In a district having a population of less than 500,000 12    with an exclusive bargaining agent, the bargaining agent 13    may, if it so chooses, supply a roster of qualified 14    teachers from whom the consulting teacher is to be 15    selected. That roster shall, however, contain the names of 16    at least 5 teachers, each of whom meets the criteria for 17    consulting teacher with regard to the teacher being 18    evaluated, or the names of all teachers so qualified if 19    that number is less than 5. In the event of a dispute as to 20    qualification, the State Board shall determine 21    qualification.22        (k) a mid-point and final evaluation by an evaluator 23    during and at the end of the remediation period, 24    immediately following receipt of a remediation plan 25    provided for under subsections (i) and (j) of this 26    Section. Each evaluation shall assess the teacher's   SB0028- 25 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    performance during the time period since the prior 2    evaluation; provided that the last evaluation shall also 3    include an overall evaluation of the teacher's performance 4    during the remediation period. A written copy of the 5    evaluations and ratings, in which any deficiencies in 6    performance and recommendations for correction are 7    identified, shall be provided to and discussed with the 8    teacher within 10 school days after the date of the 9    evaluation, unless an applicable collective bargaining 10    agreement provides to the contrary. These subsequent 11    evaluations shall be conducted by an evaluator. The 12    consulting teacher shall provide advice to the teacher 13    rated "unsatisfactory" on how to improve teaching skills 14    and to successfully complete the remediation plan. The 15    consulting teacher shall participate in developing the 16    remediation plan, but the final decision as to the 17    evaluation shall be done solely by the evaluator, unless 18    an applicable collective bargaining agreement provides to 19    the contrary. Evaluations at the conclusion of the 20    remediation process shall be separate and distinct from 21    the required annual evaluations of teachers and shall not 22    be subject to the guidelines and procedures relating to 23    those annual evaluations. The evaluator may but is not 24    required to use the forms provided for the annual 25    evaluation of teachers in the district's evaluation plan.26        (l) reinstatement to the evaluation schedule set forth   SB0028- 26 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    in the district's evaluation plan for any teacher in 2    contractual continued service who achieves a rating equal 3    to or better than "satisfactory" or "proficient" in the 4    school year following a rating of "needs improvement" or 5    "unsatisfactory".6        (m) dismissal in accordance with subsection (d) of 7    Section 24-12 or Section 24-16.5 or 34-85 of this Code of 8    any teacher who fails to complete any applicable 9    remediation plan with a rating equal to or better than a 10    "satisfactory" or "proficient" rating. Districts and 11    teachers subject to dismissal hearings are precluded from 12    compelling the testimony of consulting teachers at such 13    hearings under subsection (d) of Section 24-12 or Section 14    24-16.5 or 34-85 of this Code, either as to the rating 15    process or for opinions of performances by teachers under 16    remediation.17        (n) If After the implementation date of an evaluation 18    system for teachers in a district as specified in Section 19    24A-2.5 of this Code, if a teacher in contractual 20    continued service successfully completes a remediation 21    plan following a rating of "unsatisfactory" in an overall 22    performance evaluation received after the foregoing 23    implementation date and receives a subsequent rating of 24    "unsatisfactory" in any of the teacher's overall 25    performance evaluation ratings received during the 26    36-month period following the teacher's completion of the   SB0028- 27 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1    remediation plan, then the school district may forgo 2    remediation and seek dismissal in accordance with 3    subsection (d) of Section 24-12 or Section 34-85 of this 4    Code. 5        (o) Teachers who are due to be evaluated in the last 6    year before they are set to retire shall be offered the 7    opportunity to waive their evaluation and to retain their 8    most recent rating, unless the teacher was last rated as 9    "needs improvement" or "unsatisfactory". The school 10    district may still reserve the right to evaluate a teacher 11    provided the district gives notice to the teacher at least 12    14 days before the evaluation and a reason for evaluating 13    the teacher. 14    Nothing in this Section or Section 24A-4 shall be 15construed as preventing immediate dismissal of a teacher for 16deficiencies which are deemed irremediable or for actions 17which are injurious to or endanger the health or person of 18students in the classroom or school, or preventing the 19dismissal or non-renewal of teachers not in contractual 20continued service for any reason not prohibited by applicable 21employment, labor, and civil rights laws. Failure to strictly 22comply with the time requirements contained in Section 24A-5 23shall not invalidate the results of the remediation plan.24    Nothing contained in Public Act 98-648 repeals, 25supersedes, invalidates, or nullifies final decisions in 26lawsuits pending on July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public   SB0028- 28 -LRB104 07498 LNS 17542 b1Act 98-648) in Illinois courts involving the interpretation of 2Public Act 97-8. 3    If the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public 4health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois 5Emergency Management Agency Act that suspends in-person 6instruction, the timelines in this Section connected to the 7commencement and completion of any remediation plan are 8waived. Except if the parties mutually agree otherwise and the 9agreement is in writing, any remediation plan that had been in 10place for more than 45 days prior to the suspension of 11in-person instruction shall resume when in-person instruction 12resumes and any remediation plan that had been in place for 13fewer than 45 days prior to the suspension of in-person 14instruction shall be discontinued and a new remediation period 15shall begin when in-person instruction resumes.
