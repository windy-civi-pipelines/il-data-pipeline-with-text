An agenda for each regular meeting 13shall be posted at the principal office of the public body, if 14such an office exists, and at the location where the meeting is 15to be held at least 48 hours in advance of the holding of the 16meeting. A public body that has a website that the full-time 17staff of the public body maintains shall also post on its 18website the agenda of any regular meetings of the governing 19body of that public body. Any agenda of a regular meeting that 20is posted on a public body's website shall remain posted on the 21website until the regular meeting is concluded. The 22requirement of a regular meeting agenda shall not preclude the 23consideration of items not specifically set forth in the 24agenda. Public notice of any special meeting except a meeting 25held in the event of a bona fide emergency, or of any   SB0105- 13 -LRB104 06549 BDA 16585 b1rescheduled regular meeting, or of any reconvened meeting, 2shall be given at least 48 hours before such meeting, which 3notice shall also include the agenda for the special, 4rescheduled, or reconvened meeting, but the validity of any 5action taken by the public body which is germane to a subject 6on the agenda shall not be affected by other errors or 7omissions in the agenda. The requirement of public notice of 8reconvened meetings does not apply to any case where the 9meeting was open to the public and (1) it is to be reconvened 10within 24 hours, or (2) an announcement of the time and place 11of the reconvened meeting was made at the original meeting and 12there is no change in the agenda. Notice of an emergency 13meeting shall be given as soon as practicable, but in any event 14prior to the holding of such meeting, to any news medium which 15has filed an annual request for notice under subsection (b) of 16this Section.17    (b) Public notice shall be given by posting a copy of the 18notice at the principal office of the body holding the meeting 19or, if no such office exists, at the building in which the 20meeting is to be held. In addition, a public body that has a 21website that the full-time staff of the public body maintains 22shall post notice on its website of all meetings of the 23governing body of the public body. If a public body has a 24website that is maintained by its full-time staff but does not 25have a principal office or single building where meetings are 26regularly held, that body shall be deemed to have complied   SB0105- 14 -LRB104 06549 BDA 16585 b1with the requirement to post physical notice at the office or 2building of the meeting if the notice is timely posted on that 3public body's website.

The failure of a 19public body to post on its website notice of any meeting or the 20agenda of any meeting shall not invalidate any meeting or any 21actions taken at a meeting. 22    (c) Any agenda required under this Section shall set forth 23the general subject matter of any resolution or ordinance that 24will be the subject of final action at the meeting. The public 25body conducting a public meeting shall ensure that at least 26one copy of any requested notice and agenda for the meeting is   SB0105- 15 -LRB104 06549 BDA 16585 b1continuously available for public review during the entire 248-hour period preceding the meeting. Posting of the notice 3and agenda on a website that is maintained by the public body 4satisfies the requirement for continuous posting under this 5subsection (c). If a notice or agenda is not continuously 6available for the full 48-hour period due to actions outside 7of the control of the public body, then that lack of 8availability does not invalidate any meeting or action taken 9at a meeting. 10(Source: P.A. 97-827, eff. 1-1-13.) 11    (5 ILCS 120/2.07 new)12    Sec. 2.07.
