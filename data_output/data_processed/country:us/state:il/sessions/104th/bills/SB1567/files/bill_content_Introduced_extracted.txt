Section 50-5 also contained 14        other provisions.15            (ii) In addition, Public Act 88-680 was entitled 16        "AN ACT to create a Safe Neighborhoods Law". (A) 17        Article 5 was entitled JUVENILE JUSTICE and amended 18        the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. (B) Article 15 was 19        entitled GANGS and amended various provisions of the 20        Criminal Code of 1961 and the Unified Code of 21        Corrections. (C) Article 20 was entitled ALCOHOL ABUSE 22        and amended various provisions of the Illinois Vehicle 23        Code. (D) Article 25 was entitled DRUG ABUSE and 24        amended the Cannabis Control Act and the Illinois 25        Controlled Substances Act. (E) Article 30 was entitled 26        FIREARMS and amended the Criminal Code of 1961 and the   SB1567- 14 -LRB104 07070 RLC 17107 b1        Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. (F) Article 35 2        amended the Criminal Code of 1961, the Rights of Crime 3        Victims and Witnesses Act, and the Unified Code of 4        Corrections. (G) Article 40 amended the Criminal Code 5        of 1961 to increase the penalty for compelling 6        organization membership of persons. (H) Article 45 7        created the Secure Residential Youth Care Facility 8        Licensing Act and amended the State Finance Act, the 9        Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Unified Code of 10        Corrections, and the Private Correctional Facility 11        Moratorium Act. (I) Article 50 amended the WIC Vendor 12        Management Act, the Firearm Owners Identification Card 13        Act, the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Criminal Code 14        of 1961, the Wrongs to Children Act, and the Unified 15        Code of Corrections.16            (iii) On September 22, 1998, the Third District 17        Appellate Court in People v. Dainty, 701 N.E. 2d 118, 18        ruled that Public Act 88-680 violates the single 19        subject clause of the Illinois Constitution (Article 20        IV, Section 8 (d)) and was unconstitutional in its 21        entirety. As of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 22        was prepared, People v. Dainty was still subject to 23        appeal.24            (iv) Child pornography is a vital concern to the 25        people of this State and the validity of future 26        prosecutions under the child pornography statute of   SB1567- 15 -LRB104 07070 RLC 17107 b1        the Criminal Code of 1961 is in grave doubt.2        (2) It is the purpose of this amendatory Act of 1999 to 3    prevent or minimize any problems relating to prosecutions 4    for child pornography that may result from challenges to 5    the constitutional validity of Public Act 88-680 by 6    re-enacting the Section relating to child pornography that 7    was included in Public Act 88-680.8        (3) This amendatory Act of 1999 re-enacts Section 9    11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961, as it has been 10    amended. This re-enactment is intended to remove any 11    question as to the validity or content of that Section; it 12    is not intended to supersede any other Public Act that 13    amends the text of the Section as set forth in this 14    amendatory Act of 1999. The material is shown as existing 15    text (i.e., without underscoring) because, as of the time 16    this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty 17    was subject to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.18        (4) The re-enactment by this amendatory Act of 1999 of 19    Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 relating to 20    child pornography that was amended by Public Act 88-680 is 21    not intended, and shall not be construed, to imply that 22    Public Act 88-680 is invalid or to limit or impair any 23    legal argument concerning whether those provisions were 24    substantially re-enacted by other Public Acts.25(Source: P.A. 102-567, eff. 1-1-22; 103-825, eff. 1-1-25.) 26    Section 99. Effective date. This Act takes effect upon   SB1567- 16 -LRB104 07070 RLC 17107 b1becoming law.

Section 50-5 also contained 14        other provisions.15            (ii) In addition, Public Act 88-680 was entitled 16        "AN ACT to create a Safe Neighborhoods Law". (A) 17        Article 5 was entitled JUVENILE JUSTICE and amended 18        the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. (B) Article 15 was 19        entitled GANGS and amended various provisions of the 20        Criminal Code of 1961 and the Unified Code of 21        Corrections. (C) Article 20 was entitled ALCOHOL ABUSE 22        and amended various provisions of the Illinois Vehicle 23        Code. (D) Article 25 was entitled DRUG ABUSE and 24        amended the Cannabis Control Act and the Illinois 25        Controlled Substances Act. (E) Article 30 was entitled 26        FIREARMS and amended the Criminal Code of 1961 and the   SB1567- 14 -LRB104 07070 RLC 17107 b1        Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. (F) Article 35 2        amended the Criminal Code of 1961, the Rights of Crime 3        Victims and Witnesses Act, and the Unified Code of 4        Corrections. (G) Article 40 amended the Criminal Code 5        of 1961 to increase the penalty for compelling 6        organization membership of persons. (H) Article 45 7        created the Secure Residential Youth Care Facility 8        Licensing Act and amended the State Finance Act, the 9        Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Unified Code of 10        Corrections, and the Private Correctional Facility 11        Moratorium Act. (I) Article 50 amended the WIC Vendor 12        Management Act, the Firearm Owners Identification Card 13        Act, the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Criminal Code 14        of 1961, the Wrongs to Children Act, and the Unified 15        Code of Corrections.16            (iii) On September 22, 1998, the Third District 17        Appellate Court in People v. Dainty, 701 N.E. 2d 118, 18        ruled that Public Act 88-680 violates the single 19        subject clause of the Illinois Constitution (Article 20        IV, Section 8 (d)) and was unconstitutional in its 21        entirety. As of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 22        was prepared, People v. Dainty was still subject to 23        appeal.24            (iv) Child pornography is a vital concern to the 25        people of this State and the validity of future 26        prosecutions under the child pornography statute of   SB1567- 15 -LRB104 07070 RLC 17107 b1        the Criminal Code of 1961 is in grave doubt.2        (2) It is the purpose of this amendatory Act of 1999 to 3    prevent or minimize any problems relating to prosecutions 4    for child pornography that may result from challenges to 5    the constitutional validity of Public Act 88-680 by 6    re-enacting the Section relating to child pornography that 7    was included in Public Act 88-680.8        (3) This amendatory Act of 1999 re-enacts Section 9    11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961, as it has been 10    amended. This re-enactment is intended to remove any 11    question as to the validity or content of that Section; it 12    is not intended to supersede any other Public Act that 13    amends the text of the Section as set forth in this 14    amendatory Act of 1999. The material is shown as existing 15    text (i.e., without underscoring) because, as of the time 16    this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty 17    was subject to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.18        (4) The re-enactment by this amendatory Act of 1999 of 19    Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 relating to 20    child pornography that was amended by Public Act 88-680 is 21    not intended, and shall not be construed, to imply that 22    Public Act 88-680 is invalid or to limit or impair any 23    legal argument concerning whether those provisions were 24    substantially re-enacted by other Public Acts.25(Source: P.A. 102-567, eff. 1-1-22; 103-825, eff. 1-1-25.) 26    Section 99.
