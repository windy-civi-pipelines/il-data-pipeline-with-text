The Illinois African-American Family Commission 5Act is amended by changing Sections 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 6as follows: 7    (20 ILCS 3903/1)8    Sec. 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the RISE 9Illinois African-American Family Commission Act.10(Source: P.A. 93-867, eff. 8-5-04.) 11    (20 ILCS 3903/5)12    Sec. 5. Legislative findings. It is the policy of this 13State to deliver on the promise of systemic equity by moving 14from episodic reform to permanent investment.15    Black communities and other historically disinvested 16populations in this State continue to experience stark 17disparities across health, education, employment, housing, and 18justice. These disparities are the product of deliberate 19policy choices, economic exclusion, and structural racism.20    In response, the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus enacted 21a historic legislative agenda in 2021, structured around 4 22pillars:  SB2669- 2 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1        (1) criminal justice and police reform;2        (2) education and workforce development;3        (3) economic access and opportunity; and4        (4) health care and human services.5    The State recognizes that meaningful progress requires 6long-term, coordinated, and transparent investment. The 7Commission on Reform and Investment for Systemic Equity (RISE 8Commission) is established as the permanent entity to lead 9this effort. 10It is the policy of this State to promote family preservation 11and to preserve and strengthen families.12    (a) Over 12 million people live in Illinois. 13African-Americans represent 15% of the population and 26% of 14the residents living in Cook County. Despite some progress 15over the last few decades, African-Americans in Illinois 16continue to lag behind other racial groups relative to 17indicators of well-being in education, employment, income, and 18health. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, just 26% of the 19African-American population over 25 years of age in Illinois 20completed their high school education; 6% held an associate's 21degree; less than 10% (9%) held a bachelor's degree; less than 225% (3%) held a master's degree; and less than one percent held 23either a professional (.8%) or doctoral (.4%) degree. 24    These levels of education attainment reflect more 25fundamental problems with retaining African-Americans in 26school. The Illinois State Board of Education reported that   SB2669- 3 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1for the 2001-2002 school year, 36,373, or 6%, of students 2enrolled in public high schools dropped out. Thirty-nine 3percent of these students were African-Americans; 38% were 4White; 21% were Hispanic; and 2% were classified as Other. 5    Although African-Americans make up 18% of the high school 6population, they are disproportionately represented in the 7number of students who are suspended and expelled. In the 82001-2002 school year, 29,068 students were suspended from 9school. Forty-seven percent were White, 37% were 10African-American, 14% were Hispanic, and 1% were classified as 11Other. In regards to expulsions Statewide, the total number of 12high school students expelled was 1,651. Forty-three percent 13were African-American, 41% were White, 14% were Hispanic, and 142% were classified as Other. Within Chicago public schools, 15448 students were expelled. Seventy-seven of these students 16were African-American; 27% were White; 14% were Hispanic; and 174% were classified as Other. The fact that African-Americans 18are more likely to be suspended or expelled from school also 19contributes to the high dropout rate among African-American 20high school students. 21    In addition to educational challenges, African-Americans 22face challenges in the areas of employment and income. In the 23year 2000, the unemployment rate for African-Americans age 16 24years or older was 15% compared to only 6% for the total 25Illinois population. Moreover, the median household income of 26African-Americans in Illinois was $31,699 compared to $46,590   SB2669- 4 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1for the total Illinois population, and the percentage of 2African-American families below the poverty level in Illinois 3was 26% in 1999 compared to 10.7% for the total Illinois 4population in that same year. 5    Indicators of child welfare and criminal justice reveal 6still more challenges that African-American families face in 7Illinois. In 2000, African-American children represented 18% 8of children 18 years of age and under, but comprised 73% of 9children in substitute care. African-Americans are also 10overrepresented in the criminal justice population. Of the 11total Illinois adult inmate population in the year 2000, 65% 12were African-American. During this same time period, 13African-American youth represented 58% of the juvenile inmate 14population in Illinois. 15    While the leading causes of death among African-Americans 16are the same as those for the general population in Illinois, 17African-Americans have a higher rate of death per 100,000 18residents. The rate of overall deaths per 100,000 residents 19among African-Americans in the year 2000 was 1,181; 847 for 20Whites; and 411 for those classified as Other. The rate of 21cancer-related deaths per 100,000 residents by racial or 22ethnic groups in 2000 was: 278 African-Americans; 206 Whites; 23and 110 of those classified as Other. The rate of 24diabetes-related deaths per 100,000 residents among 25African-Americans in 2000 was 41 compared to 23 for Whites and 2613 for those classified as Other. The rate of deaths per   SB2669- 5 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1100,000 residents by heart disease among African-Americans in 22000 was 352 compared to 257 for Whites and 120 for those 3classified as Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents 4by stroke among African-Americans in 2000 was 75; 60 for 5Whites; and 35 for those classified as Other. 6    African-Americans had higher rates of smoking and obesity 7than other racial groups in Illinois in 2001. 8African-Americans accounted for more of the new 9adult/adolescent AIDS cases, cumulative adult/adolescent AIDS 10cases, and number of people living with AIDS than other racial 11groups in Illinois in the year 2002. Still, 23% of uninsured 12persons in Illinois are African-American. 13    (b) The Illinois African-American Family Commission 14continues to be an essential key to promoting the preservation 15and strengthening of families. As of January 1, 2015 (the 16effective date of Public Act 98-693), just under 13 million 17people live in Illinois. African-Americans represent 15% of 18the population and 25% of the residents living in Cook County. 19Despite some progress over the last few decades, 20African-Americans in Illinois continue to lag behind other 21racial groups relative to indicators of well-being in 22education, employment, income, and health. According to the 232010 federal decennial census: just 28% of the 24African-American population over 25 years of age in Illinois 25completed their high school education; 36% had some college or 26an associate's degree; less than 12% held a bachelor's degree;   SB2669- 6 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1less than 8% held either a graduate or professional degree.2    These levels of education attainment reflect more 3fundamental problems with retaining African-Americans in 4school. The State Board of Education reported that for the 52010-2011 school year, 18,210, or 2.77%, of students enrolled 6in public high schools dropped out. 39.3% of these students 7were African-Americans; 32.6% were White; 24.2% were Hispanic; 8and 2% were classified as Other.9    Although African-Americans make up 20% of the high school 10population, they are disproportionately represented in the 11number of students who are suspended and expelled. In the 122011-2012 school year, 29,928 students were suspended from 13school. 36% were White, 34% were African-American, 26% were 14Hispanic, and 4% were classified as Other. With regard to 15expulsions statewide, the total number of high school students 16expelled was 982. 37% were African-American, 41% were White, 1721% were Hispanic, and 2% were classified as Other. Within 18Chicago public schools, 294 students were expelled. 80% of 19these students were African-American; none were White; 17% 20were Hispanic; and 3% were classified as Other. The fact that 21African-Americans are more likely to be suspended or expelled 22from school also contributes to the high dropout rate among 23African-American high school students.24    In addition to educational challenges, African-Americans 25face challenges in the areas of employment and income. In the 26year 2010, the unemployment rate for African-Americans age 16   SB2669- 7 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1years or older was 16% compared to only 9% for the total 2Illinois population. Moreover, the median household income of 3African-Americans in Illinois was $34,874 compared to $60,433 4for the total Illinois population, and the percentage of 5African-American families below the poverty level in Illinois 6was 32% in 2012 compared to 15% for the total Illinois 7population in that same year.8    Indicators of child welfare and criminal justice reveal 9still more challenges that African-American families face in 10Illinois. In 2010, African-American children represented 14% 11of children 18 years of age and under, but comprised 56% of 12children in substitute care. African-Americans are also 13overrepresented in the criminal justice population. Of the 14total Illinois adult inmate population in the year 2012, 57% 15were African-American. During this same time period, 16African-American youth represented 66% of the juvenile inmate 17population in Illinois.18    While the leading causes of death among African-Americans 19are the same as those for the general population in Illinois, 20African-Americans have a higher rate of death per 100,000 21residents. The rate of overall deaths per 100,000 residents 22among African-Americans in the year 2010 was 898; 741 for 23Whites; and 458 for those classified as Other. The rate of 24cancer-related deaths per 100,000 residents by racial or 25ethnic groups in 2010 was 216 for African-Americans; 179 for 26Whites; and 124 for those classified as Other. The rate of   SB2669- 8 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1diabetes-related deaths per 100,000 residents among 2African-Americans in 2010 was 114 compared to 66 for Whites 3and 75 for those classified as Other. The rate of deaths per 4100,000 residents by heart disease among African-Americans in 52010 was 232 compared to 179 for Whites and 121 for those 6classified as Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents 7by stroke among African-Americans in 2010 was 108; 73 for 8Whites; and 56 for those classified as Other.9    African-Americans had higher rates of smoking and obesity 10than other racial groups in Illinois in 2013. 11African-Americans accounted for more of the new 12adult/adolescent AIDS cases, cumulative adult/adolescent AIDS 13cases, and number of people living with AIDS than other racial 14groups in Illinois in the year 2013. Still, 24% of uninsured 15persons in Illinois are African-American. 16    (c) These huge disparities in education, employment, 17income, child welfare, criminal justice, and health 18demonstrate the tremendous challenges facing the 19African-American family in Illinois. These challenges are 20severe. There is a need for government, child and family 21advocates, and other key stakeholders to create and implement 22public policies to address the health and social crises facing 23African-American families. The development of given solutions 24clearly transcends any one State agency and requires a 25coordinated effort. The Illinois African-American Family 26Commission shall assist State agencies with this task.   SB2669- 9 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1    The African-American Family Commission was created in 2October 1994 by Executive Order to assist the Illinois 3Department of Children and Family Services in developing and 4implementing programs and public policies that affect the 5State's child welfare system. The Commission has a proven 6track record of bringing State agencies, community providers, 7and consumers together to address child welfare issues. The 8ability of the Commission to address the above-mentioned 9health issues, community factors, and the personal well-being 10of African-American families and children has been limited due 11to the Executive Order's focus on child welfare. It is 12apparent that broader issues of health, mental health, 13criminal justice, education, and economic development also 14directly affect the health and well-being of African-American 15families and children. Accordingly, the role of the Illinois 16African-American Family Commission is hereby expanded to 17encompass working relationships with every department, agency, 18and commission within State government if any of its 19activities impact African-American children and families. The 20focus of the Commission is hereby restructured and shall exist 21by legislative mandate to engage State agencies in its efforts 22to preserve and strengthen African-American families. 23(Source: P.A. 103-154, eff. 6-30-23.) 24    (20 ILCS 3903/10)25    Sec. 10.

The Illinois African-American Family Commission 5Act is amended by changing Sections 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 6as follows: 7    (20 ILCS 3903/1)8    Sec. 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the RISE 9Illinois African-American Family Commission Act.10(Source: P.A. 93-867, eff. 8-5-04.) 11    (20 ILCS 3903/5)12    Sec. 5. Legislative findings. It is the policy of this 13State to deliver on the promise of systemic equity by moving 14from episodic reform to permanent investment.15    Black communities and other historically disinvested 16populations in this State continue to experience stark 17disparities across health, education, employment, housing, and 18justice. These disparities are the product of deliberate 19policy choices, economic exclusion, and structural racism.20    In response, the Illinois Legislative Black Caucus enacted 21a historic legislative agenda in 2021, structured around 4 22pillars:  SB2669- 2 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1        (1) criminal justice and police reform;2        (2) education and workforce development;3        (3) economic access and opportunity; and4        (4) health care and human services.5    The State recognizes that meaningful progress requires 6long-term, coordinated, and transparent investment. The 7Commission on Reform and Investment for Systemic Equity (RISE 8Commission) is established as the permanent entity to lead 9this effort. 10It is the policy of this State to promote family preservation 11and to preserve and strengthen families.12    (a) Over 12 million people live in Illinois. 13African-Americans represent 15% of the population and 26% of 14the residents living in Cook County. Despite some progress 15over the last few decades, African-Americans in Illinois 16continue to lag behind other racial groups relative to 17indicators of well-being in education, employment, income, and 18health. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, just 26% of the 19African-American population over 25 years of age in Illinois 20completed their high school education; 6% held an associate's 21degree; less than 10% (9%) held a bachelor's degree; less than 225% (3%) held a master's degree; and less than one percent held 23either a professional (.8%) or doctoral (.4%) degree. 24    These levels of education attainment reflect more 25fundamental problems with retaining African-Americans in 26school. The Illinois State Board of Education reported that   SB2669- 3 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1for the 2001-2002 school year, 36,373, or 6%, of students 2enrolled in public high schools dropped out. Thirty-nine 3percent of these students were African-Americans; 38% were 4White; 21% were Hispanic; and 2% were classified as Other. 5    Although African-Americans make up 18% of the high school 6population, they are disproportionately represented in the 7number of students who are suspended and expelled. In the 82001-2002 school year, 29,068 students were suspended from 9school. Forty-seven percent were White, 37% were 10African-American, 14% were Hispanic, and 1% were classified as 11Other. In regards to expulsions Statewide, the total number of 12high school students expelled was 1,651. Forty-three percent 13were African-American, 41% were White, 14% were Hispanic, and 142% were classified as Other. Within Chicago public schools, 15448 students were expelled. Seventy-seven of these students 16were African-American; 27% were White; 14% were Hispanic; and 174% were classified as Other. The fact that African-Americans 18are more likely to be suspended or expelled from school also 19contributes to the high dropout rate among African-American 20high school students. 21    In addition to educational challenges, African-Americans 22face challenges in the areas of employment and income. In the 23year 2000, the unemployment rate for African-Americans age 16 24years or older was 15% compared to only 6% for the total 25Illinois population. Moreover, the median household income of 26African-Americans in Illinois was $31,699 compared to $46,590   SB2669- 4 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1for the total Illinois population, and the percentage of 2African-American families below the poverty level in Illinois 3was 26% in 1999 compared to 10.7% for the total Illinois 4population in that same year. 5    Indicators of child welfare and criminal justice reveal 6still more challenges that African-American families face in 7Illinois. In 2000, African-American children represented 18% 8of children 18 years of age and under, but comprised 73% of 9children in substitute care. African-Americans are also 10overrepresented in the criminal justice population. Of the 11total Illinois adult inmate population in the year 2000, 65% 12were African-American. During this same time period, 13African-American youth represented 58% of the juvenile inmate 14population in Illinois. 15    While the leading causes of death among African-Americans 16are the same as those for the general population in Illinois, 17African-Americans have a higher rate of death per 100,000 18residents. The rate of overall deaths per 100,000 residents 19among African-Americans in the year 2000 was 1,181; 847 for 20Whites; and 411 for those classified as Other. The rate of 21cancer-related deaths per 100,000 residents by racial or 22ethnic groups in 2000 was: 278 African-Americans; 206 Whites; 23and 110 of those classified as Other. The rate of 24diabetes-related deaths per 100,000 residents among 25African-Americans in 2000 was 41 compared to 23 for Whites and 2613 for those classified as Other. The rate of deaths per   SB2669- 5 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1100,000 residents by heart disease among African-Americans in 22000 was 352 compared to 257 for Whites and 120 for those 3classified as Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents 4by stroke among African-Americans in 2000 was 75; 60 for 5Whites; and 35 for those classified as Other. 6    African-Americans had higher rates of smoking and obesity 7than other racial groups in Illinois in 2001. 8African-Americans accounted for more of the new 9adult/adolescent AIDS cases, cumulative adult/adolescent AIDS 10cases, and number of people living with AIDS than other racial 11groups in Illinois in the year 2002. Still, 23% of uninsured 12persons in Illinois are African-American. 13    (b) The Illinois African-American Family Commission 14continues to be an essential key to promoting the preservation 15and strengthening of families. As of January 1, 2015 (the 16effective date of Public Act 98-693), just under 13 million 17people live in Illinois. African-Americans represent 15% of 18the population and 25% of the residents living in Cook County. 19Despite some progress over the last few decades, 20African-Americans in Illinois continue to lag behind other 21racial groups relative to indicators of well-being in 22education, employment, income, and health. According to the 232010 federal decennial census: just 28% of the 24African-American population over 25 years of age in Illinois 25completed their high school education; 36% had some college or 26an associate's degree; less than 12% held a bachelor's degree;   SB2669- 6 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1less than 8% held either a graduate or professional degree.2    These levels of education attainment reflect more 3fundamental problems with retaining African-Americans in 4school. The State Board of Education reported that for the 52010-2011 school year, 18,210, or 2.77%, of students enrolled 6in public high schools dropped out. 39.3% of these students 7were African-Americans; 32.6% were White; 24.2% were Hispanic; 8and 2% were classified as Other.9    Although African-Americans make up 20% of the high school 10population, they are disproportionately represented in the 11number of students who are suspended and expelled. In the 122011-2012 school year, 29,928 students were suspended from 13school. 36% were White, 34% were African-American, 26% were 14Hispanic, and 4% were classified as Other. With regard to 15expulsions statewide, the total number of high school students 16expelled was 982. 37% were African-American, 41% were White, 1721% were Hispanic, and 2% were classified as Other. Within 18Chicago public schools, 294 students were expelled. 80% of 19these students were African-American; none were White; 17% 20were Hispanic; and 3% were classified as Other. The fact that 21African-Americans are more likely to be suspended or expelled 22from school also contributes to the high dropout rate among 23African-American high school students.24    In addition to educational challenges, African-Americans 25face challenges in the areas of employment and income. In the 26year 2010, the unemployment rate for African-Americans age 16   SB2669- 7 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1years or older was 16% compared to only 9% for the total 2Illinois population. Moreover, the median household income of 3African-Americans in Illinois was $34,874 compared to $60,433 4for the total Illinois population, and the percentage of 5African-American families below the poverty level in Illinois 6was 32% in 2012 compared to 15% for the total Illinois 7population in that same year.8    Indicators of child welfare and criminal justice reveal 9still more challenges that African-American families face in 10Illinois. In 2010, African-American children represented 14% 11of children 18 years of age and under, but comprised 56% of 12children in substitute care. African-Americans are also 13overrepresented in the criminal justice population. Of the 14total Illinois adult inmate population in the year 2012, 57% 15were African-American. During this same time period, 16African-American youth represented 66% of the juvenile inmate 17population in Illinois.18    While the leading causes of death among African-Americans 19are the same as those for the general population in Illinois, 20African-Americans have a higher rate of death per 100,000 21residents. The rate of overall deaths per 100,000 residents 22among African-Americans in the year 2010 was 898; 741 for 23Whites; and 458 for those classified as Other. The rate of 24cancer-related deaths per 100,000 residents by racial or 25ethnic groups in 2010 was 216 for African-Americans; 179 for 26Whites; and 124 for those classified as Other. The rate of   SB2669- 8 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1diabetes-related deaths per 100,000 residents among 2African-Americans in 2010 was 114 compared to 66 for Whites 3and 75 for those classified as Other. The rate of deaths per 4100,000 residents by heart disease among African-Americans in 52010 was 232 compared to 179 for Whites and 121 for those 6classified as Other. The rate of deaths per 100,000 residents 7by stroke among African-Americans in 2010 was 108; 73 for 8Whites; and 56 for those classified as Other.9    African-Americans had higher rates of smoking and obesity 10than other racial groups in Illinois in 2013. 11African-Americans accounted for more of the new 12adult/adolescent AIDS cases, cumulative adult/adolescent AIDS 13cases, and number of people living with AIDS than other racial 14groups in Illinois in the year 2013. Still, 24% of uninsured 15persons in Illinois are African-American. 16    (c) These huge disparities in education, employment, 17income, child welfare, criminal justice, and health 18demonstrate the tremendous challenges facing the 19African-American family in Illinois. These challenges are 20severe. There is a need for government, child and family 21advocates, and other key stakeholders to create and implement 22public policies to address the health and social crises facing 23African-American families. The development of given solutions 24clearly transcends any one State agency and requires a 25coordinated effort. The Illinois African-American Family 26Commission shall assist State agencies with this task.   SB2669- 9 -LRB104 13912 SPS 26794 b1    The African-American Family Commission was created in 2October 1994 by Executive Order to assist the Illinois 3Department of Children and Family Services in developing and 4implementing programs and public policies that affect the 5State's child welfare system. The Commission has a proven 6track record of bringing State agencies, community providers, 7and consumers together to address child welfare issues. The 8ability of the Commission to address the above-mentioned 9health issues, community factors, and the personal well-being 10of African-American families and children has been limited due 11to the Executive Order's focus on child welfare. It is 12apparent that broader issues of health, mental health, 13criminal justice, education, and economic development also 14directly affect the health and well-being of African-American 15families and children. Accordingly, the role of the Illinois 16African-American Family Commission is hereby expanded to 17encompass working relationships with every department, agency, 18and commission within State government if any of its 19activities impact African-American children and families. The 20focus of the Commission is hereby restructured and shall exist 21by legislative mandate to engage State agencies in its efforts 22to preserve and strengthen African-American families. 23(Source: P.A. 103-154, eff. 6-30-23.) 24    (20 ILCS 3903/10)25    Sec. 10.
