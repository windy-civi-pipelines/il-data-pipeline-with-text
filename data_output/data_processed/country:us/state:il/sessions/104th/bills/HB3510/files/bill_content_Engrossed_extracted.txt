The Energy Efficient Building Act is amended by 5changing Section 55 as follows: 6    (20 ILCS 3125/55)7    Sec. 55. Illinois Stretch Energy Code.8    (a) The Board, in consultation with the Agency, shall 9create and adopt the Illinois Stretch Energy Code, to allow 10municipalities and projects authorized or funded by the Board 11to achieve more energy efficiency in buildings than the 12Illinois Energy Conservation Code through a consistent pathway 13across the State. The Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall be 14available for adoption by any municipality and shall set 15minimum energy efficiency requirements, taking the place of 16the Illinois Energy Conservation Code within any municipality 17that adopts the Illinois Stretch Energy Code.18    (b) The Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall have separate 19components for commercial and residential buildings, which may 20be adopted by the municipality jointly or separately.21    (c) The Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall apply to all 22projects to which an energy conservation code is applicable 23that are authorized or funded in any part by the Board after   HB3510 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 10624 HLH 20700 b1July 1, 2024.2    (d) Development of the Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall 3be completed and available for adoption by municipalities by 4June 30, 2024.5    (e) Consistent with the requirements under paragraph (2.5) 6of subsection (g) of Section 8-103B of the Public Utilities 7Act and under paragraph (2) of subsection (j) of Section 8-104 8of the Public Utilities Act, municipalities may adopt the 9Illinois Stretch Energy Code and may use utility programs to 10support compliance with the Illinois Stretch Energy Code. The 11amount of savings from such utility efforts that may be 12counted toward achievement of their annual savings goals shall 13be based on reasonable estimates of the increase in savings 14resulting from the utility efforts, relative to reasonable 15approximations of what would have occurred absent the utility 16involvement.17    (f) The Illinois Stretch Energy Code's residential 18components shall:19        (1) apply to residential buildings as defined under 20    Section 10;21        (2) set performance targets using a site energy index 22    with reductions relative to the 2006 International Energy 23    Conservation Code;

and11        (3) include stretch energy codes with site energy 12    index standards and adoption dates as follows: by no later 13    than June 30, 2024, the Board shall create and adopt a 14    stretch energy code with a site energy index no greater 15    than 0.60 of the 2006 International Energy Conservation 16    Code; by no later than December 31, 2026 December 31, 17    2025, the Board shall create and adopt a stretch energy 18    code with a site energy index no greater than 0.50 of the 19    2006 International Energy Conservation Code; by no later 20    than December 31, 2029 December 31, 2028, the Board shall 21    create and adopt a stretch energy code with a site energy 22    index no greater than 0.44 of the 2006 International 23    Energy Conservation Code; and by no later than December 24    31, 2032 December 31, 2031, the Board shall create and 25    adopt a stretch energy code with a site energy index no 26    greater than 0.39 of the 2006 International Energy   HB3510 Engrossed- 5 -LRB104 10624 HLH 20700 b1    Conservation Code.2    (h) The process for the creation of the Illinois Stretch 3Energy Code includes:4        (1) within 60 days after the effective date of this 5    amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, the Capital 6    Development Board shall meet with the Illinois Energy Code 7    Advisory Council to advise and provide technical 8    assistance and recommendations to the Capital Development 9    Board for the Illinois Stretch Energy Code, which shall:10            (A) advise the Capital Development Board on 11        creation of interim performance targets, code 12        requirements, and an implementation plan for the 13        Illinois Stretch Energy Code;14            (B) recommend amendments to proposed rules issued 15        by the Capital Development Board;16            (C) recommend complementary programs or policies;17            (D) complete recommendations and development for 18        the Illinois Stretch Energy Code elements and 19        requirements by December 31, 2023;20        (2) As part of its deliberations, the Illinois Energy 21    Code Advisory Council shall actively solicit input from 22    other energy code stakeholders and interested parties.23(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21;
