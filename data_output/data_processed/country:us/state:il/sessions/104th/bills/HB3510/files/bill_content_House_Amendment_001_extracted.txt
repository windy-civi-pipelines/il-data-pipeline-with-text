Illinois Stretch Energy Code.8    (a) The Board, in consultation with the Agency, shall 9create and adopt the Illinois Stretch Energy Code, to allow 10municipalities and projects authorized or funded by the Board 11to achieve more energy efficiency in buildings than the 12Illinois Energy Conservation Code through a consistent pathway 13across the State. The Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall be 14available for adoption by any municipality and shall set 15minimum energy efficiency requirements, taking the place of 16the Illinois Energy Conservation Code within any municipality   10400HB3510ham001- 2 -LRB104 10624 HLH 23835 a1that adopts the Illinois Stretch Energy Code.2    (b) The Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall have separate 3components for commercial and residential buildings, which may 4be adopted by the municipality jointly or separately.5    (c) The Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall apply to all 6projects to which an energy conservation code is applicable 7that are authorized or funded in any part by the Board after 8July 1, 2024.9    (d) Development of the Illinois Stretch Energy Code shall 10be completed and available for adoption by municipalities by 11June 30, 2024.12    (e) Consistent with the requirements under paragraph (2.5) 13of subsection (g) of Section 8-103B of the Public Utilities 14Act and under paragraph (2) of subsection (j) of Section 8-104 15of the Public Utilities Act, municipalities may adopt the 16Illinois Stretch Energy Code and may use utility programs to 17support compliance with the Illinois Stretch Energy Code. The 18amount of savings from such utility efforts that may be 19counted toward achievement of their annual savings goals shall 20be based on reasonable estimates of the increase in savings 21resulting from the utility efforts, relative to reasonable 22approximations of what would have occurred absent the utility 23involvement.24    (f) The Illinois Stretch Energy Code's residential 25components shall:26        (1) apply to residential buildings as defined under   10400HB3510ham001- 3 -LRB104 10624 HLH 23835 a1    Section 10;2        (2) set performance targets using a site energy index 3    with reductions relative to the 2006 International Energy 4    Conservation Code;
