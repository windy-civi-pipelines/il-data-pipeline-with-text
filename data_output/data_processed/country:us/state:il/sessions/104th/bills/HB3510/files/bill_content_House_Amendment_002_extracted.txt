Illinois Stretch Energy Code.8    (a) The Board, in consultation with the Agency, shall 9create and adopt the Illinois Stretch Energy Code, to allow 10municipalities and projects authorized or funded by the Board 11to achieve more energy efficiency in buildings than the 12Illinois Energy Conservation Code through a consistent pathway 13across the State.
