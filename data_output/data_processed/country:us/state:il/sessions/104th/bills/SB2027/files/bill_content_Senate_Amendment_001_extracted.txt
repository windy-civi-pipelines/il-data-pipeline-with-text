To prevent actual or 8likely multistate taxation, the tax imposed by this Act does 9not apply to the use of tangible personal property in this 10State under the following circumstances:11    (a) The use, in this State, of tangible personal property 12acquired outside this State by a nonresident individual and 13brought into this State by the individual for his or her own 14use while temporarily within this State or while passing 15through this State.16    (b) (Blank).  10400SB2027sam001- 2 -LRB104 03451 HLH 22956 a1    (c) The use, in this State, by owners or lessors, lessees, 2or shippers of tangible personal property that is utilized by 3interstate carriers for hire for use as rolling stock moving 4in interstate commerce as long as so used by the interstate 5carriers for hire, and equipment operated by a 6telecommunications provider, licensed as a common carrier by 7the Federal Communications Commission, which is permanently 8installed in or affixed to aircraft moving in interstate 9commerce.10    (d) The use, in this State, of tangible personal property 11that is acquired outside this State and caused to be brought 12into this State by a person who has already paid a tax in 13another State in respect to the sale, purchase, or use of that 14property, to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due 15and paid in the other State.16    (e) The temporary storage, in this State, of tangible 17personal property that is acquired outside this State and 18that, after being brought into this State and stored here 19temporarily, is used solely outside this State or is 20physically attached to or incorporated into other tangible 21personal property that is used solely outside this State, or 22is altered by converting, fabricating, manufacturing, 23printing, processing, or shaping, and, as altered, is used 24solely outside this State.25    (f) The temporary storage in this State of building 26materials and fixtures that are acquired either in this State   10400SB2027sam001- 3 -LRB104 03451 HLH 22956 a1or outside this State by an Illinois registered combination 2retailer and construction contractor, and that the purchaser 3thereafter uses outside this State by incorporating that 4property into real estate located outside this State.5    (g) The use or purchase of tangible personal property by a 6common carrier by rail or motor that receives the physical 7possession of the property in Illinois, and that transports 8the property, or shares with another common carrier in the 9transportation of the property, out of Illinois on a standard 10uniform bill of lading showing the seller of the property as 11the shipper or consignor of the property to a destination 12outside Illinois, for use outside Illinois.13    (h) Except as provided in subsections subsection (h-1) and 14(h-1.5), the use, in this State, of a motor vehicle that was 15sold in this State to a nonresident, even though the motor 16vehicle is delivered to the nonresident in this State, if the 17motor vehicle is not to be titled in this State, and if a 18drive-away permit is issued to the motor vehicle as provided 19in Section 3-603 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or if the 20nonresident purchaser has vehicle registration plates to 21transfer to the motor vehicle upon returning to his or her home 22state. The issuance of the drive-away permit or having the 23out-of-state registration plates to be transferred shall be 24prima facie evidence that the motor vehicle will not be titled 25in this State.26    (h-1) The exemption under subsection (h) does not apply if   10400SB2027sam001- 4 -LRB104 03451 HLH 22956 a1the state in which the motor vehicle will be titled does not 2allow a reciprocal exemption for the use in that state of a 3motor vehicle sold and delivered in that state to an Illinois 4resident but titled in Illinois. The tax collected under this 5Act on the sale of a motor vehicle in this State to a resident 6of another state that does not allow a reciprocal exemption 7shall be imposed at a rate equal to the state's rate of tax on 8taxable property in the state in which the purchaser is a 9resident, except that the tax shall not exceed the tax that 10would otherwise be imposed under this Act.

The tax collected under this Act in accordance with this 26subsection (h-1) shall be proportionately distributed as if   10400SB2027sam001- 5 -LRB104 03451 HLH 22956 a1the tax were collected at the 6.25% general rate imposed under 2this Act. 3    (h-1.5) There is a rebuttable presumption that the 4exemption under subsection (h) does not apply if the purchaser 5is a limited liability company and a member of the limited 6liability company is a resident of Illinois.

To prevent actual or 8likely multistate taxation, the tax imposed by this Act does 9not apply to the use of tangible personal property in this 10State under the following circumstances:11    (a) The use, in this State, of tangible personal property 12acquired outside this State by a nonresident individual and 13brought into this State by the individual for his or her own 14use while temporarily within this State or while passing 15through this State.16    (b) (Blank).  10400SB2027sam001- 2 -LRB104 03451 HLH 22956 a1    (c) The use, in this State, by owners or lessors, lessees, 2or shippers of tangible personal property that is utilized by 3interstate carriers for hire for use as rolling stock moving 4in interstate commerce as long as so used by the interstate 5carriers for hire, and equipment operated by a 6telecommunications provider, licensed as a common carrier by 7the Federal Communications Commission, which is permanently 8installed in or affixed to aircraft moving in interstate 9commerce.10    (d) The use, in this State, of tangible personal property 11that is acquired outside this State and caused to be brought 12into this State by a person who has already paid a tax in 13another State in respect to the sale, purchase, or use of that 14property, to the extent of the amount of the tax properly due 15and paid in the other State.16    (e) The temporary storage, in this State, of tangible 17personal property that is acquired outside this State and 18that, after being brought into this State and stored here 19temporarily, is used solely outside this State or is 20physically attached to or incorporated into other tangible 21personal property that is used solely outside this State, or 22is altered by converting, fabricating, manufacturing, 23printing, processing, or shaping, and, as altered, is used 24solely outside this State.25    (f) The temporary storage in this State of building 26materials and fixtures that are acquired either in this State   10400SB2027sam001- 3 -LRB104 03451 HLH 22956 a1or outside this State by an Illinois registered combination 2retailer and construction contractor, and that the purchaser 3thereafter uses outside this State by incorporating that 4property into real estate located outside this State.5    (g) The use or purchase of tangible personal property by a 6common carrier by rail or motor that receives the physical 7possession of the property in Illinois, and that transports 8the property, or shares with another common carrier in the 9transportation of the property, out of Illinois on a standard 10uniform bill of lading showing the seller of the property as 11the shipper or consignor of the property to a destination 12outside Illinois, for use outside Illinois.13    (h) Except as provided in subsections subsection (h-1) and 14(h-1.5), the use, in this State, of a motor vehicle that was 15sold in this State to a nonresident, even though the motor 16vehicle is delivered to the nonresident in this State, if the 17motor vehicle is not to be titled in this State, and if a 18drive-away permit is issued to the motor vehicle as provided 19in Section 3-603 of the Illinois Vehicle Code or if the 20nonresident purchaser has vehicle registration plates to 21transfer to the motor vehicle upon returning to his or her home 22state. The issuance of the drive-away permit or having the 23out-of-state registration plates to be transferred shall be 24prima facie evidence that the motor vehicle will not be titled 25in this State.26    (h-1) The exemption under subsection (h) does not apply if   10400SB2027sam001- 4 -LRB104 03451 HLH 22956 a1the state in which the motor vehicle will be titled does not 2allow a reciprocal exemption for the use in that state of a 3motor vehicle sold and delivered in that state to an Illinois 4resident but titled in Illinois. The tax collected under this 5Act on the sale of a motor vehicle in this State to a resident 6of another state that does not allow a reciprocal exemption 7shall be imposed at a rate equal to the state's rate of tax on 8taxable property in the state in which the purchaser is a 9resident, except that the tax shall not exceed the tax that 10would otherwise be imposed under this Act.

The tax collected under this Act in accordance with this 26subsection (h-1) shall be proportionately distributed as if   10400SB2027sam001- 5 -LRB104 03451 HLH 22956 a1the tax were collected at the 6.25% general rate imposed under 2this Act. 3    (h-1.5) There is a rebuttable presumption that the 4exemption under subsection (h) does not apply if the purchaser 5is a limited liability company and a member of the limited 6liability company is a resident of Illinois. This presumption 7may be rebutted by other evidence, such as evidence the motor 8vehicle is insured for primary use at an address outside of 9Illinois or evidence that the motor vehicle will be 10permanently stored or garaged at a physical address outside 11Illinois. 12    (h-2) The following exemptions apply with respect to 13certain aircraft:14        (1) Beginning on July 1, 2007, no tax is imposed under 15    this Act on the purchase of an aircraft, as defined in 16    Section 3 of the Illinois Aeronautics Act, if all of the 17    following conditions are met:18            (A) the aircraft leaves this State within 15 days 19        after the later of either the issuance of the final 20        billing for the purchase of the aircraft or the 21        authorized approval for return to service, completion 22        of the maintenance record entry, and completion of the 23        test flight and ground test for inspection, as 24        required by 14 C.F.R. 91.407;25            (B) the aircraft is not based or registered in 26        this State after the purchase of the aircraft; and  10400SB2027sam001- 6 -LRB104 03451 HLH 22956 a1            (C) the purchaser provides the Department with a 2        signed and dated certification, on a form prescribed 3        by the Department, certifying that the requirements of 4        this item (1) are met.

If no election is made 23under this subsection to use the trips or mileage method, the 24person shall be deemed to have chosen the mileage method.25    For purposes of determining qualifying trips or miles,   10400SB2027sam001- 11 -LRB104 03451 HLH 22956 a1motor vehicles that carry persons or property for hire, even 2just between points in Illinois, will be considered used for 3hire in interstate commerce if the motor vehicle transports 4persons whose journeys or property whose shipments originate 5or terminate outside Illinois.
