Failure by any licensed 9manufacturer or importing distributor to keep a satisfactory 10bond in effect with the Department or to furnish additional 11bond to the Department, when required hereunder by the 12Department to do so, shall be grounds for the revocation or 13suspension of such manufacturer's or importing distributor's 14license by the Commission. If a manufacturer or importing 15distributor fails to pay any amount due under this Article, 16his bond with the Department shall be deemed forfeited, and 17the Department may institute a suit in its own name on such 18bond.19    After notice and opportunity for a hearing the State 20Commission may revoke or suspend the license of any 21manufacturer or importing distributor who fails to comply with 22the provisions of this Section. Notice of such hearing and the 23time and place thereof shall be in writing and shall contain a 24statement of the charges against the licensee.

An order revoking or 3suspending a license under the provisions of this Section may 4be reviewed in the manner provided in Section 7-10 of this Act. 5No new license shall be granted to a person whose license has 6been revoked for a violation of this Section or, in case of 7suspension, shall such suspension be terminated until he has 8paid to the Department all taxes and penalties which he owes 9the State under the provisions of this Act.10    Every manufacturer or importing distributor who has, as 11verified by the Department, continuously complied with the 12conditions of the bond under this Act for a period of 2 years 13shall be considered to be a prior continuous compliance 14taxpayer. In determining the consecutive period of time for 15qualification as a prior continuous compliance taxpayer, any 16consecutive period of time of qualifying compliance 17immediately prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act 18of 1987 shall be credited to any manufacturer or importing 19distributor.20    A manufacturer or importing distributor that is a prior 21continuous compliance taxpayer under this Section and becomes 22a successor as the result of an acquisition, merger, or 23consolidation of a manufacturer or importing distributor shall 24be deemed to be a prior continuous compliance taxpayer with 25respect to the acquired, merged, or consolidated entity. 26    Every prior continuous compliance taxpayer shall be exempt   SB1624- 8 -LRB104 10426 RPS 20501 b1from the bond requirements of this Act until the Department 2has determined the taxpayer to be delinquent in the filing of 3any return or deficient in the payment of any tax under this 4Act. Any taxpayer who fails to pay an admitted or established 5liability under this Act may also be required to post bond or 6other acceptable security with the Department guaranteeing the 7payment of such admitted or established liability.8    The Department shall discharge any surety and shall 9release and return any bond or security deposit assigned, 10pledged or otherwise provided to it by a taxpayer under this 11Section within 30 days after: (1) such taxpayer becomes a 12prior continuous compliance taxpayer; or (2) such taxpayer has 13ceased to collect receipts on which he is required to remit tax 14to the Department, has filed a final tax return, and has paid 15to the Department an amount sufficient to discharge his 16remaining tax liability as determined by the Department under 17this Act.18(Source: P.A. 100-1171, eff. 1-4-19; 101-37, eff. 7-3-19.)
