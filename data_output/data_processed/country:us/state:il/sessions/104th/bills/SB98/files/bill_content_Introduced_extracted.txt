Such request shall be made by registered or 18certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 19the meeting.

If the board acts to expel a student, 3the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 4reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 5is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 6shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 7the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 8transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 9in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 10denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 11which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 12of students or staff in the alternative program. 13    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 14superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 15principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 16students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 17suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 18the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 19subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 20shall lie against them for such suspension.

School authorities may request 25the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 26conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking   SB0098- 10 -LRB104 03089 LNS 13107 b1lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 2controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 3illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 4searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 5If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 6evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 7the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 8such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 9disciplinary action may be taken.

The expulsion decision 6shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 7the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 8transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 9in Article 13A or 13B of this Code.
