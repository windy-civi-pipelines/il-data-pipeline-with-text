Notice shall include the deadline for such 24submission. If an owner of record claims that another party is 25obligated to pay property taxes directly to the county 26treasurer, then the owner shall send to the obligated party a   HB1827- 7 -LRB104 03520 HLH 13543 b1copy of any notice received from the chief county assessment 2officer of the obligation to submit income and expense data. 3The taxpayer or obligated party shall submit income and 4expense data to the chief county assessment officer in 5accordance with this Division for the relevant portion of the 6property for which the taxpayer or obligated party is required 7to pay the property taxes and exercises control over such 8property, identified by parcel and area. 9    The chief county assessment officer may extend the time 10within which taxpayers are required to submit income and 11expense data under this Section. 12    If the taxpayer's books and records reflecting the 13operation of the property are maintained on a calendar year 14basis, the statement of income and expense data shall be for 15the last full calendar year preceding the date that the 16statement is submitted. If the taxpayer's books and records 17reflecting the operation of the property are maintained on a 18fiscal year basis for federal income tax purposes, the 19statement of income and expense data shall be the last full 20fiscal year preceding the date when the statement is 21submitted. 22    The taxpayer or obligated party shall certify under oath 23in a signed attestation that the statements set forth in 24income and expense data submitted under this Article are true, 25accurate, and complete, to the best of his or her knowledge 26except as to matters stated to be upon information and belief   HB1827- 8 -LRB104 03520 HLH 13543 b1and, as to such matters, the taxpayer or obligated party shall 2certify that he or she believes the same to be true, accurate, 3and complete. 4    Subsections (c) through (i) of this Section shall also 5apply in counties that have adopted by ordinance or resolution 6the requirements of this Section. 7    (c) The chief county assessment officer of a county that 8is subject to this Section shall establish rules that specify 9the manner of submission of income and expense data and 10provide for the administration of the provisions of this 11Section in the county. Income and expense data shall be 12submitted in electronic form unless waived by the chief county 13assessment officer. 14    The chief county assessment officer shall maintain a copy 15of its rules for public review and shall place a copy of those 16rules and any amended rules on his or her website. 17    (d) If a taxpayer or obligated party fails to submit 18income and expense data as required under this Section or as 19required after the adoption of a county board ordinance or 20resolution under this Section, within the time prescribed, or 21within an extended period as permitted by the chief county 22assessment officer, the assessor shall send notice by 23certified mail to such taxpayer of the failure to comply.

A taxpayer or obligated party who fails 9to submit income and expense data in accordance with this 10provision shall only be required to pay a penalty on the 11portion of the property's value for which the taxpayer or 12obligated party is required to pay taxes. 13    A taxpayer or obligated party may contest the penalty and 14requirement to report income and expense data in a particular 15year and submit evidence to the chief county assessment 16officer in support of a contention that the taxpayer or 17obligated party was not required to submit income and expense 18data, that another party was required to submit income and 19expense data for such property, or that the submission of 20income and expense data complies with this requirement based 21on available documentation. The chief county assessment 22officer shall review the taxpayer or obligated party's 23submission and other submissions for the property for the tax 24year at issue, and determine whether the taxpayer or obligated 25party provided sufficient evidence that he or she was not 26required to report income and expense data or that the   HB1827- 10 -LRB104 03520 HLH 13543 b1submission complies based on available documentation. 2    If a taxpayer or obligated party is dissatisfied with a 3decision of the chief county assessment officer of the 4requirement to submit income and expense data, the taxpayer or 5obligated party may request review of that decision. Upon such 6request, at least 30 days' notice shall be provided to the 7taxpayer or obligated party of a hearing to be conducted by a 8hearing officer designated by the chief county assessment 9officer. If dissatisfied with a hearing officer's decision, 10the taxpayer or obligated party may appeal such decision to 11the circuit court of the county where the property is located 12as a final administrative decision under the Administrative 13Review Law. If a party is unsuccessful at the hearing, the 14penalty imposed under this Section shall bear interest at 150.05% per month thereafter, beginning 21 days after the date 16of decision, or 21 days after the date of the issuance of a 17final decision on administrative review. 18    The State's Attorney of the county in which the property 19is located shall have power to act on behalf of the People and 20the chief county assessment officer to enforce the provisions 21of this Section, including the power to compel by subpoena the 22production of taxpayer income and expense data that is 23required to be produced under this Section. 24    The chief county assessment officer may audit the income 25and expense data submitted by taxpayers to verify its accuracy 26by requesting documentation in support of submissions.   HB1827- 11 -LRB104 03520 HLH 13543 b1    (e) Penalty and interest collected by the chief county 2assessment officer under this Section for a taxpayer's or 3obligated party's failure to timely submit income and expense 4data shall be collected in the same manner as other fees 5collected by the chief county assessment officer.
