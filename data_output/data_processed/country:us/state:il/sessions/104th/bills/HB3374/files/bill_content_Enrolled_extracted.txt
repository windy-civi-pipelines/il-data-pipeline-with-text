The State may enter into 16contracts and may agree to pay fees to persons providing such 17arrangements, but only under circumstances where the Director 18of the Governor's Office of Management and Budget certifies 19that he or she reasonably expects the total interest paid or to 20be paid on the Bonds, together with the fees for the 21arrangements (being treated as if interest), would not, taken 22together, cause the Bonds to bear interest, calculated to 23their stated maturity, at a rate in excess of the rate that the 24Bonds would bear in the absence of such arrangements.25    The State may, with respect to Bonds issued or anticipated 26to be issued, participate in and enter into arrangements with   HB3374 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 11426 HLH 21514 b1respect to interest rate protection or exchange agreements, 2guarantees, or financial futures contracts for the purpose of 3limiting, reducing, or managing interest rate exposure.

The terms of this policy may be 24amended from time to time by the Director of the Governor's 25Office of Management and Budget but in no event shall any 26amendment cause the permitted level of the State's variable   HB3374 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 11426 HLH 21514 b1rate exposure with respect to Bonds to exceed 20%.2    (d) "Build America Bonds" in this Section means Bonds 3authorized by Section 54AA of the Internal Revenue Code of 41986, as amended ("Internal Revenue Code"), and bonds issued 5from time to time to refund or continue to refund "Build 6America Bonds".7    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, 8Qualified School Construction Bonds shall be issued and sold 9from time to time, in one or more series, in such amounts and 10at such prices as may be directed by the Governor, upon 11recommendation by the Director of the Governor's Office of 12Management and Budget.

The State may enter into 16contracts and may agree to pay fees to persons providing such 17arrangements, but only under circumstances where the Director 18of the Governor's Office of Management and Budget certifies 19that he or she reasonably expects the total interest paid or to 20be paid on the Bonds, together with the fees for the 21arrangements (being treated as if interest), would not, taken 22together, cause the Bonds to bear interest, calculated to 23their stated maturity, at a rate in excess of the rate that the 24Bonds would bear in the absence of such arrangements.25    The State may, with respect to Bonds issued or anticipated 26to be issued, participate in and enter into arrangements with   HB3374 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 11426 HLH 21514 b1respect to interest rate protection or exchange agreements, 2guarantees, or financial futures contracts for the purpose of 3limiting, reducing, or managing interest rate exposure.
