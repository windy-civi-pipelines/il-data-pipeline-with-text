All taxing districts subject to this Law are 17authorized to seek referendum approval of each proposition 18described and set forth in this Section.19    The proposition seeking to obtain referendum approval to 20levy a new tax rate as authorized in clause (i) shall be in 21substantially the following form:22        Shall ... (insert legal name, number, if any, and 23    county or counties of taxing district and geographic or 24    other common name by which a school or community college 25    district is known and referred to), Illinois, be 26    authorized to levy a new tax for ... purposes and have an   HB2896- 3 -LRB104 09215 HLH 19272 b1    additional tax of ...% of the equalized assessed value of 2    the taxable property therein extended for such purposes?3The votes must be recorded as "Yes" or "No".4    The proposition seeking to obtain referendum approval to 5increase the limiting rate as authorized in clause (ii) shall 6be in substantially the following form:7        Shall the limiting rate under the Property Tax 8    Extension Limitation Law for ... (insert legal name, 9    number, if any, and county or counties of taxing district 10    and geographic or other common name by which a school or 11    community college district is known and referred to), 12    Illinois, be increased by an additional amount equal to 13    ...% above the limiting rate for the purpose of...(insert 14    purpose) for levy year ... (insert the most recent levy 15    year for which the limiting rate of the taxing district is 16    known at the time the submission of the proposition is 17    initiated by the taxing district) and be equal to ...% of 18    the equalized assessed value of the taxable property 19    therein for levy year(s) (insert each levy year for which 20    the increase will be applicable, which years must be 21    consecutive and may not exceed 4)?22    The votes must be recorded as "Yes" or "No".23    The ballot for any proposition submitted pursuant to this 24Section shall have printed thereon, but not as a part of the 25proposition submitted, only the following supplemental 26information (which shall be supplied to the election authority   HB2896- 4 -LRB104 09215 HLH 19272 b1by the taxing district) in substantially the following form:2        (1) The approximate amount of taxes extendable at the 3    most recently extended limiting rate is $..., and the 4    approximate amount of taxes extendable if the proposition 5    is approved is $....6        (2) For the ...

(insert each levy year for which the   HB2896- 5 -LRB104 09215 HLH 19272 b1    increase will apply) will be determined by the limiting 2    rate set forth in the proposition, rather than the 3    otherwise applicable limiting rate calculated under the 4    provisions of the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law 5    (commonly known as the Property Tax Cap Law).6The approximate amount of taxes extendable shown in paragraph 7(1) shall be computed upon the last known equalized assessed 8value of taxable property in the taxing district (at the time 9the submission of the proposition is initiated by the taxing 10district). Paragraph (3) shall be included only if the 11increased limiting rate will be applicable for more than one 12levy year and shall list each levy year for which the increased 13limiting rate will be applicable. The additional tax shown for 14each levy year shall be the approximate dollar amount of the 15increase over the amount of the most recently completed 16extension at the time the submission of the proposition is 17initiated by the taxing district. The approximate amount of 18the additional taxes extendable shown in paragraphs (2) and 19(3) shall be calculated by multiplying $100,000 (the fair 20market value of the property without regard to any property 21tax exemptions) by (i) the percentage level of assessment 22prescribed for that property by statute, or by ordinance of 23the county board in counties that classify property for 24purposes of taxation in accordance with Section 4 of Article 25IX of the Illinois Constitution; (ii) the most recent final 26equalization factor certified to the county clerk by the   HB2896- 6 -LRB104 09215 HLH 19272 b1Department of Revenue at the time the taxing district 2initiates the submission of the proposition to the electors; 3and (iii) either the new rate or the amount by which the 4limiting rate is to be increased. This amendatory Act of the 597th General Assembly is intended to clarify the existing 6requirements of this Section, and shall not be construed to 7validate any prior non-compliant referendum language. 8Paragraph (4) shall be included if the proposition concerns a 9limiting rate increase but shall not be included if the 10proposition concerns a new rate. Any notice required to be 11published in connection with the submission of the proposition 12shall also contain this supplemental information and shall not 13contain any other supplemental information regarding the 14proposition. Any error, miscalculation, or inaccuracy in 15computing any amount set forth on the ballot and in the notice 16that is not deliberate shall not invalidate or affect the 17validity of any proposition approved. Notice of the referendum 18shall be published and posted as otherwise required by law, 19and the submission of the proposition shall be initiated as 20provided by law.21    If a majority of all ballots cast on the proposition are in 22favor of the proposition, the following provisions shall be 23applicable to the extension of taxes for the taxing district:24        (A) a new tax rate shall be first effective for the 25    levy year in which the new rate is approved;26        (B) if the proposition provides for a new tax rate,   HB2896- 7 -LRB104 09215 HLH 19272 b1    the taxing district is authorized to levy a tax after the 2    canvass of the results of the referendum by the election 3    authority for the purposes for which the tax is 4    authorized;5        (C) a limiting rate increase shall be first effective 6    for the levy year in which the limiting rate increase is 7    approved, provided that the taxing district may elect to 8    have a limiting rate increase be effective for the levy 9    year prior to the levy year in which the limiting rate 10    increase is approved unless the extension of taxes for the 11    prior levy year occurs 30 days or less after the canvass of 12    the results of the referendum by the election authority in 13    any county in which the taxing district is located;14        (D) in order for the limiting rate increase to be 15    first effective for the levy year prior to the levy year of 16    the referendum, the taxing district must certify its 17    election to have the limiting rate increase be effective 18    for the prior levy year to the clerk of each county in 19    which the taxing district is located not more than 2 days 20    after the date the results of the referendum are canvassed 21    by the election authority; and22        (E) if the proposition provides for a limiting rate 23    increase, the increase may be effective regardless of 24    whether the proposition is approved before or after the 25    taxing district adopts or files its levy for any levy 26    year.   HB2896- 8 -LRB104 09215 HLH 19272 b1    Rates required to extend taxes on levies subject to a 2backdoor referendum in each year there is a levy are not new 3rates or rate increases under this Section if a levy has been 4made for the fund in one or more of the preceding 3 levy years. 5Changes made by this amendatory Act of 1997 to this Section in 6reference to rates required to extend taxes on levies subject 7to a backdoor referendum in each year there is a levy are 8declarative of existing law and not a new enactment. 9    (b) Whenever other applicable law authorizes a taxing 10district subject to the limitation with respect to its 11aggregate extension provided for in this Law to issue bonds or 12other obligations either without referendum or subject to 13backdoor referendum, the taxing district may elect for each 14separate bond issuance to submit the question of the issuance 15of the bonds or obligations directly to the voters of the 16taxing district, and if the referendum passes the taxing 17district is not required to comply with any backdoor 18referendum procedures or requirements set forth in the other 19applicable law. The direct referendum shall be initiated by 20ordinance or resolution of the governing body of the taxing 21district, and the question shall be certified to the proper 22election authorities in accordance with the provisions of the 23Election Code.24(Source: P.A. 103-592, eff. 6-7-24.) 25    Section 99.
