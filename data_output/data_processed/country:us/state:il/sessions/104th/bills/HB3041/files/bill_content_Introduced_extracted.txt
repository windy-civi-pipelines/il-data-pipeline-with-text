The service provider shall 16    provide a report of such assessment to the covered entity 17    upon request.18    (b) A person or entity may only act as a service provider 19pursuant to a written contract between the covered entity and 20the service provider, or a written contract between one 21service provider and a second service provider as described 22under paragraph (4) of subsection (a), if the contract:23        (1) sets forth the data processing procedures of the 24    service provider with respect to collection, processing, 25    or transfer performed on behalf of the covered entity or 26    service provider;  HB3041- 56 -LRB104 08482 SPS 18534 b1        (2) clearly sets forth:2            (A) instructions for collecting, processing, or 3        transferring data;4            (B) the nature and purpose of collecting, 5        processing, or transferring;6            (C) the type of data subject to collecting, 7        processing, or transferring;8            (D) the duration of processing; and9            (E) the rights and obligations of both parties, 10        including a method by which the service provider shall 11        notify the covered entity of material changes to its 12        privacy practices;13        (3) does not relieve a covered entity or a service 14    provider of any requirement or liability imposed on such 15    covered entity or service provider under this Act; and16        (4) prohibits:17            (A) collecting, processing, or transferring 18        covered data in contravention to subsection (a); and19            (B) combining service provider data with covered 20        data which the service provider receives from or on 21        behalf of another person or persons or collects from 22        the interaction of the service provider with an 23        individual, provided that such combining is not 24        necessary to effectuate a purpose described in 25        paragraphs (1) through (15) of subsection (b) of 26        Section 10 and is otherwise permitted under the   HB3041- 57 -LRB104 08482 SPS 18534 b1        contract required by this subsection.2        (5) Each service provider shall retain copies of 3    previous contracts entered into in compliance with this 4    Section with each covered entity to which it provides 5    requested products or services.6    (c) Relationship between covered entities and service 7providers:8        (1) Determining whether a person is acting as a 9    covered entity or service provider with respect to a 10    specific processing of covered data is a fact-based 11    determination that depends upon the context in which such 12    data is processed.13        (2) A person that is not limited in its processing of 14    covered data pursuant to the instructions of a covered 15    entity, or that fails to adhere to such instructions, is a 16    covered entity and not a service provider with respect to 17    a specific processing of covered data. A service provider 18    that continues to adhere to the instructions of a covered 19    entity with respect to a specific processing of covered 20    data remains a service provider. If a service provider 21    begins, alone or jointly with others, determining the 22    purposes and means of the processing of covered data, it 23    is a covered entity and not a service provider with 24    respect to the processing of such data.25        (3) A covered entity that transfers covered data to a 26    service provider or a service provider that transfers   HB3041- 58 -LRB104 08482 SPS 18534 b1    covered data to a covered entity or another service 2    provider, in compliance with the requirements of this Act, 3    is not liable for a violation of this Act by the service 4    provider or covered entity to whom such covered data was 5    transferred, if at the time of transferring such covered 6    data, the covered entity or service provider did not have 7    actual knowledge that the service provider or covered 8    entity would violate this Act.9        (4) A covered entity or service provider that receives 10    covered data in compliance with the requirements of this 11    Act is not in violation of this Act as a result of a 12    violation by a covered entity or service provider from 13    which such data was received.14    (d) A third party:15        (1) shall not process third-party data for a 16    processing purpose other than, in the case of sensitive 17    covered data, the processing purpose for which the 18    individual gave affirmative express consent or to effect a 19    purpose enumerated in paragraphs (1), (3), or (5) of 20    subsection (b) of Section 10 and, in the case of 21    non-sensitive data, the processing purpose for which the 22    covered entity made a disclosure pursuant to paragraph (4) 23    of subsection (1) of Section 30;24        (2) for purposes of paragraph (1), may reasonably rely 25    on representations made by the covered entity that 26    transferred the third party data if the third party   HB3041- 59 -LRB104 08482 SPS 18534 b1    conducts reasonable due diligence on the representations 2    of the covered entity and finds those representations to 3    be credible; and4        (3) shall enter into and comply with all provisions of 5    the contract required under subsection (e).6    (e) A covered entity that transfers covered data to a 7third party shall enter into a written contract with such 8third party that:9        (1) identifies the specific purposes for which the 10    covered data is being made available to third party;11        (2) specifies that the covered entity is transferring 12    the covered data to the third party solely for the 13    specific purposes set forth in the contract and that the 14    third party may only use the covered data for such 15    specific purposes;16        (3) requires the third party to comply with all 17    applicable provisions of and regulations promulgated under 18    this Act with respect to the covered data that the covered 19    entity transfers to the third party and must provide the 20    same level of privacy and security protection for the 21    covered data as required by covered entities under this 22    Act.23    (f) A covered entity or service provider shall exercise 24reasonable due diligence in:25        (1) selecting a service provider; and26        (2) deciding to transfer covered data to a third   HB3041- 60 -LRB104 08482 SPS 18534 b1    party.2    (g) Solely for the purposes of this Section, the 3requirements for service providers to contract with, assist, 4and follow the instructions of covered entities shall be read 5to include requirements to contract with, assist, and follow 6the instructions of a government entity if the service 7provider is providing a service to a government entity. 8    Section 75. Enforcement.
