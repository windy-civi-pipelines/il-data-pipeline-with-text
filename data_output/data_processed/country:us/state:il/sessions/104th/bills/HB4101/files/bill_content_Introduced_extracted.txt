Notwithstanding any other provision of 15this Act, the reduced rate of tax under Section 3-10 of this 16Act for clothing and school supplies shall be administered by 17the Department under the provisions of this subsection (b). 18        (1) Bundled sales. Items that qualify for the reduced 19    rate of tax that are bundled together with items that do 20    not qualify for the reduced rate of tax and that are sold 21    for one itemized price will be subject to the reduced rate 22    of tax only if the value of the items that qualify for the 23    reduced rate of tax exceeds the value of the items that do 24    not qualify for the reduced rate of tax. 25        (2) Coupons and discounts. An unreimbursed discount by 26    the seller reduces the sales price of the property so that   HB4101- 5 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1    the discounted sales price determines whether the sales 2    price is within a sales tax holiday price threshold. A 3    coupon or other reduction in the sales price is treated as 4    a discount if the seller is not reimbursed for the coupon 5    or reduction amount by a third party. 6        (3) Splitting of items normally sold together. 7    Articles that are normally sold as a single unit must 8    continue to be sold in that manner. Such articles cannot 9    be priced separately and sold as individual items in order 10    to obtain the reduced rate of tax. For example, a pair of 11    shoes cannot have each shoe sold separately so that the 12    sales price of each shoe is within a sales tax holiday 13    price threshold. 14        (4) Rain checks. A rain check is a procedure that 15    allows a customer to purchase an item at a certain price at 16    a later time because the particular item was out of stock. 17    Eligible property that customers purchase during the Sales 18    Tax Holiday Period with the use of a rain check will 19    qualify for the reduced rate of tax regardless of when the 20    rain check was issued. Issuance of a rain check during the 21    Sales Tax Holiday Period will not qualify eligible 22    property for the reduced rate of tax if the property is 23    actually purchased after the Sales Tax Holiday Period. 24        (5) Exchanges. The procedure for an exchange in 25    regards to a sales tax holiday is as follows: 26            (A) If a customer purchases an item of eligible   HB4101- 6 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1        property during the Sales Tax Holiday Period, but 2        later exchanges the item for a similar eligible item, 3        even if a different size, different color, or other 4        feature, no additional tax is due even if the exchange 5        is made after the Sales Tax Holiday Period. 6            (B) If a customer purchases an item of eligible 7        property during the Sales Tax Holiday Period, but 8        after the Sales Tax Holiday Period has ended, the 9        customer returns the item and receives credit on the 10        purchase of a different item, the 6.25% general 11        merchandise sales tax rate is due on the sale of the 12        newly purchased item. 13            (C) If a customer purchases an item of eligible 14        property before the Sales Tax Holiday Period, but 15        during the Sales Tax Holiday Period the customer 16        returns the item and receives credit on the purchase 17        of a different item of eligible property, the reduced 18        rate of tax is due on the sale of the new item if the 19        new item is purchased during the Sales Tax Holiday 20        Period. 21        (6) (Blank). 22        (7) Order date and back orders. For the purpose of a 23    sales tax holiday, eligible property qualifies for the 24    reduced rate of tax if: (i) the item is both delivered to 25    and paid for by the customer during the Sales Tax Holiday 26    Period or (ii) the customer orders and pays for the item   HB4101- 7 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1    and the seller accepts the order during the Sales Tax 2    Holiday Period for immediate shipment, even if delivery is 3    made after the Sales Tax Holiday Period. The seller 4    accepts an order when the seller has taken action to fill 5    the order for immediate shipment. Actions to fill an order 6    include placement of an "in date" stamp on an order or 7    assignment of an "order number" to an order within the 8    Sales Tax Holiday Period. An order is for immediate 9    shipment when the customer does not request delayed 10    shipment. An order is for immediate shipment 11    notwithstanding that the shipment may be delayed because 12    of a backlog of orders or because stock is currently 13    unavailable to, or on back order by, the seller. 14        (8) Returns. For a 60-day period immediately after the 15    Sales Tax Holiday Period, if a customer returns an item 16    that would qualify for the reduced rate of tax, credit for 17    or refund of sales tax shall be given only at the reduced 18    rate unless the customer provides a receipt or invoice 19    that shows tax was paid at the 6.25% general merchandise 20    rate, or the seller has sufficient documentation to show 21    that tax was paid at the 6.25% general merchandise rate on 22    the specific item. This 60-day period is set solely for 23    the purpose of designating a time period during which the 24    customer must provide documentation that shows that the 25    appropriate sales tax rate was paid on returned 26    merchandise. The 60-day period is not intended to change a   HB4101- 8 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1    seller's policy on the time period during which the seller 2    will accept returns. 3    (c) The Department may implement the provisions of this 4Section through the use of emergency rules, along with 5permanent rules filed concurrently with such emergency rules, 6in accordance with the provisions of Section 5-45 of the 7Illinois Administrative Procedure Act. For purposes of the 8Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, the adoption of rules 9to implement the provisions of this Section shall be deemed an 10emergency and necessary for the public interest, safety, and 11welfare. 12    (d) As used in this Section: 13    "Sales Tax Holiday Period" means: 14        (1) August 6, 2010 through August 15, 2010;15        (2) August 5, 2022 through August 14, 2022; 16        (3) August 5, 2026 through August 14, 2026; and17        (4) August 5 through August 14 of each year 18    thereafter. 19    (e) This Section is exempt from the provisions of Section 203-90. 21(Source: P.A. 102-700, eff. 4-19-22.) 22    (35 ILCS 105/3-10)  from Ch. 120, par. 439.33-1023    Sec. 3-10.

Items that qualify for the reduced 14    rate of tax that are bundled together with items that do 15    not qualify for the reduced rate of tax and that are sold 16    for one itemized price will be subject to the reduced rate 17    of tax only if the value of the items that qualify for the 18    reduced rate of tax exceeds the value of the items that do 19    not qualify for the reduced rate of tax. 20        (2) Coupons and discounts. An unreimbursed discount by 21    the seller reduces the sales price of the property so that 22    the discounted sales price determines whether the sales 23    price is within a sales tax holiday price threshold. A 24    coupon or other reduction in the sales price is treated as 25    a discount if the seller is not reimbursed for the coupon 26    or reduction amount by a third party.   HB4101- 20 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1        (3) Splitting of items normally sold together. 2    Articles that are normally sold as a single unit must 3    continue to be sold in that manner. Such articles cannot 4    be priced separately and sold as individual items in order 5    to obtain the reduced rate of tax. For example, a pair of 6    shoes cannot have each shoe sold separately so that the 7    sales price of each shoe is within a sales tax holiday 8    price threshold. 9        (4) Rain checks. A rain check is a procedure that 10    allows a customer to purchase an item at a certain price at 11    a later time because the particular item was out of stock. 12    Eligible property that customers purchase during the Sales 13    Tax Holiday Period with the use of a rain check will 14    qualify for the reduced rate of tax regardless of when the 15    rain check was issued. Issuance of a rain check during the 16    Sales Tax Holiday Period will not qualify eligible 17    property for the reduced rate of tax if the property is 18    actually purchased after the Sales Tax Holiday Period. 19        (5) Exchanges. The procedure for an exchange in 20    regards to a sales tax holiday is as follows: 21            (A) If a customer purchases an item of eligible 22        property during the Sales Tax Holiday Period, but 23        later exchanges the item for a similar eligible item, 24        even if a different size, different color, or other 25        feature, no additional tax is due even if the exchange 26        is made after the Sales Tax Holiday Period.   HB4101- 21 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1            (B) If a customer purchases an item of eligible 2        property during the Sales Tax Holiday Period, but 3        after the Sales Tax Holiday Period has ended, the 4        customer returns the item and receives credit on the 5        purchase of a different item, the 6.25% general 6        merchandise sales tax rate is due on the sale of the 7        newly purchased item. 8            (C) If a customer purchases an item of eligible 9        property before the Sales Tax Holiday Period, but 10        during the Sales Tax Holiday Period the customer 11        returns the item and receives credit on the purchase 12        of a different item of eligible property, the reduced 13        rate of tax is due on the sale of the new item if the 14        new item is purchased during the Sales Tax Holiday 15        Period. 16        (6) (Blank). 17        (7) Order date and back orders. For the purpose of a 18    sales tax holiday, eligible property qualifies for the 19    reduced rate of tax if: (i) the item is both delivered to 20    and paid for by the customer during the Sales Tax Holiday 21    Period or (ii) the customer orders and pays for the item 22    and the seller accepts the order during the Sales Tax 23    Holiday Period for immediate shipment, even if delivery is 24    made after the Sales Tax Holiday Period. The seller 25    accepts an order when the seller has taken action to fill 26    the order for immediate shipment. Actions to fill an order   HB4101- 22 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1    include placement of an "in date" stamp on an order or 2    assignment of an "order number" to an order within the 3    Sales Tax Holiday Period. An order is for immediate 4    shipment when the customer does not request delayed 5    shipment. An order is for immediate shipment 6    notwithstanding that the shipment may be delayed because 7    of a backlog of orders or because stock is currently 8    unavailable to, or on back order by, the seller. 9        (8) Returns. For a 60-day period immediately after the 10    Sales Tax Holiday Period, if a customer returns an item 11    that would qualify for the reduced rate of tax, credit for 12    or refund of sales tax shall be given only at the reduced 13    rate unless the customer provides a receipt or invoice 14    that shows tax was paid at the 6.25% general merchandise 15    rate, or the seller has sufficient documentation to show 16    that tax was paid at the 6.25% general merchandise rate on 17    the specific item. This 60-day period is set solely for 18    the purpose of designating a time period during which the 19    customer must provide documentation that shows that the 20    appropriate sales tax rate was paid on returned 21    merchandise. The 60-day period is not intended to change a 22    seller's policy on the time period during which the seller 23    will accept returns. 24    (c) The Department may implement the provisions of this 25Section through the use of emergency rules, along with 26permanent rules filed concurrently with such emergency rules,   HB4101- 23 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1in accordance with the provisions of Section 5-45 of the 2Illinois Administrative Procedure Act.

A rain check is a procedure that 15    allows a customer to purchase an item at a certain price at 16    a later time because the particular item was out of stock. 17    Eligible property that customers purchase during the Sales 18    Tax Holiday Period with the use of a rain check will 19    qualify for the reduced rate of tax regardless of when the 20    rain check was issued. Issuance of a rain check during the 21    Sales Tax Holiday Period will not qualify eligible 22    property for the reduced rate of tax if the property is 23    actually purchased after the Sales Tax Holiday Period. 24        (5) Exchanges. The procedure for an exchange in 25    regards to a sales tax holiday is as follows: 26            (A) If a customer purchases an item of eligible   HB4101- 6 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1        property during the Sales Tax Holiday Period, but 2        later exchanges the item for a similar eligible item, 3        even if a different size, different color, or other 4        feature, no additional tax is due even if the exchange 5        is made after the Sales Tax Holiday Period. 6            (B) If a customer purchases an item of eligible 7        property during the Sales Tax Holiday Period, but 8        after the Sales Tax Holiday Period has ended, the 9        customer returns the item and receives credit on the 10        purchase of a different item, the 6.25% general 11        merchandise sales tax rate is due on the sale of the 12        newly purchased item. 13            (C) If a customer purchases an item of eligible 14        property before the Sales Tax Holiday Period, but 15        during the Sales Tax Holiday Period the customer 16        returns the item and receives credit on the purchase 17        of a different item of eligible property, the reduced 18        rate of tax is due on the sale of the new item if the 19        new item is purchased during the Sales Tax Holiday 20        Period. 21        (6) (Blank). 22        (7) Order date and back orders. For the purpose of a 23    sales tax holiday, eligible property qualifies for the 24    reduced rate of tax if: (i) the item is both delivered to 25    and paid for by the customer during the Sales Tax Holiday 26    Period or (ii) the customer orders and pays for the item   HB4101- 7 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1    and the seller accepts the order during the Sales Tax 2    Holiday Period for immediate shipment, even if delivery is 3    made after the Sales Tax Holiday Period. The seller 4    accepts an order when the seller has taken action to fill 5    the order for immediate shipment. Actions to fill an order 6    include placement of an "in date" stamp on an order or 7    assignment of an "order number" to an order within the 8    Sales Tax Holiday Period. An order is for immediate 9    shipment when the customer does not request delayed 10    shipment. An order is for immediate shipment 11    notwithstanding that the shipment may be delayed because 12    of a backlog of orders or because stock is currently 13    unavailable to, or on back order by, the seller. 14        (8) Returns. For a 60-day period immediately after the 15    Sales Tax Holiday Period, if a customer returns an item 16    that would qualify for the reduced rate of tax, credit for 17    or refund of sales tax shall be given only at the reduced 18    rate unless the customer provides a receipt or invoice 19    that shows tax was paid at the 6.25% general merchandise 20    rate, or the seller has sufficient documentation to show 21    that tax was paid at the 6.25% general merchandise rate on 22    the specific item. This 60-day period is set solely for 23    the purpose of designating a time period during which the 24    customer must provide documentation that shows that the 25    appropriate sales tax rate was paid on returned 26    merchandise. The 60-day period is not intended to change a   HB4101- 8 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1    seller's policy on the time period during which the seller 2    will accept returns. 3    (c) The Department may implement the provisions of this 4Section through the use of emergency rules, along with 5permanent rules filed concurrently with such emergency rules, 6in accordance with the provisions of Section 5-45 of the 7Illinois Administrative Procedure Act.

Actions to fill an order   HB4101- 22 -LRB104 14805 HLH 27948 b1    include placement of an "in date" stamp on an order or 2    assignment of an "order number" to an order within the 3    Sales Tax Holiday Period. An order is for immediate 4    shipment when the customer does not request delayed 5    shipment. An order is for immediate shipment 6    notwithstanding that the shipment may be delayed because 7    of a backlog of orders or because stock is currently 8    unavailable to, or on back order by, the seller. 9        (8) Returns. For a 60-day period immediately after the 10    Sales Tax Holiday Period, if a customer returns an item 11    that would qualify for the reduced rate of tax, credit for 12    or refund of sales tax shall be given only at the reduced 13    rate unless the customer provides a receipt or invoice 14    that shows tax was paid at the 6.25% general merchandise 15    rate, or the seller has sufficient documentation to show 16    that tax was paid at the 6.25% general merchandise rate on 17    the specific item.
