It is 5    vital to commercial, educational, and cultural interests 6    that public schools remain in operation. To achieve that 7    goal, public school systems must have effective 8    leadership.9        (3) To promote the sound operation of districts, as 10    defined in this Section, it may be necessary to provide 11    for the creation of independent authorities with the 12    powers necessary to promote sound governance, sound 13    academic planning, and sound financial management and to 14    ensure the continued operation of the public schools.15        (4) It is the purpose of this Section to provide for a 16    sound basis for the continued operation of public schools. 17    The intention of the General Assembly, in creating this 18    Section, is to establish procedures, provide powers, and 19    impose restrictions to ensure the educational integrity of 20    public school districts.21    (b) As used in this Section:22    "Board" means a school board of a district.23    "Chairperson" means the Chairperson of the Independent 24Authority.25    "District" means any school district having a population 26of not more than 500,000.  HB3866- 6 -LRB104 12337 RLC 22516 b1    "State Board" means the State Board of Education.2    "State Superintendent" means the State Superintendent of 3Education.4    (c) The State Board has the power to direct the State 5Superintendent to remove a board.

When a school 24    board faces governance difficulties, continued operation   HB3866- 5 -LRB104 12337 RLC 22516 b1    of the public school system is threatened.2        (2) Sound school board governance, academic 3    achievement, and sound financial structure are essential 4    to the continued operation of any school system. It is 5    vital to commercial, educational, and cultural interests 6    that public schools remain in operation. To achieve that 7    goal, public school systems must have effective 8    leadership.9        (3) To promote the sound operation of districts, as 10    defined in this Section, it may be necessary to provide 11    for the creation of independent authorities with the 12    powers necessary to promote sound governance, sound 13    academic planning, and sound financial management and to 14    ensure the continued operation of the public schools.15        (4) It is the purpose of this Section to provide for a 16    sound basis for the continued operation of public schools. 17    The intention of the General Assembly, in creating this 18    Section, is to establish procedures, provide powers, and 19    impose restrictions to ensure the educational integrity of 20    public school districts.21    (b) As used in this Section:22    "Board" means a school board of a district.23    "Chairperson" means the Chairperson of the Independent 24Authority.25    "District" means any school district having a population 26of not more than 500,000.  HB3866- 6 -LRB104 12337 RLC 22516 b1    "State Board" means the State Board of Education.2    "State Superintendent" means the State Superintendent of 3Education.4    (c) The State Board has the power to direct the State 5Superintendent to remove a board.
