The end of this 6    flexibility and reciprocity have resulted in a significant 7    loss to the State's health care workforce.8        (3) A February 2024 report created for the Commission 9    on Government Forecasting and Accountability shows that 10    health care is one of the stalwarts of the Illinois 11    economy and Illinois employers will add more health care 12    jobs at a stronger pace than other sectors, as a response 13    to a growing aging population. Illinois hospitals alone 14    are responsible for creating 445,000 jobs and infusing 15    $117,000,000,000 into the Illinois economy.16        (4) Studies from the Department of Financial and 17    Professional Regulation show that the majority of licensed 18    nurses are employed full-time while Illinois will still 19    face an estimated shortage of 15,000 registered nurses by 20    the end of 2025.21        (5) Continued advancements in health care and health 22    care delivery require constant review of resource 23    allocation to ensure the workforce is trained and prepared 24    for those changes.25        (6) The Illinois health care workforce is not 26    representative of the Illinois population due to barriers   10400SB0593sam003- 3 -LRB104 06862 SPS 25689 a1    for many underrepresented groups.2        (7) Average waiting times of 175 minutes in hospital 3    emergency departments have contributed to health care 4    workers facing unacceptably high levels of violence from 5    patients and visitors, further challenging the ability to 6    retain highly trained and qualified staff.7        (8) Public Act 103-0725 creates important 8    opportunities for international medical graduate 9    physicians to play an important role in the growth of the 10    Illinois health care workforce.11        (9) The lack of an adequate health care workforce has, 12    in part, resulted in a continued shortage of critical 13    health care services and a reduction in access to care.14        (10) The launch and implementation of the 15    comprehensive regulatory environment by the Department of 16    Financial and Professional Regulation offers tangible 17    opportunities to use technology to enhance the licensure 18    experience for health care professionals as well as allow 19    data to drive decision-making in the workforce space. 20    Section 15.
