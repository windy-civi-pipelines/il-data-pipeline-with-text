A firearm equipped with a high-capacity magazine can 14be said to have significantly more firepower than a 15semi-automatic firearm because it can fire a significantly 16larger number of shots without reloading. Additionally, the 17use of firearms equipped with machine gun switches that allow 18firearms to fire automatically increases the risk of harm to 19innocent bystanders. High-capacity magazines that enable 20individuals to fire numerous rounds without reloading increase 21the potential for mass casualties. Firearms equipped with such 22devices pose a greater danger to the community due to the 23increased frequency with which they are reported to being used 24in the commission of violent crimes all over the country. By 25enhancing penalties for use of such firearms, the General 26Assembly seeks to: reduce the risk of gun violence and mass   HB3577- 57 -LRB104 11037 RLC 21119 b1casualties; to protect first responders and law enforcement 2from facing enhanced firepower; and to prevent circumvention 3of gun safety laws in Illinois; and to reduce the risk of 4fatalities in shootings. 5    (c-2) For the purposes of paragraphs (11) and (12) of 6subsection (c), the General Assembly finds and declares that 7the use of firearms that are not marked with serial numbers 8poses a greater danger to the community due to the increased 9frequency with which they are used in the commission of 10violent crimes and the difficulty of tracing such firearms. 11Because there is an increased market for these types of 12weapons for use in the commission of criminal activity, 13providing for stricter penalties for the possession and use of 14firearms not marked with serial numbers or "ghost guns" by 15individuals not authorized to possess or carry any firearms 16will help deter similar crimes. 17    (d) For the purposes of this Section, "organized gang" has 18the meaning ascribed to it in Section 10 of the Illinois 19Streetgang Terrorism Omnibus Prevention Act.20    (d-1) For the purposes of paragraphs (9) and (10) of 21subsection (c), "forced reset trigger" and "high-capacity 22magazine" have the meanings ascribed to them in subparagraphs 23(i) and (ii-5) of paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 2424-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012, respectively.25    (d-2) For the purposes of paragraphs (11) and (12) of 26subsection (c), firearm" does not include an antique firearm,   HB3577- 58 -LRB104 11037 RLC 21119 b1as defined in 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(16) or any firearm that was 2manufactured prior to October 22, 1968. 3    (e) The court may impose an extended term sentence under 4Article 4.5 of Chapter V upon an offender who has been 5convicted of a felony violation of Section 11-1.20, 11-1.30, 611-1.40, 11-1.50, 11-1.60, 12-13, 12-14, 12-14.1, 12-15, or 712-16 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 8when the victim of the offense is under 18 years of age at the 9time of the commission of the offense and, during the 10commission of the offense, the victim was under the influence 11of alcohol, regardless of whether or not the alcohol was 12supplied by the offender; and the offender, at the time of the 13commission of the offense, knew or should have known that the 14victim had consumed alcohol. 15(Source: P.A. 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23; 16103-822, eff. 1-1-25; 103-825, eff. 1-1-25; revised 11-26-24.) 17    (730 ILCS 5/5-8-1)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-8-1)18    Sec. 5-8-1.

For the purposes of this paragraph (8), 5    "electronic communication" shall have the meaning provided 6    in Section 26.5-0.1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. 7        (9) When a defendant is convicted of unlawful 8    possession of weapons under Section 24-1 or aggravated 9    unlawful possession of a weapon under Section 24-1.6 of 10    the Criminal Code of 2012 and the weapon possessed was a 11    machine gun as defined in subparagraph (i) of paragraph 12    (7) of subsection (a) of Section 24-1 of that Code or was 13    modified or equipped with a forced reset trigger, 14    including an auto-switch or binary switch, or 15    high-capacity magazine.16        (10) When a defendant is convicted of a violent crime 17    as defined in Section 3 of the Rights of Crime Victims and 18    Witnesses Act and a machine gun, as defined in 19    subparagraph (i) of paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of 20    Section 24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012, or a firearm 21    that was modified or equipped with a forced reset trigger, 22    including an auto-switch or binary switch or high-capacity 23    magazine was used in the commission of the crime.24        (11) When a defendant is convicted of unlawful 25    possession of weapons under Section 24-1 of the Criminal 26    Code of 2012 and the weapon possessed is a firearm in which   HB3577- 56 -LRB104 11037 RLC 21119 b1    the frame or receiver of the firearm possessed was not 2    imprinted with a serial number.3        (12) When a defendant is convicted of a violent crime 4    as defined in Section 3 of the Rights of Crime Victims and 5    Witnesses Act, and a firearm was used in the commission of 6    the offense and the frame or receiver of the firearm 7    possessed was not imprinted with a serial number.8    (c-1) For the purposes of paragraphs (9) and (10) of 9subsection (c), the General Assembly finds and declares that 10machine gun conversion switches present an extraordinary 11threat to public safety, as they can be readily made using a 3D 12printer and can quickly turn a firearm into a fully automatic 13weapon. A firearm equipped with a high-capacity magazine can 14be said to have significantly more firepower than a 15semi-automatic firearm because it can fire a significantly 16larger number of shots without reloading. Additionally, the 17use of firearms equipped with machine gun switches that allow 18firearms to fire automatically increases the risk of harm to 19innocent bystanders. High-capacity magazines that enable 20individuals to fire numerous rounds without reloading increase 21the potential for mass casualties. Firearms equipped with such 22devices pose a greater danger to the community due to the 23increased frequency with which they are reported to being used 24in the commission of violent crimes all over the country. By 25enhancing penalties for use of such firearms, the General 26Assembly seeks to: reduce the risk of gun violence and mass   HB3577- 57 -LRB104 11037 RLC 21119 b1casualties; to protect first responders and law enforcement 2from facing enhanced firepower; and to prevent circumvention 3of gun safety laws in Illinois; and to reduce the risk of 4fatalities in shootings. 5    (c-2) For the purposes of paragraphs (11) and (12) of 6subsection (c), the General Assembly finds and declares that 7the use of firearms that are not marked with serial numbers 8poses a greater danger to the community due to the increased 9frequency with which they are used in the commission of 10violent crimes and the difficulty of tracing such firearms. 11Because there is an increased market for these types of 12weapons for use in the commission of criminal activity, 13providing for stricter penalties for the possession and use of 14firearms not marked with serial numbers or "ghost guns" by 15individuals not authorized to possess or carry any firearms 16will help deter similar crimes. 17    (d) For the purposes of this Section, "organized gang" has 18the meaning ascribed to it in Section 10 of the Illinois 19Streetgang Terrorism Omnibus Prevention Act.20    (d-1) For the purposes of paragraphs (9) and (10) of 21subsection (c), "forced reset trigger" and "high-capacity 22magazine" have the meanings ascribed to them in subparagraphs 23(i) and (ii-5) of paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 2424-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012, respectively.25    (d-2) For the purposes of paragraphs (11) and (12) of 26subsection (c), firearm" does not include an antique firearm,   HB3577- 58 -LRB104 11037 RLC 21119 b1as defined in 18 U.S.C. 921(a)(16) or any firearm that was 2manufactured prior to October 22, 1968. 3    (e) The court may impose an extended term sentence under 4Article 4.5 of Chapter V upon an offender who has been 5convicted of a felony violation of Section 11-1.20, 11-1.30, 611-1.40, 11-1.50, 11-1.60, 12-13, 12-14, 12-14.1, 12-15, or 712-16 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 8when the victim of the offense is under 18 years of age at the 9time of the commission of the offense and, during the 10commission of the offense, the victim was under the influence 11of alcohol, regardless of whether or not the alcohol was 12supplied by the offender; and the offender, at the time of the 13commission of the offense, knew or should have known that the 14victim had consumed alcohol. 15(Source: P.A. 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23; 16103-822, eff. 1-1-25; 103-825, eff. 1-1-25; revised 11-26-24.) 17    (730 ILCS 5/5-8-1)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-8-1)18    Sec. 5-8-1.
