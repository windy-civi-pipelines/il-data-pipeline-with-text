For a master policy 11    insurance contract, a licensed surplus line producer may 12    make the required diligent effort to procure the insurance 13    from authorized insurers annually for the master policy 14    rather than individually for each insured that is added 15    during the policy period.

The 13    surplus line tax rate for a surplus line insurance policy 14    or contract is determined as follows:15            (i) 3% for policies or contracts with an effective 16        date prior to July 1, 2003;17            (ii) 3.5% for policies or contracts with an 18        effective date of July 1, 2003 or later. 19        A surplus line producer shall file with the Director 20    on or before February 1 and August 1 of each year a report 21    in the form prescribed by the Director on all surplus line 22    insurance procured from unauthorized insurers and 23    submitted to the Surplus Line Association of Illinois 24    during the preceding 6 month period ending December 31 or 25    June 30 respectively, and on the filing of such report 26    shall pay to the Director for the use and benefit of the   SB1289- 14 -LRB104 08171 BAB 18220 b1    State a sum equal to the surplus line tax rate multiplied 2    by the gross taxable premiums less returned taxable 3    premiums upon all surplus line insurance submitted to the 4    Surplus Line Association of Illinois during the preceding 5    6 months. 6        Any surplus line producer who fails to pay the full 7    amount due under this subsection is liable, in addition to 8    the amount due, for such late fee, penalty, and interest 9    charges as are provided for under Section 412 of this 10    Code. The Director, through the Attorney General, may 11    institute an action in the name of the People of the State 12    of Illinois, in any court of competent jurisdiction, for 13    the recovery of the amount of such taxes, late fees, 14    interest, and penalties due, and prosecute the same to 15    final judgment, and take such steps as are necessary to 16    collect the same.17        (b) Fire Marshal Tax. Each surplus line producer shall 18    file with the Director on or before February 1 of each year 19    a report in the form prescribed by the Director on all fire 20    insurance procured from unauthorized insurers and 21    submitted to the Surplus Line Association of Illinois 22    during the previous year that is subject to tax under 23    Section 12 of the Fire Investigation Act and shall pay to 24    the Director the fire marshal tax required thereunder. 25        (c) Taxes and fees charged to insured. The taxes 26    imposed under this subsection and the recording fees   SB1289- 15 -LRB104 08171 BAB 18220 b1    charged by the Surplus Line Association of Illinois may be 2    charged to and collected from surplus line insureds.3    (4) (Blank).4    (5) Submission of documents to Surplus Line Association of 5Illinois. A surplus line producer shall submit every insurance 6contract and premium-bearing endorsement issued under his or 7her license to the Surplus Line Association of Illinois for 8recording.

It shall be unlawful 7for an insurance producer to deliver any unauthorized insurer 8contract or premium-bearing endorsement unless it contains 9evidence of recording by the Surplus Line Association of 10Illinois.11    (7) Inspection of records. A surplus line producer shall 12maintain separate records of the business transacted under his 13or her license for 7 years from the policy effective date, 14including complete copies of surplus line insurance contracts 15maintained on paper or by electronic means, which records 16shall be open at all times for inspection by the Director and 17by the Surplus Line Association of Illinois.18    (8) Violations and penalties. The Director may suspend or 19revoke or refuse to renew a surplus line producer license for 20any violation of this Code. In addition to or in lieu of 21suspension or revocation, the Director may subject a surplus 22line producer to a civil penalty of up to $2,000 for each cause 23for suspension or revocation. Such penalty is enforceable 24under subsection (5) of Section 403A of this Code.25    Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the Director 26that a surplus line producer has made a documented good faith   SB1289- 17 -LRB104 08171 BAB 18220 b1determination of the home state for a surplus line insurance 2contract and has paid the surplus line taxes to a state other 3than Illinois, and the Director determines that the producer's 4good faith determination was incorrect and the home state is 5Illinois, the surplus line producer may, at the discretion of 6the Director, be required to submit the contract to the 7Surplus Line Association of Illinois and pay applicable taxes 8and recording fees, but there shall be no penalty, interest, 9or late fee assessed. 10    (9) Director may declare insurer ineligible. If the 11Director determines that the further assumption of risks might 12be hazardous to the policyholders of an unauthorized insurer, 13the Director may order the Surplus Line Association of 14Illinois not to accept and record insurance contracts 15evidencing insurance in such insurer and order surplus line 16producers to cease procuring insurance from such insurer.17    (10) Service of process upon Director.
