The deadline for the public body to respond to the 3request shall be tolled until the requester verifies that he 4or she is a person.

Failure to respond within the 8time permitted for extension shall be considered a denial of 9the request. A public body that fails to respond to a request 10within the time permitted for extension but thereafter 11provides the requester with copies of the requested public 12records may not impose a fee for those copies. A public body 13that requests an extension and subsequently fails to respond 14to the request may not treat the request as unduly burdensome 15under subsection (g).16    (g) Requests calling for all records falling within a 17category shall be complied with unless compliance with the 18request would be unduly burdensome for the complying public 19body and there is no way to narrow the request and the burden 20on the public body outweighs the public interest in the 21information. Before invoking this exemption, the public body 22shall extend to the person making the request an opportunity 23to confer with it in an attempt to reduce the request to 24manageable proportions. If any public body responds to a 25categorical request by stating that compliance would unduly 26burden its operation and the conditions described above are   HB2578- 10 -LRB104 09349 BDA 19407 b1met, it shall do so in writing, specifying the reasons why it 2would be unduly burdensome and the extent to which compliance 3will so burden the operations of the public body. Such a 4response shall be treated as a denial of the request for 5information. 6    Repeated requests from the same person for the same 7records that are unchanged or identical to records previously 8provided or properly denied under this Act shall be deemed 9unduly burdensome under this provision.10    (h) Each public body may promulgate rules and regulations 11in conformity with the provisions of this Section pertaining 12to the availability of records and procedures to be followed, 13including:14        (i) the times and places where such records will be 15    made available, and16        (ii) the persons from whom such records may be 17    obtained.18    (i) The time periods for compliance or denial of a request 19to inspect or copy records set out in this Section shall not 20apply to requests for records made for a commercial purpose, 21requests by a recurrent requester, or voluminous requests. 22Such requests shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 233.1, 3.2, and 3.6 of this Act, as applicable. 24    (j) Within 5 business days after its receipt of the 25request, a public body that has a reasonable belief that a 26request was not submitted by a person may require the   HB2578- 11 -LRB104 09349 BDA 19407 b1requester to verify orally or in writing that the requester is 2a person. The deadline for the public body to respond to the 3request shall be tolled until the requester verifies that he 4or she is a person. If the requester fails to verify that he or 5she is a person within 30 days after the public body requests 6such a verification, then the public body may deny the 7request. 8(Source: P.A. 101-81, eff. 7-12-19.)
