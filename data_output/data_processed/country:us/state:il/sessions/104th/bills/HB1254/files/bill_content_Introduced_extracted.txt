The amount of compensation which shall be paid to 9the employee for an accidental injury not resulting in death 10is:11    (a) The employer shall provide and pay the negotiated 12rate, if applicable, or the lesser of the health care 13provider's actual charges or according to a fee schedule, 14subject to Section 8.2, in effect at the time the service was 15rendered for all the necessary first aid, medical and surgical 16services, and all necessary medical, surgical and hospital 17services thereafter incurred, limited, however, to that which 18is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of 19the accidental injury, even if a health care provider sells, 20transfers, or otherwise assigns an account receivable for 21procedures, treatments, or services covered under this Act. If 22the employer does not dispute payment of first aid, medical, 23surgical, and hospital services, the employer shall make such   HB1254- 2 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1payment to the provider on behalf of the employee. The 2employer shall also pay for treatment, instruction and 3training necessary for the physical, mental and vocational 4rehabilitation of the employee, including all maintenance 5costs and expenses incidental thereto. If as a result of the 6injury the employee is unable to be self-sufficient the 7employer shall further pay for such maintenance or 8institutional care as shall be required.9    The employee may at any time elect to secure his own 10physician, surgeon and hospital services at the employer's 11expense, or, 12    Upon agreement between the employer and the employees, or 13the employees' exclusive representative, and subject to the 14approval of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the 15employer shall maintain a list of physicians, to be known as a 16Panel of Physicians, who are accessible to the employees. The 17employer shall post this list in a place or places easily 18accessible to his employees. The employee shall have the right 19to make an alternative choice of physician from such Panel if 20he is not satisfied with the physician first selected. If, due 21to the nature of the injury or its occurrence away from the 22employer's place of business, the employee is unable to make a 23selection from the Panel, the selection process from the Panel 24shall not apply. The physician selected from the Panel may 25arrange for any consultation, referral or other specialized 26medical services outside the Panel at the employer's expense.   HB1254- 3 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1Provided that, in the event the Commission shall find that a 2doctor selected by the employee is rendering improper or 3inadequate care, the Commission may order the employee to 4select another doctor certified or qualified in the medical 5field for which treatment is required. If the employee refuses 6to make such change the Commission may relieve the employer of 7his obligation to pay the doctor's charges from the date of 8refusal to the date of compliance.9    Any vocational rehabilitation counselors who provide 10service under this Act shall have appropriate certifications 11which designate the counselor as qualified to render opinions 12relating to vocational rehabilitation. Vocational 13rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, counseling 14for job searches, supervising a job search program, and 15vocational retraining including education at an accredited 16learning institution. The employee or employer may petition to 17the Commission to decide disputes relating to vocational 18rehabilitation and the Commission shall resolve any such 19dispute, including payment of the vocational rehabilitation 20program by the employer.21    The maintenance benefit shall not be less than the 22temporary total disability rate determined for the employee. 23In addition, maintenance shall include costs and expenses 24incidental to the vocational rehabilitation program.25    When the employee is working light duty on a part-time 26basis or full-time basis and earns less than he or she would be   HB1254- 4 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1earning if employed in the full capacity of the job or jobs, 2then the employee shall be entitled to temporary partial 3disability benefits. Temporary partial disability benefits 4shall be equal to two-thirds of the difference between the 5average amount that the employee would be able to earn in the 6full performance of his or her duties in the occupation in 7which he or she was engaged at the time of accident and the 8gross amount which he or she is earning in the modified job 9provided to the employee by the employer or in any other job 10that the employee is working.11    Every hospital, physician, surgeon or other person 12rendering treatment or services in accordance with the 13provisions of this Section shall upon written request furnish 14full and complete reports thereof to, and permit their records 15to be copied by, the employer, the employee or his dependents, 16as the case may be, or any other party to any proceeding for 17compensation before the Commission, or their attorneys.18    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer's liability to 19pay for such medical services selected by the employee shall 20be limited to:21        (1) all first aid and emergency treatment; plus22        (2) all medical, surgical and hospital services 23    provided by the physician, surgeon or hospital initially 24    chosen by the employee or by any other physician, 25    consultant, expert, institution or other provider of 26    services recommended by said initial service provider or   HB1254- 5 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain 2    of referrals from said initial service provider; plus3        (3) all medical, surgical and hospital services 4    provided by any second physician, surgeon or hospital 5    subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other 6    physician, consultant, expert, institution or other 7    provider of services recommended by said second service 8    provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in 9    the chain of referrals from said second service provider. 10    Thereafter the employer shall select and pay for all 11    necessary medical, surgical and hospital treatment and the 12    employee may not select a provider of medical services at 13    the employer's expense unless the employer agrees to such 14    selection. At any time the employee may obtain any medical 15    treatment he desires at his own expense. This paragraph 16    shall not affect the duty to pay for rehabilitation 17    referred to above.18        (4) The following shall apply for injuries occurring 19    on or after June 28, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 20    97-18) and only when an employer has an approved preferred 21    provider program pursuant to Section 8.1a on the date the 22    employee sustained his or her accidental injuries:23            (A) The employer shall, in writing, on a form 24        promulgated by the Commission, inform the employee of 25        the preferred provider program;26            (B) Subsequent to the report of an injury by an   HB1254- 6 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        employee, the employee may choose in writing at any 2        time to decline the preferred provider program, in 3        which case that would constitute one of the two 4        choices of medical providers to which the employee is 5        entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3); and6            (C) Prior to the report of an injury by an 7        employee, when an employee chooses non-emergency 8        treatment from a provider not within the preferred 9        provider program, that would constitute the employee's 10        one choice of medical providers to which the employee 11        is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3). 12    When an employer and employee so agree in writing, nothing 13in this Act prevents an employee whose injury or disability 14has been established under this Act, from relying in good 15faith, on treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone, in 16accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church 17or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner 18thereof, and having nursing services appropriate therewith, 19without suffering loss or diminution of the compensation 20benefits under this Act. However, the employee shall submit to 21all physical examinations required by this Act. The cost of 22such treatment and nursing care shall be paid by the employee 23unless the employer agrees to make such payment.24    Where the accidental injury results in the amputation of 25an arm, hand, leg or foot, or the enucleation of an eye, or the 26loss of any of the natural teeth, the employer shall furnish an   HB1254- 7 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1artificial of any such members lost or damaged in accidental 2injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and 3shall also furnish the necessary braces in all proper and 4necessary cases.

For the permanent partial loss of use of a member 13    or sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, compensation 14    during that proportion of the number of weeks in the 15    foregoing schedule provided for the loss of such member or 16    sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, which the partial 17    loss of use thereof bears to the total loss of use of such 18    member, or sight of eye, or hearing of an ear.19            (a) Loss of hearing for compensation purposes 20        shall be confined to the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 21        and 3,000 cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability 22        for frequency tones above 3,000 cycles per second are 23        not to be considered as constituting disability for 24        hearing.25            (b) The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of 26        the determination of compensation claims for   HB1254- 27 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the 2        average in decibels for the thresholds of hearing for 3        the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 cycles per 4        second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric 5        instruments, approved by nationally recognized 6        authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring 7        hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 30 8        decibels or less in the 3 frequencies, such losses of 9        hearing shall not then constitute any compensable 10        hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 11        85 decibels or more in the 3 frequencies, then the same 12        shall constitute and be total or 100% compensable 13        hearing loss.14            (c) In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest 15        measured losses in each of the 3 frequencies shall be 16        added together and divided by 3 to determine the 17        average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss 18        exceeding 30 decibels an allowance of 1.82% shall be 19        made up to the maximum of 100% which is reached at 85 20        decibels.21            (d) If a hearing loss is established to have 22        existed on July 1, 1975 by audiometric testing the 23        employer shall not be liable for the previous loss so 24        established nor shall he be liable for any loss for 25        which compensation has been paid or awarded.26            (e) No consideration shall be given to the   HB1254- 28 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        question of whether or not the ability of an employee 2        to understand speech is improved by the use of a 3        hearing aid.4            (f) No claim for loss of hearing due to industrial 5        noise shall be brought against an employer or allowed 6        unless the employee has been exposed for a period of 7        time sufficient to cause permanent impairment to noise 8        levels in excess of the following: 9Sound Level DBA10Slow ResponseHours Per Day11908129261395414973151002161021-1/2171051181101/2191151/420        This subparagraph (f) shall not be applied in cases of 21    hearing loss resulting from trauma or explosion.22        17. In computing the compensation to be paid to any 23    employee who, before the accident for which he claims 24    compensation, had before that time sustained an injury 25    resulting in the loss by amputation or partial loss by 26    amputation of any member, including hand, arm, thumb or   HB1254- 29 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    fingers, leg, foot or any toes, such loss or partial loss 2    of any such member shall be deducted from any award made 3    for the subsequent injury. For the permanent loss of use 4    or the permanent partial loss of use of any such member or 5    the partial loss of sight of an eye, for which 6    compensation has been paid, then such loss shall be taken 7    into consideration and deducted from any award for the 8    subsequent injury.9        18. The specific case of loss of both hands, both 10    arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any 11    two thereof, or the permanent and complete loss of the use 12    thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be 13    compensated according to the compensation fixed by 14    paragraph (f) of this Section. These specific cases of 15    total and permanent disability do not exclude other cases.16        Any employee who has previously suffered the loss or 17    permanent and complete loss of the use of any of such 18    members, and in a subsequent independent accident loses 19    another or suffers the permanent and complete loss of the 20    use of any one of such members the employer for whom the 21    injured employee is working at the time of the last 22    independent accident is liable to pay compensation only 23    for the loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of 24    the member occasioned by the last independent accident.25        19. In a case of specific loss and the subsequent 26    death of such injured employee from other causes than such   HB1254- 30 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    injury leaving a widow, widower, or dependents surviving 2    before payment or payment in full for such injury, then 3    the amount due for such injury is payable to the widow or 4    widower and, if there be no widow or widower, then to such 5    dependents, in the proportion which such dependency bears 6    to total dependency.7    Beginning July 1, 1980, and every 6 months thereafter, the 8Commission shall examine the Second Injury Fund and when, 9after deducting all advances or loans made to such Fund, the 10amount therein is $500,000 then the amount required to be paid 11by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 12reduced by one-half. When the Second Injury Fund reaches the 13sum of $600,000 then the payments shall cease entirely. 14However, when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to 15$400,000, payment of one-half of the amounts required by 16paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 17herein provided, and when the Second Injury Fund has been 18reduced to $300,000, payment of the full amounts required by 19paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 20herein provided. The Commission shall make the changes in 21payment effective by general order, and the changes in payment 22become immediately effective for all cases coming before the 23Commission thereafter either by settlement agreement or final 24order, irrespective of the date of the accidental injury.25    On August 1, 1996 and on February 1 and August 1 of each 26subsequent year, the Commission shall examine the special fund   HB1254- 31 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1designated as the "Rate Adjustment Fund" and when, after 2deducting all advances or loans made to said fund, the amount 3therein is $4,000,000, the amount required to be paid by 4employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 5reduced by one-half. When the Rate Adjustment Fund reaches the 6sum of $5,000,000 the payment therein shall cease entirely. 7However, when said Rate Adjustment Fund has been reduced to 8$3,000,000 the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 9shall be resumed in the manner herein provided.10    (f) In case of complete disability, which renders the 11employee wholly and permanently incapable of work, or in the 12specific case of total and permanent disability as provided in 13subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section, compensation 14shall be payable at the rate provided in subparagraph 2 of 15paragraph (b) of this Section for life.16    An employee entitled to benefits under paragraph (f) of 17this Section shall also be entitled to receive from the Rate 18Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of the 19supplementary benefits provided in paragraph (g) of this 20Section 8.21    If any employee who receives an award under this paragraph 22afterwards returns to work or is able to do so, and earns or is 23able to earn as much as before the accident, payments under 24such award shall cease. If such employee returns to work, or is 25able to do so, and earns or is able to earn part but not as 26much as before the accident, such award shall be modified so as   HB1254- 32 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1to conform to an award under paragraph (d) of this Section. If 2such award is terminated or reduced under the provisions of 3this paragraph, such employees have the right at any time 4within 30 months after the date of such termination or 5reduction to file petition with the Commission for the purpose 6of determining whether any disability exists as a result of 7the original accidental injury and the extent thereof.8    Disability as enumerated in subdivision 18, paragraph (e) 9of this Section is considered complete disability.10    If an employee who had previously incurred loss or the 11permanent and complete loss of use of one member, through the 12loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one hand, 13one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent and 14complete disability through the loss or the permanent and 15complete loss of the use of another member, he shall receive, 16in addition to the compensation payable by the employer and 17after such payments have ceased, an amount from the Second 18Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7, which, 19together with the compensation payable from the employer in 20whose employ he was when the last accidental injury was 21incurred, will equal the amount payable for permanent and 22complete disability as provided in this paragraph of this 23Section.24    The custodian of the Second Injury Fund provided for in 25paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be joined with the employer as 26a party respondent in the application for adjustment of claim.   HB1254- 33 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1The application for adjustment of claim shall state briefly 2and in general terms the approximate time and place and manner 3of the loss of the first member.4    In its award the Commission or the Arbitrator shall 5specifically find the amount the injured employee shall be 6weekly paid, the number of weeks compensation which shall be 7paid by the employer, the date upon which payments begin out of 8the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of 9Section 7 of this Act, the length of time the weekly payments 10continue, the date upon which the pension payments commence 11and the monthly amount of the payments. The Commission shall 1230 days after the date upon which payments out of the Second 13Injury Fund have begun as provided in the award, and every 14month thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Comptroller 15a voucher for payment for all compensation accrued to that 16date at the rate fixed by the Commission. The State 17Comptroller shall draw a warrant to the injured employee along 18with a receipt to be executed by the injured employee and 19returned to the Commission. The endorsed warrant and receipt 20is a full and complete acquittance to the Commission for the 21payment out of the Second Injury Fund. No other appropriation 22or warrant is necessary for payment out of the Second Injury 23Fund. The Second Injury Fund is appropriated for the purpose 24of making payments according to the terms of the awards.25    As of July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1982, all claims against and 26obligations of the Second Injury Fund shall become claims   HB1254- 34 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1against and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund to the 2extent there is insufficient money in the Second Injury Fund 3to pay such claims and obligations. In that case, all 4references to "Second Injury Fund" in this Section shall also 5include the Rate Adjustment Fund.6    (g) Every award for permanent total disability entered by 7the Commission on and after July 1, 1965 under which 8compensation payments shall become due and payable after the 9effective date of this amendatory Act, and every award for 10death benefits or permanent total disability entered by the 11Commission on and after the effective date of this amendatory 12Act shall be subject to annual adjustments as to the amount of 13the compensation rate therein provided. Such adjustments shall 14first be made on July 15, 1977, and all awards made and entered 15prior to July 1, 1975 and on July 15 of each year thereafter. 16In all other cases such adjustment shall be made on July 15 of 17the second year next following the date of the entry of the 18award and shall further be made on July 15 annually 19thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of 20the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there 21shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage 22in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 23the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately 24increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase 25in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under 26the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the   HB1254- 35 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring 2the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the 3prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment 4is made. Such increase shall be paid in the same manner as 5herein provided for payments under the Second Injury Fund to 6the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, 7out of the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of 8Section 7 of this Act. Payments shall be made at the same 9intervals as provided in the award or, at the option of the 10Commission, may be made in quarterly payment on the 15th day of 11January, April, July and October of each year. In the event of 12a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change 13in the then existing compensation rate. The within paragraph 14shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and 15in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer 16and the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may 17be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' 18Compensation Commission.19    Provided, that in cases of awards entered by the 20Commission for injuries occurring before July 1, 1975, the 21increases in the compensation rate adjusted under the 22foregoing provision of this paragraph (g) shall be limited to 23increases in the State's average weekly wage in covered 24industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act occurring 25after July 1, 1975.26    For every accident occurring on or after July 20, 2005 but   HB1254- 36 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 2General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General 3Assembly), the annual adjustments to the compensation rate in 4awards for death benefits or permanent total disability, as 5provided in this Act, shall be paid by the employer. The 6adjustment shall be made by the employer on July 15 of the 7second year next following the date of the entry of the award 8and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If 9during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the 10award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been 11an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 12industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the employer 13shall increase the weekly compensation rate proportionately by 14the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the 15State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the 16Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation 17rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total 18compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing 19maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. In 20the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall 21be no change in the then existing compensation rate. Such 22increase shall be paid by the employer in the same manner and 23at the same intervals as the payment of compensation in the 24award. This paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is 25disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum 26settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or   HB1254- 37 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1his or her dependents, as the case may be, has been duly 2approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.3    The annual adjustments for every award of death benefits 4or permanent total disability involving accidents occurring 5before July 20, 2005 and accidents occurring on or after the 6effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General 7Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly) shall 8continue to be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund pursuant to 9this paragraph and Section 7(f) of this Act. 10    (h) In case death occurs from any cause before the total 11compensation to which the employee would have been entitled 12has been paid, then in case the employee leaves any widow, 13widower, child, parent (or any grandchild, grandparent or 14other lineal heir or any collateral heir dependent at the time 15of the accident upon the earnings of the employee to the extent 16of 50% or more of total dependency) such compensation shall be 17paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased employee and 18distributed as provided in paragraph (g) of Section 7.19    (h-1) In case an injured employee is under legal 20disability at the time when any right or privilege accrues to 21him or her under this Act, a guardian may be appointed pursuant 22to law, and may, on behalf of such person under legal 23disability, claim and exercise any such right or privilege 24with the same effect as if the employee himself or herself had 25claimed or exercised the right or privilege. No limitations of 26time provided by this Act run so long as the employee who is   HB1254- 38 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1under legal disability is without a conservator or guardian.2    (i) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age 3at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the 4amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 5(e) and (f) of this Section is increased 50%.6    However, where an employer has on file an employment 7certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law or work 8permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor Standards 9Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and duly 10issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is 11conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor 12employee for the purposes of this Section.13    Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions 14of the Child Labor Law relating to the employment of minors 15under the age of 16 years.16    (j) 1. In the event the injured employee receives 17benefits, including medical, surgical or hospital benefits 18under any group plan covering non-occupational disabilities 19contributed to wholly or partially by the employer, which 20benefits should not have been payable if any rights of 21recovery existed under this Act, then such amounts so paid to 22the employee from any such group plan as shall be consistent 23with, and limited to, the provisions of paragraph 2 hereof, 24shall be credited to or against any compensation payment for 25temporary total incapacity for work or any medical, surgical 26or hospital benefits made or to be made under this Act. In such   HB1254- 39 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1event, the period of time for giving notice of accidental 2injury and filing application for adjustment of claim does not 3commence to run until the termination of such payments. This 4paragraph does not apply to payments made under any group plan 5which would have been payable irrespective of an accidental 6injury under this Act. Any employer receiving such credit 7shall keep such employee safe and harmless from any and all 8claims or liabilities that may be made against him by reason of 9having received such payments only to the extent of such 10credit.11    Any excess benefits paid to or on behalf of a State 12employee by the State Employees' Retirement System under 13Article 14 of the Illinois Pension Code on a death claim or 14disputed disability claim shall be credited against any 15payments made or to be made by the State of Illinois to or on 16behalf of such employee under this Act, except for payments 17for medical expenses which have already been incurred at the 18time of the award. The State of Illinois shall directly 19reimburse the State Employees' Retirement System to the extent 20of such credit.21    2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to 22give the employer or the insurance carrier the right to credit 23for any benefits or payments received by the employee other 24than compensation payments provided by this Act, and where the 25employee receives payments other than compensation payments, 26whether as full or partial salary, group insurance benefits,   HB1254- 40 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1bonuses, annuities or any other payments, the employer or 2insurance carrier shall receive credit for each such payment 3only to the extent of the compensation that would have been 4payable during the period covered by such payment.5    3. The extension of time for the filing of an Application 6for Adjustment of Claim as provided in paragraph 1 above shall 7not apply to those cases where the time for such filing had 8expired prior to the date on which payments or benefits 9enumerated herein have been initiated or resumed. Provided 10however that this paragraph 3 shall apply only to cases 11wherein the payments or benefits hereinabove enumerated shall 12be received after July 1, 1969.13(Source: P.A. 97-18, eff. 6-28-11; 97-268, eff. 8-8-11; 1497-813, eff. 7-13-12.) 15    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 103-721)16    Sec. 8. The amount of compensation which shall be paid to 17the employee for an accidental injury not resulting in death 18is:19    (a) The employer shall provide and pay the negotiated 20rate, if applicable, or the lesser of the health care 21provider's actual charges or according to a fee schedule, 22subject to Section 8.2, in effect at the time the service was 23rendered for all the necessary first aid, medical and surgical 24services, and all necessary medical, surgical and hospital 25services thereafter incurred, limited, however, to that which   HB1254- 41 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of 2the accidental injury, even if a health care provider sells, 3transfers, or otherwise assigns an account receivable for 4procedures, treatments, or services covered under this Act. If 5the employer does not dispute payment of first aid, medical, 6surgical, and hospital services, the employer shall make such 7payment to the provider on behalf of the employee. The 8employer shall also pay for treatment, instruction and 9training necessary for the physical, mental and vocational 10rehabilitation of the employee, including all maintenance 11costs and expenses incidental thereto. If as a result of the 12injury the employee is unable to be self-sufficient the 13employer shall further pay for such maintenance or 14institutional care as shall be required.15    The employee may at any time elect to secure his own 16physician, surgeon and hospital services at the employer's 17expense, or, 18    Upon agreement between the employer and the employees, or 19the employees' exclusive representative, and subject to the 20approval of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the 21employer shall maintain a list of physicians, to be known as a 22Panel of Physicians, who are accessible to the employees. The 23employer shall post this list in a place or places easily 24accessible to his employees. The employee shall have the right 25to make an alternative choice of physician from such Panel if 26he is not satisfied with the physician first selected. If, due   HB1254- 42 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1to the nature of the injury or its occurrence away from the 2employer's place of business, the employee is unable to make a 3selection from the Panel, the selection process from the Panel 4shall not apply. The physician selected from the Panel may 5arrange for any consultation, referral or other specialized 6medical services outside the Panel at the employer's expense. 7Provided that, in the event the Commission shall find that a 8doctor selected by the employee is rendering improper or 9inadequate care, the Commission may order the employee to 10select another doctor certified or qualified in the medical 11field for which treatment is required. If the employee refuses 12to make such change the Commission may relieve the employer of 13his obligation to pay the doctor's charges from the date of 14refusal to the date of compliance.15    Any vocational rehabilitation counselors who provide 16service under this Act shall have appropriate certifications 17which designate the counselor as qualified to render opinions 18relating to vocational rehabilitation. Vocational 19rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, counseling 20for job searches, supervising a job search program, and 21vocational retraining including education at an accredited 22learning institution. The employee or employer may petition to 23the Commission to decide disputes relating to vocational 24rehabilitation and the Commission shall resolve any such 25dispute, including payment of the vocational rehabilitation 26program by the employer.  HB1254- 43 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    The maintenance benefit shall not be less than the 2temporary total disability rate determined for the employee. 3In addition, maintenance shall include costs and expenses 4incidental to the vocational rehabilitation program.5    When the employee is working light duty on a part-time 6basis or full-time basis and earns less than he or she would be 7earning if employed in the full capacity of the job or jobs, 8then the employee shall be entitled to temporary partial 9disability benefits. Temporary partial disability benefits 10shall be equal to two-thirds of the difference between the 11average amount that the employee would be able to earn in the 12full performance of his or her duties in the occupation in 13which he or she was engaged at the time of accident and the 14gross amount which he or she is earning in the modified job 15provided to the employee by the employer or in any other job 16that the employee is working.17    Every hospital, physician, surgeon or other person 18rendering treatment or services in accordance with the 19provisions of this Section shall upon written request furnish 20full and complete reports thereof to, and permit their records 21to be copied by, the employer, the employee or his dependents, 22as the case may be, or any other party to any proceeding for 23compensation before the Commission, or their attorneys.24    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer's liability to 25pay for such medical services selected by the employee shall 26be limited to:  HB1254- 44 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        (1) all first aid and emergency treatment; plus2        (2) all medical, surgical and hospital services 3    provided by the physician, surgeon or hospital initially 4    chosen by the employee or by any other physician, 5    consultant, expert, institution or other provider of 6    services recommended by said initial service provider or 7    any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain 8    of referrals from said initial service provider; plus9        (3) all medical, surgical and hospital services 10    provided by any second physician, surgeon or hospital 11    subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other 12    physician, consultant, expert, institution or other 13    provider of services recommended by said second service 14    provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in 15    the chain of referrals from said second service provider. 16    Thereafter the employer shall select and pay for all 17    necessary medical, surgical and hospital treatment and the 18    employee may not select a provider of medical services at 19    the employer's expense unless the employer agrees to such 20    selection. At any time the employee may obtain any medical 21    treatment he desires at his own expense. This paragraph 22    shall not affect the duty to pay for rehabilitation 23    referred to above.24        (4) The following shall apply for injuries occurring 25    on or after June 28, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 26    97-18) and only when an employer has an approved preferred   HB1254- 45 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    provider program pursuant to Section 8.1a on the date the 2    employee sustained his or her accidental injuries:3            (A) The employer shall, in writing, on a form 4        promulgated by the Commission, inform the employee of 5        the preferred provider program;6            (B) Subsequent to the report of an injury by an 7        employee, the employee may choose in writing at any 8        time to decline the preferred provider program, in 9        which case that would constitute one of the two 10        choices of medical providers to which the employee is 11        entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3); and12            (C) Prior to the report of an injury by an 13        employee, when an employee chooses non-emergency 14        treatment from a provider not within the preferred 15        provider program, that would constitute the employee's 16        one choice of medical providers to which the employee 17        is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3). 18    When an employer and employee so agree in writing, nothing 19in this Act prevents an employee whose injury or disability 20has been established under this Act, from relying in good 21faith, on treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone, in 22accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church 23or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner 24thereof, and having nursing services appropriate therewith, 25without suffering loss or diminution of the compensation 26benefits under this Act. However, the employee shall submit to   HB1254- 46 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1all physical examinations required by this Act. The cost of 2such treatment and nursing care shall be paid by the employee 3unless the employer agrees to make such payment.4    Where the accidental injury results in the amputation of 5an arm, hand, leg or foot, or the enucleation of an eye, or the 6loss of any of the natural teeth, the employer shall furnish an 7artificial of any such members lost or damaged in accidental 8injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and 9shall also furnish the necessary braces in all proper and 10necessary cases. In cases of the loss of a member or members by 11amputation, the employer shall, whenever necessary, maintain 12in good repair, refit or replace the artificial limbs during 13the lifetime of the employee. Where the accidental injury 14accompanied by physical injury results in damage to a denture, 15eye glasses or contact eye lenses, or where the accidental 16injury results in damage to an artificial member, the employer 17shall replace or repair such denture, glasses, lenses, or 18artificial member.19    The furnishing by the employer of any such services or 20appliances is not an admission of liability on the part of the 21employer to pay compensation.22    The furnishing of any such services or appliances or the 23servicing thereof by the employer is not the payment of 24compensation.25    (b) If the period of temporary total incapacity for work 26lasts more than 3 working days, weekly compensation as   HB1254- 47 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1hereinafter provided shall be paid beginning on the 4th day of 2such temporary total incapacity and continuing as long as the 3total temporary incapacity lasts. In cases where the temporary 4total incapacity for work continues for a period of 14 days or 5more from the day of the accident compensation shall commence 6on the day after the accident.7        1. The compensation rate for temporary total 8    incapacity under this paragraph (b) of this Section shall 9    be equal to 66 2/3% of the employee's average weekly wage 10    computed in accordance with Section 10, provided that it 11    shall be not less than 66 2/3% of the sum of the Federal 12    minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act, or the 13    Illinois minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law, 14    whichever is more, multiplied by 40 hours. This percentage 15    rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse and child, 16    not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage calculation, 17    nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage computed in 18    accordance with the provisions of Section 10, whichever is 19    less.20        2. The compensation rate in all cases other than for 21    temporary total disability under this paragraph (b), and 22    other than for serious and permanent disfigurement under 23    paragraph (c) and other than for permanent partial 24    disability under subparagraph (2) of paragraph (d) or 25    under paragraph (e), of this Section shall be equal to 66 26    2/3% of the employee's average weekly wage computed in   HB1254- 48 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    accordance with the provisions of Section 10, provided 2    that it shall be not less than 66 2/3% of the sum of the 3    Federal minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 4    or the Illinois minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law, 5    whichever is more, multiplied by 40 hours. This percentage 6    rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse and child, 7    not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage calculation, 8    nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage computed in 9    accordance with the provisions of Section 10, whichever is 10    less.11        2.1. The compensation rate in all cases of serious and 12    permanent disfigurement under paragraph (c) and of 13    permanent partial disability under subparagraph (2) of 14    paragraph (d) or under paragraph (e) of this Section shall 15    be equal to 60% of the employee's average weekly wage 16    computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, 17    provided that it shall be not less than 66 2/3% of the sum 18    of the Federal minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards 19    Act, or the Illinois minimum wage under the Minimum Wage 20    Law, whichever is more, multiplied by 40 hours. This 21    percentage rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse 22    and child, not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage 23    calculation, nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage 24    computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, 25    whichever is less.26        3. As used in this Section the term "child" means a   HB1254- 49 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    child of the employee including any child legally adopted 2    before the accident or whom at the time of the accident the 3    employee was under legal obligation to support or to whom 4    the employee stood in loco parentis, and who at the time of 5    the accident was under 18 years of age and not 6    emancipated. The term "children" means the plural of 7    "child".8        4.

Effective 8    January 1, 1984 and on January 1, of each year thereafter 9    the maximum weekly compensation rate, except as 10    hereinafter provided, shall be determined as follows: if 11    during the preceding 12 month period there shall have been 12    an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 13    industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the 14    weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately 15    increased by the same percentage as the percentage of 16    increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 17    industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act during 18    such period.19        From July 1, 1977 and thereafter such maximum weekly 20    compensation rate in death cases under Section 7, and 21    permanent total disability cases under paragraph (f) or 22    subparagraph 18 of paragraph (3) of this Section and for 23    temporary total disability under paragraph (b) of this 24    Section and for amputation of a member or enucleation of 25    an eye under paragraph (e) of this Section shall be 26    increased to 133-1/3% of the State's average weekly wage   HB1254- 51 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance 2    Act.3        For injuries occurring on or after February 1, 2006, 4    the maximum weekly benefit under paragraph (d)1 of this 5    Section shall be 100% of the State's average weekly wage 6    in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance 7    Act. 8        4.1. Any provision herein to the contrary 9    notwithstanding, the weekly compensation rate for 10    compensation payments under subparagraph 18 of paragraph 11    (e) of this Section and under paragraph (f) of this 12    Section and under paragraph (a) of Section 7 and for 13    amputation of a member or enucleation of an eye under 14    paragraph (e) of this Section, shall in no event be less 15    than 50% of the State's average weekly wage in covered 16    industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act.17        4.2.

The amount when so posted and 13    published shall be conclusive and shall be applicable as 14    the basis of computation of compensation rates until the 15    next posting and publication as aforesaid.16        7. The payment of compensation by an employer or his 17    insurance carrier to an injured employee shall not 18    constitute an admission of the employer's liability to pay 19    compensation.20    (c) For any serious and permanent disfigurement to the 21hand, head, face, neck, arm, leg below the knee or the chest 22above the axillary line, the employee is entitled to 23compensation for such disfigurement, the amount determined by 24agreement at any time or by arbitration under this Act, at a 25hearing not less than 6 months after the date of the accidental 26injury, which amount shall not exceed 150 weeks (if the   HB1254- 53 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1accidental injury occurs on or after the effective date of 2this amendatory Act of the 94th General Assembly but before 3February 1, 2006) or 162 weeks (if the accidental injury 4occurs on or after February 1, 2006) at the applicable rate 5provided in subparagraph 2.1 of paragraph (b) of this Section.6    No compensation is payable under this paragraph where 7compensation is payable under paragraphs (d), (e) or (f) of 8this Section.9    A duly appointed member of a fire department in a city, the 10population of which exceeds 500,000 according to the last 11federal or State census, is eligible for compensation under 12this paragraph only where such serious and permanent 13disfigurement results from burns.14    (d) 1.

For the permanent partial loss of use of a member 15    or sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, compensation 16    during that proportion of the number of weeks in the 17    foregoing schedule provided for the loss of such member or 18    sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, which the partial 19    loss of use thereof bears to the total loss of use of such 20    member, or sight of eye, or hearing of an ear.21            (a) Loss of hearing for compensation purposes 22        shall be confined to the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 23        and 3,000 cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability 24        for frequency tones above 3,000 cycles per second are 25        not to be considered as constituting disability for 26        hearing.  HB1254- 66 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1            (b) The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of 2        the determination of compensation claims for 3        occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the 4        average in decibels for the thresholds of hearing for 5        the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 cycles per 6        second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric 7        instruments, approved by nationally recognized 8        authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring 9        hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 30 10        decibels or less in the 3 frequencies, such losses of 11        hearing shall not then constitute any compensable 12        hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 13        85 decibels or more in the 3 frequencies, then the same 14        shall constitute and be total or 100% compensable 15        hearing loss.16            (c) In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest 17        measured losses in each of the 3 frequencies shall be 18        added together and divided by 3 to determine the 19        average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss 20        exceeding 30 decibels an allowance of 1.82% shall be 21        made up to the maximum of 100% which is reached at 85 22        decibels.23            (d) If a hearing loss is established to have 24        existed on July 1, 1975 by audiometric testing the 25        employer shall not be liable for the previous loss so 26        established nor shall he be liable for any loss for   HB1254- 67 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        which compensation has been paid or awarded.2            (e) No consideration shall be given to the 3        question of whether or not the ability of an employee 4        to understand speech is improved by the use of a 5        hearing aid.6            (f) No claim for loss of hearing due to industrial 7        noise shall be brought against an employer or allowed 8        unless the employee has been exposed for a period of 9        time sufficient to cause permanent impairment to noise 10        levels in excess of the following: 11Sound Level DBA12Slow ResponseHours Per Day13908149261595416973171002181021-1/2191051201101/2211151/422        This subparagraph (f) shall not be applied in cases of 23    hearing loss resulting from trauma or explosion.24        17. In computing the compensation to be paid to any 25    employee who, before the accident for which he claims 26    compensation, had before that time sustained an injury   HB1254- 68 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    resulting in the loss by amputation or partial loss by 2    amputation of any member, including hand, arm, thumb or 3    fingers, leg, foot or any toes, such loss or partial loss 4    of any such member shall be deducted from any award made 5    for the subsequent injury. For the permanent loss of use 6    or the permanent partial loss of use of any such member or 7    the partial loss of sight of an eye, for which 8    compensation has been paid, then such loss shall be taken 9    into consideration and deducted from any award for the 10    subsequent injury.11        18. The specific case of loss of both hands, both 12    arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any 13    two thereof, or the permanent and complete loss of the use 14    thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be 15    compensated according to the compensation fixed by 16    paragraph (f) of this Section. These specific cases of 17    total and permanent disability do not exclude other cases.18        Any employee who has previously suffered the loss or 19    permanent and complete loss of the use of any of such 20    members, and in a subsequent independent accident loses 21    another or suffers the permanent and complete loss of the 22    use of any one of such members the employer for whom the 23    injured employee is working at the time of the last 24    independent accident is liable to pay compensation only 25    for the loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of 26    the member occasioned by the last independent accident.  HB1254- 69 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        19. In a case of specific loss and the subsequent 2    death of such injured employee from other causes than such 3    injury leaving a widow, widower, or dependents surviving 4    before payment or payment in full for such injury, then 5    the amount due for such injury is payable to the widow or 6    widower and, if there be no widow or widower, then to such 7    dependents, in the proportion which such dependency bears 8    to total dependency.9    Beginning July 1, 1980, and every 6 months thereafter, the 10Commission shall examine the Second Injury Fund and when, 11after deducting all advances or loans made to such Fund, the 12amount therein is $500,000 then the amount required to be paid 13by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 14reduced by one-half. When the Second Injury Fund reaches the 15sum of $600,000 then the payments shall cease entirely. 16However, when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to 17$400,000, payment of one-half of the amounts required by 18paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 19herein provided, and when the Second Injury Fund has been 20reduced to $300,000, payment of the full amounts required by 21paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 22herein provided. The Commission shall make the changes in 23payment effective by general order, and the changes in payment 24become immediately effective for all cases coming before the 25Commission thereafter either by settlement agreement or final 26order, irrespective of the date of the accidental injury.  HB1254- 70 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    On August 1, 1996 and on February 1 and August 1 of each 2subsequent year, the Commission shall examine the special fund 3designated as the "Rate Adjustment Fund" and when, after 4deducting all advances or loans made to said fund, the amount 5therein is $4,000,000, the amount required to be paid by 6employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 7reduced by one-half. When the Rate Adjustment Fund reaches the 8sum of $5,000,000 the payment therein shall cease entirely. 9However, when said Rate Adjustment Fund has been reduced to 10$3,000,000 the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 11shall be resumed in the manner herein provided.12    (f) In case of complete disability, which renders the 13employee wholly and permanently incapable of work, or in the 14specific case of total and permanent disability as provided in 15subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section, compensation 16shall be payable at the rate provided in subparagraph 2 of 17paragraph (b) of this Section for life.18    An employee entitled to benefits under paragraph (f) of 19this Section shall also be entitled to receive from the Rate 20Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of the 21supplementary benefits provided in paragraph (g) of this 22Section 8.23    If any employee who receives an award under this paragraph 24afterwards returns to work or is able to do so, and earns or is 25able to earn as much as before the accident, payments under 26such award shall cease. If such employee returns to work, or is   HB1254- 71 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1able to do so, and earns or is able to earn part but not as 2much as before the accident, such award shall be modified so as 3to conform to an award under paragraph (d) of this Section. If 4such award is terminated or reduced under the provisions of 5this paragraph, such employees have the right at any time 6within 30 months after the date of such termination or 7reduction to file petition with the Commission for the purpose 8of determining whether any disability exists as a result of 9the original accidental injury and the extent thereof.10    Disability as enumerated in subdivision 18, paragraph (e) 11of this Section is considered complete disability.12    If an employee who had previously incurred loss or the 13permanent and complete loss of use of one member, through the 14loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one hand, 15one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent and 16complete disability through the loss or the permanent and 17complete loss of the use of another member, he shall receive, 18in addition to the compensation payable by the employer and 19after such payments have ceased, an amount from the Second 20Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7, which, 21together with the compensation payable from the employer in 22whose employ he was when the last accidental injury was 23incurred, will equal the amount payable for permanent and 24complete disability as provided in this paragraph of this 25Section.26    The custodian of the Second Injury Fund provided for in   HB1254- 72 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be joined with the employer as 2a party respondent in the application for adjustment of claim. 3The application for adjustment of claim shall state briefly 4and in general terms the approximate time and place and manner 5of the loss of the first member.6    In its award the Commission or the Arbitrator shall 7specifically find the amount the injured employee shall be 8weekly paid, the number of weeks compensation which shall be 9paid by the employer, the date upon which payments begin out of 10the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of 11Section 7 of this Act, the length of time the weekly payments 12continue, the date upon which the pension payments commence 13and the monthly amount of the payments. The Commission shall 1430 days after the date upon which payments out of the Second 15Injury Fund have begun as provided in the award, and every 16month thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Comptroller 17a voucher for payment for all compensation accrued to that 18date at the rate fixed by the Commission. The State 19Comptroller shall draw a warrant to the injured employee along 20with a receipt to be executed by the injured employee and 21returned to the Commission. The endorsed warrant and receipt 22is a full and complete acquittance to the Commission for the 23payment out of the Second Injury Fund. No other appropriation 24or warrant is necessary for payment out of the Second Injury 25Fund. The Second Injury Fund is appropriated for the purpose 26of making payments according to the terms of the awards.  HB1254- 73 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    As of July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1982, all claims against and 2obligations of the Second Injury Fund shall become claims 3against and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund to the 4extent there is insufficient money in the Second Injury Fund 5to pay such claims and obligations. In that case, all 6references to "Second Injury Fund" in this Section shall also 7include the Rate Adjustment Fund.8    (g) Every award for permanent total disability entered by 9the Commission on and after July 1, 1965 under which 10compensation payments shall become due and payable after the 11effective date of this amendatory Act, and every award for 12death benefits or permanent total disability entered by the 13Commission on and after the effective date of this amendatory 14Act shall be subject to annual adjustments as to the amount of 15the compensation rate therein provided. Such adjustments shall 16first be made on July 15, 1977, and all awards made and entered 17prior to July 1, 1975 and on July 15 of each year thereafter. 18In all other cases such adjustment shall be made on July 15 of 19the second year next following the date of the entry of the 20award and shall further be made on July 15 annually 21thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of 22the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there 23shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage 24in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 25the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately 26increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase   HB1254- 74 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under 2the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the 3compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring 4the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the 5prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment 6is made. Such increase shall be paid in the same manner as 7herein provided for payments under the Second Injury Fund to 8the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, 9out of the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of 10Section 7 of this Act. Payments shall be made at the same 11intervals as provided in the award or, at the option of the 12Commission, may be made in quarterly payment on the 15th day of 13January, April, July and October of each year. In the event of 14a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change 15in the then existing compensation rate. The within paragraph 16shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and 17in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer 18and the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may 19be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' 20Compensation Commission.21    Provided, that in cases of awards entered by the 22Commission for injuries occurring before July 1, 1975, the 23increases in the compensation rate adjusted under the 24foregoing provision of this paragraph (g) shall be limited to 25increases in the State's average weekly wage in covered 26industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act occurring   HB1254- 75 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1after July 1, 1975.2    For every accident occurring on or after July 20, 2005 but 3before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 4General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General 5Assembly), the annual adjustments to the compensation rate in 6awards for death benefits or permanent total disability, as 7provided in this Act, shall be paid by the employer. The 8adjustment shall be made by the employer on July 15 of the 9second year next following the date of the entry of the award 10and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If 11during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the 12award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been 13an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 14industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the employer 15shall increase the weekly compensation rate proportionately by 16the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the 17State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the 18Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation 19rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total 20compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing 21maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. In 22the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall 23be no change in the then existing compensation rate. Such 24increase shall be paid by the employer in the same manner and 25at the same intervals as the payment of compensation in the 26award. This paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is   HB1254- 76 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum 2settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or 3his or her dependents, as the case may be, has been duly 4approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.5    The annual adjustments for every award of death benefits 6or permanent total disability involving accidents occurring 7before July 20, 2005 and accidents occurring on or after the 8effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General 9Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly) shall 10continue to be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund pursuant to 11this paragraph and Section 7(f) of this Act. 12    (h) In case death occurs from any cause before the total 13compensation to which the employee would have been entitled 14has been paid, then in case the employee leaves any widow, 15widower, child, parent (or any grandchild, grandparent or 16other lineal heir or any collateral heir dependent at the time 17of the accident upon the earnings of the employee to the extent 18of 50% or more of total dependency) such compensation shall be 19paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased employee and 20distributed as provided in paragraph (g) of Section 7.21    (h-1) In case an injured employee is under legal 22disability at the time when any right or privilege accrues to 23him or her under this Act, a guardian may be appointed pursuant 24to law, and may, on behalf of such person under legal 25disability, claim and exercise any such right or privilege 26with the same effect as if the employee himself or herself had   HB1254- 77 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1claimed or exercised the right or privilege. No limitations of 2time provided by this Act run so long as the employee who is 3under legal disability is without a conservator or guardian.4    (i) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age 5at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the 6amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 7(e) and (f) of this Section is increased 50%.8    However, where an employer has on file an employment 9certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law of 2024 or 10work permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor 11Standards Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and 12duly issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is 13conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor 14employee for the purposes of this Section.15    Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions 16of the Child Labor Law of 2024 relating to the employment of 17minors under the age of 16 years.18    (j) 1. In the event the injured employee receives 19benefits, including medical, surgical or hospital benefits 20under any group plan covering non-occupational disabilities 21contributed to wholly or partially by the employer, which 22benefits should not have been payable if any rights of 23recovery existed under this Act, then such amounts so paid to 24the employee from any such group plan as shall be consistent 25with, and limited to, the provisions of paragraph 2 hereof, 26shall be credited to or against any compensation payment for   HB1254- 78 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1temporary total incapacity for work or any medical, surgical 2or hospital benefits made or to be made under this Act. In such 3event, the period of time for giving notice of accidental 4injury and filing application for adjustment of claim does not 5commence to run until the termination of such payments. This 6paragraph does not apply to payments made under any group plan 7which would have been payable irrespective of an accidental 8injury under this Act. Any employer receiving such credit 9shall keep such employee safe and harmless from any and all 10claims or liabilities that may be made against him by reason of 11having received such payments only to the extent of such 12credit.13    Any excess benefits paid to or on behalf of a State 14employee by the State Employees' Retirement System under 15Article 14 of the Illinois Pension Code on a death claim or 16disputed disability claim shall be credited against any 17payments made or to be made by the State of Illinois to or on 18behalf of such employee under this Act, except for payments 19for medical expenses which have already been incurred at the 20time of the award. The State of Illinois shall directly 21reimburse the State Employees' Retirement System to the extent 22of such credit.23    2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to 24give the employer or the insurance carrier the right to credit 25for any benefits or payments received by the employee other 26than compensation payments provided by this Act, and where the   HB1254- 79 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1employee receives payments other than compensation payments, 2whether as full or partial salary, group insurance benefits, 3bonuses, annuities or any other payments, the employer or 4insurance carrier shall receive credit for each such payment 5only to the extent of the compensation that would have been 6payable during the period covered by such payment.7    3. The extension of time for the filing of an Application 8for Adjustment of Claim as provided in paragraph 1 above shall 9not apply to those cases where the time for such filing had 10expired prior to the date on which payments or benefits 11enumerated herein have been initiated or resumed. Provided 12however that this paragraph 3 shall apply only to cases 13wherein the payments or benefits hereinabove enumerated shall 14be received after July 1, 1969.15(Source: P.A. 103-721, eff. 1-1-25.) 16    Section 95.

The Workers' Compensation Act is amended by 5changing Section 8 as follows: 6    (820 ILCS 305/8)  (from Ch. 48, par. 138.8)7    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 103-721)8    Sec. 8. The amount of compensation which shall be paid to 9the employee for an accidental injury not resulting in death 10is:11    (a) The employer shall provide and pay the negotiated 12rate, if applicable, or the lesser of the health care 13provider's actual charges or according to a fee schedule, 14subject to Section 8.2, in effect at the time the service was 15rendered for all the necessary first aid, medical and surgical 16services, and all necessary medical, surgical and hospital 17services thereafter incurred, limited, however, to that which 18is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of 19the accidental injury, even if a health care provider sells, 20transfers, or otherwise assigns an account receivable for 21procedures, treatments, or services covered under this Act. If 22the employer does not dispute payment of first aid, medical, 23surgical, and hospital services, the employer shall make such   HB1254- 2 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1payment to the provider on behalf of the employee. The 2employer shall also pay for treatment, instruction and 3training necessary for the physical, mental and vocational 4rehabilitation of the employee, including all maintenance 5costs and expenses incidental thereto. If as a result of the 6injury the employee is unable to be self-sufficient the 7employer shall further pay for such maintenance or 8institutional care as shall be required.9    The employee may at any time elect to secure his own 10physician, surgeon and hospital services at the employer's 11expense, or, 12    Upon agreement between the employer and the employees, or 13the employees' exclusive representative, and subject to the 14approval of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the 15employer shall maintain a list of physicians, to be known as a 16Panel of Physicians, who are accessible to the employees. The 17employer shall post this list in a place or places easily 18accessible to his employees. The employee shall have the right 19to make an alternative choice of physician from such Panel if 20he is not satisfied with the physician first selected. If, due 21to the nature of the injury or its occurrence away from the 22employer's place of business, the employee is unable to make a 23selection from the Panel, the selection process from the Panel 24shall not apply. The physician selected from the Panel may 25arrange for any consultation, referral or other specialized 26medical services outside the Panel at the employer's expense.   HB1254- 3 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1Provided that, in the event the Commission shall find that a 2doctor selected by the employee is rendering improper or 3inadequate care, the Commission may order the employee to 4select another doctor certified or qualified in the medical 5field for which treatment is required. If the employee refuses 6to make such change the Commission may relieve the employer of 7his obligation to pay the doctor's charges from the date of 8refusal to the date of compliance.9    Any vocational rehabilitation counselors who provide 10service under this Act shall have appropriate certifications 11which designate the counselor as qualified to render opinions 12relating to vocational rehabilitation. Vocational 13rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, counseling 14for job searches, supervising a job search program, and 15vocational retraining including education at an accredited 16learning institution. The employee or employer may petition to 17the Commission to decide disputes relating to vocational 18rehabilitation and the Commission shall resolve any such 19dispute, including payment of the vocational rehabilitation 20program by the employer.21    The maintenance benefit shall not be less than the 22temporary total disability rate determined for the employee. 23In addition, maintenance shall include costs and expenses 24incidental to the vocational rehabilitation program.25    When the employee is working light duty on a part-time 26basis or full-time basis and earns less than he or she would be   HB1254- 4 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1earning if employed in the full capacity of the job or jobs, 2then the employee shall be entitled to temporary partial 3disability benefits. Temporary partial disability benefits 4shall be equal to two-thirds of the difference between the 5average amount that the employee would be able to earn in the 6full performance of his or her duties in the occupation in 7which he or she was engaged at the time of accident and the 8gross amount which he or she is earning in the modified job 9provided to the employee by the employer or in any other job 10that the employee is working.11    Every hospital, physician, surgeon or other person 12rendering treatment or services in accordance with the 13provisions of this Section shall upon written request furnish 14full and complete reports thereof to, and permit their records 15to be copied by, the employer, the employee or his dependents, 16as the case may be, or any other party to any proceeding for 17compensation before the Commission, or their attorneys.18    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer's liability to 19pay for such medical services selected by the employee shall 20be limited to:21        (1) all first aid and emergency treatment; plus22        (2) all medical, surgical and hospital services 23    provided by the physician, surgeon or hospital initially 24    chosen by the employee or by any other physician, 25    consultant, expert, institution or other provider of 26    services recommended by said initial service provider or   HB1254- 5 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain 2    of referrals from said initial service provider; plus3        (3) all medical, surgical and hospital services 4    provided by any second physician, surgeon or hospital 5    subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other 6    physician, consultant, expert, institution or other 7    provider of services recommended by said second service 8    provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in 9    the chain of referrals from said second service provider. 10    Thereafter the employer shall select and pay for all 11    necessary medical, surgical and hospital treatment and the 12    employee may not select a provider of medical services at 13    the employer's expense unless the employer agrees to such 14    selection. At any time the employee may obtain any medical 15    treatment he desires at his own expense. This paragraph 16    shall not affect the duty to pay for rehabilitation 17    referred to above.18        (4) The following shall apply for injuries occurring 19    on or after June 28, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 20    97-18) and only when an employer has an approved preferred 21    provider program pursuant to Section 8.1a on the date the 22    employee sustained his or her accidental injuries:23            (A) The employer shall, in writing, on a form 24        promulgated by the Commission, inform the employee of 25        the preferred provider program;26            (B) Subsequent to the report of an injury by an   HB1254- 6 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        employee, the employee may choose in writing at any 2        time to decline the preferred provider program, in 3        which case that would constitute one of the two 4        choices of medical providers to which the employee is 5        entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3); and6            (C) Prior to the report of an injury by an 7        employee, when an employee chooses non-emergency 8        treatment from a provider not within the preferred 9        provider program, that would constitute the employee's 10        one choice of medical providers to which the employee 11        is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3). 12    When an employer and employee so agree in writing, nothing 13in this Act prevents an employee whose injury or disability 14has been established under this Act, from relying in good 15faith, on treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone, in 16accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church 17or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner 18thereof, and having nursing services appropriate therewith, 19without suffering loss or diminution of the compensation 20benefits under this Act. However, the employee shall submit to 21all physical examinations required by this Act. The cost of 22such treatment and nursing care shall be paid by the employee 23unless the employer agrees to make such payment.24    Where the accidental injury results in the amputation of 25an arm, hand, leg or foot, or the enucleation of an eye, or the 26loss of any of the natural teeth, the employer shall furnish an   HB1254- 7 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1artificial of any such members lost or damaged in accidental 2injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and 3shall also furnish the necessary braces in all proper and 4necessary cases. In cases of the loss of a member or members by 5amputation, the employer shall, whenever necessary, maintain 6in good repair, refit or replace the artificial limbs during 7the lifetime of the employee. Where the accidental injury 8accompanied by physical injury results in damage to a denture, 9eye glasses or contact eye lenses, or where the accidental 10injury results in damage to an artificial member, the employer 11shall replace or repair such denture, glasses, lenses, or 12artificial member.13    The furnishing by the employer of any such services or 14appliances is not an admission of liability on the part of the 15employer to pay compensation.16    The furnishing of any such services or appliances or the 17servicing thereof by the employer is not the payment of 18compensation.19    (b) If the period of temporary total incapacity for work 20lasts more than 3 working days, weekly compensation as 21hereinafter provided shall be paid beginning on the 4th day of 22such temporary total incapacity and continuing as long as the 23total temporary incapacity lasts. In cases where the temporary 24total incapacity for work continues for a period of 14 days or 25more from the day of the accident compensation shall commence 26on the day after the accident.  HB1254- 8 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        1.

This percentage 9    rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse and child, 10    not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage calculation, 11    nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage computed in 12    accordance with the provisions of Section 10, whichever is 13    less.14        2. The compensation rate in all cases other than for 15    temporary total disability under this paragraph (b), and 16    other than for serious and permanent disfigurement under 17    paragraph (c) and other than for permanent partial 18    disability under subparagraph (2) of paragraph (d) or 19    under paragraph (e), of this Section shall be equal to 66 20    2/3% of the employee's average weekly wage computed in 21    accordance with the provisions of Section 10, provided 22    that it shall be not less than 66 2/3% of the sum of the 23    Federal minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 24    or the Illinois minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law, 25    whichever is more, multiplied by 40 hours. This percentage 26    rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse and child,   HB1254- 9 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage calculation, 2    nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage computed in 3    accordance with the provisions of Section 10, whichever is 4    less.5        2.1. The compensation rate in all cases of serious and 6    permanent disfigurement under paragraph (c) and of 7    permanent partial disability under subparagraph (2) of 8    paragraph (d) or under paragraph (e) of this Section shall 9    be equal to 60% of the employee's average weekly wage 10    computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, 11    provided that it shall be not less than 66 2/3% of the sum 12    of the Federal minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards 13    Act, or the Illinois minimum wage under the Minimum Wage 14    Law, whichever is more, multiplied by 40 hours. This 15    percentage rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse 16    and child, not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage 17    calculation, nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage 18    computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, 19    whichever is less.20        3.

For the permanent partial loss of use of a member 13    or sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, compensation 14    during that proportion of the number of weeks in the 15    foregoing schedule provided for the loss of such member or 16    sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, which the partial 17    loss of use thereof bears to the total loss of use of such 18    member, or sight of eye, or hearing of an ear.19            (a) Loss of hearing for compensation purposes 20        shall be confined to the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 21        and 3,000 cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability 22        for frequency tones above 3,000 cycles per second are 23        not to be considered as constituting disability for 24        hearing.25            (b) The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of 26        the determination of compensation claims for   HB1254- 27 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the 2        average in decibels for the thresholds of hearing for 3        the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 cycles per 4        second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric 5        instruments, approved by nationally recognized 6        authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring 7        hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 30 8        decibels or less in the 3 frequencies, such losses of 9        hearing shall not then constitute any compensable 10        hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 11        85 decibels or more in the 3 frequencies, then the same 12        shall constitute and be total or 100% compensable 13        hearing loss.14            (c) In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest 15        measured losses in each of the 3 frequencies shall be 16        added together and divided by 3 to determine the 17        average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss 18        exceeding 30 decibels an allowance of 1.82% shall be 19        made up to the maximum of 100% which is reached at 85 20        decibels.21            (d) If a hearing loss is established to have 22        existed on July 1, 1975 by audiometric testing the 23        employer shall not be liable for the previous loss so 24        established nor shall he be liable for any loss for 25        which compensation has been paid or awarded.26            (e) No consideration shall be given to the   HB1254- 28 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        question of whether or not the ability of an employee 2        to understand speech is improved by the use of a 3        hearing aid.4            (f) No claim for loss of hearing due to industrial 5        noise shall be brought against an employer or allowed 6        unless the employee has been exposed for a period of 7        time sufficient to cause permanent impairment to noise 8        levels in excess of the following: 9Sound Level DBA10Slow ResponseHours Per Day11908129261395414973151002161021-1/2171051181101/2191151/420        This subparagraph (f) shall not be applied in cases of 21    hearing loss resulting from trauma or explosion.22        17. In computing the compensation to be paid to any 23    employee who, before the accident for which he claims 24    compensation, had before that time sustained an injury 25    resulting in the loss by amputation or partial loss by 26    amputation of any member, including hand, arm, thumb or   HB1254- 29 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    fingers, leg, foot or any toes, such loss or partial loss 2    of any such member shall be deducted from any award made 3    for the subsequent injury. For the permanent loss of use 4    or the permanent partial loss of use of any such member or 5    the partial loss of sight of an eye, for which 6    compensation has been paid, then such loss shall be taken 7    into consideration and deducted from any award for the 8    subsequent injury.9        18. The specific case of loss of both hands, both 10    arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any 11    two thereof, or the permanent and complete loss of the use 12    thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be 13    compensated according to the compensation fixed by 14    paragraph (f) of this Section. These specific cases of 15    total and permanent disability do not exclude other cases.16        Any employee who has previously suffered the loss or 17    permanent and complete loss of the use of any of such 18    members, and in a subsequent independent accident loses 19    another or suffers the permanent and complete loss of the 20    use of any one of such members the employer for whom the 21    injured employee is working at the time of the last 22    independent accident is liable to pay compensation only 23    for the loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of 24    the member occasioned by the last independent accident.25        19. In a case of specific loss and the subsequent 26    death of such injured employee from other causes than such   HB1254- 30 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    injury leaving a widow, widower, or dependents surviving 2    before payment or payment in full for such injury, then 3    the amount due for such injury is payable to the widow or 4    widower and, if there be no widow or widower, then to such 5    dependents, in the proportion which such dependency bears 6    to total dependency.7    Beginning July 1, 1980, and every 6 months thereafter, the 8Commission shall examine the Second Injury Fund and when, 9after deducting all advances or loans made to such Fund, the 10amount therein is $500,000 then the amount required to be paid 11by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 12reduced by one-half. When the Second Injury Fund reaches the 13sum of $600,000 then the payments shall cease entirely. 14However, when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to 15$400,000, payment of one-half of the amounts required by 16paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 17herein provided, and when the Second Injury Fund has been 18reduced to $300,000, payment of the full amounts required by 19paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 20herein provided. The Commission shall make the changes in 21payment effective by general order, and the changes in payment 22become immediately effective for all cases coming before the 23Commission thereafter either by settlement agreement or final 24order, irrespective of the date of the accidental injury.25    On August 1, 1996 and on February 1 and August 1 of each 26subsequent year, the Commission shall examine the special fund   HB1254- 31 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1designated as the "Rate Adjustment Fund" and when, after 2deducting all advances or loans made to said fund, the amount 3therein is $4,000,000, the amount required to be paid by 4employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 5reduced by one-half. When the Rate Adjustment Fund reaches the 6sum of $5,000,000 the payment therein shall cease entirely. 7However, when said Rate Adjustment Fund has been reduced to 8$3,000,000 the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 9shall be resumed in the manner herein provided.10    (f) In case of complete disability, which renders the 11employee wholly and permanently incapable of work, or in the 12specific case of total and permanent disability as provided in 13subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section, compensation 14shall be payable at the rate provided in subparagraph 2 of 15paragraph (b) of this Section for life.16    An employee entitled to benefits under paragraph (f) of 17this Section shall also be entitled to receive from the Rate 18Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of the 19supplementary benefits provided in paragraph (g) of this 20Section 8.21    If any employee who receives an award under this paragraph 22afterwards returns to work or is able to do so, and earns or is 23able to earn as much as before the accident, payments under 24such award shall cease. If such employee returns to work, or is 25able to do so, and earns or is able to earn part but not as 26much as before the accident, such award shall be modified so as   HB1254- 32 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1to conform to an award under paragraph (d) of this Section. If 2such award is terminated or reduced under the provisions of 3this paragraph, such employees have the right at any time 4within 30 months after the date of such termination or 5reduction to file petition with the Commission for the purpose 6of determining whether any disability exists as a result of 7the original accidental injury and the extent thereof.8    Disability as enumerated in subdivision 18, paragraph (e) 9of this Section is considered complete disability.10    If an employee who had previously incurred loss or the 11permanent and complete loss of use of one member, through the 12loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one hand, 13one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent and 14complete disability through the loss or the permanent and 15complete loss of the use of another member, he shall receive, 16in addition to the compensation payable by the employer and 17after such payments have ceased, an amount from the Second 18Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7, which, 19together with the compensation payable from the employer in 20whose employ he was when the last accidental injury was 21incurred, will equal the amount payable for permanent and 22complete disability as provided in this paragraph of this 23Section.24    The custodian of the Second Injury Fund provided for in 25paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be joined with the employer as 26a party respondent in the application for adjustment of claim.   HB1254- 33 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1The application for adjustment of claim shall state briefly 2and in general terms the approximate time and place and manner 3of the loss of the first member.4    In its award the Commission or the Arbitrator shall 5specifically find the amount the injured employee shall be 6weekly paid, the number of weeks compensation which shall be 7paid by the employer, the date upon which payments begin out of 8the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of 9Section 7 of this Act, the length of time the weekly payments 10continue, the date upon which the pension payments commence 11and the monthly amount of the payments. The Commission shall 1230 days after the date upon which payments out of the Second 13Injury Fund have begun as provided in the award, and every 14month thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Comptroller 15a voucher for payment for all compensation accrued to that 16date at the rate fixed by the Commission. The State 17Comptroller shall draw a warrant to the injured employee along 18with a receipt to be executed by the injured employee and 19returned to the Commission. The endorsed warrant and receipt 20is a full and complete acquittance to the Commission for the 21payment out of the Second Injury Fund. No other appropriation 22or warrant is necessary for payment out of the Second Injury 23Fund. The Second Injury Fund is appropriated for the purpose 24of making payments according to the terms of the awards.25    As of July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1982, all claims against and 26obligations of the Second Injury Fund shall become claims   HB1254- 34 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1against and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund to the 2extent there is insufficient money in the Second Injury Fund 3to pay such claims and obligations. In that case, all 4references to "Second Injury Fund" in this Section shall also 5include the Rate Adjustment Fund.6    (g) Every award for permanent total disability entered by 7the Commission on and after July 1, 1965 under which 8compensation payments shall become due and payable after the 9effective date of this amendatory Act, and every award for 10death benefits or permanent total disability entered by the 11Commission on and after the effective date of this amendatory 12Act shall be subject to annual adjustments as to the amount of 13the compensation rate therein provided. Such adjustments shall 14first be made on July 15, 1977, and all awards made and entered 15prior to July 1, 1975 and on July 15 of each year thereafter. 16In all other cases such adjustment shall be made on July 15 of 17the second year next following the date of the entry of the 18award and shall further be made on July 15 annually 19thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of 20the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there 21shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage 22in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 23the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately 24increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase 25in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under 26the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the   HB1254- 35 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring 2the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the 3prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment 4is made. Such increase shall be paid in the same manner as 5herein provided for payments under the Second Injury Fund to 6the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, 7out of the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of 8Section 7 of this Act. Payments shall be made at the same 9intervals as provided in the award or, at the option of the 10Commission, may be made in quarterly payment on the 15th day of 11January, April, July and October of each year. In the event of 12a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change 13in the then existing compensation rate. The within paragraph 14shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and 15in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer 16and the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may 17be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' 18Compensation Commission.19    Provided, that in cases of awards entered by the 20Commission for injuries occurring before July 1, 1975, the 21increases in the compensation rate adjusted under the 22foregoing provision of this paragraph (g) shall be limited to 23increases in the State's average weekly wage in covered 24industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act occurring 25after July 1, 1975.26    For every accident occurring on or after July 20, 2005 but   HB1254- 36 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 2General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General 3Assembly), the annual adjustments to the compensation rate in 4awards for death benefits or permanent total disability, as 5provided in this Act, shall be paid by the employer. The 6adjustment shall be made by the employer on July 15 of the 7second year next following the date of the entry of the award 8and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If 9during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the 10award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been 11an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 12industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the employer 13shall increase the weekly compensation rate proportionately by 14the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the 15State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the 16Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation 17rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total 18compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing 19maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. In 20the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall 21be no change in the then existing compensation rate. Such 22increase shall be paid by the employer in the same manner and 23at the same intervals as the payment of compensation in the 24award. This paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is 25disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum 26settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or   HB1254- 37 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1his or her dependents, as the case may be, has been duly 2approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.3    The annual adjustments for every award of death benefits 4or permanent total disability involving accidents occurring 5before July 20, 2005 and accidents occurring on or after the 6effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General 7Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly) shall 8continue to be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund pursuant to 9this paragraph and Section 7(f) of this Act. 10    (h) In case death occurs from any cause before the total 11compensation to which the employee would have been entitled 12has been paid, then in case the employee leaves any widow, 13widower, child, parent (or any grandchild, grandparent or 14other lineal heir or any collateral heir dependent at the time 15of the accident upon the earnings of the employee to the extent 16of 50% or more of total dependency) such compensation shall be 17paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased employee and 18distributed as provided in paragraph (g) of Section 7.19    (h-1) In case an injured employee is under legal 20disability at the time when any right or privilege accrues to 21him or her under this Act, a guardian may be appointed pursuant 22to law, and may, on behalf of such person under legal 23disability, claim and exercise any such right or privilege 24with the same effect as if the employee himself or herself had 25claimed or exercised the right or privilege. No limitations of 26time provided by this Act run so long as the employee who is   HB1254- 38 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1under legal disability is without a conservator or guardian.2    (i) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age 3at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the 4amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 5(e) and (f) of this Section is increased 50%.6    However, where an employer has on file an employment 7certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law or work 8permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor Standards 9Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and duly 10issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is 11conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor 12employee for the purposes of this Section.13    Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions 14of the Child Labor Law relating to the employment of minors 15under the age of 16 years.16    (j) 1. In the event the injured employee receives 17benefits, including medical, surgical or hospital benefits 18under any group plan covering non-occupational disabilities 19contributed to wholly or partially by the employer, which 20benefits should not have been payable if any rights of 21recovery existed under this Act, then such amounts so paid to 22the employee from any such group plan as shall be consistent 23with, and limited to, the provisions of paragraph 2 hereof, 24shall be credited to or against any compensation payment for 25temporary total incapacity for work or any medical, surgical 26or hospital benefits made or to be made under this Act. In such   HB1254- 39 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1event, the period of time for giving notice of accidental 2injury and filing application for adjustment of claim does not 3commence to run until the termination of such payments. This 4paragraph does not apply to payments made under any group plan 5which would have been payable irrespective of an accidental 6injury under this Act. Any employer receiving such credit 7shall keep such employee safe and harmless from any and all 8claims or liabilities that may be made against him by reason of 9having received such payments only to the extent of such 10credit.11    Any excess benefits paid to or on behalf of a State 12employee by the State Employees' Retirement System under 13Article 14 of the Illinois Pension Code on a death claim or 14disputed disability claim shall be credited against any 15payments made or to be made by the State of Illinois to or on 16behalf of such employee under this Act, except for payments 17for medical expenses which have already been incurred at the 18time of the award. The State of Illinois shall directly 19reimburse the State Employees' Retirement System to the extent 20of such credit.21    2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to 22give the employer or the insurance carrier the right to credit 23for any benefits or payments received by the employee other 24than compensation payments provided by this Act, and where the 25employee receives payments other than compensation payments, 26whether as full or partial salary, group insurance benefits,   HB1254- 40 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1bonuses, annuities or any other payments, the employer or 2insurance carrier shall receive credit for each such payment 3only to the extent of the compensation that would have been 4payable during the period covered by such payment.5    3. The extension of time for the filing of an Application 6for Adjustment of Claim as provided in paragraph 1 above shall 7not apply to those cases where the time for such filing had 8expired prior to the date on which payments or benefits 9enumerated herein have been initiated or resumed. Provided 10however that this paragraph 3 shall apply only to cases 11wherein the payments or benefits hereinabove enumerated shall 12be received after July 1, 1969.13(Source: P.A. 97-18, eff. 6-28-11; 97-268, eff. 8-8-11; 1497-813, eff. 7-13-12.) 15    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 103-721)16    Sec. 8. The amount of compensation which shall be paid to 17the employee for an accidental injury not resulting in death 18is:19    (a) The employer shall provide and pay the negotiated 20rate, if applicable, or the lesser of the health care 21provider's actual charges or according to a fee schedule, 22subject to Section 8.2, in effect at the time the service was 23rendered for all the necessary first aid, medical and surgical 24services, and all necessary medical, surgical and hospital 25services thereafter incurred, limited, however, to that which   HB1254- 41 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of 2the accidental injury, even if a health care provider sells, 3transfers, or otherwise assigns an account receivable for 4procedures, treatments, or services covered under this Act. If 5the employer does not dispute payment of first aid, medical, 6surgical, and hospital services, the employer shall make such 7payment to the provider on behalf of the employee. The 8employer shall also pay for treatment, instruction and 9training necessary for the physical, mental and vocational 10rehabilitation of the employee, including all maintenance 11costs and expenses incidental thereto. If as a result of the 12injury the employee is unable to be self-sufficient the 13employer shall further pay for such maintenance or 14institutional care as shall be required.15    The employee may at any time elect to secure his own 16physician, surgeon and hospital services at the employer's 17expense, or, 18    Upon agreement between the employer and the employees, or 19the employees' exclusive representative, and subject to the 20approval of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the 21employer shall maintain a list of physicians, to be known as a 22Panel of Physicians, who are accessible to the employees. The 23employer shall post this list in a place or places easily 24accessible to his employees. The employee shall have the right 25to make an alternative choice of physician from such Panel if 26he is not satisfied with the physician first selected. If, due   HB1254- 42 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1to the nature of the injury or its occurrence away from the 2employer's place of business, the employee is unable to make a 3selection from the Panel, the selection process from the Panel 4shall not apply. The physician selected from the Panel may 5arrange for any consultation, referral or other specialized 6medical services outside the Panel at the employer's expense. 7Provided that, in the event the Commission shall find that a 8doctor selected by the employee is rendering improper or 9inadequate care, the Commission may order the employee to 10select another doctor certified or qualified in the medical 11field for which treatment is required. If the employee refuses 12to make such change the Commission may relieve the employer of 13his obligation to pay the doctor's charges from the date of 14refusal to the date of compliance.15    Any vocational rehabilitation counselors who provide 16service under this Act shall have appropriate certifications 17which designate the counselor as qualified to render opinions 18relating to vocational rehabilitation. Vocational 19rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, counseling 20for job searches, supervising a job search program, and 21vocational retraining including education at an accredited 22learning institution. The employee or employer may petition to 23the Commission to decide disputes relating to vocational 24rehabilitation and the Commission shall resolve any such 25dispute, including payment of the vocational rehabilitation 26program by the employer.  HB1254- 43 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    The maintenance benefit shall not be less than the 2temporary total disability rate determined for the employee. 3In addition, maintenance shall include costs and expenses 4incidental to the vocational rehabilitation program.5    When the employee is working light duty on a part-time 6basis or full-time basis and earns less than he or she would be 7earning if employed in the full capacity of the job or jobs, 8then the employee shall be entitled to temporary partial 9disability benefits. Temporary partial disability benefits 10shall be equal to two-thirds of the difference between the 11average amount that the employee would be able to earn in the 12full performance of his or her duties in the occupation in 13which he or she was engaged at the time of accident and the 14gross amount which he or she is earning in the modified job 15provided to the employee by the employer or in any other job 16that the employee is working.17    Every hospital, physician, surgeon or other person 18rendering treatment or services in accordance with the 19provisions of this Section shall upon written request furnish 20full and complete reports thereof to, and permit their records 21to be copied by, the employer, the employee or his dependents, 22as the case may be, or any other party to any proceeding for 23compensation before the Commission, or their attorneys.24    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer's liability to 25pay for such medical services selected by the employee shall 26be limited to:  HB1254- 44 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        (1) all first aid and emergency treatment; plus2        (2) all medical, surgical and hospital services 3    provided by the physician, surgeon or hospital initially 4    chosen by the employee or by any other physician, 5    consultant, expert, institution or other provider of 6    services recommended by said initial service provider or 7    any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain 8    of referrals from said initial service provider; plus9        (3) all medical, surgical and hospital services 10    provided by any second physician, surgeon or hospital 11    subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other 12    physician, consultant, expert, institution or other 13    provider of services recommended by said second service 14    provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in 15    the chain of referrals from said second service provider. 16    Thereafter the employer shall select and pay for all 17    necessary medical, surgical and hospital treatment and the 18    employee may not select a provider of medical services at 19    the employer's expense unless the employer agrees to such 20    selection. At any time the employee may obtain any medical 21    treatment he desires at his own expense. This paragraph 22    shall not affect the duty to pay for rehabilitation 23    referred to above.24        (4) The following shall apply for injuries occurring 25    on or after June 28, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 26    97-18) and only when an employer has an approved preferred   HB1254- 45 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    provider program pursuant to Section 8.1a on the date the 2    employee sustained his or her accidental injuries:3            (A) The employer shall, in writing, on a form 4        promulgated by the Commission, inform the employee of 5        the preferred provider program;6            (B) Subsequent to the report of an injury by an 7        employee, the employee may choose in writing at any 8        time to decline the preferred provider program, in 9        which case that would constitute one of the two 10        choices of medical providers to which the employee is 11        entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3); and12            (C) Prior to the report of an injury by an 13        employee, when an employee chooses non-emergency 14        treatment from a provider not within the preferred 15        provider program, that would constitute the employee's 16        one choice of medical providers to which the employee 17        is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3). 18    When an employer and employee so agree in writing, nothing 19in this Act prevents an employee whose injury or disability 20has been established under this Act, from relying in good 21faith, on treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone, in 22accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church 23or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner 24thereof, and having nursing services appropriate therewith, 25without suffering loss or diminution of the compensation 26benefits under this Act. However, the employee shall submit to   HB1254- 46 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1all physical examinations required by this Act. The cost of 2such treatment and nursing care shall be paid by the employee 3unless the employer agrees to make such payment.4    Where the accidental injury results in the amputation of 5an arm, hand, leg or foot, or the enucleation of an eye, or the 6loss of any of the natural teeth, the employer shall furnish an 7artificial of any such members lost or damaged in accidental 8injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and 9shall also furnish the necessary braces in all proper and 10necessary cases. In cases of the loss of a member or members by 11amputation, the employer shall, whenever necessary, maintain 12in good repair, refit or replace the artificial limbs during 13the lifetime of the employee. Where the accidental injury 14accompanied by physical injury results in damage to a denture, 15eye glasses or contact eye lenses, or where the accidental 16injury results in damage to an artificial member, the employer 17shall replace or repair such denture, glasses, lenses, or 18artificial member.19    The furnishing by the employer of any such services or 20appliances is not an admission of liability on the part of the 21employer to pay compensation.22    The furnishing of any such services or appliances or the 23servicing thereof by the employer is not the payment of 24compensation.25    (b) If the period of temporary total incapacity for work 26lasts more than 3 working days, weekly compensation as   HB1254- 47 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1hereinafter provided shall be paid beginning on the 4th day of 2such temporary total incapacity and continuing as long as the 3total temporary incapacity lasts. In cases where the temporary 4total incapacity for work continues for a period of 14 days or 5more from the day of the accident compensation shall commence 6on the day after the accident.7        1. The compensation rate for temporary total 8    incapacity under this paragraph (b) of this Section shall 9    be equal to 66 2/3% of the employee's average weekly wage 10    computed in accordance with Section 10, provided that it 11    shall be not less than 66 2/3% of the sum of the Federal 12    minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act, or the 13    Illinois minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law, 14    whichever is more, multiplied by 40 hours. This percentage 15    rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse and child, 16    not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage calculation, 17    nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage computed in 18    accordance with the provisions of Section 10, whichever is 19    less.20        2. The compensation rate in all cases other than for 21    temporary total disability under this paragraph (b), and 22    other than for serious and permanent disfigurement under 23    paragraph (c) and other than for permanent partial 24    disability under subparagraph (2) of paragraph (d) or 25    under paragraph (e), of this Section shall be equal to 66 26    2/3% of the employee's average weekly wage computed in   HB1254- 48 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    accordance with the provisions of Section 10, provided 2    that it shall be not less than 66 2/3% of the sum of the 3    Federal minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards Act, 4    or the Illinois minimum wage under the Minimum Wage Law, 5    whichever is more, multiplied by 40 hours. This percentage 6    rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse and child, 7    not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage calculation, 8    nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage computed in 9    accordance with the provisions of Section 10, whichever is 10    less.11        2.1. The compensation rate in all cases of serious and 12    permanent disfigurement under paragraph (c) and of 13    permanent partial disability under subparagraph (2) of 14    paragraph (d) or under paragraph (e) of this Section shall 15    be equal to 60% of the employee's average weekly wage 16    computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, 17    provided that it shall be not less than 66 2/3% of the sum 18    of the Federal minimum wage under the Fair Labor Standards 19    Act, or the Illinois minimum wage under the Minimum Wage 20    Law, whichever is more, multiplied by 40 hours. This 21    percentage rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse 22    and child, not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage 23    calculation, nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage 24    computed in accordance with the provisions of Section 10, 25    whichever is less.26        3. As used in this Section the term "child" means a   HB1254- 49 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    child of the employee including any child legally adopted 2    before the accident or whom at the time of the accident the 3    employee was under legal obligation to support or to whom 4    the employee stood in loco parentis, and who at the time of 5    the accident was under 18 years of age and not 6    emancipated. The term "children" means the plural of 7    "child".8        4. All weekly compensation rates provided under 9    subparagraphs 1, 2 and 2.1 of this paragraph (b) of this 10    Section shall be subject to the following limitations:11        The maximum weekly compensation rate from July 1, 12    1975, except as hereinafter provided, shall be 100% of the 13    State's average weekly wage in covered industries under 14    the Unemployment Insurance Act, that being the wage that 15    most closely approximates the State's average weekly wage.16        The maximum weekly compensation rate, for the period 17    July 1, 1984, through June 30, 1987, except as hereinafter 18    provided, shall be $293.61.

For every decibel of loss 20        exceeding 30 decibels an allowance of 1.82% shall be 21        made up to the maximum of 100% which is reached at 85 22        decibels.23            (d) If a hearing loss is established to have 24        existed on July 1, 1975 by audiometric testing the 25        employer shall not be liable for the previous loss so 26        established nor shall he be liable for any loss for   HB1254- 67 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        which compensation has been paid or awarded.2            (e) No consideration shall be given to the 3        question of whether or not the ability of an employee 4        to understand speech is improved by the use of a 5        hearing aid.6            (f) No claim for loss of hearing due to industrial 7        noise shall be brought against an employer or allowed 8        unless the employee has been exposed for a period of 9        time sufficient to cause permanent impairment to noise 10        levels in excess of the following: 11Sound Level DBA12Slow ResponseHours Per Day13908149261595416973171002181021-1/2191051201101/2211151/422        This subparagraph (f) shall not be applied in cases of 23    hearing loss resulting from trauma or explosion.24        17. In computing the compensation to be paid to any 25    employee who, before the accident for which he claims 26    compensation, had before that time sustained an injury   HB1254- 68 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    resulting in the loss by amputation or partial loss by 2    amputation of any member, including hand, arm, thumb or 3    fingers, leg, foot or any toes, such loss or partial loss 4    of any such member shall be deducted from any award made 5    for the subsequent injury. For the permanent loss of use 6    or the permanent partial loss of use of any such member or 7    the partial loss of sight of an eye, for which 8    compensation has been paid, then such loss shall be taken 9    into consideration and deducted from any award for the 10    subsequent injury.11        18. The specific case of loss of both hands, both 12    arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any 13    two thereof, or the permanent and complete loss of the use 14    thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be 15    compensated according to the compensation fixed by 16    paragraph (f) of this Section. These specific cases of 17    total and permanent disability do not exclude other cases.18        Any employee who has previously suffered the loss or 19    permanent and complete loss of the use of any of such 20    members, and in a subsequent independent accident loses 21    another or suffers the permanent and complete loss of the 22    use of any one of such members the employer for whom the 23    injured employee is working at the time of the last 24    independent accident is liable to pay compensation only 25    for the loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of 26    the member occasioned by the last independent accident.  HB1254- 69 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1        19. In a case of specific loss and the subsequent 2    death of such injured employee from other causes than such 3    injury leaving a widow, widower, or dependents surviving 4    before payment or payment in full for such injury, then 5    the amount due for such injury is payable to the widow or 6    widower and, if there be no widow or widower, then to such 7    dependents, in the proportion which such dependency bears 8    to total dependency.9    Beginning July 1, 1980, and every 6 months thereafter, the 10Commission shall examine the Second Injury Fund and when, 11after deducting all advances or loans made to such Fund, the 12amount therein is $500,000 then the amount required to be paid 13by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 14reduced by one-half. When the Second Injury Fund reaches the 15sum of $600,000 then the payments shall cease entirely. 16However, when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to 17$400,000, payment of one-half of the amounts required by 18paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 19herein provided, and when the Second Injury Fund has been 20reduced to $300,000, payment of the full amounts required by 21paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 22herein provided. The Commission shall make the changes in 23payment effective by general order, and the changes in payment 24become immediately effective for all cases coming before the 25Commission thereafter either by settlement agreement or final 26order, irrespective of the date of the accidental injury.  HB1254- 70 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    On August 1, 1996 and on February 1 and August 1 of each 2subsequent year, the Commission shall examine the special fund 3designated as the "Rate Adjustment Fund" and when, after 4deducting all advances or loans made to said fund, the amount 5therein is $4,000,000, the amount required to be paid by 6employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 7reduced by one-half. When the Rate Adjustment Fund reaches the 8sum of $5,000,000 the payment therein shall cease entirely. 9However, when said Rate Adjustment Fund has been reduced to 10$3,000,000 the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 11shall be resumed in the manner herein provided.12    (f) In case of complete disability, which renders the 13employee wholly and permanently incapable of work, or in the 14specific case of total and permanent disability as provided in 15subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section, compensation 16shall be payable at the rate provided in subparagraph 2 of 17paragraph (b) of this Section for life.18    An employee entitled to benefits under paragraph (f) of 19this Section shall also be entitled to receive from the Rate 20Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of the 21supplementary benefits provided in paragraph (g) of this 22Section 8.23    If any employee who receives an award under this paragraph 24afterwards returns to work or is able to do so, and earns or is 25able to earn as much as before the accident, payments under 26such award shall cease. If such employee returns to work, or is   HB1254- 71 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1able to do so, and earns or is able to earn part but not as 2much as before the accident, such award shall be modified so as 3to conform to an award under paragraph (d) of this Section. If 4such award is terminated or reduced under the provisions of 5this paragraph, such employees have the right at any time 6within 30 months after the date of such termination or 7reduction to file petition with the Commission for the purpose 8of determining whether any disability exists as a result of 9the original accidental injury and the extent thereof.10    Disability as enumerated in subdivision 18, paragraph (e) 11of this Section is considered complete disability.12    If an employee who had previously incurred loss or the 13permanent and complete loss of use of one member, through the 14loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one hand, 15one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent and 16complete disability through the loss or the permanent and 17complete loss of the use of another member, he shall receive, 18in addition to the compensation payable by the employer and 19after such payments have ceased, an amount from the Second 20Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7, which, 21together with the compensation payable from the employer in 22whose employ he was when the last accidental injury was 23incurred, will equal the amount payable for permanent and 24complete disability as provided in this paragraph of this 25Section.26    The custodian of the Second Injury Fund provided for in   HB1254- 72 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be joined with the employer as 2a party respondent in the application for adjustment of claim. 3The application for adjustment of claim shall state briefly 4and in general terms the approximate time and place and manner 5of the loss of the first member.6    In its award the Commission or the Arbitrator shall 7specifically find the amount the injured employee shall be 8weekly paid, the number of weeks compensation which shall be 9paid by the employer, the date upon which payments begin out of 10the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of 11Section 7 of this Act, the length of time the weekly payments 12continue, the date upon which the pension payments commence 13and the monthly amount of the payments. The Commission shall 1430 days after the date upon which payments out of the Second 15Injury Fund have begun as provided in the award, and every 16month thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Comptroller 17a voucher for payment for all compensation accrued to that 18date at the rate fixed by the Commission. The State 19Comptroller shall draw a warrant to the injured employee along 20with a receipt to be executed by the injured employee and 21returned to the Commission. The endorsed warrant and receipt 22is a full and complete acquittance to the Commission for the 23payment out of the Second Injury Fund. No other appropriation 24or warrant is necessary for payment out of the Second Injury 25Fund. The Second Injury Fund is appropriated for the purpose 26of making payments according to the terms of the awards.  HB1254- 73 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1    As of July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1982, all claims against and 2obligations of the Second Injury Fund shall become claims 3against and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund to the 4extent there is insufficient money in the Second Injury Fund 5to pay such claims and obligations. In that case, all 6references to "Second Injury Fund" in this Section shall also 7include the Rate Adjustment Fund.8    (g) Every award for permanent total disability entered by 9the Commission on and after July 1, 1965 under which 10compensation payments shall become due and payable after the 11effective date of this amendatory Act, and every award for 12death benefits or permanent total disability entered by the 13Commission on and after the effective date of this amendatory 14Act shall be subject to annual adjustments as to the amount of 15the compensation rate therein provided. Such adjustments shall 16first be made on July 15, 1977, and all awards made and entered 17prior to July 1, 1975 and on July 15 of each year thereafter. 18In all other cases such adjustment shall be made on July 15 of 19the second year next following the date of the entry of the 20award and shall further be made on July 15 annually 21thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of 22the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there 23shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage 24in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 25the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately 26increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase   HB1254- 74 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under 2the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the 3compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring 4the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the 5prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment 6is made. Such increase shall be paid in the same manner as 7herein provided for payments under the Second Injury Fund to 8the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, 9out of the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of 10Section 7 of this Act. Payments shall be made at the same 11intervals as provided in the award or, at the option of the 12Commission, may be made in quarterly payment on the 15th day of 13January, April, July and October of each year. In the event of 14a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change 15in the then existing compensation rate. The within paragraph 16shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and 17in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer 18and the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may 19be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' 20Compensation Commission.21    Provided, that in cases of awards entered by the 22Commission for injuries occurring before July 1, 1975, the 23increases in the compensation rate adjusted under the 24foregoing provision of this paragraph (g) shall be limited to 25increases in the State's average weekly wage in covered 26industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act occurring   HB1254- 75 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1after July 1, 1975.2    For every accident occurring on or after July 20, 2005 but 3before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 4General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General 5Assembly), the annual adjustments to the compensation rate in 6awards for death benefits or permanent total disability, as 7provided in this Act, shall be paid by the employer. The 8adjustment shall be made by the employer on July 15 of the 9second year next following the date of the entry of the award 10and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If 11during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the 12award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been 13an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 14industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the employer 15shall increase the weekly compensation rate proportionately by 16the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the 17State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the 18Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation 19rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total 20compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing 21maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. In 22the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall 23be no change in the then existing compensation rate. Such 24increase shall be paid by the employer in the same manner and 25at the same intervals as the payment of compensation in the 26award. This paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is   HB1254- 76 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum 2settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or 3his or her dependents, as the case may be, has been duly 4approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.5    The annual adjustments for every award of death benefits 6or permanent total disability involving accidents occurring 7before July 20, 2005 and accidents occurring on or after the 8effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General 9Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly) shall 10continue to be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund pursuant to 11this paragraph and Section 7(f) of this Act. 12    (h) In case death occurs from any cause before the total 13compensation to which the employee would have been entitled 14has been paid, then in case the employee leaves any widow, 15widower, child, parent (or any grandchild, grandparent or 16other lineal heir or any collateral heir dependent at the time 17of the accident upon the earnings of the employee to the extent 18of 50% or more of total dependency) such compensation shall be 19paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased employee and 20distributed as provided in paragraph (g) of Section 7.21    (h-1) In case an injured employee is under legal 22disability at the time when any right or privilege accrues to 23him or her under this Act, a guardian may be appointed pursuant 24to law, and may, on behalf of such person under legal 25disability, claim and exercise any such right or privilege 26with the same effect as if the employee himself or herself had   HB1254- 77 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1claimed or exercised the right or privilege. No limitations of 2time provided by this Act run so long as the employee who is 3under legal disability is without a conservator or guardian.4    (i) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age 5at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the 6amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 7(e) and (f) of this Section is increased 50%.8    However, where an employer has on file an employment 9certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law of 2024 or 10work permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor 11Standards Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and 12duly issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is 13conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor 14employee for the purposes of this Section.15    Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions 16of the Child Labor Law of 2024 relating to the employment of 17minors under the age of 16 years.18    (j) 1. In the event the injured employee receives 19benefits, including medical, surgical or hospital benefits 20under any group plan covering non-occupational disabilities 21contributed to wholly or partially by the employer, which 22benefits should not have been payable if any rights of 23recovery existed under this Act, then such amounts so paid to 24the employee from any such group plan as shall be consistent 25with, and limited to, the provisions of paragraph 2 hereof, 26shall be credited to or against any compensation payment for   HB1254- 78 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1temporary total incapacity for work or any medical, surgical 2or hospital benefits made or to be made under this Act. In such 3event, the period of time for giving notice of accidental 4injury and filing application for adjustment of claim does not 5commence to run until the termination of such payments. This 6paragraph does not apply to payments made under any group plan 7which would have been payable irrespective of an accidental 8injury under this Act. Any employer receiving such credit 9shall keep such employee safe and harmless from any and all 10claims or liabilities that may be made against him by reason of 11having received such payments only to the extent of such 12credit.13    Any excess benefits paid to or on behalf of a State 14employee by the State Employees' Retirement System under 15Article 14 of the Illinois Pension Code on a death claim or 16disputed disability claim shall be credited against any 17payments made or to be made by the State of Illinois to or on 18behalf of such employee under this Act, except for payments 19for medical expenses which have already been incurred at the 20time of the award. The State of Illinois shall directly 21reimburse the State Employees' Retirement System to the extent 22of such credit.23    2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to 24give the employer or the insurance carrier the right to credit 25for any benefits or payments received by the employee other 26than compensation payments provided by this Act, and where the   HB1254- 79 -LRB104 03226 SPS 13248 b1employee receives payments other than compensation payments, 2whether as full or partial salary, group insurance benefits, 3bonuses, annuities or any other payments, the employer or 4insurance carrier shall receive credit for each such payment 5only to the extent of the compensation that would have been 6payable during the period covered by such payment.7    3. The extension of time for the filing of an Application 8for Adjustment of Claim as provided in paragraph 1 above shall 9not apply to those cases where the time for such filing had 10expired prior to the date on which payments or benefits 11enumerated herein have been initiated or resumed. Provided 12however that this paragraph 3 shall apply only to cases 13wherein the payments or benefits hereinabove enumerated shall 14be received after July 1, 1969.15(Source: P.A. 103-721, eff. 1-1-25.) 16    Section 95.
