It is not necessary for 3such district to also be the administrative district for the 4joint agreement, nor is it necessary for the same district to 5be designated as the issuer of all series of bonds or notes 6issued hereunder. Any district so designated may, from time to 7time, borrow money and, in evidence of its obligation to repay 8the borrowing, issue its negotiable bonds or notes for the 9purpose of acquiring, constructing, altering, repairing, 10enlarging and equipping any building or portion thereof, 11together with any land or interest therein, necessary to 12provide special educational facilities and services as defined 13in Section 14-1.08.

The resolution shall be effective 20immediately upon its adoption.21    Prior to the issuance of such bonds or notes, each school 22district that is a party to the joint agreement shall agree, 23whether by amendment to the joint agreement or by resolution 24of the board of education, to be jointly and severally liable 25for the payment of the bonds and notes. The bonds or notes 26shall be payable solely and only from the payments made   HB2390- 7 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1pursuant to such agreement.2    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the 3bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an 4indebtedness of any district, including the issuing district, 5within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory 6limitation.7    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, 8the agreement by a district to pay the bonds and notes shall be 9irrevocable notwithstanding the district's withdrawal from 10membership in the joint special education program.11    (e) If a district whose employees are on strike was, prior 12to the strike, sending students with disabilities to special 13educational facilities and services in another district or 14cooperative, the district affected by the strike shall 15continue to send such students during the strike and shall be 16eligible to receive appropriate State reimbursement.17    (f) With respect to those joint agreements that have a 18governing board composed of one member of the school board of 19each cooperating district and designated by those boards to 20act in accordance with the joint agreement, the governing 21board shall have, in addition to its other powers under this 22Section, the authority to issue bonds or notes for the 23purposes and in the manner provided in this subsection.

The resolution may contain 11such covenants as may be deemed necessary or advisable by the 12governing board to assure the payment of the bonds or notes and 13interest accruing thereon. The resolution shall be effective 14immediately upon its adoption.15    Each school district that is a party to the joint 16agreement shall be automatically liable, by virtue of its 17membership in the joint agreement, for its proportionate share 18of the principal amount of the bonds and notes plus interest 19accruing thereon, as provided in the resolution. Subject to 20the joint and several liability hereinafter provided for, the 21resolution may provide for different payment schedules for 22different districts except that the aggregate amount of 23scheduled payments for each district shall be equal to its 24proportionate share of the debt service in the bonds or notes 25based upon the fraction that its equalized assessed valuation 26bears to the total equalized assessed valuation of all the   HB2390- 9 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1district members of the joint agreement as adjusted in the 2manner hereinafter provided. In computing that fraction the 3most recent available equalized assessed valuation at the time 4of the issuance of the bonds and notes shall be used, and the 5equalized assessed valuation of any district maintaining 6grades K to 12 shall be doubled in both the numerator and 7denominator of the fraction used for all of the districts that 8are members of the joint agreement. In case of default in 9payment by any member, each school district that is a party to 10the joint agreement shall automatically be jointly and 11severally liable for the amount of any deficiency. The bonds 12or notes and interest thereon shall be payable solely and only 13from the funds made available pursuant to the procedures set 14forth in this subsection. No project authorized under this 15subsection may require an annual contribution for bond 16payments from any member district in excess of 0.15% of the 17value of taxable property as equalized or assessed by the 18Department of Revenue in the case of districts maintaining 19grades K-8 or 9-12 and 0.30% of the value of taxable property 20as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue in the 21case of districts maintaining grades K-12. This limitation on 22taxing authority is expressly applicable to taxing authority 23provided under Section 17-9 and other applicable Sections of 24this Act. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be 25construed as an exception to the property tax limitations 26contained in Section 17-2, 17-2.2a, 17-5, or any other   HB2390- 10 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1applicable Section of this Act.2    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the 3bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an 4indebtedness of any district within the meaning of any 5constitutional or statutory limitation.6    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, 7the obligation of a district to pay its proportionate share of 8the principal of and interest on the bonds and notes as 9required in this Section shall be a general obligation of the 10district payable from any and all sources of revenue 11designated for that purpose by the board of education of the 12district and shall be irrevocable notwithstanding the 13district's withdrawal from membership in the joint special 14education program.15    (g) A member district wishing to withdraw from a joint 16agreement may obtain from its school board a written 17resolution approving the withdrawal. The withdrawing district 18must then present a written petition for withdrawal from the 19joint agreement to the other member districts. Under no 20circumstances may the petition be presented to the other 21member districts less than 12 months from the date of the 22proposed withdrawal, unless the member districts agree to 23waive this timeline. Upon approval by school board written 24resolution of all of the remaining member districts, the 25petitioning member district shall notify the State Board of 26Education of the approved withdrawal in writing and must   HB2390- 11 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1submit a comprehensive plan developed under subsection (g-5) 2for review by the State Board. If the petition for withdrawal 3is not approved, the petitioning member district may appeal 4the disapproval decision to the trustees of schools of the 5township that has jurisdiction and authority over the 6withdrawing district. If a withdrawing district is not under 7the jurisdiction and authority of the trustees of schools of a 8township, a hearing panel shall be established by the chief 9administrative officer of the intermediate service center 10having jurisdiction over the withdrawing district. The hearing 11panel shall be made up of 3 persons who have a demonstrated 12interest and background in education. Each hearing panel 13member must reside within an educational service region of 142,000,000 or more inhabitants but not within the withdrawing 15district and may not be a current school board member or 16employee of the withdrawing district or hold any county 17office.

Subject to 20the joint and several liability hereinafter provided for, the 21resolution may provide for different payment schedules for 22different districts except that the aggregate amount of 23scheduled payments for each district shall be equal to its 24proportionate share of the debt service in the bonds or notes 25based upon the fraction that its equalized assessed valuation 26bears to the total equalized assessed valuation of all the   HB2390- 9 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1district members of the joint agreement as adjusted in the 2manner hereinafter provided.
