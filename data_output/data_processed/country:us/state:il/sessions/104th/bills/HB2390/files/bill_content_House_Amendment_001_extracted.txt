The changes to this Section made by 3Public Act 96-769 apply to all changes to special education 4joint agreement membership initiated after July 1, 2009.5    (b) To either (1) designate an administrative district to 6act as fiscal and legal agent for the districts that are 7parties to the joint agreement, or (2) designate a governing 8board composed of one member of the school board of each 9cooperating district and designated by such boards to act in 10accordance with the joint agreement. No such governing board 11may levy taxes and no such governing board may incur any 12indebtedness except within an annual budget for the joint 13agreement approved by the governing board and by the boards of 14at least a majority of the cooperating school districts or a 15number of districts greater than a majority if required by the 16joint agreement. The governing board may appoint an executive 17board of at least 7 members to administer the joint agreement 18in accordance with its terms. However, if 7 or more school 19districts are parties to a joint agreement that does not have 20an administrative district: (i) at least a majority of the 21members appointed by the governing board to the executive 22board shall be members of the school boards of the cooperating 23districts; or (ii) if the governing board wishes to appoint 24members who are not school board members, they shall be 25superintendents from the cooperating districts.26    (c) To employ a full-time director of special education of   10400HB2390ham001- 5 -LRB104 08356 LNS 24086 a1the joint agreement program under a one-year or multi-year 2contract.

Notice of intent 12not to renew the contract must be given by the controlling 13board or the administrative district at least 90 days before 14the contract expires. Failure to do so will automatically 15extend the contract for one additional year.16    By accepting the terms of the contract, the director of a 17special education joint agreement waives all rights granted 18under Sections 24-11 through 24-16 for the duration of his or 19her employment as a director of a special education joint 20agreement.21    (d) To designate a district that is a party to the joint 22agreement as the issuer of bonds or notes for the purposes and 23in the manner provided in this Section.

Any district so designated may, from time to 2time, borrow money and, in evidence of its obligation to repay 3the borrowing, issue its negotiable bonds or notes for the 4purpose of acquiring, constructing, altering, repairing, 5enlarging and equipping any building or portion thereof, 6together with any land or interest therein, necessary to 7provide special educational facilities and services as defined 8in Section 14-1.08. Title in and to any such facilities shall 9be held in accordance with the joint agreement.10    Any such bonds or notes shall be authorized by a 11resolution of the board of education of the issuing district. 12The resolution may contain such covenants as may be deemed 13necessary or advisable by the district to assure the payment 14of the bonds or notes. The resolution shall be effective 15immediately upon its adoption.16    Prior to the issuance of such bonds or notes, each school 17district that is a party to the joint agreement shall agree, 18whether by amendment to the joint agreement or by resolution 19of the board of education, to be jointly and severally liable 20for the payment of the bonds and notes. The bonds or notes 21shall be payable solely and only from the payments made 22pursuant to such agreement.23    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the 24bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an 25indebtedness of any district, including the issuing district, 26within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory   10400HB2390ham001- 7 -LRB104 08356 LNS 24086 a1limitation.2    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, 3the agreement by a district to pay the bonds and notes shall be 4irrevocable notwithstanding the district's withdrawal from 5membership in the joint special education program.6    (e) If a district whose employees are on strike was, prior 7to the strike, sending students with disabilities to special 8educational facilities and services in another district or 9cooperative, the district affected by the strike shall 10continue to send such students during the strike and shall be 11eligible to receive appropriate State reimbursement.12    (f) With respect to those joint agreements that have a 13governing board composed of one member of the school board of 14each cooperating district and designated by those boards to 15act in accordance with the joint agreement, the governing 16board shall have, in addition to its other powers under this 17Section, the authority to issue bonds or notes for the 18purposes and in the manner provided in this subsection.

The resolution may contain 6such covenants as may be deemed necessary or advisable by the 7governing board to assure the payment of the bonds or notes and 8interest accruing thereon. The resolution shall be effective 9immediately upon its adoption.10    Each school district that is a party to the joint 11agreement shall be automatically liable, by virtue of its 12membership in the joint agreement, for its proportionate share 13of the principal amount of the bonds and notes plus interest 14accruing thereon, as provided in the resolution. Subject to 15the joint and several liability hereinafter provided for, the 16resolution may provide for different payment schedules for 17different districts except that the aggregate amount of 18scheduled payments for each district shall be equal to its 19proportionate share of the debt service in the bonds or notes 20based upon the fraction that its equalized assessed valuation 21bears to the total equalized assessed valuation of all the 22district members of the joint agreement as adjusted in the 23manner hereinafter provided. In computing that fraction the 24most recent available equalized assessed valuation at the time 25of the issuance of the bonds and notes shall be used, and the 26equalized assessed valuation of any district maintaining   10400HB2390ham001- 9 -LRB104 08356 LNS 24086 a1grades K to 12 shall be doubled in both the numerator and 2denominator of the fraction used for all of the districts that 3are members of the joint agreement. In case of default in 4payment by any member, each school district that is a party to 5the joint agreement shall automatically be jointly and 6severally liable for the amount of any deficiency. The bonds 7or notes and interest thereon shall be payable solely and only 8from the funds made available pursuant to the procedures set 9forth in this subsection. No project authorized under this 10subsection may require an annual contribution for bond 11payments from any member district in excess of 0.15% of the 12value of taxable property as equalized or assessed by the 13Department of Revenue in the case of districts maintaining 14grades K-8 or 9-12 and 0.30% of the value of taxable property 15as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue in the 16case of districts maintaining grades K-12.

Nothing contained in this subsection shall be 20construed as an exception to the property tax limitations 21contained in Section 17-2, 17-2.2a, 17-5, or any other 22applicable Section of this Act.23    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the 24bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an 25indebtedness of any district within the meaning of any 26constitutional or statutory limitation.  10400HB2390ham001- 10 -LRB104 08356 LNS 24086 a1    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, 2the obligation of a district to pay its proportionate share of 3the principal of and interest on the bonds and notes as 4required in this Section shall be a general obligation of the 5district payable from any and all sources of revenue 6designated for that purpose by the board of education of the 7district and shall be irrevocable notwithstanding the 8district's withdrawal from membership in the joint special 9education program.10    (g) A member district wishing to withdraw from a joint 11agreement may obtain from its school board a written 12resolution approving the withdrawal.

The governing board may appoint an executive 17board of at least 7 members to administer the joint agreement 18in accordance with its terms. However, if 7 or more school 19districts are parties to a joint agreement that does not have 20an administrative district: (i) at least a majority of the 21members appointed by the governing board to the executive 22board shall be members of the school boards of the cooperating 23districts; or (ii) if the governing board wishes to appoint 24members who are not school board members, they shall be 25superintendents from the cooperating districts.26    (c) To employ a full-time director of special education of   10400HB2390ham001- 5 -LRB104 08356 LNS 24086 a1the joint agreement program under a one-year or multi-year 2contract.

The resolution shall be effective 15immediately upon its adoption.16    Prior to the issuance of such bonds or notes, each school 17district that is a party to the joint agreement shall agree, 18whether by amendment to the joint agreement or by resolution 19of the board of education, to be jointly and severally liable 20for the payment of the bonds and notes. The bonds or notes 21shall be payable solely and only from the payments made 22pursuant to such agreement.23    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the 24bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an 25indebtedness of any district, including the issuing district, 26within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory   10400HB2390ham001- 7 -LRB104 08356 LNS 24086 a1limitation.2    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, 3the agreement by a district to pay the bonds and notes shall be 4irrevocable notwithstanding the district's withdrawal from 5membership in the joint special education program.6    (e) If a district whose employees are on strike was, prior 7to the strike, sending students with disabilities to special 8educational facilities and services in another district or 9cooperative, the district affected by the strike shall 10continue to send such students during the strike and shall be 11eligible to receive appropriate State reimbursement.12    (f) With respect to those joint agreements that have a 13governing board composed of one member of the school board of 14each cooperating district and designated by those boards to 15act in accordance with the joint agreement, the governing 16board shall have, in addition to its other powers under this 17Section, the authority to issue bonds or notes for the 18purposes and in the manner provided in this subsection.

The resolution may contain 6such covenants as may be deemed necessary or advisable by the 7governing board to assure the payment of the bonds or notes and 8interest accruing thereon. The resolution shall be effective 9immediately upon its adoption.10    Each school district that is a party to the joint 11agreement shall be automatically liable, by virtue of its 12membership in the joint agreement, for its proportionate share 13of the principal amount of the bonds and notes plus interest 14accruing thereon, as provided in the resolution. Subject to 15the joint and several liability hereinafter provided for, the 16resolution may provide for different payment schedules for 17different districts except that the aggregate amount of 18scheduled payments for each district shall be equal to its 19proportionate share of the debt service in the bonds or notes 20based upon the fraction that its equalized assessed valuation 21bears to the total equalized assessed valuation of all the 22district members of the joint agreement as adjusted in the 23manner hereinafter provided. In computing that fraction the 24most recent available equalized assessed valuation at the time 25of the issuance of the bonds and notes shall be used, and the 26equalized assessed valuation of any district maintaining   10400HB2390ham001- 9 -LRB104 08356 LNS 24086 a1grades K to 12 shall be doubled in both the numerator and 2denominator of the fraction used for all of the districts that 3are members of the joint agreement.
