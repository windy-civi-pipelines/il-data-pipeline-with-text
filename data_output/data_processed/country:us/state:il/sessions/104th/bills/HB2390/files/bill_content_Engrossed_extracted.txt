The bonds or notes 14shall be payable solely and only from the payments made 15pursuant to such agreement.16    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the 17bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an 18indebtedness of any district, including the issuing district, 19within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory 20limitation.21    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, 22the agreement by a district to pay the bonds and notes shall be 23irrevocable notwithstanding the district's withdrawal from 24membership in the joint special education program.25    (e) If a district whose employees are on strike was, prior 26to the strike, sending students with disabilities to special   HB2390 Engrossed- 7 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1educational facilities and services in another district or 2cooperative, the district affected by the strike shall 3continue to send such students during the strike and shall be 4eligible to receive appropriate State reimbursement.5    (f) With respect to those joint agreements that have a 6governing board composed of one member of the school board of 7each cooperating district and designated by those boards to 8act in accordance with the joint agreement, the governing 9board shall have, in addition to its other powers under this 10Section, the authority to issue bonds or notes for the 11purposes and in the manner provided in this subsection.

The resolution shall be effective 2immediately upon its adoption.3    Each school district that is a party to the joint 4agreement shall be automatically liable, by virtue of its 5membership in the joint agreement, for its proportionate share 6of the principal amount of the bonds and notes plus interest 7accruing thereon, as provided in the resolution. Subject to 8the joint and several liability hereinafter provided for, the 9resolution may provide for different payment schedules for 10different districts except that the aggregate amount of 11scheduled payments for each district shall be equal to its 12proportionate share of the debt service in the bonds or notes 13based upon the fraction that its equalized assessed valuation 14bears to the total equalized assessed valuation of all the 15district members of the joint agreement as adjusted in the 16manner hereinafter provided. In computing that fraction the 17most recent available equalized assessed valuation at the time 18of the issuance of the bonds and notes shall be used, and the 19equalized assessed valuation of any district maintaining 20grades K to 12 shall be doubled in both the numerator and 21denominator of the fraction used for all of the districts that 22are members of the joint agreement. In case of default in 23payment by any member, each school district that is a party to 24the joint agreement shall automatically be jointly and 25severally liable for the amount of any deficiency. The bonds 26or notes and interest thereon shall be payable solely and only   HB2390 Engrossed- 9 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1from the funds made available pursuant to the procedures set 2forth in this subsection.

Nothing contained in this subsection shall be 13construed as an exception to the property tax limitations 14contained in Section 17-2, 17-2.2a, 17-5, or any other 15applicable Section of this Act.16    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the 17bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an 18indebtedness of any district within the meaning of any 19constitutional or statutory limitation.20    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, 21the obligation of a district to pay its proportionate share of 22the principal of and interest on the bonds and notes as 23required in this Section shall be a general obligation of the 24district payable from any and all sources of revenue 25designated for that purpose by the board of education of the 26district and shall be irrevocable notwithstanding the   HB2390 Engrossed- 10 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1district's withdrawal from membership in the joint special 2education program.3    (g) A member district wishing to withdraw from a joint 4agreement may obtain from its school board a written 5resolution approving the withdrawal.

If a withdrawing district is not under 21the jurisdiction and authority of the trustees of schools of a 22township, a hearing panel shall be established by the chief 23administrative officer of the intermediate service center 24having jurisdiction over the withdrawing district. The hearing 25panel shall be made up of 3 persons who have a demonstrated 26interest and background in education.

The resolution shall be effective 8immediately upon its adoption.9    Prior to the issuance of such bonds or notes, each school 10district that is a party to the joint agreement shall agree, 11whether by amendment to the joint agreement or by resolution 12of the board of education, to be jointly and severally liable 13for the payment of the bonds and notes. The bonds or notes 14shall be payable solely and only from the payments made 15pursuant to such agreement.16    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the 17bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an 18indebtedness of any district, including the issuing district, 19within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory 20limitation.21    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, 22the agreement by a district to pay the bonds and notes shall be 23irrevocable notwithstanding the district's withdrawal from 24membership in the joint special education program.25    (e) If a district whose employees are on strike was, prior 26to the strike, sending students with disabilities to special   HB2390 Engrossed- 7 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1educational facilities and services in another district or 2cooperative, the district affected by the strike shall 3continue to send such students during the strike and shall be 4eligible to receive appropriate State reimbursement.5    (f) With respect to those joint agreements that have a 6governing board composed of one member of the school board of 7each cooperating district and designated by those boards to 8act in accordance with the joint agreement, the governing 9board shall have, in addition to its other powers under this 10Section, the authority to issue bonds or notes for the 11purposes and in the manner provided in this subsection.

The resolution shall be effective 2immediately upon its adoption.3    Each school district that is a party to the joint 4agreement shall be automatically liable, by virtue of its 5membership in the joint agreement, for its proportionate share 6of the principal amount of the bonds and notes plus interest 7accruing thereon, as provided in the resolution. Subject to 8the joint and several liability hereinafter provided for, the 9resolution may provide for different payment schedules for 10different districts except that the aggregate amount of 11scheduled payments for each district shall be equal to its 12proportionate share of the debt service in the bonds or notes 13based upon the fraction that its equalized assessed valuation 14bears to the total equalized assessed valuation of all the 15district members of the joint agreement as adjusted in the 16manner hereinafter provided. In computing that fraction the 17most recent available equalized assessed valuation at the time 18of the issuance of the bonds and notes shall be used, and the 19equalized assessed valuation of any district maintaining 20grades K to 12 shall be doubled in both the numerator and 21denominator of the fraction used for all of the districts that 22are members of the joint agreement. In case of default in 23payment by any member, each school district that is a party to 24the joint agreement shall automatically be jointly and 25severally liable for the amount of any deficiency.

If a withdrawing district is not under 21the jurisdiction and authority of the trustees of schools of a 22township, a hearing panel shall be established by the chief 23administrative officer of the intermediate service center 24having jurisdiction over the withdrawing district. The hearing 25panel shall be made up of 3 persons who have a demonstrated 26interest and background in education.
