Petitions for 24withdrawal shall be made to the regional board or boards of 25school trustees exercising oversight or governance over any of 26the districts in the joint agreement.

The changes to this Section made by 22Public Act 96-769 apply to all changes to special education 23joint agreement membership initiated after July 1, 2009.24    (b) To either (1) designate an administrative district to 25act as fiscal and legal agent for the districts that are 26parties to the joint agreement, or (2) designate a governing   HB2390 Enrolled- 4 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1board composed of one member of the school board of each 2cooperating district and designated by such boards to act in 3accordance with the joint agreement. No such governing board 4may levy taxes and no such governing board may incur any 5indebtedness except within an annual budget for the joint 6agreement approved by the governing board and by the boards of 7at least a majority of the cooperating school districts or a 8number of districts greater than a majority if required by the 9joint agreement. The governing board may appoint an executive 10board of at least 7 members to administer the joint agreement 11in accordance with its terms. However, if 7 or more school 12districts are parties to a joint agreement that does not have 13an administrative district: (i) at least a majority of the 14members appointed by the governing board to the executive 15board shall be members of the school boards of the cooperating 16districts; or (ii) if the governing board wishes to appoint 17members who are not school board members, they shall be 18superintendents from the cooperating districts.19    (c) To employ a full-time director of special education of 20the joint agreement program under a one-year or multi-year 21contract. No such contract can be offered or accepted for less 22than one year. Such contract may be discontinued at any time by 23mutual agreement of the contracting parties, or may be 24extended for an additional one-year or multi-year period at 25the end of any year.26    The contract year is July 1 through the following June   HB2390 Enrolled- 5 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b130th, unless the contract specifically provides otherwise. 2Notice of intent not to renew a contract when given by a 3controlling board or administrative district must be in 4writing stating the specific reason therefor. Notice of intent 5not to renew the contract must be given by the controlling 6board or the administrative district at least 90 days before 7the contract expires. Failure to do so will automatically 8extend the contract for one additional year.9    By accepting the terms of the contract, the director of a 10special education joint agreement waives all rights granted 11under Sections 24-11 through 24-16 for the duration of his or 12her employment as a director of a special education joint 13agreement.14    (d) To designate a district that is a party to the joint 15agreement as the issuer of bonds or notes for the purposes and 16in the manner provided in this Section. It is not necessary for 17such district to also be the administrative district for the 18joint agreement, nor is it necessary for the same district to 19be designated as the issuer of all series of bonds or notes 20issued hereunder. Any district so designated may, from time to 21time, borrow money and, in evidence of its obligation to repay 22the borrowing, issue its negotiable bonds or notes for the 23purpose of acquiring, constructing, altering, repairing, 24enlarging and equipping any building or portion thereof, 25together with any land or interest therein, necessary to 26provide special educational facilities and services as defined   HB2390 Enrolled- 6 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1in Section 14-1.08.

The bonds or notes 14shall be payable solely and only from the payments made 15pursuant to such agreement.16    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the 17bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an 18indebtedness of any district, including the issuing district, 19within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory 20limitation.21    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, 22the agreement by a district to pay the bonds and notes shall be 23irrevocable notwithstanding the district's withdrawal from 24membership in the joint special education program.25    (e) If a district whose employees are on strike was, prior 26to the strike, sending students with disabilities to special   HB2390 Enrolled- 7 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1educational facilities and services in another district or 2cooperative, the district affected by the strike shall 3continue to send such students during the strike and shall be 4eligible to receive appropriate State reimbursement.5    (f) With respect to those joint agreements that have a 6governing board composed of one member of the school board of 7each cooperating district and designated by those boards to 8act in accordance with the joint agreement, the governing 9board shall have, in addition to its other powers under this 10Section, the authority to issue bonds or notes for the 11purposes and in the manner provided in this subsection.

The resolution shall be effective 2immediately upon its adoption.3    Each school district that is a party to the joint 4agreement shall be automatically liable, by virtue of its 5membership in the joint agreement, for its proportionate share 6of the principal amount of the bonds and notes plus interest 7accruing thereon, as provided in the resolution. Subject to 8the joint and several liability hereinafter provided for, the 9resolution may provide for different payment schedules for 10different districts except that the aggregate amount of 11scheduled payments for each district shall be equal to its 12proportionate share of the debt service in the bonds or notes 13based upon the fraction that its equalized assessed valuation 14bears to the total equalized assessed valuation of all the 15district members of the joint agreement as adjusted in the 16manner hereinafter provided. In computing that fraction the 17most recent available equalized assessed valuation at the time 18of the issuance of the bonds and notes shall be used, and the 19equalized assessed valuation of any district maintaining 20grades K to 12 shall be doubled in both the numerator and 21denominator of the fraction used for all of the districts that 22are members of the joint agreement. In case of default in 23payment by any member, each school district that is a party to 24the joint agreement shall automatically be jointly and 25severally liable for the amount of any deficiency. The bonds 26or notes and interest thereon shall be payable solely and only   HB2390 Enrolled- 9 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1from the funds made available pursuant to the procedures set 2forth in this subsection.

Nothing contained in this subsection shall be 13construed as an exception to the property tax limitations 14contained in Section 17-2, 17-2.2a, 17-5, or any other 15applicable Section of this Act.16    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the 17bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an 18indebtedness of any district within the meaning of any 19constitutional or statutory limitation.20    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, 21the obligation of a district to pay its proportionate share of 22the principal of and interest on the bonds and notes as 23required in this Section shall be a general obligation of the 24district payable from any and all sources of revenue 25designated for that purpose by the board of education of the 26district and shall be irrevocable notwithstanding the   HB2390 Enrolled- 10 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1district's withdrawal from membership in the joint special 2education program.3    (g) A member district wishing to withdraw from a joint 4agreement may obtain from its school board a written 5resolution approving the withdrawal.

The bonds or notes 14shall be payable solely and only from the payments made 15pursuant to such agreement.16    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the 17bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an 18indebtedness of any district, including the issuing district, 19within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory 20limitation.21    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, 22the agreement by a district to pay the bonds and notes shall be 23irrevocable notwithstanding the district's withdrawal from 24membership in the joint special education program.25    (e) If a district whose employees are on strike was, prior 26to the strike, sending students with disabilities to special   HB2390 Enrolled- 7 -LRB104 08356 LNS 18407 b1educational facilities and services in another district or 2cooperative, the district affected by the strike shall 3continue to send such students during the strike and shall be 4eligible to receive appropriate State reimbursement.5    (f) With respect to those joint agreements that have a 6governing board composed of one member of the school board of 7each cooperating district and designated by those boards to 8act in accordance with the joint agreement, the governing 9board shall have, in addition to its other powers under this 10Section, the authority to issue bonds or notes for the 11purposes and in the manner provided in this subsection.

The resolution shall be effective 2immediately upon its adoption.3    Each school district that is a party to the joint 4agreement shall be automatically liable, by virtue of its 5membership in the joint agreement, for its proportionate share 6of the principal amount of the bonds and notes plus interest 7accruing thereon, as provided in the resolution. Subject to 8the joint and several liability hereinafter provided for, the 9resolution may provide for different payment schedules for 10different districts except that the aggregate amount of 11scheduled payments for each district shall be equal to its 12proportionate share of the debt service in the bonds or notes 13based upon the fraction that its equalized assessed valuation 14bears to the total equalized assessed valuation of all the 15district members of the joint agreement as adjusted in the 16manner hereinafter provided. In computing that fraction the 17most recent available equalized assessed valuation at the time 18of the issuance of the bonds and notes shall be used, and the 19equalized assessed valuation of any district maintaining 20grades K to 12 shall be doubled in both the numerator and 21denominator of the fraction used for all of the districts that 22are members of the joint agreement. In case of default in 23payment by any member, each school district that is a party to 24the joint agreement shall automatically be jointly and 25severally liable for the amount of any deficiency.
