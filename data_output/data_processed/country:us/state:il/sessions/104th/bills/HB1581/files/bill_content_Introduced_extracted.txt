Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Adequate and Equitable Public University Funding Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly makes all of the 7following findings:8        (1) A thriving postsecondary education system enriches 9    the State and its residents.10        (2) Illinois requires an adequate, equitable, and 11    stable approach to funding public universities.12        (3) Historic inequities in university funding underlie 13    current gaps in access, retention, and attainment among 14    different groups of students in this State.15        (4) The State must seek to reduce on behalf of 16    underserved students the significant disparities in public 17    university access, affordability, and measures of 18    retention, progress, and degree completion, by, among 19    other things, addressing the influence of disparities in 20    resources by race, income, age of entry, and location.21        (5) High-quality, evidence-based student support has 22    been shown to improve enrollment and outcomes for 23    students.  HB1581- 2 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1        (6) Illinois' public universities have a variety of 2    missions and characteristics.3        (7) Through "A Thriving Illinois: Higher Education 4    Paths to Equity, Sustainability, and Growth", the State 5    has set systemwide goals for equity, sustainability, and 6    growth, and the General Assembly must strategically fund 7    public universities to achieve these goals.8        (8) As State funding has decreased, Illinois' public 9    universities have become increasingly reliant on tuition 10    and fees, increasing the debt students take on to fund 11    their education.12        (9) Public universities should be funded to 13    sufficiently achieve student, institutional, and State 14    goals.15        (10) Public higher education should be affordable for 16    all students.17        (11) Increasing public funding for public universities 18    should be paired with increased transparency and 19    accountability. 20    Section 10. Purpose. It is the purpose of this Act to 21establish an adequate and equitable funding formula for public 22universities that shall do all of the following:23        (1) ensure that the State provides adequate, 24    equitable, and stable funding for public universities that 25    is particularly directed to serving students from groups   HB1581- 3 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1    for whom there is evidence of meaningful gaps in 2    enrollment, retention, and completion compared to their 3    peers;4        (2) determine, for each eligible public institution, a 5    funding level based on the unique needs and of the 6    eligible public institution's student body and the 7    eligible public institution's mission and mix of programs;8        (3) encourage greater access and success for students 9    who are, based on evidence, less likely to enroll, 10    persist, progress, and complete their selected programs of 11    study; and12        (4) provide a funding increase to each eligible public 13    institution when new funds are invested;14        (5) support the diverse missions of each eligible 15    public institution;16        (6) foster economic activity and innovation;17        (7) ensure that each eligible public institution has 18    the flexibility to invest in ways that best serve the 19    eligible public institution's students;20        (8) allow for ongoing monitoring and continuous 21    improvement of the adequate and equitable funding formula 22    for eligible public institutions;23        (9) incentivize each eligible public institution to 24    reduce reliance on student tuition and fees with increased 25    State investment;26        (10) distribute new funding through an equitable   HB1581- 4 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1    allocation that drives resources to eligible public 2    institution that are furthest from adequate funding; and3        (11) ensure that each eligible public institution is 4    held harmless in the transition to a new funding model. 5    Section 15.

A public university shall receive 25all funding on behalf of each eligible public institution that 26is part of that public university and then distribute that   HB1581- 37 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1funding to each eligible public institution.2    (e) In each fiscal year in which the State appropriates 3new State formula funding, a portion of the new State formula 4funding shall be set aside and used as the aggregate guardrail 5distribution that shall be made to all public universities in 6the fiscal year. The amount of the guardrail distribution a 7public university shall receive in an applicable fiscal year 8shall be equal to the dollar value of its base funding minimum 9for the fiscal year, multiplied by the guardrail percentage. 10    (f) In each fiscal year in which there is new State formula 11funding, 50% of the new State formula funding shall be 12calculated using the dollar gap formula for each eligible 13public institution, and the remaining 50% shall be calculated 14using the adequacy gap formula for each eligible public 15institution through the following calculations:16        (1) The portion of the new State formula funding to be 17    distributed under the dollar gap formula shall be 18    calculated for each eligible public institution as 19    follows: 20            (A) First, add the total dollar value of the 21        adequacy gap of all eligible public institutions for 22        the fiscal year, which shall be the total adequacy 23        gap. 24            (B) Second, divide the dollar value of the 25        adequacy gap of the eligible public institution by the 26        dollar value of the total adequacy gap, which shall be   HB1581- 38 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1        the gap percentage A. 2            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 3        institution's gap percentage A times the amount 4        available for the dollar gap formula for the fiscal 5        year. 6            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 7        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) 8        shall be the dollar gap formula distribution for the 9        eligible public institution.10        (2) The portion of the new State formula funding to be 11    distributed under the adequacy gap formula shall be 12    calculated for each eligible public institution as 13    follows: 14            (A) First, add the percentage gaps of all eligible 15        public institutions for the fiscal year, which shall 16        be the total percentage gap. 17            (B) Second, divide the percentage gap of the 18        eligible public institution by the total percentage 19        gap, which shall be the gap percentage B.20            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 21        institution's gap percentage B times the amount 22        available for the adequacy gap formula for the fiscal 23        year. 24            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 25        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (2) 26        shall be the adequacy gap formula distribution for the   HB1581- 39 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1        eligible public institution.2    (g) The reduction formula shall be used in a fiscal year in 3which the State reduces its overall appropriations to public 4universities relative to the previous fiscal year such that 5funds are insufficient to provide each public university with 6its base funding minimum. In each fiscal year in which there is 7a reduction in funds relative to the previous fiscal year, the 8funding reductions shall be borne by public universities using 9the reduction guardrail factor, which equals 25%, and the 10remaining 75% shall be borne by public universities using the 11scaled institutional ratio cut. The reduction formula shall be 12determined as follows:13        (1) A reduction shall be determined by multiplying the 14    amount of the reduction of funds relative to the previous 15    fiscal year by the reduction guardrail factor. This amount 16    is to be subtracted from the eligible public institutions' 17    base funding minimum, with each eligible public 18    institution absorbing the percentage of the amount that 19    corresponds to each eligible public institution's 20    percentage of the base funding minimum.21        (2) The balance of the remaining reduction in funds 22    shall be distributed to universities using the reduction 23    ratio formula determined as follows:24            (A) The reduction ratio formula shall be 25        calculated by dividing the cumulative statewide 26        adequacy gap percentage by each eligible public   HB1581- 40 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1        institution's adequacy gap percentage and multiplying 2        the result by the percentage decrease in the current 3        fiscal year's appropriation compared to the prior 4        fiscal year's appropriation. 5            (B) To complete the reduction calculation, each 6        eligible public institution's percentage of the cut 7        shall be proportionally scaled up or down to fit the 8        total amount of the reduced appropriations. The scaled 9        institutional ratio cut shall be scaled by: 10                (i) calculating the difference between the 11            statewide sum of institutional ratio cuts and the 12            statewide sum of the guardrail reduction;13                (ii) calculating the ratio of each 14            institutional ratio cut and the statewide sum of 15            institutional ratio cuts; and16                (iii) calculating the product of subdivisions 17            (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph (B) and 18            subtracting that amount from each institutional 19            ratio cut. 20            (C) Once the reduction calculation is complete, 21        each eligible public institution that is part of a 22        public university shall have its cuts aggregated into 23        a total cut for the public university. 24    Section 40. Accountability and transparency framework; 25reporting; committee.   HB1581- 41 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1    (a) The Board shall oversee an accountability and 2transparency framework for assessing the distribution and use 3of funds appropriated by the funding formula under Section 30 4and evaluating the funds' effects on institutional outcomes 5pertaining to student affordability, enrollment, persistence, 6and outcome metrics. 7    (b) The Board shall report annually to the General 8Assembly on the implementation of the funding formula as 9follows:10        (1) The report shall be posted publicly on the Board's 11    website by March 1 of each year and shall, at a minimum, 12    include all of the following:13            (A) an updated adequacy target for each eligible 14        public institution for the upcoming fiscal year, 15        calculated from the following:16                (i) the updated resource profile for each 17            eligible public institution; and18                (ii) the updated adequacy gap for each 19            eligible public institution; and20            (B) a description of the use of all resources 21        received by eligible public institutions through the 22        appropriations of the funding formula; and23            (C) a description of the status and year-over-year 24        progress of each eligible public institution on a 25        series of institutional spending, institutional 26        performance, and student support metrics described in   HB1581- 42 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1        this Section.2        (2) The Board, with advice of each public university, 3    shall specify a set of metrics and associated information 4    designated for evaluating institutional performance and 5    annually report on those metrics. These metrics shall 6    include both point-in-time and longitudinal measures of 7    institutional spending of any resources received from the 8    funding formula and institutional performance regarding 9    student affordability, student enrollment, student 10    retention, and student graduation.

Distribution of State appropriations for 5eligible public institutions. 6    (a) As used in this Section:7    "Guardrail percentage" means the percentage obtained by 8multiplying 50% by the lesser of either:9        (1) the annual inflation rate measured by the 10    Employment Cost Index (Midwest Economy) published by the 11    Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department 12    of Labor for the 4-quarter period ending on December 31 of 13    the immediately preceding fiscal year, but not less than 14    0%; or15        (2) the percentage equal to (i) the total amount of 16    new State formula funding for the fiscal year, divided by 17    (ii) the total amount of annual formula funding for the 18    immediately preceding fiscal year. 19The dollar amount of new State formula funding in a fiscal year 20that remains after accounting for all guardrail distributions 21to be made in the fiscal year shall be referred to as the new 22State formula funding. 23    "New State formula funding" means, in a fiscal year, the 24dollar amount of State appropriations that exceeds the dollar 25amount of the annual formula funding appropriated for public   HB1581- 34 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1universities in the immediately preceding fiscal year.2    "Pro rata share" means an amount that is equal to the sum 3of (i) the amount of the guardrail distribution allocated to 4the eligible public institution for the fiscal year, as 5determined in subsection (e), plus (ii) the eligible public 6institution's adequacy gap formula distribution and dollar gap 7formula distribution for the fiscal year, as determined in 8paragraph (1) of subsection (f).9    (b) The base funding minimum for each eligible public 10institution shall be determined as follows:11        (1) For Fiscal Year 2026, the base funding minimum of 12    an eligible public institution shall be the sum of all 13    State appropriations made from the Education Assistance 14    Fund or the General Revenue Fund to the eligible public 15    institution to use as operating funds in the previous 16    fiscal year.17        (2) For Fiscal Year 2027 and each fiscal year 18    thereafter, the base funding minimum of an eligible public 19    institution shall be the dollar value of its base funding 20    minimum from the immediately preceding fiscal year, 21    increased by any new State formula funding the eligible 22    public institution received in the immediately preceding 23    fiscal year, provided that there was new State formula 24    funding appropriated in the immediately preceding fiscal 25    year. If there was no increase or decrease made to annual 26    formula funding in the immediately preceding fiscal year,   HB1581- 35 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1    then the dollar value of the base funding minimum for the 2    eligible public institution that pertained to the 3    immediately preceding fiscal year shall carry forward into 4    the next fiscal year. If there was a year-to-year 5    reduction in annual formula funding in the immediately 6    preceding fiscal year, then the base funding minimum for 7    the eligible public institution in the next succeeding 8    fiscal year shall be the State appropriations made to the 9    eligible public institution to meet its operational 10    expenses for the fiscal year.11    (c) To enhance the stability of long-term funding for 12public universities, to create predictability in funding, to 13enhance the capacity of public universities to prepare 14budgets, and to create a feasible pathway to fully fund the 15adequacy target of each public university within a reasonable 16period of time, in Fiscal Year 2026 and in each fiscal year 17thereafter, the State shall endeavor to increase the aggregate 18amount of annual formula funding by an amount that is at least 19$135,000,000 more than the aggregate annual formula funding 20appropriation made in the immediately preceding fiscal year, 21and that amount shall be designated as the minimum target 22increase. The minimum target increase shall be in addition to 23and not a replacement for any other appropriations the State 24makes to support either public universities or the students 25who attend public universities. 26    The first fiscal year occurring after the adequacy target   HB1581- 36 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1of every eligible public institution is fully funded, after 2accounting for inflation and enrollment changes, shall be the 3full funding date, and the minimum target increase shall be an 4amount equal to the annual formula funding amount for the 5fiscal year of the full funding date, increased on a 6cumulative basis by a percentage equal to the percentage 7increase, if any, in the Employment Cost Index (Midwest 8Economy) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the 9United States Department of Labor for the 4-quarter period 10ending on December 31 of the fiscal year in which the full 11funding date occurs. Thereafter, the minimum target increase 12in a fiscal year shall be the annual formula funding amount for 13the immediately preceding fiscal year, increased by a 14percentage equal to the percentage increase, if any, in the 15Employment Cost Index (Midwest Economy) published by the 16Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of 17Labor for the 4-quarter period ending on December 31 of the 18immediately preceding fiscal year. 19    (d) In Fiscal Year 2026 and in each fiscal year thereafter 20in which the State appropriates new State formula funding, 21each public university shall receive an appropriation from the 22Board equal to the sum of its base funding minimum for the 23fiscal year, plus its pro rata share of new State formula 24funding for the fiscal year. A public university shall receive 25all funding on behalf of each eligible public institution that 26is part of that public university and then distribute that   HB1581- 37 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1funding to each eligible public institution.2    (e) In each fiscal year in which the State appropriates 3new State formula funding, a portion of the new State formula 4funding shall be set aside and used as the aggregate guardrail 5distribution that shall be made to all public universities in 6the fiscal year. The amount of the guardrail distribution a 7public university shall receive in an applicable fiscal year 8shall be equal to the dollar value of its base funding minimum 9for the fiscal year, multiplied by the guardrail percentage. 10    (f) In each fiscal year in which there is new State formula 11funding, 50% of the new State formula funding shall be 12calculated using the dollar gap formula for each eligible 13public institution, and the remaining 50% shall be calculated 14using the adequacy gap formula for each eligible public 15institution through the following calculations:16        (1) The portion of the new State formula funding to be 17    distributed under the dollar gap formula shall be 18    calculated for each eligible public institution as 19    follows: 20            (A) First, add the total dollar value of the 21        adequacy gap of all eligible public institutions for 22        the fiscal year, which shall be the total adequacy 23        gap. 24            (B) Second, divide the dollar value of the 25        adequacy gap of the eligible public institution by the 26        dollar value of the total adequacy gap, which shall be   HB1581- 38 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1        the gap percentage A. 2            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 3        institution's gap percentage A times the amount 4        available for the dollar gap formula for the fiscal 5        year. 6            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 7        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) 8        shall be the dollar gap formula distribution for the 9        eligible public institution.10        (2) The portion of the new State formula funding to be 11    distributed under the adequacy gap formula shall be 12    calculated for each eligible public institution as 13    follows: 14            (A) First, add the percentage gaps of all eligible 15        public institutions for the fiscal year, which shall 16        be the total percentage gap. 17            (B) Second, divide the percentage gap of the 18        eligible public institution by the total percentage 19        gap, which shall be the gap percentage B.20            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 21        institution's gap percentage B times the amount 22        available for the adequacy gap formula for the fiscal 23        year. 24            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 25        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (2) 26        shall be the adequacy gap formula distribution for the   HB1581- 39 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1        eligible public institution.2    (g) The reduction formula shall be used in a fiscal year in 3which the State reduces its overall appropriations to public 4universities relative to the previous fiscal year such that 5funds are insufficient to provide each public university with 6its base funding minimum. In each fiscal year in which there is 7a reduction in funds relative to the previous fiscal year, the 8funding reductions shall be borne by public universities using 9the reduction guardrail factor, which equals 25%, and the 10remaining 75% shall be borne by public universities using the 11scaled institutional ratio cut. The reduction formula shall be 12determined as follows:13        (1) A reduction shall be determined by multiplying the 14    amount of the reduction of funds relative to the previous 15    fiscal year by the reduction guardrail factor. This amount 16    is to be subtracted from the eligible public institutions' 17    base funding minimum, with each eligible public 18    institution absorbing the percentage of the amount that 19    corresponds to each eligible public institution's 20    percentage of the base funding minimum.21        (2) The balance of the remaining reduction in funds 22    shall be distributed to universities using the reduction 23    ratio formula determined as follows:24            (A) The reduction ratio formula shall be 25        calculated by dividing the cumulative statewide 26        adequacy gap percentage by each eligible public   HB1581- 40 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1        institution's adequacy gap percentage and multiplying 2        the result by the percentage decrease in the current 3        fiscal year's appropriation compared to the prior 4        fiscal year's appropriation. 5            (B) To complete the reduction calculation, each 6        eligible public institution's percentage of the cut 7        shall be proportionally scaled up or down to fit the 8        total amount of the reduced appropriations. The scaled 9        institutional ratio cut shall be scaled by: 10                (i) calculating the difference between the 11            statewide sum of institutional ratio cuts and the 12            statewide sum of the guardrail reduction;13                (ii) calculating the ratio of each 14            institutional ratio cut and the statewide sum of 15            institutional ratio cuts; and16                (iii) calculating the product of subdivisions 17            (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph (B) and 18            subtracting that amount from each institutional 19            ratio cut. 20            (C) Once the reduction calculation is complete, 21        each eligible public institution that is part of a 22        public university shall have its cuts aggregated into 23        a total cut for the public university. 24    Section 40. Accountability and transparency framework; 25reporting; committee.   HB1581- 41 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1    (a) The Board shall oversee an accountability and 2transparency framework for assessing the distribution and use 3of funds appropriated by the funding formula under Section 30 4and evaluating the funds' effects on institutional outcomes 5pertaining to student affordability, enrollment, persistence, 6and outcome metrics. 7    (b) The Board shall report annually to the General 8Assembly on the implementation of the funding formula as 9follows:10        (1) The report shall be posted publicly on the Board's 11    website by March 1 of each year and shall, at a minimum, 12    include all of the following:13            (A) an updated adequacy target for each eligible 14        public institution for the upcoming fiscal year, 15        calculated from the following:16                (i) the updated resource profile for each 17            eligible public institution; and18                (ii) the updated adequacy gap for each 19            eligible public institution; and20            (B) a description of the use of all resources 21        received by eligible public institutions through the 22        appropriations of the funding formula; and23            (C) a description of the status and year-over-year 24        progress of each eligible public institution on a 25        series of institutional spending, institutional 26        performance, and student support metrics described in   HB1581- 42 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1        this Section.2        (2) The Board, with advice of each public university, 3    shall specify a set of metrics and associated information 4    designated for evaluating institutional performance and 5    annually report on those metrics. These metrics shall 6    include both point-in-time and longitudinal measures of 7    institutional spending of any resources received from the 8    funding formula and institutional performance regarding 9    student affordability, student enrollment, student 10    retention, and student graduation. Each eligible public 11    institution shall provide the needed data to calculate the 12    set of metrics and related information annually to the 13    Board by December 31. The metrics and related information 14    and materials shall include all of the following 15    information: 16            (A) Prospective spending proposals through which 17        eligible public institutions delineate their projected 18        use of appropriations allocated through the funding 19        formula for the forthcoming fiscal year. These 20        expenditure plans shall be categorized according to 21        accounting spending classifications established by the 22        Board. 23            (B) Retrospective spending summaries through which 24        eligible public institutions disclose the expenditure 25        of all new appropriations received in the preceding 26        fiscal year. These expenditure reports shall be   HB1581- 43 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1        structured based on accounting spending categories 2        designated by the Board. 3            (C) Metrics measuring the institutional status and 4        year-over-year changes in students' tuition and fees, 5        net price, and expected share of expenses. Student 6        affordability data and data trends shall be 7        disaggregated by undergraduate and graduate students 8        with further disaggregation by the student equity 9        categories aligned with the equitable student share, 10        set forth in paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of 11        Section 30. 12            (D) Metrics measuring the institutional status and 13        year-over-year changes in student enrollment. 14        Enrollment data and data trends shall be disaggregated 15        by undergraduate and graduate students with further 16        disaggregation by the student groups who carry with 17        them equity adjustments, as set forth in subsections 18        (c) through (e) of Section 25. 19            (E) Metrics measuring the institutional status and 20        year-over-year changes in student retention increased 21        rates from one year of enrollment to the next, minus 22        those that transfer from one eligible public 23        institution to another, and minus those that receive a 24        credential and no longer enroll thereafter. Student 25        retention data and data trends shall be disaggregated 26        by the student groups who carry with them equity   HB1581- 44 -LRB104 08166 LNS 18214 b1        adjustments, as set forth in subsections (c) through 2        (e) of Section 25.3            (F) Metrics measuring student graduation rates 4        within 4 years, 5 years, and 6 years and 5        year-over-year changes in graduation rates.
