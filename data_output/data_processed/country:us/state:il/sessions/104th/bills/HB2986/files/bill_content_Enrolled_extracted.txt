A school district may establish a 3program in transitional bilingual education with respect to 4any classification with less than 20 children therein, but 5should a school district decide not to establish such a 6program, the school district shall provide a locally 7determined transitional program of instruction which, based 8upon an individual student language assessment, provides 9content area instruction in a language other than English to 10the extent necessary to ensure that each student can benefit 11from educational instruction and achieve an early and 12effective transition into the regular school curriculum.13    Every school-age English learner not enrolled in existing 14private school systems shall be enrolled and participate in 15the program in transitional bilingual education established 16for the classification to which he belongs by the school 17district in which he resides for a period of 3 years or until 18such time as he achieves a level of English language skills 19which will enable him to perform successfully in classes in 20which instruction is given only in English, whichever shall 21first occur.22    An English learner enrolled in a program in transitional 23bilingual education may, in the discretion of the school 24district and subject to the approval of the child's parent or 25legal guardian, continue in that program for a period longer 26than 3 years.  HB2986 Enrolled- 57 -LRB104 08403 LNS 18454 b1    An examination in the oral language (listening and 2speaking), reading, and writing of English, as prescribed by 3the State Board, shall be administered annually to all English 4learners enrolled and participating in a program in 5transitional bilingual education. No school district shall 6transfer an English learner out of a program in transitional 7bilingual education prior to his third year of enrollment 8therein unless the parents of the child approve the transfer 9in writing, and unless the child has received a score on said 10examination which, in the determination of the State Board, 11reflects a level of English language skills appropriate to his 12or her grade level.13    If later evidence suggests that a child so transferred is 14still disabled by an inadequate command of English, he may be 15re-enrolled in the program for a length of time equal to that 16which remained at the time he was transferred.17(Source: P.A. 98-972, eff. 8-15-14; 99-30, eff. 7-10-15.) 18    (105 ILCS 5/17-1.5)19    Sec. 17-1.5.

A school district may establish a 3program in transitional bilingual education with respect to 4any classification with less than 20 children therein, but 5should a school district decide not to establish such a 6program, the school district shall provide a locally 7determined transitional program of instruction which, based 8upon an individual student language assessment, provides 9content area instruction in a language other than English to 10the extent necessary to ensure that each student can benefit 11from educational instruction and achieve an early and 12effective transition into the regular school curriculum.13    Every school-age English learner not enrolled in existing 14private school systems shall be enrolled and participate in 15the program in transitional bilingual education established 16for the classification to which he belongs by the school 17district in which he resides for a period of 3 years or until 18such time as he achieves a level of English language skills 19which will enable him to perform successfully in classes in 20which instruction is given only in English, whichever shall 21first occur.22    An English learner enrolled in a program in transitional 23bilingual education may, in the discretion of the school 24district and subject to the approval of the child's parent or 25legal guardian, continue in that program for a period longer 26than 3 years.  HB2986 Enrolled- 57 -LRB104 08403 LNS 18454 b1    An examination in the oral language (listening and 2speaking), reading, and writing of English, as prescribed by 3the State Board, shall be administered annually to all English 4learners enrolled and participating in a program in 5transitional bilingual education. No school district shall 6transfer an English learner out of a program in transitional 7bilingual education prior to his third year of enrollment 8therein unless the parents of the child approve the transfer 9in writing, and unless the child has received a score on said 10examination which, in the determination of the State Board, 11reflects a level of English language skills appropriate to his 12or her grade level.13    If later evidence suggests that a child so transferred is 14still disabled by an inadequate command of English, he may be 15re-enrolled in the program for a length of time equal to that 16which remained at the time he was transferred.17(Source: P.A. 98-972, eff. 8-15-14; 99-30, eff. 7-10-15.) 18    (105 ILCS 5/17-1.5)19    Sec. 17-1.5. Limitation of administrative costs. 20    (a) It is the purpose of this Section to establish 21limitations on the growth of administrative expenditures in 22order to maximize the proportion of school district resources 23available for the instructional program, building maintenance, 24and safety services for the students of each district.25    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this Section:  HB2986 Enrolled- 58 -LRB104 08403 LNS 18454 b1    "Administrative expenditures" mean the annual expenditures 2of school districts properly attributable to expenditure 3functions defined by the rules of the State Board of Education 4as: 2320 (Executive Administration Services); 2330 (Special 5Area Administration Services); 2490 (Other Support Services - 6School Administration); 2510 (Direction of Business Support 7Services); 2570 (Internal Services); and 2610 (Direction of 8Central Support Services); provided, however, that 9"administrative expenditures" shall not include early 10retirement or other pension system obligations required by 11State law.12    "School district" means all school districts having a 13population of less than 500,000.14    (c) For the 1998-99 school year and each school year 15thereafter, each school district shall undertake budgetary and 16expenditure control actions so that the increase in 17administrative expenditures for that school year over the 18prior school year does not exceed 5%. School districts with 19administrative expenditures per pupil in the 25th percentile 20and below for all districts of the same type, as defined by the 21State Board of Education, may waive the limitation imposed 22under this Section for any year following a public hearing and 23with the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the 24members of the school board of the district. Any district 25waiving the limitation shall notify the State Board within 45 26days of such action.  HB2986 Enrolled- 59 -LRB104 08403 LNS 18454 b1    (d) School districts shall file with the State Board of 2Education by November 15, 1998 and by each October November 315th thereafter a one-page report that lists (i) the actual 4administrative expenditures for the prior year from the 5district's audited Annual Financial Report, and (ii) the 6projected administrative expenditures for the current year 7from the budget adopted by the school board pursuant to 8Section 17-1 of this Code.9    If a school district that is ineligible to waive the 10limitation imposed by subsection (c) of this Section by board 11action exceeds the limitation solely because of circumstances 12beyond the control of the district and the district has 13exhausted all available and reasonable remedies to comply with 14the limitation, the district may request a waiver pursuant to 15Section 2-3.25g. The waiver application shall specify the 16amount, nature, and reason for the relief requested, as well 17as all remedies the district has exhausted to comply with the 18limitation. Any emergency relief so requested shall apply only 19to the specific school year for which the request is made. The 20State Board of Education shall analyze all such waivers 21submitted and shall recommend that the General Assembly 22disapprove any such waiver requested that is not due solely to 23circumstances beyond the control of the district and for which 24the district has not exhausted all available and reasonable 25remedies to comply with the limitation. The State 26Superintendent shall have no authority to impose any sanctions   HB2986 Enrolled- 60 -LRB104 08403 LNS 18454 b1pursuant to this Section for any expenditures for which a 2waiver has been requested until such waiver has been reviewed 3by the General Assembly.4    If the report and information required under this 5subsection (d) are not provided by the school district in a 6timely manner, or are subsequently determined by the State 7Superintendent of Education to be incomplete or inaccurate, 8the State Superintendent shall notify the district in writing 9of reporting deficiencies. The school district shall, within 1060 days of the notice, address the reporting deficiencies 11identified. 12    (e) If the State Superintendent determines that a school 13district has failed to comply with the administrative 14expenditure limitation imposed in subsection (c) of this 15Section, the State Superintendent shall notify the district of 16the violation and direct the district to undertake corrective 17action to bring the district's budget into compliance with the 18administrative expenditure limitation. The district shall, 19within 60 days of the notice, provide adequate assurance to 20the State Superintendent that appropriate corrective actions 21have been or will be taken. If the district fails to provide 22adequate assurance or fails to undertake the necessary 23corrective actions, the State Superintendent may impose 24progressive sanctions against the district that may culminate 25in withholding all subsequent payments of general State aid 26due the district under Section 18-8.05 of this Code or   HB2986 Enrolled- 61 -LRB104 08403 LNS 18454 b1evidence-based funding due the district under Section 18-8.15 2of this Code until the assurance is provided or the corrective 3actions taken.4    (f) The State Superintendent shall publish a list each 5year of the school districts that violate the limitation 6imposed by subsection (c) of this Section and a list of the 7districts that waive the limitation by board action as 8provided in subsection (c) of this Section. 9(Source: P.A. 100-465, eff. 8-31-17.) 10    (105 ILCS 5/27A-12)11    Sec. 27A-12.
