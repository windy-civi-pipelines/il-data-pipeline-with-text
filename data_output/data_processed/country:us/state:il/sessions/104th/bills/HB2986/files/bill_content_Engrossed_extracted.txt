Language classification of children; 3establishment of program; period of participation; 4examination. Each school district shall ascertain, not later 5than the first day of March, under regulations prescribed by 6the State Board, the number of English learners within the 7school district, and shall classify them according to the 8language of which they possess a primary speaking ability, and 9their grade level, age or achievement level.10    When, at the beginning of any school year, there is within 11an attendance center of a school district, not including 12children who are enrolled in existing private school systems, 1320 or more English learners in any such language 14classification, the school district shall establish, for each 15classification, a program in transitional bilingual education 16for the children therein. A school district may establish a 17program in transitional bilingual education with respect to 18any classification with less than 20 children therein, but 19should a school district decide not to establish such a 20program, the school district shall provide a locally 21determined transitional program of instruction which, based 22upon an individual student language assessment, provides 23content area instruction in a language other than English to 24the extent necessary to ensure that each student can benefit 25from educational instruction and achieve an early and 26effective transition into the regular school curriculum.  HB2986 Engrossed- 51 -LRB104 08403 LNS 18454 b1    Every school-age English learner not enrolled in existing 2private school systems shall be enrolled and participate in 3the program in transitional bilingual education established 4for the classification to which he belongs by the school 5district in which he resides for a period of 3 years or until 6such time as he achieves a level of English language skills 7which will enable him to perform successfully in classes in 8which instruction is given only in English, whichever shall 9first occur.10    An English learner enrolled in a program in transitional 11bilingual education may, in the discretion of the school 12district and subject to the approval of the child's parent or 13legal guardian, continue in that program for a period longer 14than 3 years.15    An examination in the oral language (listening and 16speaking), reading, and writing of English, as prescribed by 17the State Board, shall be administered annually to all English 18learners enrolled and participating in a program in 19transitional bilingual education. No school district shall 20transfer an English learner out of a program in transitional 21bilingual education prior to his third year of enrollment 22therein unless the parents of the child approve the transfer 23in writing, and unless the child has received a score on said 24examination which, in the determination of the State Board, 25reflects a level of English language skills appropriate to his 26or her grade level.  HB2986 Engrossed- 52 -LRB104 08403 LNS 18454 b1    If later evidence suggests that a child so transferred is 2still disabled by an inadequate command of English, he may be 3re-enrolled in the program for a length of time equal to that 4which remained at the time he was transferred.5(Source: P.A. 98-972, eff. 8-15-14; 99-30, eff. 7-10-15.) 6    (105 ILCS 5/17-1.5)7    Sec. 17-1.5.

The State 14Superintendent shall have no authority to impose any sanctions 15pursuant to this Section for any expenditures for which a 16waiver has been requested until such waiver has been reviewed 17by the General Assembly.18    If the report and information required under this 19subsection (d) are not provided by the school district in a 20timely manner, or are subsequently determined by the State 21Superintendent of Education to be incomplete or inaccurate, 22the State Superintendent shall notify the district in writing 23of reporting deficiencies.
