Full Text of HB3572 ILGA.GOV HB3572 - 104th General Assembly HB3572 EngrossedLRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1    AN ACT concerning criminal law. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Reference to Act. This Act may be referred to as 5the Diversion of Unfit Misdemeanants Act. 6    Section 5. Purpose. The General Assembly recognizes that 7there are a substantial number of persons with mental 8illnesses who are charged with misdemeanors and are found 9unfit to stand trial under Article 104 of the Code of Criminal 10Procedure of 1963. Many of these defendants remain in the 11criminal justice system for periods of time longer than they 12would have served had they been convicted of the misdemeanor 13with which they have been charged. These defendants impose a 14substantial financial burden on county jails, the criminal 15court system, and State-operated mental health facilities 16where they are frequently committed under Section 104-17 of 17the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Additionally, despite 18extended involvement in the criminal justice system, many of 19these defendants do not receive the mental health treatment 20needed to reduce the likelihood that they will commit future 21offenses and are not successfully linked to ongoing mental 22health services when their involvement in the criminal justice 23system ends, including community-based treatment programs. The   HB3572 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1General Assembly finds that the interests of public safety, 2the welfare of persons with mental illnesses charged with 3misdemeanors, and the efficient and effective use of public 4resources may be served by creating programs which remove 5these defendants from the criminal justice system and use 6behavioral health services, case management, and substance use 7disorder treatment, including, but not limited to, treatment 8authorized under Articles IV, VII, and VII-A and Section 93-801.5 of Article VIII of the Mental Health and Developmental 10Disabilities Code. 11    Section 10. The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 is 12amended by changing Sections 104-11, 104-13, 104-15, and 13104-17 and by adding Section 104-32 and Article 104A as 14follows: 15    (725 ILCS 5/104-11)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-11)16    Sec. 104-11. Raising Issue; Burden; Fitness Motions.) 1718    (a) The issue of the defendant's fitness for trial, to 19plead, or to be sentenced may be raised by the defense, the 20State or the Court at any appropriate time before a plea is 21entered or before, during, or after trial. When a bonafide 22doubt of the defendant's fitness is raised, other than for 23eligible defendants charged with one or more misdemeanors 24subject to Section 104A-1, the court shall order a   HB3572 Engrossed- 3 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1determination of the issue before proceeding further.2    (b) Upon request of the defendant that a qualified expert 3be appointed to examine him or her to determine prior to trial 4if a bonafide doubt as to his or her fitness to stand trial may 5be raised, the court, in its discretion, may order an 6appropriate examination. However, no order entered pursuant to 7this subsection shall prevent further proceedings in the case. 8An expert so appointed shall examine the defendant and make a 9report as provided in Section 104-15. Upon the filing with the 10court of a verified statement of services rendered, the court 11shall enter an order on the county board to pay such expert a 12reasonable fee stated in the order.13    (c) When a bonafide doubt of the defendant's fitness has 14been raised, the burden of proving that the defendant is fit by 15a preponderance of the evidence and the burden of going 16forward with the evidence are on the State. However, the court 17may call its own witnesses and conduct its own inquiry.18    (d) Following a finding of unfitness, the court may hear 19and rule on any pretrial motion or motions if the defendant's 20presence is not essential to a fair determination of the 21issues. A motion may be reheard upon a showing that evidence is 22available which was not available, due to the defendant's 23unfitness, when the motion was first decided.24(Source: P.A. 81-1217.) 25    (725 ILCS 5/104-13)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-13)  HB3572 Engrossed- 4 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1    Sec. 104-13. Fitness examination. 2    (a) When the issue of fitness involves the defendant's 3mental condition, the court shall order an examination of the 4defendant by one or more licensed physicians, clinical 5psychologists, or psychiatrists chosen by the court. No 6physician, clinical psychologist or psychiatrist employed by 7the Department of Human Services shall be ordered to perform, 8in his official capacity, an examination under this Section.9    (a-1) The Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts is 10encouraged to establish standards and a certification process 11for court-appointed fitness evaluators designed to increase 12the availability of qualified evaluators statewide and to 13increase access, consistency, and fairness within 14fitness-to-stand-trial proceedings and subsequent placement 15recommendations. 16    (b) If the issue of fitness involves the defendant's 17physical condition, the court shall appoint one or more 18physicians and in addition, such other experts as it may deem 19appropriate to examine the defendant and to report to the 20court regarding the defendant's condition.21    (c) An examination ordered under this Section shall be 22given at the place designated by the person who will conduct 23the examination, except that if the defendant is being held in 24custody, the examination shall take place at such location as 25the court directs. No examinations under this Section shall be 26ordered to take place at mental health or developmental   HB3572 Engrossed- 5 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1disabilities facilities operated by the Department of Human 2Services. If the defendant fails to keep appointments without 3reasonable cause or if the person conducting the examination 4reports to the court that diagnosis requires hospitalization 5or extended observation, the court may order the defendant 6admitted to an appropriate facility for an examination, other 7than a screening examination, for not more than 7 days. The 8court may, upon a showing of good cause, grant an additional 7 9days to complete the examination.10    (d) Pretrial Release on pretrial release or on 11recognizance shall not be revoked and an application therefor 12shall not be denied on the grounds that an examination has been 13ordered.14    (e) Upon request by the defense and if the defendant is 15indigent, the court may appoint, in addition to the expert or 16experts chosen pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section, a 17qualified expert selected by the defendant to examine him and 18to make a report as provided in Section 104-15. Upon the filing 19with the court of a verified statement of services rendered, 20the court shall enter an order on the county board to pay such 21expert a reasonable fee stated in the order.22(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 1-1-23.) 23    (725 ILCS 5/104-15)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-15)24    Sec. 104-15. Report. 25    (a) The person or persons conducting an examination of the   HB3572 Engrossed- 6 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1defendant, pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 104-13 2shall submit a written report to the court, the State, and the 3defense within 30 days of the date of the order. The report 4shall include:5        (1) A diagnosis and an explanation as to how it was 6    reached and the facts upon which it is based;7        (2) A description of the defendant's mental or 8    physical disability, if any; its severity; and an opinion 9    as to whether and to what extent it impairs the 10    defendant's ability to understand the nature and purpose 11    of the proceedings against him or to assist in his 12    defense, or both.13    (b) If the report indicates that the defendant is not fit 14to stand trial or to plead because of a disability, the report 15shall include an opinion as to the likelihood of the defendant 16attaining fitness within the statutory a period of time from 17the date of the finding of unfitness if provided with a course 18of treatment. For a defendant charged with a felony, the 19period of time shall be one year. For a defendant charged with 20a misdemeanor, the period of time shall be no longer than the 21maximum term of imprisonment for the most serious offense. The 22period of commitment shall not exceed the maximum length of 23time that the defendant would have been required to serve, 24less credit for good behavior as provided in Section 5-4-1 of 25the Unified Code of Corrections. Defendants charged with petty 26offenses or infraction of a municipal ordinance are not   HB3572 Engrossed- 7 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1eligible for fitness restoration services. If the person or 2persons preparing the initial fitness report are unable to 3form such an opinion, the report shall state the reasons 4therefore therefor. The report shall may include a general 5description of the type of treatment needed and of the least 6physically restrictive form of treatment therapeutically 7appropriate. If inpatient treatment is recommended, the report 8must articulate the evaluator's assessment of risk, protective 9factors, and treatment needs as related to the defendant's 10mental disorder. Risk shall not be determined solely by the 11nature of the defendant's criminal charges. 12    (c) The report shall indicate what information, if any, 13contained therein may be harmful to the mental condition of 14the defendant if made known to him.15    (d) In addition to the report, a person retained or 16appointed by the State or the defense to conduct an 17examination shall, upon written request, make his or her 18notes, other evaluations reviewed or relied upon by the 19testifying witness, and any videotaped interviews available to 20another examiner of the defendant. All forensic interviews 21conducted by a person retained or appointed by the State or the 22defense shall be videotaped unless doing so would be 23impractical. In the event that the interview is not 24videotaped, the examiner may still testify as to the person's 25fitness and the court may only consider the lack of compliance 26in according the weight and not the admissibility of the   HB3572 Engrossed- 8 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1expert testimony. An examiner may use these materials as part 2of his or her diagnosis and explanation but shall not 3otherwise disclose the contents, including at a hearing before 4the court, except as otherwise provided in Section 104-14 of 5this Code. 6(Source: P.A. 100-424, eff. 1-1-18.) 7    (725 ILCS 5/104-17)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-17)8    Sec. 104-17. Commitment for treatment; treatment plan. 9    (a) If the defendant is eligible to be or has been released 10on pretrial release or on his own recognizance, the court 11shall select the least physically restrictive form of 12treatment therapeutically appropriate and consistent with the 13treatment plan. The placement may be ordered either on an 14inpatient or an outpatient basis. Placement shall be on an 15outpatient basis unless the court determines that:16        (1) treatment on an outpatient basis is reasonably 17    expected to inflict serious physical harm upon the 18    defendant or another. No defendant may be ordered to 19    inpatient restoration unless at least one licensed 20    physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist who has 21    examined the defendant testifies in person at the hearing. 22    The defendant may waive the requirement of the testimony 23    subject to the approval of the court; or24        (2) treatment that will restore the defendant to 25    fitness within a reasonable period of time is not   HB3572 Engrossed- 9 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1    available on an outpatient basis. 2    (b) If the defendant's disability is mental, the court may 3order him placed for secure treatment in the custody of the 4Department of Human Services, or the court may order him 5placed in the custody of any other appropriate public or 6private mental health facility or treatment program which has 7agreed to provide treatment to the defendant. If the most 8serious charge faced by the defendant is a misdemeanor, the 9court shall order outpatient treatment, unless the court finds 10good cause on the record that the defendant is reasonably 11expected to inflict serious physical harm on the defendant or 12another due to mental illness. No defendant may be ordered to 13inpatient restoration unless at least one licensed physician, 14clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist who has examined the 15defendant testifies in person at the hearing. The defendant 16may waive the requirement of the testimony subject to the 17approval of the court to order inpatient treatment. If the 18court orders the defendant to inpatient treatment in the 19custody of the Department of Human Services, the Department 20shall evaluate the defendant to determine the most appropriate 21secure facility to receive the defendant and, within 20 days 22of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit court of the 23court's placement order, notify the court of the designated 24facility to receive the defendant. The Department shall admit 25the defendant to a secure facility within 60 days of the 26transmittal of the court's placement order, unless the   HB3572 Engrossed- 10 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1Department can demonstrate good faith efforts at placement and 2a lack of bed and placement availability. If placement cannot 3be made within 60 days of the transmittal of the court's 4placement order and the Department has demonstrated good faith 5efforts at placement and a lack of bed and placement 6availability, the Department shall provide an update to the 7ordering court every 30 days until the defendant is placed. 8Once bed and placement availability is determined, the 9Department shall notify the sheriff who shall promptly 10transport the defendant to the designated facility. If the 11defendant is placed in the custody of the Department of Human 12Services, the defendant shall be placed in a secure setting. 13During the period of time required to determine bed and 14placement availability at the designated facility, the 15defendant shall remain in jail. If during the course of 16evaluating the defendant for placement, the Department of 17Human Services determines that the defendant is currently fit 18to stand trial, it shall immediately notify the court and 19shall submit a written report within 7 days. In that 20circumstance the placement shall be held pending a court 21hearing on the Department's report. Otherwise, upon completion 22of the placement process, including identifying bed and 23placement availability, the sheriff shall be notified and 24shall transport the defendant to the designated facility. If, 25within 60 days of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit 26court of the court's placement order, the Department fails to   HB3572 Engrossed- 11 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1provide the sheriff with notice of bed and placement 2availability at the designated facility, the sheriff shall 3contact the Department to inquire about when a placement will 4become available at the designated facility as well as bed and 5placement availability at other secure facilities. The 6Department shall respond to the sheriff within 2 business days 7of the notice and inquiry by the sheriff seeking the transfer 8and the Department shall provide the sheriff with the status 9of the evaluation, information on bed and placement 10availability, and an estimated date of admission for the 11defendant and any changes to that estimated date of admission. 12If the Department notifies the sheriff during the 2 business 13day period of a facility operated by the Department with 14placement availability, the sheriff shall promptly transport 15the defendant to that facility. The placement may be ordered 16either on an inpatient or an outpatient basis.17    (c) If the defendant's disability is physical, the court 18may order him placed under the supervision of the Department 19of Human Services which shall place and maintain the defendant 20in a suitable treatment facility or program, or the court may 21order him placed in an appropriate public or private facility 22or treatment program which has agreed to provide treatment to 23the defendant. The placement may be ordered either on an 24inpatient or an outpatient basis.25    (d) The clerk of the circuit court shall within 5 days of 26the entry of the order transmit to the Department, agency or   HB3572 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1institution, if any, to which the defendant is remanded for 2treatment, the following:3        (1) a certified copy of the order to undergo 4    treatment.

For a defendant charged with a felony, the period 24of time shall be one year. For a defendant charged with a 25misdemeanor, the period of time shall be no longer than the 26sentence if convicted of the most serious offense, less credit   HB3572 Engrossed- 13 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1for good behavior as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Unified 2Code of Corrections. If the report indicates that there is a 3substantial probability that the defendant will attain fitness 4within the time period, the treatment supervisor shall also 5file a treatment plan which shall include:6        (1) A diagnosis of the defendant's disability;7        (2) A description of treatment goals with respect to 8    rendering the defendant fit, a specification of the 9    proposed treatment modalities, and an estimated timetable 10    for attainment of the goals;11        (3) An identification of the person in charge of 12    supervising the defendant's treatment.13(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 1-1-23; 102-1118, eff. 1-18-23.) 14    (725 ILCS 5/104-32 new)15    Sec. 104-32.

Reference to Act. This Act may be referred to as 5the Diversion of Unfit Misdemeanants Act. 6    Section 5. Purpose. The General Assembly recognizes that 7there are a substantial number of persons with mental 8illnesses who are charged with misdemeanors and are found 9unfit to stand trial under Article 104 of the Code of Criminal 10Procedure of 1963. Many of these defendants remain in the 11criminal justice system for periods of time longer than they 12would have served had they been convicted of the misdemeanor 13with which they have been charged. These defendants impose a 14substantial financial burden on county jails, the criminal 15court system, and State-operated mental health facilities 16where they are frequently committed under Section 104-17 of 17the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Additionally, despite 18extended involvement in the criminal justice system, many of 19these defendants do not receive the mental health treatment 20needed to reduce the likelihood that they will commit future 21offenses and are not successfully linked to ongoing mental 22health services when their involvement in the criminal justice 23system ends, including community-based treatment programs. The   HB3572 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1General Assembly finds that the interests of public safety, 2the welfare of persons with mental illnesses charged with 3misdemeanors, and the efficient and effective use of public 4resources may be served by creating programs which remove 5these defendants from the criminal justice system and use 6behavioral health services, case management, and substance use 7disorder treatment, including, but not limited to, treatment 8authorized under Articles IV, VII, and VII-A and Section 93-801.5 of Article VIII of the Mental Health and Developmental 10Disabilities Code. 11    Section 10. The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 is 12amended by changing Sections 104-11, 104-13, 104-15, and 13104-17 and by adding Section 104-32 and Article 104A as 14follows: 15    (725 ILCS 5/104-11)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-11)16    Sec. 104-11. Raising Issue; Burden; Fitness Motions.) 1718    (a) The issue of the defendant's fitness for trial, to 19plead, or to be sentenced may be raised by the defense, the 20State or the Court at any appropriate time before a plea is 21entered or before, during, or after trial. When a bonafide 22doubt of the defendant's fitness is raised, other than for 23eligible defendants charged with one or more misdemeanors 24subject to Section 104A-1, the court shall order a   HB3572 Engrossed- 3 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1determination of the issue before proceeding further.2    (b) Upon request of the defendant that a qualified expert 3be appointed to examine him or her to determine prior to trial 4if a bonafide doubt as to his or her fitness to stand trial may 5be raised, the court, in its discretion, may order an 6appropriate examination. However, no order entered pursuant to 7this subsection shall prevent further proceedings in the case. 8An expert so appointed shall examine the defendant and make a 9report as provided in Section 104-15. Upon the filing with the 10court of a verified statement of services rendered, the court 11shall enter an order on the county board to pay such expert a 12reasonable fee stated in the order.13    (c) When a bonafide doubt of the defendant's fitness has 14been raised, the burden of proving that the defendant is fit by 15a preponderance of the evidence and the burden of going 16forward with the evidence are on the State. However, the court 17may call its own witnesses and conduct its own inquiry.18    (d) Following a finding of unfitness, the court may hear 19and rule on any pretrial motion or motions if the defendant's 20presence is not essential to a fair determination of the 21issues. A motion may be reheard upon a showing that evidence is 22available which was not available, due to the defendant's 23unfitness, when the motion was first decided.24(Source: P.A. 81-1217.) 25    (725 ILCS 5/104-13)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-13)  HB3572 Engrossed- 4 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1    Sec. 104-13. Fitness examination. 2    (a) When the issue of fitness involves the defendant's 3mental condition, the court shall order an examination of the 4defendant by one or more licensed physicians, clinical 5psychologists, or psychiatrists chosen by the court. No 6physician, clinical psychologist or psychiatrist employed by 7the Department of Human Services shall be ordered to perform, 8in his official capacity, an examination under this Section.9    (a-1) The Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts is 10encouraged to establish standards and a certification process 11for court-appointed fitness evaluators designed to increase 12the availability of qualified evaluators statewide and to 13increase access, consistency, and fairness within 14fitness-to-stand-trial proceedings and subsequent placement 15recommendations. 16    (b) If the issue of fitness involves the defendant's 17physical condition, the court shall appoint one or more 18physicians and in addition, such other experts as it may deem 19appropriate to examine the defendant and to report to the 20court regarding the defendant's condition.21    (c) An examination ordered under this Section shall be 22given at the place designated by the person who will conduct 23the examination, except that if the defendant is being held in 24custody, the examination shall take place at such location as 25the court directs. No examinations under this Section shall be 26ordered to take place at mental health or developmental   HB3572 Engrossed- 5 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1disabilities facilities operated by the Department of Human 2Services. If the defendant fails to keep appointments without 3reasonable cause or if the person conducting the examination 4reports to the court that diagnosis requires hospitalization 5or extended observation, the court may order the defendant 6admitted to an appropriate facility for an examination, other 7than a screening examination, for not more than 7 days. The 8court may, upon a showing of good cause, grant an additional 7 9days to complete the examination.10    (d) Pretrial Release on pretrial release or on 11recognizance shall not be revoked and an application therefor 12shall not be denied on the grounds that an examination has been 13ordered.14    (e) Upon request by the defense and if the defendant is 15indigent, the court may appoint, in addition to the expert or 16experts chosen pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section, a 17qualified expert selected by the defendant to examine him and 18to make a report as provided in Section 104-15. Upon the filing 19with the court of a verified statement of services rendered, 20the court shall enter an order on the county board to pay such 21expert a reasonable fee stated in the order.22(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 1-1-23.) 23    (725 ILCS 5/104-15)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-15)24    Sec. 104-15. Report. 25    (a) The person or persons conducting an examination of the   HB3572 Engrossed- 6 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1defendant, pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 104-13 2shall submit a written report to the court, the State, and the 3defense within 30 days of the date of the order. The report 4shall include:5        (1) A diagnosis and an explanation as to how it was 6    reached and the facts upon which it is based;7        (2) A description of the defendant's mental or 8    physical disability, if any; its severity; and an opinion 9    as to whether and to what extent it impairs the 10    defendant's ability to understand the nature and purpose 11    of the proceedings against him or to assist in his 12    defense, or both.13    (b) If the report indicates that the defendant is not fit 14to stand trial or to plead because of a disability, the report 15shall include an opinion as to the likelihood of the defendant 16attaining fitness within the statutory a period of time from 17the date of the finding of unfitness if provided with a course 18of treatment. For a defendant charged with a felony, the 19period of time shall be one year. For a defendant charged with 20a misdemeanor, the period of time shall be no longer than the 21maximum term of imprisonment for the most serious offense. The 22period of commitment shall not exceed the maximum length of 23time that the defendant would have been required to serve, 24less credit for good behavior as provided in Section 5-4-1 of 25the Unified Code of Corrections. Defendants charged with petty 26offenses or infraction of a municipal ordinance are not   HB3572 Engrossed- 7 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1eligible for fitness restoration services. If the person or 2persons preparing the initial fitness report are unable to 3form such an opinion, the report shall state the reasons 4therefore therefor. The report shall may include a general 5description of the type of treatment needed and of the least 6physically restrictive form of treatment therapeutically 7appropriate. If inpatient treatment is recommended, the report 8must articulate the evaluator's assessment of risk, protective 9factors, and treatment needs as related to the defendant's 10mental disorder. Risk shall not be determined solely by the 11nature of the defendant's criminal charges. 12    (c) The report shall indicate what information, if any, 13contained therein may be harmful to the mental condition of 14the defendant if made known to him.15    (d) In addition to the report, a person retained or 16appointed by the State or the defense to conduct an 17examination shall, upon written request, make his or her 18notes, other evaluations reviewed or relied upon by the 19testifying witness, and any videotaped interviews available to 20another examiner of the defendant. All forensic interviews 21conducted by a person retained or appointed by the State or the 22defense shall be videotaped unless doing so would be 23impractical. In the event that the interview is not 24videotaped, the examiner may still testify as to the person's 25fitness and the court may only consider the lack of compliance 26in according the weight and not the admissibility of the   HB3572 Engrossed- 8 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1expert testimony. An examiner may use these materials as part 2of his or her diagnosis and explanation but shall not 3otherwise disclose the contents, including at a hearing before 4the court, except as otherwise provided in Section 104-14 of 5this Code. 6(Source: P.A. 100-424, eff. 1-1-18.) 7    (725 ILCS 5/104-17)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-17)8    Sec. 104-17. Commitment for treatment; treatment plan. 9    (a) If the defendant is eligible to be or has been released 10on pretrial release or on his own recognizance, the court 11shall select the least physically restrictive form of 12treatment therapeutically appropriate and consistent with the 13treatment plan. The placement may be ordered either on an 14inpatient or an outpatient basis. Placement shall be on an 15outpatient basis unless the court determines that:16        (1) treatment on an outpatient basis is reasonably 17    expected to inflict serious physical harm upon the 18    defendant or another. No defendant may be ordered to 19    inpatient restoration unless at least one licensed 20    physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist who has 21    examined the defendant testifies in person at the hearing. 22    The defendant may waive the requirement of the testimony 23    subject to the approval of the court; or24        (2) treatment that will restore the defendant to 25    fitness within a reasonable period of time is not   HB3572 Engrossed- 9 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1    available on an outpatient basis. 2    (b) If the defendant's disability is mental, the court may 3order him placed for secure treatment in the custody of the 4Department of Human Services, or the court may order him 5placed in the custody of any other appropriate public or 6private mental health facility or treatment program which has 7agreed to provide treatment to the defendant. If the most 8serious charge faced by the defendant is a misdemeanor, the 9court shall order outpatient treatment, unless the court finds 10good cause on the record that the defendant is reasonably 11expected to inflict serious physical harm on the defendant or 12another due to mental illness. No defendant may be ordered to 13inpatient restoration unless at least one licensed physician, 14clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist who has examined the 15defendant testifies in person at the hearing. The defendant 16may waive the requirement of the testimony subject to the 17approval of the court to order inpatient treatment. If the 18court orders the defendant to inpatient treatment in the 19custody of the Department of Human Services, the Department 20shall evaluate the defendant to determine the most appropriate 21secure facility to receive the defendant and, within 20 days 22of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit court of the 23court's placement order, notify the court of the designated 24facility to receive the defendant. The Department shall admit 25the defendant to a secure facility within 60 days of the 26transmittal of the court's placement order, unless the   HB3572 Engrossed- 10 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1Department can demonstrate good faith efforts at placement and 2a lack of bed and placement availability. If placement cannot 3be made within 60 days of the transmittal of the court's 4placement order and the Department has demonstrated good faith 5efforts at placement and a lack of bed and placement 6availability, the Department shall provide an update to the 7ordering court every 30 days until the defendant is placed. 8Once bed and placement availability is determined, the 9Department shall notify the sheriff who shall promptly 10transport the defendant to the designated facility. If the 11defendant is placed in the custody of the Department of Human 12Services, the defendant shall be placed in a secure setting. 13During the period of time required to determine bed and 14placement availability at the designated facility, the 15defendant shall remain in jail. If during the course of 16evaluating the defendant for placement, the Department of 17Human Services determines that the defendant is currently fit 18to stand trial, it shall immediately notify the court and 19shall submit a written report within 7 days. In that 20circumstance the placement shall be held pending a court 21hearing on the Department's report. Otherwise, upon completion 22of the placement process, including identifying bed and 23placement availability, the sheriff shall be notified and 24shall transport the defendant to the designated facility. If, 25within 60 days of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit 26court of the court's placement order, the Department fails to   HB3572 Engrossed- 11 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1provide the sheriff with notice of bed and placement 2availability at the designated facility, the sheriff shall 3contact the Department to inquire about when a placement will 4become available at the designated facility as well as bed and 5placement availability at other secure facilities. The 6Department shall respond to the sheriff within 2 business days 7of the notice and inquiry by the sheriff seeking the transfer 8and the Department shall provide the sheriff with the status 9of the evaluation, information on bed and placement 10availability, and an estimated date of admission for the 11defendant and any changes to that estimated date of admission. 12If the Department notifies the sheriff during the 2 business 13day period of a facility operated by the Department with 14placement availability, the sheriff shall promptly transport 15the defendant to that facility. The placement may be ordered 16either on an inpatient or an outpatient basis.17    (c) If the defendant's disability is physical, the court 18may order him placed under the supervision of the Department 19of Human Services which shall place and maintain the defendant 20in a suitable treatment facility or program, or the court may 21order him placed in an appropriate public or private facility 22or treatment program which has agreed to provide treatment to 23the defendant. The placement may be ordered either on an 24inpatient or an outpatient basis.25    (d) The clerk of the circuit court shall within 5 days of 26the entry of the order transmit to the Department, agency or   HB3572 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1institution, if any, to which the defendant is remanded for 2treatment, the following:3        (1) a certified copy of the order to undergo 4    treatment. Accompanying the certified copy of the order to 5    undergo treatment shall be the complete copy of any report 6    prepared under Section 104-15 of this Code or other report 7    prepared by a forensic examiner for the court;8        (2) the county and municipality in which the offense 9    was committed;10        (3) the county and municipality in which the arrest 11    took place;12        (4) a copy of the arrest report, criminal charges, 13    arrest record; and 14        (5) all additional matters which the Court directs the 15    clerk to transmit.16    (e) Within 30 days of admission to the designated 17facility, the person supervising the defendant's treatment 18shall file with the court, the State, and the defense a report 19assessing the facility's or program's capacity to provide 20appropriate treatment for the defendant and indicating his 21opinion as to the probability of the defendant's attaining 22fitness within a period of time from the date of the finding of 23unfitness. For a defendant charged with a felony, the period 24of time shall be one year. For a defendant charged with a 25misdemeanor, the period of time shall be no longer than the 26sentence if convicted of the most serious offense, less credit   HB3572 Engrossed- 13 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1for good behavior as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Unified 2Code of Corrections. If the report indicates that there is a 3substantial probability that the defendant will attain fitness 4within the time period, the treatment supervisor shall also 5file a treatment plan which shall include:6        (1) A diagnosis of the defendant's disability;7        (2) A description of treatment goals with respect to 8    rendering the defendant fit, a specification of the 9    proposed treatment modalities, and an estimated timetable 10    for attainment of the goals;11        (3) An identification of the person in charge of 12    supervising the defendant's treatment.13(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 1-1-23; 102-1118, eff. 1-18-23.) 14    (725 ILCS 5/104-32 new)15    Sec. 104-32.
