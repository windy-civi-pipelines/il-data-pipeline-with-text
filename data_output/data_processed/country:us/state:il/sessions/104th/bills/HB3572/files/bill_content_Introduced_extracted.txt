Reference to Act. This Act may be referred to as 5the Diversion of Unfit Misdemeanants Act. 6    Section 5. Purpose. The General Assembly recognizes that 7there are a substantial number of persons with mental 8illnesses who are charged with misdemeanors and are found 9unfit to stand trial under Article 104 of the Code of Criminal 10Procedure of 1963. Many of these defendants remain in the 11criminal justice system for periods of time longer than they 12would have served had they been convicted of the misdemeanor 13with which they have been charged. These defendants impose a 14substantial financial burden on county jails, the criminal 15court system, and State-operated mental health facilities 16where they are frequently committed under Section 104-17 of 17the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Additionally, despite 18extended involvement in the criminal justice system, many of 19these defendants do not receive the mental health treatment 20needed to reduce the likelihood that they will commit future 21offenses and are not successfully linked to on-going mental 22health services when their involvement in the criminal justice 23system ends, including community-based treatment programs. The   HB3572- 2 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1General Assembly finds that the interests of public safety, 2the welfare of persons with mental illnesses charged with 3misdemeanors, and the efficient and effective use of public 4resources may be served by creating programs which remove 5these defendants from the criminal justice system and use 6behavioral health services, case management, and substance use 7disorder treatment, including, but not limited to, treatment 8authorized under Articles IV, VII, and VII-A and Section 93-801.5 of Article VIII of the Mental Health and Developmental 10Disabilities Code. 11    Section 10. The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 is 12amended by changing Sections 104-13, 104-15, and 104-17 and by 13adding Article 104A as follows: 14    (725 ILCS 5/104-13)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-13)15    Sec. 104-13. Fitness examination. 16    (a) When the issue of fitness involves the defendant's 17mental condition, the court shall order an examination of the 18defendant by one or more licensed physicians, clinical 19psychologists, or psychiatrists chosen by the court. No 20physician, clinical psychologist or psychiatrist employed by 21the Department of Human Services shall be ordered to perform, 22in his official capacity, an examination under this Section.23    (a-1) The Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts is 24encouraged to establish standards and a certification process   HB3572- 3 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1for court-appointed fitness evaluators designed to increase 2the availability of qualified evaluators statewide and to 3increase access, consistency, and fairness within 4fitness-to-stand-trial proceedings and subsequent placement 5recommendations. 6    (b) If the issue of fitness involves the defendant's 7physical condition, the court shall appoint one or more 8physicians and in addition, such other experts as it may deem 9appropriate to examine the defendant and to report to the 10court regarding the defendant's condition.11    (c) An examination ordered under this Section shall be 12given at the place designated by the person who will conduct 13the examination, except that if the defendant is being held in 14custody, the examination shall take place at such location as 15the court directs. No examinations under this Section shall be 16ordered to take place at mental health or developmental 17disabilities facilities operated by the Department of Human 18Services. If the defendant fails to keep appointments without 19reasonable cause or if the person conducting the examination 20reports to the court that diagnosis requires hospitalization 21or extended observation, the court may order the defendant 22admitted to an appropriate facility for an examination, other 23than a screening examination, for not more than 7 days. The 24court may, upon a showing of good cause, grant an additional 7 25days to complete the examination.26    (d) Pretrial Release on pretrial release or on   HB3572- 4 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1recognizance shall not be revoked and an application therefor 2shall not be denied on the grounds that an examination has been 3ordered.4    (e) Upon request by the defense and if the defendant is 5indigent, the court may appoint, in addition to the expert or 6experts chosen pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section, a 7qualified expert selected by the defendant to examine him and 8to make a report as provided in Section 104-15. Upon the filing 9with the court of a verified statement of services rendered, 10the court shall enter an order on the county board to pay such 11expert a reasonable fee stated in the order.12(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 1-1-23.) 13    (725 ILCS 5/104-15)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-15)14    Sec. 104-15. Report. 15    (a) The person or persons conducting an examination of the 16defendant, pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 104-13 17shall submit a written report to the court, the State, and the 18defense within 30 days of the date of the order. The report 19shall include:20        (1) A diagnosis and an explanation as to how it was 21    reached and the facts upon which it is based;22        (2) A description of the defendant's mental or 23    physical disability, if any; its severity; and an opinion 24    as to whether and to what extent it impairs the 25    defendant's ability to understand the nature and purpose   HB3572- 5 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1    of the proceedings against him or to assist in his 2    defense, or both.3    (b) If the report indicates that the defendant is not fit 4to stand trial or to plead because of a disability, the report 5shall include an opinion as to the likelihood of the defendant 6attaining fitness within the statutory a period of time from 7the date of the finding of unfitness if provided with a course 8of treatment. For a defendant charged with a felony, the 9period of time shall be one year. For a defendant charged with 10a Class A misdemeanor, the period of time shall be no longer 11than the maximum term of imprisonment for the most serious 12offense. The period of commitment shall not exceed the maximum 13length of time that the defendant would have been required to 14serve, less credit for good behavior as provided in Section 155-4-1 of the Unified Code of Corrections. Defendants charged 16with Class B and C misdemeanors, petty offenses, infraction of 17a municipal ordinance, or violation of the Illinois Vehicle 18Code are not eligible for fitness restoration services. If the 19person or persons preparing the initial fitness report are 20unable to form such an opinion, the report shall state the 21reasons therefore therefor. The report shall may include a 22general description of the type of treatment needed and of the 23least physically restrictive form of treatment therapeutically 24appropriate. Should inpatient treatment be recommended, the 25report must articulate the evaluator's assessment of risk, 26protective factors, and treatment needs as related to their   HB3572- 6 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1mental disorder. Risk shall not be determined solely by the 2nature of the defendant's criminal charges. 3    (c) The report shall indicate what information, if any, 4contained therein may be harmful to the mental condition of 5the defendant if made known to him.6    (d) In addition to the report, a person retained or 7appointed by the State or the defense to conduct an 8examination shall, upon written request, make his or her 9notes, other evaluations reviewed or relied upon by the 10testifying witness, and any videotaped interviews available to 11another examiner of the defendant. All forensic interviews 12conducted by a person retained or appointed by the State or the 13defense shall be videotaped unless doing so would be 14impractical. In the event that the interview is not 15videotaped, the examiner may still testify as to the person's 16fitness and the court may only consider the lack of compliance 17in according the weight and not the admissibility of the 18expert testimony. An examiner may use these materials as part 19of his or her diagnosis and explanation but shall not 20otherwise disclose the contents, including at a hearing before 21the court, except as otherwise provided in Section 104-14 of 22this Code. 23(Source: P.A. 100-424, eff. 1-1-18.) 24    (725 ILCS 5/104-17)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-17)25    Sec. 104-17. Commitment for treatment; treatment plan.   HB3572- 7 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1    (a) If the defendant is eligible to be or has been released 2on pretrial release or on his own recognizance, the court 3shall select the least physically restrictive form of 4treatment therapeutically appropriate and consistent with the 5treatment plan. The placement may be ordered either on an 6inpatient or an outpatient basis. Placement shall be on an 7outpatient basis unless the court determines that:8        (1) treatment on an outpatient basis is reasonably 9    expected to inflict serious physical harm upon himself, 10    herself,     or another; or11        (2) treatment that will restore the defendant to 12    fitness within a reasonable period of time is not 13    available on an outpatient basis. 14    (b) If the defendant's disability is mental, the court may 15order him placed for secure treatment in the custody of the 16Department of Human Services, or the court may order him 17placed in the custody of any other appropriate public or 18private mental health facility or treatment program which has 19agreed to provide treatment to the defendant. If the most 20serious charge faced by the defendant is a misdemeanor, the 21court shall order outpatient treatment, unless the court finds 22good cause on the record that the defendant is reasonably 23expected to inflict serious physical harm on himself, herself, 24or another due to mental illness to order inpatient treatment. 25If the court orders the defendant to inpatient treatment in 26the custody of the Department of Human Services, the   HB3572- 8 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1Department shall evaluate the defendant to determine the most 2appropriate secure facility to receive the defendant and, 3within 20 days of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit 4court of the court's placement order, notify the court of the 5designated facility to receive the defendant. The Department 6shall admit the defendant to a secure facility within 60 days 7of the transmittal of the court's placement order, unless the 8Department can demonstrate good faith efforts at placement and 9a lack of bed and placement availability. If placement cannot 10be made within 60 days of the transmittal of the court's 11placement order and the Department has demonstrated good faith 12efforts at placement and a lack of bed and placement 13availability, the Department shall provide an update to the 14ordering court every 30 days until the defendant is placed. 15Once bed and placement availability is determined, the 16Department shall notify the sheriff who shall promptly 17transport the defendant to the designated facility. If the 18defendant is placed in the custody of the Department of Human 19Services, the defendant shall be placed in a secure setting. 20During the period of time required to determine bed and 21placement availability at the designated facility, the 22defendant shall remain in jail. If during the course of 23evaluating the defendant for placement, the Department of 24Human Services determines that the defendant is currently fit 25to stand trial, it shall immediately notify the court and 26shall submit a written report within 7 days. In that   HB3572- 9 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1circumstance the placement shall be held pending a court 2hearing on the Department's report. Otherwise, upon completion 3of the placement process, including identifying bed and 4placement availability, the sheriff shall be notified and 5shall transport the defendant to the designated facility. If, 6within 60 days of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit 7court of the court's placement order, the Department fails to 8provide the sheriff with notice of bed and placement 9availability at the designated facility, the sheriff shall 10contact the Department to inquire about when a placement will 11become available at the designated facility as well as bed and 12placement availability at other secure facilities. The 13Department shall respond to the sheriff within 2 business days 14of the notice and inquiry by the sheriff seeking the transfer 15and the Department shall provide the sheriff with the status 16of the evaluation, information on bed and placement 17availability, and an estimated date of admission for the 18defendant and any changes to that estimated date of admission. 19If the Department notifies the sheriff during the 2 business 20day period of a facility operated by the Department with 21placement availability, the sheriff shall promptly transport 22the defendant to that facility. The placement may be ordered 23either on an inpatient or an outpatient basis.24    (c) If the defendant's disability is physical, the court 25may order him placed under the supervision of the Department 26of Human Services which shall place and maintain the defendant   HB3572- 10 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1in a suitable treatment facility or program, or the court may 2order him placed in an appropriate public or private facility 3or treatment program which has agreed to provide treatment to 4the defendant. The placement may be ordered either on an 5inpatient or an outpatient basis.6    (d) The clerk of the circuit court shall within 5 days of 7the entry of the order transmit to the Department, agency or 8institution, if any, to which the defendant is remanded for 9treatment, the following:10        (1) a certified copy of the order to undergo 11    treatment. Accompanying the certified copy of the order to 12    undergo treatment shall be the complete copy of any report 13    prepared under Section 104-15 of this Code or other report 14    prepared by a forensic examiner for the court;15        (2) the county and municipality in which the offense 16    was committed;17        (3) the county and municipality in which the arrest 18    took place;19        (4) a copy of the arrest report, criminal charges, 20    arrest record; and 21        (5) all additional matters which the Court directs the 22    clerk to transmit.23    (e) Within 30 days of admission to the designated 24facility, the person supervising the defendant's treatment 25shall file with the court, the State, and the defense a report 26assessing the facility's or program's capacity to provide   HB3572- 11 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1appropriate treatment for the defendant and indicating his 2opinion as to the probability of the defendant's attaining 3fitness within a period of time from the date of the finding of 4unfitness. For a defendant charged with a felony, the period 5of time shall be one year. For a defendant charged with a 6misdemeanor, the period of time shall be no longer than the 7sentence if convicted of the most serious offense, less credit 8for good behavior as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Unified 9Code of Corrections. If the report indicates that there is a 10substantial probability that the defendant will attain fitness 11within the time period, the treatment supervisor shall also 12file a treatment plan which shall include:13        (1) A diagnosis of the defendant's disability;14        (2) A description of treatment goals with respect to 15    rendering the defendant fit, a specification of the 16    proposed treatment modalities, and an estimated timetable 17    for attainment of the goals;18        (3) An identification of the person in charge of 19    supervising the defendant's treatment.20(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 1-1-23; 102-1118, eff. 1-18-23.) 21    (725 ILCS 5/Art. 104A heading new)22ARTICLE 104A.

The General Assembly recognizes that 7there are a substantial number of persons with mental 8illnesses who are charged with misdemeanors and are found 9unfit to stand trial under Article 104 of the Code of Criminal 10Procedure of 1963. Many of these defendants remain in the 11criminal justice system for periods of time longer than they 12would have served had they been convicted of the misdemeanor 13with which they have been charged. These defendants impose a 14substantial financial burden on county jails, the criminal 15court system, and State-operated mental health facilities 16where they are frequently committed under Section 104-17 of 17the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Additionally, despite 18extended involvement in the criminal justice system, many of 19these defendants do not receive the mental health treatment 20needed to reduce the likelihood that they will commit future 21offenses and are not successfully linked to on-going mental 22health services when their involvement in the criminal justice 23system ends, including community-based treatment programs.

If the 19person or persons preparing the initial fitness report are 20unable to form such an opinion, the report shall state the 21reasons therefore therefor. The report shall may include a 22general description of the type of treatment needed and of the 23least physically restrictive form of treatment therapeutically 24appropriate. Should inpatient treatment be recommended, the 25report must articulate the evaluator's assessment of risk, 26protective factors, and treatment needs as related to their   HB3572- 6 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1mental disorder. Risk shall not be determined solely by the 2nature of the defendant's criminal charges. 3    (c) The report shall indicate what information, if any, 4contained therein may be harmful to the mental condition of 5the defendant if made known to him.6    (d) In addition to the report, a person retained or 7appointed by the State or the defense to conduct an 8examination shall, upon written request, make his or her 9notes, other evaluations reviewed or relied upon by the 10testifying witness, and any videotaped interviews available to 11another examiner of the defendant. All forensic interviews 12conducted by a person retained or appointed by the State or the 13defense shall be videotaped unless doing so would be 14impractical. In the event that the interview is not 15videotaped, the examiner may still testify as to the person's 16fitness and the court may only consider the lack of compliance 17in according the weight and not the admissibility of the 18expert testimony. An examiner may use these materials as part 19of his or her diagnosis and explanation but shall not 20otherwise disclose the contents, including at a hearing before 21the court, except as otherwise provided in Section 104-14 of 22this Code. 23(Source: P.A. 100-424, eff. 1-1-18.) 24    (725 ILCS 5/104-17)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-17)25    Sec. 104-17. Commitment for treatment; treatment plan.   HB3572- 7 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1    (a) If the defendant is eligible to be or has been released 2on pretrial release or on his own recognizance, the court 3shall select the least physically restrictive form of 4treatment therapeutically appropriate and consistent with the 5treatment plan. The placement may be ordered either on an 6inpatient or an outpatient basis. Placement shall be on an 7outpatient basis unless the court determines that:8        (1) treatment on an outpatient basis is reasonably 9    expected to inflict serious physical harm upon himself, 10    herself,     or another; or11        (2) treatment that will restore the defendant to 12    fitness within a reasonable period of time is not 13    available on an outpatient basis. 14    (b) If the defendant's disability is mental, the court may 15order him placed for secure treatment in the custody of the 16Department of Human Services, or the court may order him 17placed in the custody of any other appropriate public or 18private mental health facility or treatment program which has 19agreed to provide treatment to the defendant. If the most 20serious charge faced by the defendant is a misdemeanor, the 21court shall order outpatient treatment, unless the court finds 22good cause on the record that the defendant is reasonably 23expected to inflict serious physical harm on himself, herself, 24or another due to mental illness to order inpatient treatment. 25If the court orders the defendant to inpatient treatment in 26the custody of the Department of Human Services, the   HB3572- 8 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1Department shall evaluate the defendant to determine the most 2appropriate secure facility to receive the defendant and, 3within 20 days of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit 4court of the court's placement order, notify the court of the 5designated facility to receive the defendant. The Department 6shall admit the defendant to a secure facility within 60 days 7of the transmittal of the court's placement order, unless the 8Department can demonstrate good faith efforts at placement and 9a lack of bed and placement availability. If placement cannot 10be made within 60 days of the transmittal of the court's 11placement order and the Department has demonstrated good faith 12efforts at placement and a lack of bed and placement 13availability, the Department shall provide an update to the 14ordering court every 30 days until the defendant is placed. 15Once bed and placement availability is determined, the 16Department shall notify the sheriff who shall promptly 17transport the defendant to the designated facility. If the 18defendant is placed in the custody of the Department of Human 19Services, the defendant shall be placed in a secure setting. 20During the period of time required to determine bed and 21placement availability at the designated facility, the 22defendant shall remain in jail. If during the course of 23evaluating the defendant for placement, the Department of 24Human Services determines that the defendant is currently fit 25to stand trial, it shall immediately notify the court and 26shall submit a written report within 7 days. In that   HB3572- 9 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1circumstance the placement shall be held pending a court 2hearing on the Department's report. Otherwise, upon completion 3of the placement process, including identifying bed and 4placement availability, the sheriff shall be notified and 5shall transport the defendant to the designated facility. If, 6within 60 days of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit 7court of the court's placement order, the Department fails to 8provide the sheriff with notice of bed and placement 9availability at the designated facility, the sheriff shall 10contact the Department to inquire about when a placement will 11become available at the designated facility as well as bed and 12placement availability at other secure facilities. The 13Department shall respond to the sheriff within 2 business days 14of the notice and inquiry by the sheriff seeking the transfer 15and the Department shall provide the sheriff with the status 16of the evaluation, information on bed and placement 17availability, and an estimated date of admission for the 18defendant and any changes to that estimated date of admission. 19If the Department notifies the sheriff during the 2 business 20day period of a facility operated by the Department with 21placement availability, the sheriff shall promptly transport 22the defendant to that facility. The placement may be ordered 23either on an inpatient or an outpatient basis.24    (c) If the defendant's disability is physical, the court 25may order him placed under the supervision of the Department 26of Human Services which shall place and maintain the defendant   HB3572- 10 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1in a suitable treatment facility or program, or the court may 2order him placed in an appropriate public or private facility 3or treatment program which has agreed to provide treatment to 4the defendant. The placement may be ordered either on an 5inpatient or an outpatient basis.6    (d) The clerk of the circuit court shall within 5 days of 7the entry of the order transmit to the Department, agency or 8institution, if any, to which the defendant is remanded for 9treatment, the following:10        (1) a certified copy of the order to undergo 11    treatment. Accompanying the certified copy of the order to 12    undergo treatment shall be the complete copy of any report 13    prepared under Section 104-15 of this Code or other report 14    prepared by a forensic examiner for the court;15        (2) the county and municipality in which the offense 16    was committed;17        (3) the county and municipality in which the arrest 18    took place;19        (4) a copy of the arrest report, criminal charges, 20    arrest record; and 21        (5) all additional matters which the Court directs the 22    clerk to transmit.23    (e) Within 30 days of admission to the designated 24facility, the person supervising the defendant's treatment 25shall file with the court, the State, and the defense a report 26assessing the facility's or program's capacity to provide   HB3572- 11 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1appropriate treatment for the defendant and indicating his 2opinion as to the probability of the defendant's attaining 3fitness within a period of time from the date of the finding of 4unfitness. For a defendant charged with a felony, the period 5of time shall be one year. For a defendant charged with a 6misdemeanor, the period of time shall be no longer than the 7sentence if convicted of the most serious offense, less credit 8for good behavior as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Unified 9Code of Corrections. If the report indicates that there is a 10substantial probability that the defendant will attain fitness 11within the time period, the treatment supervisor shall also 12file a treatment plan which shall include:13        (1) A diagnosis of the defendant's disability;14        (2) A description of treatment goals with respect to 15    rendering the defendant fit, a specification of the 16    proposed treatment modalities, and an estimated timetable 17    for attainment of the goals;18        (3) An identification of the person in charge of 19    supervising the defendant's treatment.20(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 1-1-23; 102-1118, eff. 1-18-23.) 21    (725 ILCS 5/Art. 104A heading new)22ARTICLE 104A.

Rulemaking. The Illinois Supreme Court or any 8circuit court of this State may adopt rules establishing unfit 9misdemeanant diversion programs consistent with this Article. 10    (725 ILCS 5/104A-3 new)11    Sec. 104A-3. Procedure. The court shall require an 12eligibility screening and an assessment of the defendant to 13determine whether the defendant may be able to receive mental 14health services under the Mental Health and Developmental 15Disabilities Code which shall reasonably assure his or her 16safety and that of the public and his or her continued 17participation in treatment. If, following this screening, the 18State and the defendant agree to the diversion and the court 19determines that the defendant is appropriate for diversion, 20the criminal charges may be dismissed with prejudice. If the 21court does not approve, the court shall order a fitness 22examination under Section 104-13 of this Code and the matter 23shall be governed by any other relevant provisions of Article 24104.   HB3572- 13 -LRB104 10652 RLC 20729 b1    (725 ILCS 5/104A-4 new)2    Sec. 104A-4.
