Amend House Bill 3572 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 1. Reference to Act. This Act may be referred to 5as the Diversion of Unfit Misdemeanants Act. 6    Section 5. Purpose. The General Assembly recognizes that 7there are a substantial number of persons with mental 8illnesses who are charged with misdemeanors and are found 9unfit to stand trial under Article 104 of the Code of Criminal 10Procedure of 1963. Many of these defendants remain in the 11criminal justice system for periods of time longer than they 12would have served had they been convicted of the misdemeanor 13with which they have been charged. These defendants impose a 14substantial financial burden on county jails, the criminal 15court system, and State-operated mental health facilities 16where they are frequently committed under Section 104-17 of   10400HB3572sam002- 2 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Additionally, despite 2extended involvement in the criminal justice system, many of 3these defendants do not receive the mental health treatment 4needed to reduce the likelihood that they will commit future 5offenses and are not successfully linked to ongoing mental 6health services when their involvement in the criminal justice 7system ends, including community-based treatment programs. The 8General Assembly finds that the interests of public safety, 9the welfare of persons with mental illnesses charged with 10misdemeanors, and the efficient and effective use of public 11resources may be served by creating programs which remove 12these defendants from the criminal justice system and use 13behavioral health services, case management, and substance use 14disorder treatment, including, but not limited to, treatment 15authorized under Articles IV, VII, and VII-A and Section 163-801.5 of Article VIII of the Mental Health and Developmental 17Disabilities Code. 18    Section 10. The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 is 19amended by changing Sections 104-11, 104-13, 104-15, and 20104-17 and by adding Section 104-32 and Article 104A as 21follows: 22    (725 ILCS 5/104-11)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-11)23    Sec. 104-11. Raising Issue; Burden; Fitness Motions.) 24  10400HB3572sam002- 3 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1    (a) The issue of the defendant's fitness for trial, to 2plead, or to be sentenced may be raised by the defense, the 3State or the Court at any appropriate time before a plea is 4entered or before, during, or after trial. When a bonafide 5doubt of the defendant's fitness is raised, other than for 6eligible defendants charged with one or more misdemeanors 7subject to Section 104A-1, the court shall order a 8determination of the issue before proceeding further.9    (b) Upon request of the defendant that a qualified expert 10be appointed to examine him or her to determine prior to trial 11if a bonafide doubt as to his or her fitness to stand trial may 12be raised, the court, in its discretion, may order an 13appropriate examination. However, no order entered pursuant to 14this subsection shall prevent further proceedings in the case. 15An expert so appointed shall examine the defendant and make a 16report as provided in Section 104-15. Upon the filing with the 17court of a verified statement of services rendered, the court 18shall enter an order on the county board to pay such expert a 19reasonable fee stated in the order.20    (c) When a bonafide doubt of the defendant's fitness has 21been raised, the burden of proving that the defendant is fit by 22a preponderance of the evidence and the burden of going 23forward with the evidence are on the State. However, the court 24may call its own witnesses and conduct its own inquiry.25    (d) Following a finding of unfitness, the court may hear 26and rule on any pretrial motion or motions if the defendant's   10400HB3572sam002- 4 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1presence is not essential to a fair determination of the 2issues. A motion may be reheard upon a showing that evidence is 3available which was not available, due to the defendant's 4unfitness, when the motion was first decided.5(Source: P.A. 81-1217.) 6    (725 ILCS 5/104-13)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-13)7    Sec. 104-13. Fitness examination. 8    (a) When the issue of fitness involves the defendant's 9mental condition, the court shall order an examination of the 10defendant by one or more licensed physicians, clinical 11psychologists, or psychiatrists chosen by the court. No 12physician, clinical psychologist or psychiatrist employed by 13the Department of Human Services shall be ordered to perform, 14in his official capacity, an examination under this Section.15    (a-1) The Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts is 16encouraged to establish standards and a certification process 17for court-appointed fitness evaluators designed to increase 18the availability of qualified evaluators statewide and to 19increase access, consistency, and fairness within 20fitness-to-stand-trial proceedings and subsequent placement 21recommendations. 22    (b) If the issue of fitness involves the defendant's 23physical condition, the court shall appoint one or more 24physicians and in addition, such other experts as it may deem 25appropriate to examine the defendant and to report to the   10400HB3572sam002- 5 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1court regarding the defendant's condition.2    (c) An examination ordered under this Section shall be 3given at the place designated by the person who will conduct 4the examination, except that if the defendant is being held in 5custody, the examination shall take place at such location as 6the court directs. No examinations under this Section shall be 7ordered to take place at mental health or developmental 8disabilities facilities operated by the Department of Human 9Services. If the defendant fails to keep appointments without 10reasonable cause or if the person conducting the examination 11reports to the court that diagnosis requires hospitalization 12or extended observation, the court may order the defendant 13admitted to an appropriate facility for an examination, other 14than a screening examination, for not more than 7 days. The 15court may, upon a showing of good cause, grant an additional 7 16days to complete the examination.17    (d) Pretrial Release on pretrial release or on 18recognizance shall not be revoked and an application therefor 19shall not be denied on the grounds that an examination has been 20ordered.21    (e) Upon request by the defense and if the defendant is 22indigent, the court may appoint, in addition to the expert or 23experts chosen pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section, a 24qualified expert selected by the defendant to examine him and 25to make a report as provided in Section 104-15. Upon the filing 26with the court of a verified statement of services rendered,   10400HB3572sam002- 6 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1the court shall enter an order on the county board to pay such 2expert a reasonable fee stated in the order.3(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 1-1-23.) 4    (725 ILCS 5/104-15)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-15)5    Sec. 104-15. Report. 6    (a) The person or persons conducting an examination of the 7defendant, pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 104-13 8shall submit a written report to the court, the State, and the 9defense within 30 days of the date of the order. The report 10shall include:11        (1) A diagnosis and an explanation as to how it was 12    reached and the facts upon which it is based;13        (2) A description of the defendant's mental or 14    physical disability, if any; its severity; and an opinion 15    as to whether and to what extent it impairs the 16    defendant's ability to understand the nature and purpose 17    of the proceedings against him or to assist in his 18    defense, or both.19    (b) If the report indicates that the defendant is not fit 20to stand trial or to plead because of a disability, the report 21shall include an opinion as to the likelihood of the defendant 22attaining fitness within the statutory a period of time from 23the date of the finding of unfitness if provided with a course 24of treatment. For a defendant charged with a felony, the 25period of time shall be one year. For a defendant charged with   10400HB3572sam002- 7 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1a misdemeanor, the period of time shall be no longer than the 2maximum term of imprisonment for the most serious offense. The 3period of commitment shall not exceed the maximum length of 4time that the defendant would have been required to serve, 5less credit for good behavior as provided in Section 5-4-1 of 6the Unified Code of Corrections. Defendants charged with petty 7offenses or infraction of a municipal ordinance are not 8eligible for fitness restoration services. If the person or 9persons preparing the initial fitness report are unable to 10form such an opinion, the report shall state the reasons 11therefor. The report shall may include a general description 12of the type of treatment needed and of the least physically 13restrictive form of treatment therapeutically appropriate. If 14inpatient treatment is recommended, the report must articulate 15the evaluator's assessment of risk, protective factors, and 16treatment needs as related to the defendant's mental disorder. 17Risk shall not be determined solely by the nature of the 18defendant's criminal charges. 19    (c) The report shall indicate what information, if any, 20contained therein may be harmful to the mental condition of 21the defendant if made known to him.22    (d) In addition to the report, a person retained or 23appointed by the State or the defense to conduct an 24examination shall, upon written request, make his or her 25notes, other evaluations reviewed or relied upon by the 26testifying witness, and any videotaped interviews available to   10400HB3572sam002- 8 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1another examiner of the defendant. All forensic interviews 2conducted by a person retained or appointed by the State or the 3defense shall be videotaped unless doing so would be 4impractical. In the event that the interview is not 5videotaped, the examiner may still testify as to the person's 6fitness and the court may only consider the lack of compliance 7in according the weight and not the admissibility of the 8expert testimony. An examiner may use these materials as part 9of his or her diagnosis and explanation but shall not 10otherwise disclose the contents, including at a hearing before 11the court, except as otherwise provided in Section 104-14 of 12this Code. 13(Source: P.A. 100-424, eff. 1-1-18.) 14    (725 ILCS 5/104-17)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-17)15    Sec. 104-17. Commitment for treatment; treatment plan. 16    (a) If the defendant is eligible to be or has been released 17on pretrial release or on his own recognizance, the court 18shall select the least physically restrictive form of 19treatment therapeutically appropriate and consistent with the 20treatment plan. The placement may be ordered either on an 21inpatient or an outpatient basis. Placement shall be on an 22outpatient basis unless the court determines that:23        (1) treatment on an outpatient basis is reasonably 24    expected to inflict serious physical harm upon the 25    defendant or another. No defendant may be ordered to   10400HB3572sam002- 9 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1    inpatient restoration unless at least one licensed 2    physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist who has 3    examined the defendant testifies in person at the hearing. 4    The defendant may waive the requirement of the testimony 5    subject to the approval of the court; or6        (2) treatment that will restore the defendant to 7    fitness within a reasonable period of time is not 8    available on an outpatient basis. 9    (b) If the defendant's disability is mental, the court may 10order him placed for secure treatment in the custody of the 11Department of Human Services, or the court may order him 12placed in the custody of any other appropriate public or 13private mental health facility or treatment program which has 14agreed to provide treatment to the defendant. If the most 15serious charge faced by the defendant is a misdemeanor, the 16court shall order outpatient treatment, unless the court finds 17good cause on the record that the defendant is reasonably 18expected to inflict serious physical harm on the defendant or 19another due to mental illness. No defendant may be ordered to 20inpatient restoration unless at least one licensed physician, 21clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist who has examined the 22defendant testifies in person at the hearing. The defendant 23may waive the requirement of the testimony subject to the 24approval of the court to order inpatient treatment. If the 25court orders the defendant to inpatient treatment in the 26custody of the Department of Human Services, the Department   10400HB3572sam002- 10 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1shall evaluate the defendant to determine the most appropriate 2secure facility to receive the defendant and, within 20 days 3of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit court of the 4court's placement order, notify the court of the designated 5facility to receive the defendant. The Department shall admit 6the defendant to a secure facility within 60 days of the 7transmittal of the court's placement order, unless the 8Department can demonstrate good faith efforts at placement and 9a lack of bed and placement availability. If placement cannot 10be made within 60 days of the transmittal of the court's 11placement order and the Department has demonstrated good faith 12efforts at placement and a lack of bed and placement 13availability, the Department shall provide an update to the 14ordering court every 30 days until the defendant is placed. 15Once bed and placement availability is determined, the 16Department shall notify the sheriff who shall promptly 17transport the defendant to the designated facility. If the 18defendant is placed in the custody of the Department of Human 19Services, the defendant shall be placed in a secure setting. 20During the period of time required to determine bed and 21placement availability at the designated facility, the 22defendant shall remain in jail. If during the course of 23evaluating the defendant for placement, the Department of 24Human Services determines that the defendant is currently fit 25to stand trial, it shall immediately notify the court and 26shall submit a written report within 7 days. In that   10400HB3572sam002- 11 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1circumstance the placement shall be held pending a court 2hearing on the Department's report. Otherwise, upon completion 3of the placement process, including identifying bed and 4placement availability, the sheriff shall be notified and 5shall transport the defendant to the designated facility. If, 6within 60 days of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit 7court of the court's placement order, the Department fails to 8provide the sheriff with notice of bed and placement 9availability at the designated facility, the sheriff shall 10contact the Department to inquire about when a placement will 11become available at the designated facility as well as bed and 12placement availability at other secure facilities. The 13Department shall respond to the sheriff within 2 business days 14of the notice and inquiry by the sheriff seeking the transfer 15and the Department shall provide the sheriff with the status 16of the evaluation, information on bed and placement 17availability, and an estimated date of admission for the 18defendant and any changes to that estimated date of admission. 19If the Department notifies the sheriff during the 2 business 20day period of a facility operated by the Department with 21placement availability, the sheriff shall promptly transport 22the defendant to that facility. The placement may be ordered 23either on an inpatient or an outpatient basis.24    (c) If the defendant's disability is physical, the court 25may order him placed under the supervision of the Department 26of Human Services which shall place and maintain the defendant   10400HB3572sam002- 12 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1in a suitable treatment facility or program, or the court may 2order him placed in an appropriate public or private facility 3or treatment program which has agreed to provide treatment to 4the defendant. The placement may be ordered either on an 5inpatient or an outpatient basis.6    (d) The clerk of the circuit court shall within 5 days of 7the entry of the order transmit to the Department, agency or 8institution, if any, to which the defendant is remanded for 9treatment, the following:10        (1) a certified copy of the order to undergo 11    treatment. Accompanying the certified copy of the order to 12    undergo treatment shall be the complete copy of any report 13    prepared under Section 104-15 of this Code or other report 14    prepared by a forensic examiner for the court;15        (2) the county and municipality in which the offense 16    was committed;17        (3) the county and municipality in which the arrest 18    took place;19        (4) a copy of the arrest report, criminal charges, 20    arrest record; and 21        (5) all additional matters which the Court directs the 22    clerk to transmit.23    (e) Within 30 days of admission to the designated 24facility, the person supervising the defendant's treatment 25shall file with the court, the State, and the defense a report 26assessing the facility's or program's capacity to provide   10400HB3572sam002- 13 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1appropriate treatment for the defendant and indicating his 2opinion as to the probability of the defendant's attaining 3fitness within a period of time from the date of the finding of 4unfitness. For a defendant charged with a felony, the period 5of time shall be one year. For a defendant charged with a 6misdemeanor, the period of time shall be no longer than the 7sentence if convicted of the most serious offense, less credit 8for good behavior as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Unified 9Code of Corrections. If the report indicates that there is a 10substantial probability that the defendant will attain fitness 11within the time period, the treatment supervisor shall also 12file a treatment plan which shall include:13        (1) A diagnosis of the defendant's disability;14        (2) A description of treatment goals with respect to 15    rendering the defendant fit, a specification of the 16    proposed treatment modalities, and an estimated timetable 17    for attainment of the goals;18        (3) An identification of the person in charge of 19    supervising the defendant's treatment.20(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 1-1-23; 102-1118, eff. 1-18-23.) 21    (725 ILCS 5/104-32 new)22    Sec. 104-32.

Amend House Bill 3572 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 1. Reference to Act. This Act may be referred to 5as the Diversion of Unfit Misdemeanants Act. 6    Section 5. Purpose. The General Assembly recognizes that 7there are a substantial number of persons with mental 8illnesses who are charged with misdemeanors and are found 9unfit to stand trial under Article 104 of the Code of Criminal 10Procedure of 1963. Many of these defendants remain in the 11criminal justice system for periods of time longer than they 12would have served had they been convicted of the misdemeanor 13with which they have been charged. These defendants impose a 14substantial financial burden on county jails, the criminal 15court system, and State-operated mental health facilities 16where they are frequently committed under Section 104-17 of   10400HB3572sam002- 2 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. Additionally, despite 2extended involvement in the criminal justice system, many of 3these defendants do not receive the mental health treatment 4needed to reduce the likelihood that they will commit future 5offenses and are not successfully linked to ongoing mental 6health services when their involvement in the criminal justice 7system ends, including community-based treatment programs. The 8General Assembly finds that the interests of public safety, 9the welfare of persons with mental illnesses charged with 10misdemeanors, and the efficient and effective use of public 11resources may be served by creating programs which remove 12these defendants from the criminal justice system and use 13behavioral health services, case management, and substance use 14disorder treatment, including, but not limited to, treatment 15authorized under Articles IV, VII, and VII-A and Section 163-801.5 of Article VIII of the Mental Health and Developmental 17Disabilities Code. 18    Section 10. The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 is 19amended by changing Sections 104-11, 104-13, 104-15, and 20104-17 and by adding Section 104-32 and Article 104A as 21follows: 22    (725 ILCS 5/104-11)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-11)23    Sec. 104-11. Raising Issue; Burden; Fitness Motions.) 24  10400HB3572sam002- 3 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1    (a) The issue of the defendant's fitness for trial, to 2plead, or to be sentenced may be raised by the defense, the 3State or the Court at any appropriate time before a plea is 4entered or before, during, or after trial. When a bonafide 5doubt of the defendant's fitness is raised, other than for 6eligible defendants charged with one or more misdemeanors 7subject to Section 104A-1, the court shall order a 8determination of the issue before proceeding further.9    (b) Upon request of the defendant that a qualified expert 10be appointed to examine him or her to determine prior to trial 11if a bonafide doubt as to his or her fitness to stand trial may 12be raised, the court, in its discretion, may order an 13appropriate examination. However, no order entered pursuant to 14this subsection shall prevent further proceedings in the case. 15An expert so appointed shall examine the defendant and make a 16report as provided in Section 104-15. Upon the filing with the 17court of a verified statement of services rendered, the court 18shall enter an order on the county board to pay such expert a 19reasonable fee stated in the order.20    (c) When a bonafide doubt of the defendant's fitness has 21been raised, the burden of proving that the defendant is fit by 22a preponderance of the evidence and the burden of going 23forward with the evidence are on the State. However, the court 24may call its own witnesses and conduct its own inquiry.25    (d) Following a finding of unfitness, the court may hear 26and rule on any pretrial motion or motions if the defendant's   10400HB3572sam002- 4 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1presence is not essential to a fair determination of the 2issues. A motion may be reheard upon a showing that evidence is 3available which was not available, due to the defendant's 4unfitness, when the motion was first decided.5(Source: P.A. 81-1217.) 6    (725 ILCS 5/104-13)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-13)7    Sec. 104-13. Fitness examination. 8    (a) When the issue of fitness involves the defendant's 9mental condition, the court shall order an examination of the 10defendant by one or more licensed physicians, clinical 11psychologists, or psychiatrists chosen by the court. No 12physician, clinical psychologist or psychiatrist employed by 13the Department of Human Services shall be ordered to perform, 14in his official capacity, an examination under this Section.15    (a-1) The Administrative Office of the Illinois Courts is 16encouraged to establish standards and a certification process 17for court-appointed fitness evaluators designed to increase 18the availability of qualified evaluators statewide and to 19increase access, consistency, and fairness within 20fitness-to-stand-trial proceedings and subsequent placement 21recommendations. 22    (b) If the issue of fitness involves the defendant's 23physical condition, the court shall appoint one or more 24physicians and in addition, such other experts as it may deem 25appropriate to examine the defendant and to report to the   10400HB3572sam002- 5 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1court regarding the defendant's condition.2    (c) An examination ordered under this Section shall be 3given at the place designated by the person who will conduct 4the examination, except that if the defendant is being held in 5custody, the examination shall take place at such location as 6the court directs. No examinations under this Section shall be 7ordered to take place at mental health or developmental 8disabilities facilities operated by the Department of Human 9Services. If the defendant fails to keep appointments without 10reasonable cause or if the person conducting the examination 11reports to the court that diagnosis requires hospitalization 12or extended observation, the court may order the defendant 13admitted to an appropriate facility for an examination, other 14than a screening examination, for not more than 7 days. The 15court may, upon a showing of good cause, grant an additional 7 16days to complete the examination.17    (d) Pretrial Release on pretrial release or on 18recognizance shall not be revoked and an application therefor 19shall not be denied on the grounds that an examination has been 20ordered.21    (e) Upon request by the defense and if the defendant is 22indigent, the court may appoint, in addition to the expert or 23experts chosen pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section, a 24qualified expert selected by the defendant to examine him and 25to make a report as provided in Section 104-15. Upon the filing 26with the court of a verified statement of services rendered,   10400HB3572sam002- 6 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1the court shall enter an order on the county board to pay such 2expert a reasonable fee stated in the order.3(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 1-1-23.) 4    (725 ILCS 5/104-15)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-15)5    Sec. 104-15. Report. 6    (a) The person or persons conducting an examination of the 7defendant, pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) of Section 104-13 8shall submit a written report to the court, the State, and the 9defense within 30 days of the date of the order. The report 10shall include:11        (1) A diagnosis and an explanation as to how it was 12    reached and the facts upon which it is based;13        (2) A description of the defendant's mental or 14    physical disability, if any; its severity; and an opinion 15    as to whether and to what extent it impairs the 16    defendant's ability to understand the nature and purpose 17    of the proceedings against him or to assist in his 18    defense, or both.19    (b) If the report indicates that the defendant is not fit 20to stand trial or to plead because of a disability, the report 21shall include an opinion as to the likelihood of the defendant 22attaining fitness within the statutory a period of time from 23the date of the finding of unfitness if provided with a course 24of treatment. For a defendant charged with a felony, the 25period of time shall be one year. For a defendant charged with   10400HB3572sam002- 7 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1a misdemeanor, the period of time shall be no longer than the 2maximum term of imprisonment for the most serious offense. The 3period of commitment shall not exceed the maximum length of 4time that the defendant would have been required to serve, 5less credit for good behavior as provided in Section 5-4-1 of 6the Unified Code of Corrections. Defendants charged with petty 7offenses or infraction of a municipal ordinance are not 8eligible for fitness restoration services. If the person or 9persons preparing the initial fitness report are unable to 10form such an opinion, the report shall state the reasons 11therefor. The report shall may include a general description 12of the type of treatment needed and of the least physically 13restrictive form of treatment therapeutically appropriate. If 14inpatient treatment is recommended, the report must articulate 15the evaluator's assessment of risk, protective factors, and 16treatment needs as related to the defendant's mental disorder. 17Risk shall not be determined solely by the nature of the 18defendant's criminal charges. 19    (c) The report shall indicate what information, if any, 20contained therein may be harmful to the mental condition of 21the defendant if made known to him.22    (d) In addition to the report, a person retained or 23appointed by the State or the defense to conduct an 24examination shall, upon written request, make his or her 25notes, other evaluations reviewed or relied upon by the 26testifying witness, and any videotaped interviews available to   10400HB3572sam002- 8 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1another examiner of the defendant. All forensic interviews 2conducted by a person retained or appointed by the State or the 3defense shall be videotaped unless doing so would be 4impractical. In the event that the interview is not 5videotaped, the examiner may still testify as to the person's 6fitness and the court may only consider the lack of compliance 7in according the weight and not the admissibility of the 8expert testimony. An examiner may use these materials as part 9of his or her diagnosis and explanation but shall not 10otherwise disclose the contents, including at a hearing before 11the court, except as otherwise provided in Section 104-14 of 12this Code. 13(Source: P.A. 100-424, eff. 1-1-18.) 14    (725 ILCS 5/104-17)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-17)15    Sec. 104-17. Commitment for treatment; treatment plan. 16    (a) If the defendant is eligible to be or has been released 17on pretrial release or on his own recognizance, the court 18shall select the least physically restrictive form of 19treatment therapeutically appropriate and consistent with the 20treatment plan. The placement may be ordered either on an 21inpatient or an outpatient basis. Placement shall be on an 22outpatient basis unless the court determines that:23        (1) treatment on an outpatient basis is reasonably 24    expected to inflict serious physical harm upon the 25    defendant or another. No defendant may be ordered to   10400HB3572sam002- 9 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1    inpatient restoration unless at least one licensed 2    physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist who has 3    examined the defendant testifies in person at the hearing. 4    The defendant may waive the requirement of the testimony 5    subject to the approval of the court; or6        (2) treatment that will restore the defendant to 7    fitness within a reasonable period of time is not 8    available on an outpatient basis. 9    (b) If the defendant's disability is mental, the court may 10order him placed for secure treatment in the custody of the 11Department of Human Services, or the court may order him 12placed in the custody of any other appropriate public or 13private mental health facility or treatment program which has 14agreed to provide treatment to the defendant. If the most 15serious charge faced by the defendant is a misdemeanor, the 16court shall order outpatient treatment, unless the court finds 17good cause on the record that the defendant is reasonably 18expected to inflict serious physical harm on the defendant or 19another due to mental illness. No defendant may be ordered to 20inpatient restoration unless at least one licensed physician, 21clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist who has examined the 22defendant testifies in person at the hearing. The defendant 23may waive the requirement of the testimony subject to the 24approval of the court to order inpatient treatment. If the 25court orders the defendant to inpatient treatment in the 26custody of the Department of Human Services, the Department   10400HB3572sam002- 10 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1shall evaluate the defendant to determine the most appropriate 2secure facility to receive the defendant and, within 20 days 3of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit court of the 4court's placement order, notify the court of the designated 5facility to receive the defendant. The Department shall admit 6the defendant to a secure facility within 60 days of the 7transmittal of the court's placement order, unless the 8Department can demonstrate good faith efforts at placement and 9a lack of bed and placement availability. If placement cannot 10be made within 60 days of the transmittal of the court's 11placement order and the Department has demonstrated good faith 12efforts at placement and a lack of bed and placement 13availability, the Department shall provide an update to the 14ordering court every 30 days until the defendant is placed. 15Once bed and placement availability is determined, the 16Department shall notify the sheriff who shall promptly 17transport the defendant to the designated facility. If the 18defendant is placed in the custody of the Department of Human 19Services, the defendant shall be placed in a secure setting. 20During the period of time required to determine bed and 21placement availability at the designated facility, the 22defendant shall remain in jail. If during the course of 23evaluating the defendant for placement, the Department of 24Human Services determines that the defendant is currently fit 25to stand trial, it shall immediately notify the court and 26shall submit a written report within 7 days. In that   10400HB3572sam002- 11 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1circumstance the placement shall be held pending a court 2hearing on the Department's report. Otherwise, upon completion 3of the placement process, including identifying bed and 4placement availability, the sheriff shall be notified and 5shall transport the defendant to the designated facility. If, 6within 60 days of the transmittal by the clerk of the circuit 7court of the court's placement order, the Department fails to 8provide the sheriff with notice of bed and placement 9availability at the designated facility, the sheriff shall 10contact the Department to inquire about when a placement will 11become available at the designated facility as well as bed and 12placement availability at other secure facilities. The 13Department shall respond to the sheriff within 2 business days 14of the notice and inquiry by the sheriff seeking the transfer 15and the Department shall provide the sheriff with the status 16of the evaluation, information on bed and placement 17availability, and an estimated date of admission for the 18defendant and any changes to that estimated date of admission. 19If the Department notifies the sheriff during the 2 business 20day period of a facility operated by the Department with 21placement availability, the sheriff shall promptly transport 22the defendant to that facility. The placement may be ordered 23either on an inpatient or an outpatient basis.24    (c) If the defendant's disability is physical, the court 25may order him placed under the supervision of the Department 26of Human Services which shall place and maintain the defendant   10400HB3572sam002- 12 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1in a suitable treatment facility or program, or the court may 2order him placed in an appropriate public or private facility 3or treatment program which has agreed to provide treatment to 4the defendant. The placement may be ordered either on an 5inpatient or an outpatient basis.6    (d) The clerk of the circuit court shall within 5 days of 7the entry of the order transmit to the Department, agency or 8institution, if any, to which the defendant is remanded for 9treatment, the following:10        (1) a certified copy of the order to undergo 11    treatment. Accompanying the certified copy of the order to 12    undergo treatment shall be the complete copy of any report 13    prepared under Section 104-15 of this Code or other report 14    prepared by a forensic examiner for the court;15        (2) the county and municipality in which the offense 16    was committed;17        (3) the county and municipality in which the arrest 18    took place;19        (4) a copy of the arrest report, criminal charges, 20    arrest record; and 21        (5) all additional matters which the Court directs the 22    clerk to transmit.23    (e) Within 30 days of admission to the designated 24facility, the person supervising the defendant's treatment 25shall file with the court, the State, and the defense a report 26assessing the facility's or program's capacity to provide   10400HB3572sam002- 13 -LRB104 10652 RLC 25894 a1appropriate treatment for the defendant and indicating his 2opinion as to the probability of the defendant's attaining 3fitness within a period of time from the date of the finding of 4unfitness. For a defendant charged with a felony, the period 5of time shall be one year. For a defendant charged with a 6misdemeanor, the period of time shall be no longer than the 7sentence if convicted of the most serious offense, less credit 8for good behavior as provided in Section 5-4-1 of the Unified 9Code of Corrections. If the report indicates that there is a 10substantial probability that the defendant will attain fitness 11within the time period, the treatment supervisor shall also 12file a treatment plan which shall include:13        (1) A diagnosis of the defendant's disability;14        (2) A description of treatment goals with respect to 15    rendering the defendant fit, a specification of the 16    proposed treatment modalities, and an estimated timetable 17    for attainment of the goals;18        (3) An identification of the person in charge of 19    supervising the defendant's treatment.20(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 1-1-23; 102-1118, eff. 1-18-23.) 21    (725 ILCS 5/104-32 new)22    Sec. 104-32.
