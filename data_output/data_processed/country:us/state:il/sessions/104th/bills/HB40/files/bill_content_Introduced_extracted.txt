After review and satisfaction of all 7requested conditions, the officer shall be awarded an 8equivalency certificate satisfying the requirements of this 9Section. Within 60 days after the effective date of this 10amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly, the Board shall 11adopt uniform rules providing for a waiver process for a 12person previously employed and qualified as a law enforcement 13or county corrections officer under federal law or the laws of 14any other state, or who has completed a basic law enforcement 15officer or correctional officer academy who would be qualified 16to be employed as a law enforcement officer or correctional 17officer by the federal government or any other state. These 18rules shall address the process for evaluating prior training 19credit, a description and list of the courses typically 20required for reciprocity candidates to complete prior to 21taking the exam, and a procedure for employers seeking a 22pre-activation determination for a reciprocity training 23waiver.

Any hiring agency that fails to train a 17law enforcement officer within this period shall be prohibited 18from employing this individual in a law enforcement capacity 19for one year from the date training was to be completed. If an 20agency again fails to train the individual a second time, the 21agency shall be permanently barred from employing this 22individual in a law enforcement capacity.23    An individual who is not certified by the Board or whose 24certified status is inactive shall not function as a law 25enforcement officer, be assigned the duties of a law 26enforcement officer by an employing agency, or be authorized   HB0040- 11 -LRB104 03559 RTM 13583 b1to carry firearms under the authority of the employer, except 2as otherwise authorized to carry a firearm under State or 3federal law.
