Such request shall be made by registered or 18certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 19the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 20at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 21date on which the expulsion is to become effective.

If the board acts to expel a student, 3the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 4reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 5is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 6shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 7the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 8transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 9in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 10denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 11which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 12of students or staff in the alternative program. 13    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 14superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 15principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 16students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 17suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 18the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 19subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 20shall lie against them for such suspension.

To ensure that 4students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 5recommended that school officials consider forms of 6non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 7suspensions or expulsions. 8    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 9Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 10by which school administrators are required to suspend or 11expel students for particular behaviors.12    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 13used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 14pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 15students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 16subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 17other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 18a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 19School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 20such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 21length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.22    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 23out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 24and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 25only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 26disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the   HB2739- 5 -LRB104 10500 LNS 20575 b1student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 2a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 3the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 4interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 5this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 6students, staff, or members of the school community" and 7"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 8operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 9basis by school officials.

For the purposes of this Section, 22    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 23    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 24    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 25    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 26    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012.

School authorities may request 25the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 26conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking   HB2739- 10 -LRB104 10500 LNS 20575 b1lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 2controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 3illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 4searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 5If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 6evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 7the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 8such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 9disciplinary action may be taken.

If the board acts to expel a student, 3the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 4reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 5is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 6shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 7the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 8transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 9in Article 13A or 13B of this Code.
