Actions brought by the 7adjudicated parent father shall be brought by verified 8petition. If, as a result of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 9testing that is admissible under Section 614 of this Act, the 10petitioner is determined not to be the parent father of the 11child, the adjudication of parentage paternity and any orders 12regarding the allocation of parental responsibilities, 13parenting time, and future payments of support may be vacated. 14This provision shall not apply to actions involving parentage 15of children born through assisted reproduction. 16    (d) An action to declare the non-existence of the 17parent-child relationship brought under subsection (c) of this 18Section shall be barred if brought more than 2 years after the 19petitioner obtains actual knowledge of relevant facts.

The 232-year period for bringing an action to declare the 24non-existence of the parent-child relationship shall not 25extend beyond the date on which the child reaches the age of 18 26years.   10400HB2568sam002- 14 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 2    (750 ILCS 46/301)3    Sec. 301. Voluntary acknowledgment. A parent-child 4relationship may be established voluntarily by the signing and 5witnessing of a voluntary acknowledgment in accordance with 6Section 12 of the Vital Records Act and Section 10-17.7 of the 7Illinois Public Aid Code. A woman or person who gave birth to a 8child and an alleged genetic parent of the child, a presumed 9parent under Section 204, or an intended parent under Article 107, may sign an acknowledgment of parentage to establish the 11parentage of the child. The voluntary acknowledgment shall 12contain the social security numbers or tax identification 13numbers of the persons signing the voluntary acknowledgment; 14however, failure to include the social security numbers of the 15persons signing a voluntary acknowledgment does not invalidate 16the voluntary acknowledgment.17(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 18    (750 ILCS 46/302)19    Sec. 302.

Effect of voluntary acknowledgment or denial of 22parentage. 23    (a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 307 and 308 24of this Act, a valid voluntary acknowledgment filed with the   10400HB2568sam002- 17 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1Department of Healthcare and Family Services, as provided by 2law, is equivalent to an adjudication of the parentage of a 3child and confers upon the acknowledged parent father all of 4the rights and duties of a parent. 5    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, 6parentage established in accordance with Section 301 of this 7Act has the full force and effect of a judgment entered under 8this Act and serves as a basis for seeking a child support 9order without any further proceedings to establish parentage. 10    (c) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 307 and 308 11of this Act, a valid denial by a presumed parent filed with the 12Department of Healthcare and Family Services, as provided by 13law, in conjunction with a voluntary acknowledgment, is 14equivalent to an adjudication of the nonparentage of the 15presumed parent and discharges the presumed parent from all 16rights and duties of a parent. 17(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 18    (750 ILCS 46/401)19    Sec. 401. Proceeding authorized. 20    (a) As soon as practicable, a court, or an administrative 21hearing officer in an Expedited Child Support System may, 22subject to subsection (c), order or direct a woman or person 23who gave birth to the child, the child, and an alleged, 24acknowledged parent, adjudicated parent, or the presumed 25parent to submit to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing to   10400HB2568sam002- 18 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1determine inherited characteristics.2    (b) A court, or an administrative hearing officer in an 3Expedited Child Support System, upon the request of any party, 4or the child, shall, subject to subsection (c), order or 5direct a woman or person who gave birth to the child, the 6child, and a presumed, acknowledged, alleged, or adjudicated 7parent to submit to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing to 8determine inherited characteristics unless the court 9determines that (1) the conduct of the parent, acknowledged 10parent, adjudicated parent, or the presumed parent estops that 11party from denying parentage; (2) it would be inequitable to 12disprove the parent-child relationship between the child and 13the presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parent, and (3) 14that it is in the child's best interest to deny DNA testing 15considering the factors in Section 610(a)(3). It is presumed 16to be equitable and in the best interest of the child to grant 17a motion by the child seeking an order for genetic testing. The 18presumption may be overcome by clear and convincing evidence 19that extraordinary circumstances exist making the genetic 20testing contrary to the child's best interests. The court's 21order denying a child's request for genetic testing must state 22the basis upon which the presumption was overcome. The court's 23order granting a child's request for genetic testing must 24specify the ways in which testing results may be used for 25purposes of protecting the child's best interests. In a 26proceeding involving the application of this Section, a minor   10400HB2568sam002- 19 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1or incapacitated child must be represented by a guardian ad 2litem, child's representative, or attorney for the child.3    (c) Genetic testing may not be used to (1) challenge the 4parentage of a person who is a parent under Article 7 or the 5Gestational Surrogacy Act, inclusive, or (2) establish the 6parentage of a person who is a donor. 7As soon as practicable, a court or an administrative hearing 8officer in an Expedited Child Support System may, and upon the 9request of a party except as provided in Section 610 of this 10Act, or of the child, shall order or direct the mother, child, 11and alleged father to submit to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 12testing to determine inherited characteristics. If any party 13refuses to submit to genetic testing, the court may resolve 14the question of paternity against that party or enforce its 15order if the rights of others and the interests of justice so 16require. 17(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 18    (750 ILCS 46/402)19    Sec. 402. Requirements for genetic testing. 20    (a) The genetic testing shall be conducted by an expert 21qualified as an examiner of blood or tissue types and 22appointed by the court. The expert shall determine the genetic 23testing procedures. However, any interested party, for good 24cause shown, in advance of the scheduled genetic testing, may 25request a hearing to object to the qualifications of the   10400HB2568sam002- 20 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1expert or the genetic testing procedures. The expert appointed 2by the court shall testify at the pre-test hearing at the 3expense of the party requesting the hearing, except for an 4indigent party as provided in Section 405 of this Act. An 5expert not appointed by the court shall testify at the 6pre-test hearing at the expense of the party retaining the 7expert. Inquiry into an expert's qualifications at the 8pre-test hearing shall not affect either party's right to have 9the expert qualified at trial. 10    (b) Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably relied 11upon by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed 12in a testing laboratory accredited by the American Association 13of Blood Banks or a successor to its functions. 14    (c) A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of one 15or more samples, or a combination of samples, of blood, buccal 16cells, bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid. 17    (d) The testing laboratory shall determine the databases 18from which to select frequencies for use in calculation of the 19probability of parentage paternity based on the ethnic or 20racial group of an individual or individuals. If there is 21disagreement as to the testing laboratory's choice, the 22following rules apply: 23        (1) The individual objecting may require the testing 24    laboratory, within 30 days after receipt of the report of 25    the genetic testing, to recalculate the probability of 26    parentage paternity using an ethnic or racial group   10400HB2568sam002- 21 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1    different from that used by the laboratory. 2        (2) The individual objecting to the testing 3    laboratory's initial choice shall: 4            (A) if the frequencies are not available to the 5        testing laboratory for the ethnic or racial group 6        requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled 7        in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or 8            (B) engage another testing laboratory to perform 9        the calculations. 10    (e) If, after recalculation using a different ethnic or 11racial group, genetic testing does not reputably identify a 12person man as the parent father of a child, an individual who 13has been tested may be required to submit to additional 14genetic testing. 15(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 16    (750 ILCS 46/403)17    Sec. 403. Genetic test results. 18    (a) The expert shall prepare a written report of the 19genetic test results. If the genetic test results show that 20the alleged genetic parent father is not excluded, the report 21shall contain statistics based upon the statistical formula of 22combined parentage paternity index (CPI) and the probability 23of parentage paternity as determined by the probability of 24exclusion (Random Person Man Not Excluded = RPNE RMNE). The 25expert may be called by the court as a witness to testify to   10400HB2568sam002- 22 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1the expert's his or her findings and, if called, shall be 2subject to cross-examination by the parties. If the genetic 3test results show that the alleged genetic parent father is 4not excluded, any party may demand that other experts, 5qualified as examiners of blood or tissue types, perform 6independent genetic testing under order of court, including, 7but not limited to, blood types or other testing of genetic 8markers. The results of the genetic testing may be offered 9into evidence. The number and qualifications of the experts 10shall be determined by the court. 11    (b) Documentation of the chain of custody of the blood or 12tissue samples, accompanied by an affidavit or certification 13in accordance with Section 1-109 of the Code of Civil 14Procedure, is competent evidence to establish the chain of 15custody. 16    (c) The report of the genetic test results prepared by the 17appointed expert shall be made by affidavit or by 18certification as provided in Section 1-109 of the Code of 19Civil Procedure and shall be mailed to all parties. A proof of 20service shall be filed with the court. The verified report 21shall be admitted into evidence at trial without foundation 22testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy, unless a 23written motion challenging the admissibility of the report is 24filed by either party within 28 days of receipt of the report, 25in which case expert testimony shall be required. A party may 26not file such a motion challenging the admissibility of the   10400HB2568sam002- 23 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1report later than 28 days before commencement of trial. Before 2trial, the court shall determine whether the motion is 3sufficient to deny admission of the report by verification. 4Failure to make that timely motion constitutes a waiver of the 5right to object to admission by verification and shall not be 6grounds for a continuance of the hearing to establish 7parentage paternity. 8(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 9    (750 ILCS 46/404)10    Sec. 404. Effect of genetic testing. Genetic testing taken 11under this Article shall have the following effect:12        (a) If the court finds that the conclusion of the 13    expert or experts, as disclosed by the evidence based upon 14    the genetic testing, is that the alleged genetic parent 15    father is not the parent of the child, the question of 16    parentage paternity shall be resolved accordingly. 17        (b) If the experts disagree in their findings or 18    conclusions, the question shall be weighed with other 19    competent evidence of parentage paternity. 20        (c) If the genetic testing results indicate that the 21    alleged genetic parent father is not excluded and that the 22    combined parentage paternity index is at least 1,000 to 1, 23    and there is at least a 99.9% probability of parentage 24    paternity, the alleged genetic parent father is presumed 25    to be the parent father, and this evidence shall be   10400HB2568sam002- 24 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1    admitted. 2        (d) A person man identified under subsection (c) of 3    this Section as the parent father of the child may rebut 4    the genetic testing results by other genetic testing 5    satisfying the requirements of this Article which: 6            (1) excludes the person man as a genetic parent 7        father of the child; or 8            (2) identifies another person man as the possible 9        parent father of the child. 10        (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, if 11    more than one person man is identified by genetic testing 12    as the possible parent father of the child, the court 13    shall order them to submit to further genetic testing to 14    identify the genetic parent father. 15(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 16    (750 ILCS 46/405)17    Sec. 405. Cost of genetic testing. The expense of the 18genetic testing shall be paid by the party who requests the 19genetic testing, except that the court may apportion the costs 20between the parties, upon request. When the genetic testing is 21requested by the party seeking to establish parentage 22paternity and that party is found to be indigent by the court, 23the expense shall be paid by the public agency providing 24representation; except that where a public agency is not 25providing representation, the expense shall be paid by the   10400HB2568sam002- 25 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1county in which the action is brought. When the genetic 2testing is ordered by the court on its own motion or is 3requested by the alleged or presumed parent father and that 4parent father is found to be indigent by the court, the expense 5shall be paid by the county in which the action is brought. Any 6part of the expense may be taxed as costs in the action, except 7that no costs may be taxed against a public agency that has not 8requested the genetic testing.9(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 10    (750 ILCS 46/407)11    Sec. 407. Independent genetic testing. Nothing in this 12Article shall prevent a party from obtaining genetic testing 13of the party's his or her own blood or tissue independent of 14those ordered by the court or from presenting expert testimony 15interpreting those tests or any other blood tests ordered 16under this Article. Reports of all the independent tests, 17accompanied by affidavit or certification pursuant to Section 181-109 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and notice of any expert 19witnesses to be called to testify to the results of those tests 20shall be submitted to all parties at least 30 days before any 21hearing set to determine the issue of parentage.22(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 23    (750 ILCS 46/408)24    Sec. 408. Additional persons to be tested.   10400HB2568sam002- 26 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1    (a) Subject to subsection (b), if a genetic-testing 2specimen is not available from a person man who may be the 3parent father of a child, for good cause and under 4circumstances the court considers to be just, the court may 5order the following individuals to submit specimens for 6genetic testing: 7        (1) the parents of the person man; 8        (2) brothers and sisters of the person man; 9        (3) other children of the person and the woman or 10    person who gave birth to the person man and their mothers; 11    and12        (4) other relatives of the person man necessary to 13    complete genetic testing. 14    (b) Issuance of an order under this Section requires a 15finding that a need for genetic testing outweighs the 16legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested, 17and in no event shall an order be issued until the individual 18is joined as a party and given notice as required under the 19Code of Civil Procedure. 20(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 21    (750 ILCS 46/501)22    Sec. 501.

Actions 8brought by the child, the woman or person who gave birth to the 9child mother, or a presumed parent shall be brought by 10verified complaint, which shall be designated a petition. 11After a presumption under Section 204 of this Act has been 12rebutted, parentage of the child by another person man or 13woman may be established in the same action, if such person he 14or she has been made a party.15    (b) An action to declare the non-existence of the 16parent-child relationship brought under subsection (a) of this 17Section shall be barred if brought later than 2 years after the 18petitioner knew or should have known of the relevant facts. 19The 2-year period for bringing an action to declare the 20non-existence of the parent-child relationship shall not 21extend beyond the date on which the child reaches the age of 18 22years. Failure to bring an action within 2 years shall not bar 23any party from asserting a defense in any action to declare the 24existence of the parent-child relationship.25    (c) An action to declare the non-existence of the 26parent-child relationship may be brought subsequent to an   10400HB2568sam002- 13 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1adjudication of parentage in any judgment by the person man 2adjudicated to be the parent pursuant to a presumption in 3paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of Section 204 if, as a 4result of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing, it is 5discovered that the person man adjudicated to be the parent is 6not the parent father of the child. Actions brought by the 7adjudicated parent father shall be brought by verified 8petition. If, as a result of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 9testing that is admissible under Section 614 of this Act, the 10petitioner is determined not to be the parent father of the 11child, the adjudication of parentage paternity and any orders 12regarding the allocation of parental responsibilities, 13parenting time, and future payments of support may be vacated. 14This provision shall not apply to actions involving parentage 15of children born through assisted reproduction. 16    (d) An action to declare the non-existence of the 17parent-child relationship brought under subsection (c) of this 18Section shall be barred if brought more than 2 years after the 19petitioner obtains actual knowledge of relevant facts. The 202-year period shall not apply to periods of time where the 21woman or person who gave birth to the child mother or the child 22refuses to submit to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing. The 232-year period for bringing an action to declare the 24non-existence of the parent-child relationship shall not 25extend beyond the date on which the child reaches the age of 18 26years.   10400HB2568sam002- 14 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 2    (750 ILCS 46/301)3    Sec. 301. Voluntary acknowledgment. A parent-child 4relationship may be established voluntarily by the signing and 5witnessing of a voluntary acknowledgment in accordance with 6Section 12 of the Vital Records Act and Section 10-17.7 of the 7Illinois Public Aid Code. A woman or person who gave birth to a 8child and an alleged genetic parent of the child, a presumed 9parent under Section 204, or an intended parent under Article 107, may sign an acknowledgment of parentage to establish the 11parentage of the child. The voluntary acknowledgment shall 12contain the social security numbers or tax identification 13numbers of the persons signing the voluntary acknowledgment; 14however, failure to include the social security numbers of the 15persons signing a voluntary acknowledgment does not invalidate 16the voluntary acknowledgment.17(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 18    (750 ILCS 46/302)19    Sec. 302. Execution of voluntary acknowledgment. 20    (a) A voluntary acknowledgment described in Section 301 of 21this Act must: 22        (1) be in a record; 23        (2) be signed, or otherwise authenticated, under 24    penalty of perjury by the woman or person who gave birth to   10400HB2568sam002- 15 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1    the child mother and by the person man seeking to 2    establish his parentage; 3        (3) state that the child whose parentage is being 4    acknowledged: 5            (A) does not have a presumed parent, or has a 6        presumed parent whose full name is stated; and 7            (B) does not have another acknowledged or 8        adjudicated parent; 9        (4) be witnessed; and 10        (5) state that the signatories understand that the 11    voluntary acknowledgment is the equivalent of a judicial 12    adjudication of parentage of the child and that: (i) a 13    challenge by a signatory to the voluntary acknowledgment 14    may be permitted only upon a showing of fraud, duress, or 15    material mistake of fact; and (ii) a challenge to the 16    voluntary acknowledgment is barred after 2 years unless 17    that period is tolled pursuant to the law. 18    (b) An acknowledgment is void if it: 19        (1) states that another person is a presumed parent, 20    unless a denial signed or otherwise authenticated by the 21    presumed parent is filed with the Department of Healthcare 22    and Family Services, as provided by law; 23        (2) states that another person is an acknowledged or 24    adjudicated parent; or 25        (3) falsely denies the existence of a presumed, 26    acknowledged, or adjudicated parent of the child.   10400HB2568sam002- 16 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1    (c) A presumed parent father may sign or otherwise 2authenticate a voluntary acknowledgment. 3(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 4    (750 ILCS 46/303)5    Sec. 303. Denial of parentage. A presumed parent may sign 6a denial of parentage. The denial is valid only if:7        (a) a voluntary acknowledgment described in Section 8    301 of this Act signed, or otherwise authenticated, by a 9    person man is filed pursuant to Section 305 of this Act; 10        (b) the denial is in a record, and is signed, or 11    otherwise authenticated, under penalty of perjury; and 12        (c) the presumed parent has not previously: 13            (1) acknowledged his parentage, unless the 14        previous voluntary acknowledgment has been rescinded 15        under Section 307 of this Act or successfully 16        challenged under Section 308 of this Act; or 17            (2) been adjudicated to be the parent of the 18        child. 19(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 20    (750 ILCS 46/305)21    Sec. 305. Effect of voluntary acknowledgment or denial of 22parentage. 23    (a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 307 and 308 24of this Act, a valid voluntary acknowledgment filed with the   10400HB2568sam002- 17 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1Department of Healthcare and Family Services, as provided by 2law, is equivalent to an adjudication of the parentage of a 3child and confers upon the acknowledged parent father all of 4the rights and duties of a parent. 5    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, 6parentage established in accordance with Section 301 of this 7Act has the full force and effect of a judgment entered under 8this Act and serves as a basis for seeking a child support 9order without any further proceedings to establish parentage. 10    (c) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 307 and 308 11of this Act, a valid denial by a presumed parent filed with the 12Department of Healthcare and Family Services, as provided by 13law, in conjunction with a voluntary acknowledgment, is 14equivalent to an adjudication of the nonparentage of the 15presumed parent and discharges the presumed parent from all 16rights and duties of a parent. 17(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 18    (750 ILCS 46/401)19    Sec. 401. Proceeding authorized. 20    (a) As soon as practicable, a court, or an administrative 21hearing officer in an Expedited Child Support System may, 22subject to subsection (c), order or direct a woman or person 23who gave birth to the child, the child, and an alleged, 24acknowledged parent, adjudicated parent, or the presumed 25parent to submit to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing to   10400HB2568sam002- 18 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1determine inherited characteristics.2    (b) A court, or an administrative hearing officer in an 3Expedited Child Support System, upon the request of any party, 4or the child, shall, subject to subsection (c), order or 5direct a woman or person who gave birth to the child, the 6child, and a presumed, acknowledged, alleged, or adjudicated 7parent to submit to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing to 8determine inherited characteristics unless the court 9determines that (1) the conduct of the parent, acknowledged 10parent, adjudicated parent, or the presumed parent estops that 11party from denying parentage; (2) it would be inequitable to 12disprove the parent-child relationship between the child and 13the presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parent, and (3) 14that it is in the child's best interest to deny DNA testing 15considering the factors in Section 610(a)(3). It is presumed 16to be equitable and in the best interest of the child to grant 17a motion by the child seeking an order for genetic testing. The 18presumption may be overcome by clear and convincing evidence 19that extraordinary circumstances exist making the genetic 20testing contrary to the child's best interests. The court's 21order denying a child's request for genetic testing must state 22the basis upon which the presumption was overcome. The court's 23order granting a child's request for genetic testing must 24specify the ways in which testing results may be used for 25purposes of protecting the child's best interests. In a 26proceeding involving the application of this Section, a minor   10400HB2568sam002- 19 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1or incapacitated child must be represented by a guardian ad 2litem, child's representative, or attorney for the child.3    (c) Genetic testing may not be used to (1) challenge the 4parentage of a person who is a parent under Article 7 or the 5Gestational Surrogacy Act, inclusive, or (2) establish the 6parentage of a person who is a donor. 7As soon as practicable, a court or an administrative hearing 8officer in an Expedited Child Support System may, and upon the 9request of a party except as provided in Section 610 of this 10Act, or of the child, shall order or direct the mother, child, 11and alleged father to submit to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 12testing to determine inherited characteristics. If any party 13refuses to submit to genetic testing, the court may resolve 14the question of paternity against that party or enforce its 15order if the rights of others and the interests of justice so 16require. 17(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 18    (750 ILCS 46/402)19    Sec. 402. Requirements for genetic testing. 20    (a) The genetic testing shall be conducted by an expert 21qualified as an examiner of blood or tissue types and 22appointed by the court. The expert shall determine the genetic 23testing procedures. However, any interested party, for good 24cause shown, in advance of the scheduled genetic testing, may 25request a hearing to object to the qualifications of the   10400HB2568sam002- 20 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1expert or the genetic testing procedures. The expert appointed 2by the court shall testify at the pre-test hearing at the 3expense of the party requesting the hearing, except for an 4indigent party as provided in Section 405 of this Act. An 5expert not appointed by the court shall testify at the 6pre-test hearing at the expense of the party retaining the 7expert. Inquiry into an expert's qualifications at the 8pre-test hearing shall not affect either party's right to have 9the expert qualified at trial. 10    (b) Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably relied 11upon by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed 12in a testing laboratory accredited by the American Association 13of Blood Banks or a successor to its functions. 14    (c) A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of one 15or more samples, or a combination of samples, of blood, buccal 16cells, bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid. 17    (d) The testing laboratory shall determine the databases 18from which to select frequencies for use in calculation of the 19probability of parentage paternity based on the ethnic or 20racial group of an individual or individuals. If there is 21disagreement as to the testing laboratory's choice, the 22following rules apply: 23        (1) The individual objecting may require the testing 24    laboratory, within 30 days after receipt of the report of 25    the genetic testing, to recalculate the probability of 26    parentage paternity using an ethnic or racial group   10400HB2568sam002- 21 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1    different from that used by the laboratory. 2        (2) The individual objecting to the testing 3    laboratory's initial choice shall: 4            (A) if the frequencies are not available to the 5        testing laboratory for the ethnic or racial group 6        requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled 7        in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or 8            (B) engage another testing laboratory to perform 9        the calculations. 10    (e) If, after recalculation using a different ethnic or 11racial group, genetic testing does not reputably identify a 12person man as the parent father of a child, an individual who 13has been tested may be required to submit to additional 14genetic testing. 15(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 16    (750 ILCS 46/403)17    Sec. 403. Genetic test results. 18    (a) The expert shall prepare a written report of the 19genetic test results. If the genetic test results show that 20the alleged genetic parent father is not excluded, the report 21shall contain statistics based upon the statistical formula of 22combined parentage paternity index (CPI) and the probability 23of parentage paternity as determined by the probability of 24exclusion (Random Person Man Not Excluded = RPNE RMNE). The 25expert may be called by the court as a witness to testify to   10400HB2568sam002- 22 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1the expert's his or her findings and, if called, shall be 2subject to cross-examination by the parties. If the genetic 3test results show that the alleged genetic parent father is 4not excluded, any party may demand that other experts, 5qualified as examiners of blood or tissue types, perform 6independent genetic testing under order of court, including, 7but not limited to, blood types or other testing of genetic 8markers. The results of the genetic testing may be offered 9into evidence. The number and qualifications of the experts 10shall be determined by the court. 11    (b) Documentation of the chain of custody of the blood or 12tissue samples, accompanied by an affidavit or certification 13in accordance with Section 1-109 of the Code of Civil 14Procedure, is competent evidence to establish the chain of 15custody. 16    (c) The report of the genetic test results prepared by the 17appointed expert shall be made by affidavit or by 18certification as provided in Section 1-109 of the Code of 19Civil Procedure and shall be mailed to all parties. A proof of 20service shall be filed with the court. The verified report 21shall be admitted into evidence at trial without foundation 22testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy, unless a 23written motion challenging the admissibility of the report is 24filed by either party within 28 days of receipt of the report, 25in which case expert testimony shall be required. A party may 26not file such a motion challenging the admissibility of the   10400HB2568sam002- 23 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1report later than 28 days before commencement of trial. Before 2trial, the court shall determine whether the motion is 3sufficient to deny admission of the report by verification. 4Failure to make that timely motion constitutes a waiver of the 5right to object to admission by verification and shall not be 6grounds for a continuance of the hearing to establish 7parentage paternity. 8(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 9    (750 ILCS 46/404)10    Sec. 404. Effect of genetic testing. Genetic testing taken 11under this Article shall have the following effect:12        (a) If the court finds that the conclusion of the 13    expert or experts, as disclosed by the evidence based upon 14    the genetic testing, is that the alleged genetic parent 15    father is not the parent of the child, the question of 16    parentage paternity shall be resolved accordingly. 17        (b) If the experts disagree in their findings or 18    conclusions, the question shall be weighed with other 19    competent evidence of parentage paternity. 20        (c) If the genetic testing results indicate that the 21    alleged genetic parent father is not excluded and that the 22    combined parentage paternity index is at least 1,000 to 1, 23    and there is at least a 99.9% probability of parentage 24    paternity, the alleged genetic parent father is presumed 25    to be the parent father, and this evidence shall be   10400HB2568sam002- 24 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1    admitted. 2        (d) A person man identified under subsection (c) of 3    this Section as the parent father of the child may rebut 4    the genetic testing results by other genetic testing 5    satisfying the requirements of this Article which: 6            (1) excludes the person man as a genetic parent 7        father of the child; or 8            (2) identifies another person man as the possible 9        parent father of the child. 10        (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, if 11    more than one person man is identified by genetic testing 12    as the possible parent father of the child, the court 13    shall order them to submit to further genetic testing to 14    identify the genetic parent father. 15(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 16    (750 ILCS 46/405)17    Sec. 405. Cost of genetic testing. The expense of the 18genetic testing shall be paid by the party who requests the 19genetic testing, except that the court may apportion the costs 20between the parties, upon request. When the genetic testing is 21requested by the party seeking to establish parentage 22paternity and that party is found to be indigent by the court, 23the expense shall be paid by the public agency providing 24representation; except that where a public agency is not 25providing representation, the expense shall be paid by the   10400HB2568sam002- 25 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1county in which the action is brought. When the genetic 2testing is ordered by the court on its own motion or is 3requested by the alleged or presumed parent father and that 4parent father is found to be indigent by the court, the expense 5shall be paid by the county in which the action is brought. Any 6part of the expense may be taxed as costs in the action, except 7that no costs may be taxed against a public agency that has not 8requested the genetic testing.9(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 10    (750 ILCS 46/407)11    Sec. 407. Independent genetic testing. Nothing in this 12Article shall prevent a party from obtaining genetic testing 13of the party's his or her own blood or tissue independent of 14those ordered by the court or from presenting expert testimony 15interpreting those tests or any other blood tests ordered 16under this Article. Reports of all the independent tests, 17accompanied by affidavit or certification pursuant to Section 181-109 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and notice of any expert 19witnesses to be called to testify to the results of those tests 20shall be submitted to all parties at least 30 days before any 21hearing set to determine the issue of parentage.22(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 23    (750 ILCS 46/408)24    Sec. 408. Additional persons to be tested.   10400HB2568sam002- 26 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1    (a) Subject to subsection (b), if a genetic-testing 2specimen is not available from a person man who may be the 3parent father of a child, for good cause and under 4circumstances the court considers to be just, the court may 5order the following individuals to submit specimens for 6genetic testing: 7        (1) the parents of the person man; 8        (2) brothers and sisters of the person man; 9        (3) other children of the person and the woman or 10    person who gave birth to the person man and their mothers; 11    and12        (4) other relatives of the person man necessary to 13    complete genetic testing. 14    (b) Issuance of an order under this Section requires a 15finding that a need for genetic testing outweighs the 16legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested, 17and in no event shall an order be issued until the individual 18is joined as a party and given notice as required under the 19Code of Civil Procedure. 20(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 21    (750 ILCS 46/501)22    Sec. 501. Temporary orders. 23    (a) On a motion by a party and a showing of clear and 24convincing evidence of parentage, the court shall issue a 25temporary order for support of a child, including a non-minor   10400HB2568sam002- 27 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1child with a disability, if the order is appropriate and the 2individual ordered to pay support is: 3        (1) a presumed parent of the child; 4        (2) petitioning to have parentage adjudicated; 5        (3) identified as the parent father through genetic 6    testing under Article 4 of this Act; 7        (4) an alleged genetic parent father who has declined 8    to submit to genetic testing; 9        (5) shown by clear and convincing evidence to be the 10    child's parent father; 11        (6) the woman or person who gave birth to mother of the 12    child except under the Gestational Surrogacy Act; or 13        (7) anyone else determined to be the child's parent. 14    In determining the amount of a temporary child support 15award, the court shall use the guidelines and standards set 16forth in Sections 505, 505.2, and 513.5 of the Illinois 17Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. 18    (b) A temporary order may include provisions for the 19allocation of parental responsibilities and parenting time as 20provided by the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage 21Act. A temporary order may, in accordance with the provisions 22of subsection (a) of Section 508 of the Illinois Marriage and 23Dissolution of Marriage Act that relate to proceedings other 24than pre-judgment dissolution proceedings, include an award 25for interim attorney's fees and costs. 26    (c) Temporary orders issued under this Section shall not   10400HB2568sam002- 28 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1have prejudicial effect with respect to final child support, 2the allocation of parental responsibilities, or parenting time 3orders. 4(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 5    (750 ILCS 46/502)6    Sec. 502. Injunctive relief. 7    (a) In any action brought under this Act for the initial 8determination of parentage, the allocation of parental 9responsibilities or parenting time, or for modification of a 10prior allocation order or judgment or parenting time order, 11the court, upon application of a party, may enjoin a party 12having physical possession or an allocation order or judgment 13from temporarily relocating the child from this State pending 14the adjudication of the issues of parentage, the allocation of 15parental responsibilities, and parenting time. When deciding 16whether to enjoin relocation of a child, or to order a party to 17return the child to this State, the court shall consider 18factors including, but not limited to: 19        (1) the extent of previous involvement with the child 20    by the party seeking to enjoin relocation or to have the 21    absent party return the child to this State; 22        (2) the likelihood that parentage will be established; 23    and 24        (3) the impact on the financial, physical, and 25    emotional health of the party being enjoined from   10400HB2568sam002- 29 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1    relocating the child or the party being ordered to return 2    the child to this State. 3    (b) A temporary restraining order or preliminary 4injunction under this Act shall be governed by the relevant 5provisions of Part 1 of Article XI of the Code of Civil 6Procedure.7    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of 8this Section, the court may decline to enjoin a domestic 9violence victim having physical possession or an allocation 10order or judgment from temporarily or permanently relocating 11the child from this State pending an allocation of parental 12responsibilities or an adjudication of parenting time. In 13determining whether a person is a domestic violence victim, 14the court shall consider the following factors: 15        (1) a sworn statement by the person that the person 16    has good reason to believe that the person he or she is the 17    victim of domestic violence or stalking; 18        (2) a sworn statement that the person fears for the 19    person's his or her safety or the safety of the person's 20    his or her children; 21        (3) evidence from police, court, or other government 22    agency records or files; 23        (4) documentation from a domestic violence program if 24    the person is alleged to be a victim of domestic violence; 25        (5) documentation from a legal, clerical, medical, or 26    other professional from whom the person has sought   10400HB2568sam002- 30 -LRB104 10837 JRC 26833 a1    assistance in dealing with the alleged domestic violence; 2    and 3        (6) any other evidence that supports the sworn 4    statements, such as a statement from any other individual 5    with knowledge of the circumstances that provides the 6    basis for the claim, or physical evidence of the domestic 7    violence. 8(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 9    (750 ILCS 46/601)10    Sec. 601. Proceeding authorized. A civil proceeding may be 11maintained to adjudicate the parentage of a child. The 12proceeding is governed by the Code of Civil Procedure and 13Illinois Supreme Court Rules.

The presumption may be overcome 15by clear and convincing evidence that extraordinary 16circumstances exist making the genetic testing contrary to the 17child's best interests. The court's order denying a child's 18request for genetic testing must state the basis upon which 19the presumption was overcome. The court's order granting a 20child's request for genetic testing must specify the ways in 21which the testing results may be used for purposes of 22protecting the child's best interests.23     (c) (Blank).
