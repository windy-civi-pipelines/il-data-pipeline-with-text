Craig Wilcox SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 60 ILCS 1/110-11 new505 ILCS 147/15    Amends the Township Code. Provides that a township may regulate commercial wind energy facilities, commercial solar energy facilities, or both. Provides that a township may use any of its zoning powers in the regulation of commercial wind energy facilities and commercial solar energy facilities and may prohibit commercial wind energy facilities, commercial solar energy facilities, or both. Provides that a township's regulations over commercial wind energy facilities and commercial solar energy facilities shall prevail over county regulations but not over municipal regulations. Defines terms. Amends the Renewable Energy Facilities Agricultural Impact Mitigation Act making conforming changes. Effective immediately.LRB104 04067 RTM 14091 b  A BILL FOR SB0160LRB104 04067 RTM 14091 b1    AN ACT concerning local government. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Township Code is amended by adding Section 5110-11 as follows: 6    (60 ILCS 1/110-11 new)7    Sec. 110-11. Commercial solar and wind energy facilities.8    (a) As used in this Section:9    "Commercial solar energy facility" means a "commercial 10solar energy system" as defined in Section 10-720 of the 11Property Tax Code. "Commercial solar energy facility" does not 12mean a utility-scale solar energy facility being constructed 13at a site that was eligible to participate in a procurement 14event conducted by the Illinois Power Agency pursuant to 15subsection (c-5) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency 16Act.17    "Commercial wind energy facility" means a wind energy 18conversion facility of equal or greater than 500 kilowatts in 19total nameplate generating capacity.20    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including 21Section 5-12020 of the Counties Code, a township may regulate 22commercial wind energy facilities, commercial solar energy 23facilities, or both. A township's power to regulate commercial   SB0160- 2 -LRB104 04067 RTM 14091 b1wind energy facilities and commercial solar energy facilities 2includes all powers granted under Section 110-10 and the power 3to prohibit commercial wind energy facilities, commercial 4solar energy facilities, or both.5    (c) To the extent that a township's regulation of 6commercial wind energy facilities or commercial solar energy 7facilities conflicts with a county's regulation of commercial 8wind energy facilities or commercial solar energy facilities, 9the township's regulations prevail. To the extent that a 10township's regulation of commercial wind energy facilities or 11commercial solar energy facilities conflict with a 12municipality's regulation of commercial wind energy facilities 13or commercial solar energy facilities, the municipality's 14regulations prevail, including in the 1.5-mile radius 15surrounding the municipality's zoning jurisdiction as provided 16in Section 11-13-26 of the Illinois Municipal Code. 17    Section 10. The Renewable Energy Facilities Agricultural 18Impact Mitigation Act is amended by changing Section 15 as 19follows: 20    (505 ILCS 147/15)21    Sec. 15. Agricultural impact mitigation agreement. 22    (a) A commercial renewable energy facility owner of a 23commercial wind energy facility or a commercial solar energy 24facility that is located on landowner property shall enter   SB0160- 3 -LRB104 04067 RTM 14091 b1into an agricultural impact mitigation agreement with the 2Department outlining construction and deconstruction standards 3and policies designed to preserve the integrity of any 4agricultural land that is impacted by commercial renewable 5energy facility construction and deconstruction. The 6construction and deconstruction of any commercial solar energy 7facility shall be in conformance with the Department's 8standard agricultural impact mitigation agreement referenced 9in subsection (f) of this Section. Except as provided in 10subsection (a-5) of this Section, the terms and conditions of 11the Department's standard agricultural impact mitigation 12agreement are subject to and may be modified by an underlying 13agreement between the landowner and the commercial solar 14energy facility owner. 15    (a-5) Prior to the commencement of construction, a 16commercial solar energy facility owner shall submit to the 17county or township in which the commercial solar facility is 18to be located a deconstruction plan. A commercial solar energy 19facility owner shall provide the county or township with an 20appropriate financial assurance mechanism consistent with the 21Department's standard agricultural impact mitigation agreement 22for and to assure deconstruction in the event of an 23abandonment of a commercial solar energy facility. 24    (b) The agricultural impact mitigation agreement for a 25commercial wind energy facility shall include, but is not 26limited to, such items as restoration of agricultural land   SB0160- 4 -LRB104 04067 RTM 14091 b1affected by construction, deconstruction (including upon 2abandonment of a commercial wind energy facility), 3construction staging, and storage areas; support structures; 4aboveground facilities; guy wires and anchors; underground 5cabling depth; topsoil replacement; protection and repair of 6agricultural drainage tiles; rock removal; repair of 7compaction and rutting; land leveling; prevention of soil 8erosion; repair of damaged soil conservation practices; 9compensation for damages to private property; clearing of 10trees and brush; interference with irrigation systems; access 11roads; weed control; pumping of water from open excavations; 12advance notice of access to private property; indemnification 13of landowners; and deconstruction plans and financial 14assurance for deconstruction (including upon abandonment of a 15commercial wind energy facility). 16    (b-5) The agricultural impact mitigation agreement for a 17commercial solar energy facility shall include, but is not 18limited to, such items as restoration of agricultural land 19affected by construction, deconstruction (including upon 20abandonment of a commercial solar energy facility); support 21structures; aboveground facilities; guy wires and anchors; 22underground cabling depth; topsoil removal and replacement; 23rerouting and permanent repair of agricultural drainage tiles; 24rock removal; repair of compaction and rutting; construction 25during wet weather; land leveling; prevention of soil erosion; 26repair of damaged soil conservation practices; compensation   SB0160- 5 -LRB104 04067 RTM 14091 b1for damages to private property; clearing of trees and brush; 2access roads; weed control; advance notice of access to 3private property; indemnification of landowners; and 4deconstruction plans and financial assurance for 5deconstruction (including upon abandonment of a commercial 6solar energy facility).
