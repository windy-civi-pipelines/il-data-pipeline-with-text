Student discipline report; school discipline 8improvement plan. 9    (a) On or before October 31, 2015 and on or before October 1031 of each subsequent year, the State Board of Education, 11through the State Superintendent of Education, shall prepare a 12report on student discipline in all school districts in this 13State, including State-authorized charter schools. This report 14shall include data from all public schools within school 15districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This 16report must be posted on the Internet website of the State 17Board of Education. The report shall include data on the 18issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and 19removals to alternative settings in lieu of another 20disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, 21gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English 22learner, incident type, and discipline duration. Such data 23shall be reported to the State Board of Education annually by 24all school districts in this State, including State-authorized 25charter schools, in a form and manner as specified by the State   10400SB2423sam001- 24 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1Board of Education, no later than July 31 for the previous 2school year and by July 31 of each year thereafter. 3    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data 4under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and 5determine the top 20% of school districts for the following 6metrics:7        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided 8    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 9    September for the year in which the data was collected, 10    multiplied by 100.11        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided 12    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 13    September for the year in which the data was collected, 14    multiplied by 100.15        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the 16    overrepresentation of students of color or white students 17    in comparison to the total number of students of color or 18    white students on October 1st of the school year in which 19    data are collected, with respect to the use of 20    out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be 21    calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of 22    Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.23    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 24consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school 25year.26    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board   10400SB2423sam001- 25 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1of Education shall require each of the school districts that 2are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described 3in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan 4identifying the strategies the school district will implement 5to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or 6racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School 7districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 8the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 9years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 10    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 11required under federal or State law.12    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 13described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 14districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 15charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10 16out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is 17applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 1820% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 19subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an 20enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 21students of color.22    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 23and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 24one year after being identified, the school district shall 25submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 26district's Internet website a progress report describing the   10400SB2423sam001- 26 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 2(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 3100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 4    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)5    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)6    Sec. 10-22.6. Suspension or expulsion of students; school 7searches. 8    (a) To expel students guilty of gross disobedience or 9misconduct, including gross disobedience or misconduct 10perpetuated by electronic means, pursuant to subsection (b-20) 11of this Section, and no action shall lie against them for such 12expulsion. Expulsion shall take place only after the parents 13have been requested to appear at a meeting of the board, or 14with a hearing officer appointed by it, to discuss their 15child's behavior. Such request shall be made by registered or 16certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 17the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 18at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 19date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 20hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 21shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 22heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 23as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 24the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 25reasons why removing the student from the learning environment   10400SB2423sam001- 27 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 2shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 3the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 4transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 5in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 6denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 7which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 8of students or staff in the alternative program. 9    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 10superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 11principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 12students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 13suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 14the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 15subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 16shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 17policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 18principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 19school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 20to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 21gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 22may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 23reasons. 24    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 25parents or guardian of a student along with a full statement of 26the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right to   10400SB2423sam001- 28 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 2notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 3suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardian, 4the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 5review such action of the superintendent or principal, 6assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 7parents or guardian of the student may appear and discuss the 8suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 9officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 10a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 11its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 12hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 13appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 14subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 15decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 16misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 17suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 18specific duration of the suspension. 19    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 20and consequences available to school officials, school 21exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 22are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 23and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 24extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 25only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 26students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is   10400SB2423sam001- 29 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1recommended that school officials consider forms of 2non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 3suspensions or expulsions. 4    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 5Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 6by which school administrators are required to suspend or 7expel students for particular behaviors.8    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 9used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 10pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 11students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 12subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 13other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 14a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 15School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 16such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 17length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.18    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 19out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 20and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 21only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 22disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 23student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 24a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 25the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 26interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of   10400SB2423sam001- 30 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 2students, staff, or members of the school community" and 3"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 4operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 5basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 6(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 7available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 8exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 9shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 10address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 11exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 12suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 13Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 14of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 15interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 16there were no other appropriate and available interventions.17    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 18than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 19support services during the period of their suspension. For 20purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 21support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 22Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 23this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 24to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 25such appropriate and available services. 26    A school district may refer students who are expelled to   10400SB2423sam001- 31 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1appropriate and available support services.2    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 3re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 4expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 5consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 6Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 7and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 8suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 9alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 10Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 11    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 12suspended students, including those students suspended from 13the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 14school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 15equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 16a student's parent or guardian to notify school officials that 17a student suspended from the school bus does not have 18alternate transportation to school. 19    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 20local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 21meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 22the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.23    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 24provide ongoing professional development to all school 25personnel, school board members, and school resource officers, 26on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the   10400SB2423sam001- 32 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 2involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 3culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 4environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 5the appropriate and available supportive services for the 6promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 7developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 8positive and healthy school climates. 9    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 10time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 11case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 12brought one of the following objects to school, any 13school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 14that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 15expelled for a period of not less than one year:16        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 17    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 18    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 19    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 20    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 21    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012.

The expulsion 4    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 5    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 6    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 7Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 8consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 9Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 10expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 11transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 12Article 13A of the School Code.13    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 14superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 15principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 16student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 17a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 18calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 19that student has been determined to have made an explicit 20threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 21student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 22website through which the threat was made is a site that was 23accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 24was available to third parties who worked or studied within 25the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 26the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to   10400SB2423sam001- 34 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1the safety and security of the threatened individual because 2of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 3student inside the school. 4    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 5authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 6lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 7equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 8personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 9without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 10search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 11Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 12privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 13left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 14the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 15conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 16lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 17controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 18illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 19searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 20If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 21evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 22the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 23such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 24disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also 25turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.26    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or   10400SB2423sam001- 35 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1expulsion from school and all school activities and a 2prohibition from being present on school grounds.3    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if 4a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any 5public or private school in this or any other state, the 6student must complete the entire term of the suspension or 7expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A 8of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program 9under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the 10school district if there is no threat to the safety of students 11or staff in the alternative program.12    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 13students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 14difficulties.15    (i) A student may not be issued a monetary fine or fee as a 16disciplinary consequence, though this shall not preclude 17requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, stolen, 18or damaged property.19    (j) Subsections (a) through (i) of this Section shall 20apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter schools, 21special charter districts, and school districts organized 22under Article 34 of this Code. 23    (k) The expulsion of students enrolled in programs funded 24under Section 1C-2 of this Code is subject to the requirements 25under paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 2-3.71 of 26this Code.   10400SB2423sam001- 36 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1    (l) An in-school suspension program provided by a school 2district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may 3focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and 4positive interaction with other students and school personnel. 5A school district may employ a school social worker or a 6licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school 7suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12. 8(Source: P.A. 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 9103-594, eff. 6-25-24; 103-896, eff. 8-9-24; revised 9-25-24.) 10    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 102-466)11    Sec. 10-22.6.

On and after July 1, 2026, such screening 8    procedures shall be based on criteria established by the 9    Department of Early Childhood.10        Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (4.5), 11    grantees under the program must enter into a memorandum of 12    understanding with the appropriate local Head Start 13    agency. This memorandum must be entered into no later than 14    3 months after the award of a grantee's grant under the 15    program, except that, in the case of the 2009-2010 program 16    year, the memorandum must be entered into no later than 17    the deadline set by the State Board of Education for 18    applications to participate in the program in fiscal year 19    2011, and must address collaboration between the grantee's 20    program and the local Head Start agency on certain issues, 21    which shall include without limitation the following:22            (A) educational activities, curricular objectives, 23        and instruction;24            (B) public information dissemination and access to 25        programs for families contacting programs;26            (C) service areas;  10400SB2423sam001- 13 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1            (D) selection priorities for eligible children to 2        be served by programs;3            (E) maximizing the impact of federal and State 4        funding to benefit young children;5            (F) staff training, including opportunities for 6        joint staff training;7            (G) technical assistance;8            (H) communication and parent outreach for smooth 9        transitions to kindergarten;10            (I) provision and use of facilities, 11        transportation, and other program elements;12            (J) facilitating each program's fulfillment of its 13        statutory and regulatory requirements;14            (K) improving local planning and collaboration; 15        and16            (L) providing comprehensive services for the 17        neediest Illinois children and families.18    Through June 30, 2026, if the appropriate local Head Start 19    agency is unable or unwilling to enter into a memorandum 20    of understanding as required under this paragraph (4.5), 21    the memorandum of understanding requirement shall not 22    apply and the grantee under the program must notify the 23    State Board of Education in writing of the Head Start 24    agency's inability or unwillingness. The State Board of 25    Education shall compile all such written notices and make 26    them available to the public. On and after July 1, 2026, if   10400SB2423sam001- 14 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1    the appropriate local Head Start agency is unable or 2    unwilling to enter into a memorandum of understanding as 3    required under this paragraph (4.5), the memorandum of 4    understanding requirement shall not apply and the grantee 5    under the program must notify the Department of Early 6    Childhood in writing of the Head Start agency's inability 7    or unwillingness. The Department of Early Childhood shall 8    compile all such written notices and make them available 9    to the public. 10        (5) Through June 30, 2026, the State Board of 11    Education shall develop and provide evaluation tools, 12    including tests, that school districts and other eligible 13    entities may use to evaluate children for school readiness 14    prior to age 5. The State Board of Education shall require 15    school districts and other eligible entities to obtain 16    consent from the parents or guardians of children before 17    any evaluations are conducted. The State Board of 18    Education shall encourage local school districts and other 19    eligible entities to evaluate the population of preschool 20    children in their communities and provide preschool 21    programs, pursuant to this subsection, where appropriate.22        (5.1) On and after July 1, 2026, the Department of 23    Early Childhood shall develop and provide evaluation 24    tools, including tests, that school districts and other 25    eligible entities may use to evaluate children for school 26    readiness prior to age 5. The Department of Early   10400SB2423sam001- 15 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1    Childhood shall require school districts and other 2    eligible entities to obtain consent from the parents or 3    guardians of children before any evaluations are 4    conducted. The Department of Early Childhood shall 5    encourage local school districts and other eligible 6    entities to evaluate the population of preschool children 7    in their communities and provide preschool programs, 8    pursuant to this subsection, where appropriate. 9        (6) Through June 30, 2026, the State Board of 10    Education shall report to the General Assembly by November 11    1, 2018 and every 2 years thereafter on the results and 12    progress of students who were enrolled in preschool 13    educational programs, including an assessment of which 14    programs have been most successful in promoting academic 15    excellence and alleviating academic failure. Through June 16    30, 2026, the State Board of Education shall assess the 17    academic progress of all students who have been enrolled 18    in preschool educational programs.19        Through fiscal year 2026, on or before November 1 of 20    each fiscal year in which the General Assembly provides 21    funding for new programs under paragraph (4.5) of this 22    Section, the State Board of Education shall report to the 23    General Assembly on what percentage of new funding was 24    provided to programs serving primarily at-risk children, 25    what percentage of new funding was provided to programs 26    serving primarily children with a family income of less   10400SB2423sam001- 16 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1    than 4 times the federal poverty level, and what 2    percentage of new funding was provided to other programs. 3        (6.1) On and after July 1, 2026, the Department of 4    Early Childhood shall report to the General Assembly by 5    November 1, 2026 and every 2 years thereafter on the 6    results and progress of students who were enrolled in 7    preschool educational programs, including an assessment of 8    which programs have been most successful in promoting 9    academic excellence and alleviating academic failure. On 10    and after July 1, 2026, the Department of Early Childhood 11    shall assess the academic progress of all students who 12    have been enrolled in preschool educational programs. 13    Beginning in fiscal year 2027, on or before November 1 of 14    each fiscal year in which the General Assembly provides 15    funding for new programs under paragraph (4.5) of this 16    Section, the Department of Early Childhood shall report to 17    the General Assembly on what percentage of new funding was 18    provided to programs serving primarily at-risk children, 19    what percentage of new funding was provided to programs 20    serving primarily children with a family income of less 21    than 4 times the federal poverty level, and what 22    percentage of new funding was provided to other programs. 23        (7) Due to evidence that expulsion practices in the 24    preschool years are linked to poor child outcomes and are 25    employed inconsistently across racial and gender groups, 26    early childhood programs receiving State funds under this   10400SB2423sam001- 17 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1    subsection (a) shall prohibit expulsions. Planned 2    transitions to settings that are able to better meet a 3    child's needs are not considered expulsion under this 4    paragraph (7).5            (A) When persistent and serious challenging 6        behaviors emerge, the early childhood program shall 7        document steps taken to ensure that the child can 8        participate safely in the program; including 9        observations of initial and ongoing challenging 10        behaviors, strategies for remediation and intervention 11        plans to address the behaviors, and communication with 12        the parent or legal guardian, including participation 13        of the parent or legal guardian in planning and 14        decision-making.15            (B) The early childhood program shall, with 16        parental or legal guardian consent as required, 17        utilize a range of community resources, if available 18        and deemed necessary, including, but not limited to, 19        developmental screenings, referrals to programs and 20        services administered by a local educational agency or 21        early intervention agency under Parts B and C of the 22        federal Individual with Disabilities Education Act, 23        and consultation with infant and early childhood 24        mental health consultants and the child's health care 25        provider. The program shall document attempts to 26        engage these resources, including parent or legal   10400SB2423sam001- 18 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1        guardian participation and consent attempted and 2        obtained. Communication with the parent or legal 3        guardian shall take place in a culturally and 4        linguistically competent manner.5            (C) If there is documented evidence that all 6        available interventions and supports recommended by a 7        qualified professional have been exhausted and the 8        program determines in its professional judgment that 9        transitioning a child to another program is necessary 10        for the well-being of the child or his or her peers and 11        staff, with parent or legal guardian permission, both 12        the current and pending programs shall create a 13        transition plan designed to ensure continuity of 14        services and the comprehensive development of the 15        child. Communication with families shall occur in a 16        culturally and linguistically competent manner.17            (D) Nothing in this paragraph (7) shall preclude a 18        parent's or legal guardian's right to voluntarily 19        withdraw his or her child from an early childhood 20        program. Early childhood programs shall request and 21        keep on file, when received, a written statement from 22        the parent or legal guardian stating the reason for 23        his or her decision to withdraw his or her child.24            (E) In the case of the determination of a serious 25        safety threat to a child or others or in the case of 26        behaviors listed in subsection (d) of Section 10-22.6   10400SB2423sam001- 19 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1        of this Code, the temporary removal of a child from 2        attendance in group settings may be used. Temporary 3        removal of a child from attendance in a group setting 4        shall trigger the process detailed in subparagraphs 5        (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph (7), with the child 6        placed back in a group setting as quickly as possible.7            (F) Early childhood programs may utilize and the 8        Department of Early Childhood, State Board of 9        Education, the Department of Human Services, and the 10        Department of Children and Family Services shall 11        recommend training, technical support, and 12        professional development resources to improve the 13        ability of teachers, administrators, program 14        directors, and other staff to promote social-emotional 15        development and behavioral health, to address 16        challenging behaviors, and to understand trauma and 17        trauma-informed care, cultural competence, family 18        engagement with diverse populations, the impact of 19        implicit bias on adult behavior, and the use of 20        reflective practice techniques. Support shall include 21        the availability of resources to contract with infant 22        and early childhood mental health consultants.23            (G) Through June 30, 2026, early childhood 24        programs shall annually report to the State Board of 25        Education, and, beginning in fiscal year 2020, the 26        State Board of Education shall make available on a   10400SB2423sam001- 20 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1        biennial basis, in an existing report, all of the 2        following data for children from birth to age 5 who are 3        served by the program:4                (i) Total number served over the course of the 5            program year and the total number of children who 6            left the program during the program year.7                (ii) Number of planned transitions to another 8            program due to children's behavior, by children's 9            race, gender, disability, language, class/group 10            size, teacher-child ratio, and length of program 11            day.12                (iii) Number of temporary removals of a child 13            from attendance in group settings due to a serious 14            safety threat under subparagraph (E) of this 15            paragraph (7), by children's race, gender, 16            disability, language, class/group size, 17            teacher-child ratio, and length of program day.18                (iv) Hours of infant and early childhood 19            mental health consultant contact with program 20            leaders, staff, and families over the program 21            year.22            (G-5) On and after July 1, 2026, early childhood 23        programs shall annually report to the Department of 24        Early Childhood, and beginning in fiscal year 2028, 25        the Department of Early Childhood shall make available 26        on a biennial basis, in a report, all of the following   10400SB2423sam001- 21 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1        data for children from birth to age 5 who are served by 2        the program:3                (i) Total number served over the course of the 4            program year and the total number of children who 5            left the program during the program year.6                (ii) Number of planned transitions to another 7            program due to children's behavior, by children's 8            race, gender, disability, language, class/group 9            size, teacher-child ratio, and length of program 10            day.11                (iii) Number of temporary removals of a child 12            from attendance in group settings due to a serious 13            safety threat under subparagraph (E) of this 14            paragraph (7), by children's race, gender, 15            disability, language, class/group size, 16            teacher-child ratio, and length of program day.17                (iv) Hours of infant and early childhood 18            mental health consultant contact with program 19            leaders, staff, and families over the program 20            year. 21            (H) Changes to services for children with an 22        individualized education program or individual family 23        service plan shall be construed in a manner consistent 24        with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 25        Education Act.26        The Department of Early Childhood, in consultation   10400SB2423sam001- 22 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1    with the Department of Children and Family Services, shall 2    adopt rules to administer this paragraph (7). 3        (8) Due to evidence that suspension practices in the 4    preschool years are linked to poor child outcomes and are 5    employed inconsistently across racial and gender groups, 6    early childhood programs receiving State funds under this 7    subsection (a) shall restrict suspensions. Planned 8    transitions to settings that are able to better meet a 9    child's needs are not considered suspension under this 10    paragraph (8). In no case may the decision to suspend a 11    student in preschool for 3 or more days be made by anyone 12    other than the superintendent of the school district, 13    director of an early childhood program, or their 14    equivalent nor may the length of the suspension for any 15    student in preschool be for longer than the number of days 16    required by the school district or early childhood program 17    to develop and implement a behavior intervention plan or 18    safety plan. 19    (b) (Blank).20    (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, 21grantees may serve children ages 0 to 12 of essential workers 22if the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health 23emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency 24Management Agency Act. For the purposes of this subsection, 25essential workers include those outlined in Executive Order 2620-8 and school employees. The State Board of Education shall   10400SB2423sam001- 23 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1adopt rules to administer this subsection. 2    (d) Paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(1.5), (a)(4.5), (a)(5), 3(a)(5.1), (a)(6), (a)(6.1), and (a)(7) and subsection (c) of 4this Section are inoperative on and after July 1, 2026. 5(Source: P.A. 103-111, eff. 6-29-23; 103-594, eff. 6-25-24.) 6    (105 ILCS 5/2-3.162)7    Sec. 2-3.162. Student discipline report; school discipline 8improvement plan. 9    (a) On or before October 31, 2015 and on or before October 1031 of each subsequent year, the State Board of Education, 11through the State Superintendent of Education, shall prepare a 12report on student discipline in all school districts in this 13State, including State-authorized charter schools. This report 14shall include data from all public schools within school 15districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This 16report must be posted on the Internet website of the State 17Board of Education. The report shall include data on the 18issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and 19removals to alternative settings in lieu of another 20disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, 21gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English 22learner, incident type, and discipline duration. Such data 23shall be reported to the State Board of Education annually by 24all school districts in this State, including State-authorized 25charter schools, in a form and manner as specified by the State   10400SB2423sam001- 24 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1Board of Education, no later than July 31 for the previous 2school year and by July 31 of each year thereafter. 3    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data 4under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and 5determine the top 20% of school districts for the following 6metrics:7        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided 8    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 9    September for the year in which the data was collected, 10    multiplied by 100.11        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided 12    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 13    September for the year in which the data was collected, 14    multiplied by 100.15        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the 16    overrepresentation of students of color or white students 17    in comparison to the total number of students of color or 18    white students on October 1st of the school year in which 19    data are collected, with respect to the use of 20    out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be 21    calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of 22    Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.23    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 24consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school 25year.26    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board   10400SB2423sam001- 25 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1of Education shall require each of the school districts that 2are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described 3in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan 4identifying the strategies the school district will implement 5to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or 6racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School 7districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 8the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 9years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 10    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 11required under federal or State law.12    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 13described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 14districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 15charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10 16out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is 17applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 1820% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 19subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an 20enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 21students of color.22    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 23and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 24one year after being identified, the school district shall 25submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 26district's Internet website a progress report describing the   10400SB2423sam001- 26 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 2(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 3100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 4    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)5    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)6    Sec. 10-22.6. Suspension or expulsion of students; school 7searches. 8    (a) To expel students guilty of gross disobedience or 9misconduct, including gross disobedience or misconduct 10perpetuated by electronic means, pursuant to subsection (b-20) 11of this Section, and no action shall lie against them for such 12expulsion. Expulsion shall take place only after the parents 13have been requested to appear at a meeting of the board, or 14with a hearing officer appointed by it, to discuss their 15child's behavior. Such request shall be made by registered or 16certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 17the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 18at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 19date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 20hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 21shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 22heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 23as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 24the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 25reasons why removing the student from the learning environment   10400SB2423sam001- 27 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 2shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 3the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 4transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 5in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 6denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 7which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 8of students or staff in the alternative program. 9    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 10superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 11principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 12students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 13suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 14the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 15subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 16shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 17policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 18principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 19school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 20to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 21gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 22may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 23reasons. 24    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 25parents or guardian of a student along with a full statement of 26the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right to   10400SB2423sam001- 28 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 2notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 3suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardian, 4the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 5review such action of the superintendent or principal, 6assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 7parents or guardian of the student may appear and discuss the 8suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 9officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 10a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 11its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 12hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 13appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 14subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 15decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 16misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 17suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 18specific duration of the suspension. 19    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 20and consequences available to school officials, school 21exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 22are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 23and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 24extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 25only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 26students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is   10400SB2423sam001- 29 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1recommended that school officials consider forms of 2non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 3suspensions or expulsions. 4    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 5Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 6by which school administrators are required to suspend or 7expel students for particular behaviors.8    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 9used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 10pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 11students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 12subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 13other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 14a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 15School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 16such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 17length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.18    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 19out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 20and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 21only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 22disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 23student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 24a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 25the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 26interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of   10400SB2423sam001- 30 -LRB104 10323 LNS 24020 a1this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 2students, staff, or members of the school community" and 3"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 4operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 5basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 6(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 7available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 8exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 9shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 10address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 11exclusions to the greatest extent practicable.
