The Senior Pharmaceutical Assistance Act is 17amended by changing Section 5 as follows: 18    (320 ILCS 50/5)19    Sec. 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds:20    (1) Senior citizens identify pharmaceutical assistance as 21the single most critical factor to their health, well-being, 22and continued independence.23    (2) The State of Illinois currently operates one 2 24pharmaceutical assistance programs that benefit seniors: (i)   SB1302- 66 -LRB104 07596 KTG 17640 b1the program of pharmaceutical assistance under the Senior 2Citizens and Persons with Disabilities Property Tax Relief Act 3and (ii) the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled program under 4the Illinois Public Aid Code. The State has been given 5authority to establish a third program, SeniorRx Care, through 6a federal Medicaid waiver.7    (3) Each year, numerous pieces of legislation are filed 8seeking to establish additional pharmaceutical assistance 9benefits for seniors or to make changes to the existing 10programs.11    (4) Establishment of a pharmaceutical assistance review 12committee will ensure proper coordination of benefits, 13diminish the likelihood of duplicative benefits, and ensure 14that the best interests of seniors are served.15    (5) In addition to the State pharmaceutical assistance 16programs, several private entities, such as drug manufacturers 17and pharmacies, also offer prescription drug discount or 18coverage programs.19    (6) Many seniors are unaware of the myriad of public and 20private programs available to them.21    (7) Establishing a pharmaceutical clearinghouse with a 22toll-free hot-line and local outreach workers will educate 23seniors about the vast array of options available to them and 24enable seniors to make an educated and informed choice that is 25best for them.26    (8) Estimates indicate that almost one-third of senior   SB1302- 67 -LRB104 07596 KTG 17640 b1citizens lack prescription drug coverage. The federal 2government, states, and the pharmaceutical industry each have 3a role in helping these uninsured seniors gain access to 4life-saving medications.5    (9) The State of Illinois has recognized its obligation to 6assist Illinois' neediest seniors in purchasing prescription 7medications, and it is now time for pharmaceutical 8manufacturers to recognize their obligation to make their 9medications affordable to seniors.10(Source: P.A. 99-143, eff. 7-27-15.) 11    Section 55.

This 5subsection does not, however, prevent a unit from receiving a 6general increase in the amount of aid that is provided to all 7recipients of aid under this Article.8    The Illinois Department is authorized to transfer funds, 9and shall use any budgetary savings attributable to not 10increasing the grants due to the births of additional 11children, to supplement existing funding for employment and 12training services for recipients of aid under this Article IV. 13The Illinois Department shall target, to the extent the 14supplemental funding allows, employment and training services 15to the families who do not receive a grant increase after the 16birth of a child.

All remaining 20supplemental funds shall be used for employment and training 21services or transitional child care support.22    In making the transfers authorized by this subsection, the 23Illinois Department shall first determine, pursuant to 24regulations adopted by the Illinois Department for this 25purpose, the amount of savings attributable to not increasing 26the grants due to the births of additional children. Transfers   SB1302- 55 -LRB104 07596 KTG 17640 b1may be made from General Revenue Fund appropriations for 2distributive purposes authorized by Article IV of this Code 3only to General Revenue Fund appropriations for employability 4development services including operating and administrative 5costs and related distributive purposes under Article IXA of 6this Code. The Director, with the approval of the Governor, 7shall certify the amount and affected line item appropriations 8to the State Comptroller.9    Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit 10the Illinois Department from using funds under this Article IV 11to provide assistance in the form of vouchers that may be used 12to pay for goods and services deemed by the Illinois 13Department, by rule, as suitable for the care of the child such 14as diapers, clothing, school supplies, and cribs.15    (f-5) Subsection (f) shall not apply to affect the monthly 16assistance amount of any family as a result of the birth of a 17child on or after January 1, 2004. As resources permit after 18January 1, 2004, the Department may cease applying subsection 19(f) to limit assistance to families receiving assistance under 20this Article on January 1, 2004, with respect to children born 21prior to that date. In any event, subsection (f) shall be 22completely inoperative on and after July 1, 2007.23    (g) (Blank).24    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the 25Illinois Department is authorized to reduce payment levels 26used to determine cash grants under this Article after   SB1302- 56 -LRB104 07596 KTG 17640 b1December 31 of any fiscal year if the Illinois Department 2determines that the caseload upon which the appropriations for 3the current fiscal year are based have increased by more than 45% and the appropriation is not sufficient to ensure that cash 5benefits under this Article do not exceed the amounts 6appropriated for those cash benefits. Reductions in payment 7levels may be accomplished by emergency rule under Section 85-45 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, except that 9the limitation on the number of emergency rules that may be 10adopted in a 24-month period shall not apply and the 11provisions of Sections 5-115 and 5-125 of the Illinois 12Administrative Procedure Act shall not apply.

The Senior Pharmaceutical Assistance Act is 17amended by changing Section 5 as follows: 18    (320 ILCS 50/5)19    Sec. 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds:20    (1) Senior citizens identify pharmaceutical assistance as 21the single most critical factor to their health, well-being, 22and continued independence.23    (2) The State of Illinois currently operates one 2 24pharmaceutical assistance programs that benefit seniors: (i)   SB1302- 66 -LRB104 07596 KTG 17640 b1the program of pharmaceutical assistance under the Senior 2Citizens and Persons with Disabilities Property Tax Relief Act 3and (ii) the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled program under 4the Illinois Public Aid Code. The State has been given 5authority to establish a third program, SeniorRx Care, through 6a federal Medicaid waiver.7    (3) Each year, numerous pieces of legislation are filed 8seeking to establish additional pharmaceutical assistance 9benefits for seniors or to make changes to the existing 10programs.11    (4) Establishment of a pharmaceutical assistance review 12committee will ensure proper coordination of benefits, 13diminish the likelihood of duplicative benefits, and ensure 14that the best interests of seniors are served.15    (5) In addition to the State pharmaceutical assistance 16programs, several private entities, such as drug manufacturers 17and pharmacies, also offer prescription drug discount or 18coverage programs.19    (6) Many seniors are unaware of the myriad of public and 20private programs available to them.21    (7) Establishing a pharmaceutical clearinghouse with a 22toll-free hot-line and local outreach workers will educate 23seniors about the vast array of options available to them and 24enable seniors to make an educated and informed choice that is 25best for them.26    (8) Estimates indicate that almost one-third of senior   SB1302- 67 -LRB104 07596 KTG 17640 b1citizens lack prescription drug coverage. The federal 2government, states, and the pharmaceutical industry each have 3a role in helping these uninsured seniors gain access to 4life-saving medications.5    (9) The State of Illinois has recognized its obligation to 6assist Illinois' neediest seniors in purchasing prescription 7medications, and it is now time for pharmaceutical 8manufacturers to recognize their obligation to make their 9medications affordable to seniors.10(Source: P.A. 99-143, eff. 7-27-15.) 11    Section 55.
