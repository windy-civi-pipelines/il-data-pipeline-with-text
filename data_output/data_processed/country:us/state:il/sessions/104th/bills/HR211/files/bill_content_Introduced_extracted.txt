Full Text of HR0211 ILGA.GOV HR0211 - 104th General Assembly HR0211LRB104 12755 LAW 23907 r1HOUSE RESOLUTION 2    WHEREAS, The Benin Bronzes are a collection of several 3thousand metal plaques, sculpture heads, jewelry, and other 4objects that adorned the royal palace of the Oba, or king, of 5the Benin Kingdom, in what is now Edo State, Nigeria; they were 6made of brass, leather, wood, and ivory by Edo artists from the 712th to 19th centuries; and 8    WHEREAS, The Benin Bronzes hold profound spiritual, 9historical, and cultural significance to the Edo people; 10however, the 16th to 19th century brass relics hold particular 11cultural and ethnical significance to heirs, also referred to 12as descendants, of enslaved captives because this group of 13relics, referred to as "slave trade Benin Bronzes", were 14created through the melting and refabrication of metal manilla 15currency exchanged for their captive ancestors who were sold 16to European transatlantic slave traders by the Benin Kingdom 17over a 300-year period; and 18    WHEREAS, During the Punitive Expedition of 1897, the slave 19trade Benin Bronzes were taken by British forces to cover the 20cost of a retaliatory war in response to the Benin Kingdom 21committing a massacre against an unarmed party of 12 British 22envoys and 250 African porters, which left only a few 23survivors; and   HR0211- 2 -LRB104 12755 LAW 23907 r1    WHEREAS, The Benin Bronzes are currently held in various 2museums and private collections around the world, including 3one-quarter of the known relics being located in the United 4States, with the third largest collection in the world, 5consisting of 393 pieces, being held at the Field Museum in 6Chicago; while most of the slave trade Benin Bronzes are blood 7metal bronzes, their slave trade origins are not shared and 8remain largely unknown to the world; and 9    WHEREAS, Benin Kingdom heirs have been engaged in a 10repatriation effort of the Benin Bronzes since 1933, calling 11for the return of the slave trade Benin Bronzes for moral 12reasons; however, heirs of enslaved Africans have required 13modern technology to trace their DNA to Benin Kingdom captives 14and officially joined the effort in 2022, demanding the 15following:16        (1) The slave trade Benin Bronzes be shared with them 17    as they have the highest moral grounds for ownership, 18    considering their ancestors were sold for the metal needed 19    to make the bronzes;20        (2) The slave trade Benin Bronzes remain in trust at 21    institutions in the West and the Americas, where the 22    institutions can have access to them for aesthetic, 23    academic, and cultural education; and24        (3) They share in all the benefits of co-ownership;   HR0211- 3 -LRB104 12755 LAW 23907 r1    and 2    WHEREAS, DNA research verifies that 93% of African 3Americans have Nigerian DNA from ancestors sold into the 4transatlantic slave trade from the region now called Nigeria, 5while 82% of Caribbean people have it, as do descendants of 6captives sold to Portuguese slave traders by the Benin Kingdom 7and transported to Brazil from the 1500s until the prohibition 8of the slave trade in 1888; and 9    WHEREAS, Neither the Benin Kingdom nor Nigeria has ever 10apologized for the Benin Kingdom's stealing of people and 11selling them for the manillas used to make the Benin Bronzes; 12however, heirs of enslaved Africans still suffer from the 13vestiges of slavery such as racial violence, discrimination, 14and wealth gaps, and they have never been offered 15dual-citizenship or been invited to repatriate back home to 16Nigeria; and 17    WHEREAS, The Benin Kingdom and Nigeria have been 18unresponsive to demands by descendants of their captives to 19share the slave trade bronzes, while Edo State, the home of the 20ancient Benin Kingdom, still bears a lasting legacy of the 21historic crime against humanity exemplified by media reports 22of organ harvesting and human trafficking of Edo girls for sex 23slavery in Europe and the Middle East; and   HR0211- 4 -LRB104 12755 LAW 23907 r1    WHEREAS, Rewarding the heirs of slave traders with 2repatriation of their ancestors' ill-gotten gains, the slave 3trade Benin Bronzes, sends a misguided message to modern Edo 4State human traffickers and fails to address the historical 5injustices associated with the relics; and 6    WHEREAS, The Benin Bronzes must be shared between the 7heirs of the enslaved captives who paid for the relics with 8their lives, and the heirs of the Benin Kingdom slave traders 9must acknowledge the shared cultural history and Benin 10Kingdom's responsibility; and 11    WHEREAS, Efforts should be taken to bring these heirs 12together for healing and to ensure that they collectively 13benefit from the ownership and preservation of the Benin 14Bronzes; therefore, be it 15    RESOLVED, BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE 16HUNDRED FOURTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, that 17we acknowledge and condemn the historical injustice associated 18with the original creation of the Benin Bronzes, the 19subsequent British acquisition and distribution of the relics, 20and the current possession of the Benin Bronzes by museums and 21collectors who are unwilling to share the relics with the 22heirs of the enslaved people who paid for them with their lives   HR0211- 5 -LRB104 12755 LAW 23907 r1and the heirs of the Benin Kingdom slave traders, emphasizing 2the need for redress and equitable sharing and repatriation; 3and be it further 4    RESOLVED, That we urge the following steps be taken in 5regard to the Benin Bronzes:6        (1) That all museums and private collectors who 7    possess slave trade Benin Bronzes enter into discussions 8    and negotiations with the descendants of the enslaved and 9    the heirs of the Benin Kingdom for the sharing and 10    repatriation process, with particular concern paid to the 11    Field Museum and all other stakeholder museums located in 12    the United States;13        (2) That a Repatriation Committee shall be 14    established, comprising of representatives from the 15    Restitution Study Group and other relevant advocates on 16    behalf of descendants of the enslaved captives, the heirs 17    of the Benin Kingdom, relevant academia, cultural 18    associations, and international experts, and the Committee 19    shall facilitate negotiations, oversee repatriation of 20    select relics, and ensure equitable sharing and ownership;21        (3) That the Repatriation Committee shall work with 22    museums and collectors to create an inventory and 23    comprehensive documentation of the slave trade Benin 24    Bronzes and all other Benin Bronzes, ensuring their 25    accurate identification and classification;  HR0211- 6 -LRB104 12755 LAW 23907 r1        (4) That the Repatriation Committee shall develop a 2    transparent and inclusive decision-making process which 3    includes the voices and perspectives of the descendants of 4    the transatlantic enslaved Benin Kingdom captives and the 5    heirs of the Benin Kingdom, ensuring their equal 6    participation in determining the future of the Benin 7    Bronzes;8        (5) That the Repatriation Committee shall develop a 9    framework for sharing the Benin Bronzes, considering 10    factors such as display language in museums and cultural 11    institutions both in the Benin Kingdom and 12    internationally, touring exhibitions, educational 13    programs, and initiatives that promote cultural 14    understanding and healing;15        (6) That resale royalties shall be collected from 16    private sale of Benin Bronzes anywhere in the world based 17    on agreements with auction houses or laws passed in 18    legislative bodies, and these royalties shall be paid into 19    a trust shared by descendants of Benin Kingdom captives 20    sold into transatlantic enslavement and Benin Kingdom 21    heirs and used for the management of relics and other 22    matters to be determined by the two groups of heirs;23        (7) That adequate resources shall be allocated from 24    museum exhibit, loan, and resale royalty fees to ensure 25    the sustainable preservation and conservation of the Benin 26    Bronzes, safeguarding their historical and cultural value   HR0211- 7 -LRB104 12755 LAW 23907 r1    for future generations;2        (8) That the Repatriation Committee shall initiate 3    programs and initiatives aimed at bringing the heirs of 4    the enslaved and the heirs of the Benin Kingdom together 5    for healing and reconciliation, with efforts being made to 6    support the economic, educational, and cultural 7    development of the heirs, ensuring they share in the 8    benefits of ownership of the Benin Bronzes through a trust 9    created with exhibit, loan, and resale royalty fees;
