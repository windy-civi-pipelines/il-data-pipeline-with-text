Short title. This Act may be cited as the Campus 5Free Speech Act. 6    Section 5. Legislative findings. The General Assembly 7finds the following:8        (1) Section 4 of Article I of the Illinois 9    Constitution recognizes that "all persons may speak, write 10    and publish freely, being responsible for the abuse of 11    that liberty. In trials for libel, both civil and 12    criminal, the truth, when published with good motives and 13    for justifiable ends, shall be a sufficient defense".14        (2) Public institutions of higher education have 15    historically embraced a commitment to freedom of 16    expression in policy.17        (3) In recent years, some public institutions of 18    higher education have abdicated their responsibility to 19    uphold free-speech principles, and these failures make it 20    appropriate for all public institutions of higher 21    education to restate and confirm their commitment in this 22    regard.23        (4) In 1974, the Committee on Free Expression at Yale   SB1865- 2 -LRB104 08881 LNS 18936 b1    University issued a statement known as the Woodward Report 2    that stands as a classic defense of free expression on 3    campuses; in 2015, the Committee on Freedom of Expression 4    at the University of Chicago issued a similar and widely 5    respected report; and in 1967, the Kalven Committee Report 6    of the University of Chicago articulated the principle of 7    institutional neutrality regarding political and social 8    issues and the essential role of such neutrality in 9    protecting freedom of thought and expression at 10    universities. The principles affirmed by these 3 highly 11    regarded reports are inspiring articulations of the 12    critical importance of free expression in higher 13    education.14        (5) The General Assembly views freedom of expression 15    as being of critical importance and requires that each 16    public institution of higher education ensure free, 17    robust, and uninhibited debate and deliberation by 18    students of public institutions whether on or off campus.19        (6) The General Assembly has determined that it is a 20    matter of statewide concern that all public institutions 21    of higher education officially recognize freedom of speech 22    as a fundamental right. 23    Section 10. Definition. In this Act, "public institution" 24means a public university or public community college in this 25State.   SB1865- 3 -LRB104 08881 LNS 18936 b1    Section 15. Policy on free expression required. The board 2of trustees of a public institution shall develop and adopt a 3policy on free expression that contains, at least, the 4following:5        (1) A statement that the primary function of an 6    institution of higher education is the discovery, 7    improvement, transmission, and dissemination of knowledge 8    by means of research, teaching, discussion, and debate. 9    This statement shall provide that, to fulfill this 10    function, the institution must strive to ensure the 11    fullest degree of intellectual freedom and free 12    expression.13        (2) A statement that it is not the proper role of the 14    institution to shield individuals from speech protected by 15    the First Amendment, including, without limitation, ideas 16    and opinions they find unwelcome, disagreeable, or even 17    deeply offensive.18        (3) A statement that students and faculty have the 19    freedom to discuss any problem that presents itself, as 20    the First Amendment permits and within the limits of 21    reasonable viewpoint and content-neutral restrictions on 22    time, place, and manner of expression that are consistent 23    with this Act and that are necessary to achieve a 24    significant institutional interest; provided that these 25    restrictions are clear, are published, and provide ample   SB1865- 4 -LRB104 08881 LNS 18936 b1    alternative means of expression. Students and faculty 2    shall be permitted to assemble and engage in spontaneous 3    expressive activity as long as the activity is not 4    unlawful and does not materially and substantially disrupt 5    the functioning of the institution, subject to the 6    requirements of this Act.7        (4) A statement that the campuses of the institution 8    are open to speakers invited by students, student groups, 9    or members of the faculty without regard to viewpoint or 10    content of the proposed speech. If a fee applies to a 11    speech by an invited speaker, the inviting students, 12    student groups, or members of the faculty may not be 13    charged greater or lesser amounts based on the viewpoint, 14    content, or expected reaction to the speech.15        (5) A statement that the outdoor public areas of 16    campuses of the institution are designated public forums, 17    open on the same terms to any speaker, and that any person 18    lawfully present on campus may leaflet, protest, or 19    demonstrate in those outdoor public areas.20        (6) A provision setting forth the affirmative steps 21    that the institution will take to protect the free-speech 22    rights of invited speakers.23        (7) A provision that, in all disciplinary cases 24    involving expressive conduct, students are entitled to a 25    disciplinary hearing under published procedures.

The institution shall remove or revise 14    any such provisions in its policies and regulations to 15    ensure compatibility with this policy on free expression. 16    Section 20.
