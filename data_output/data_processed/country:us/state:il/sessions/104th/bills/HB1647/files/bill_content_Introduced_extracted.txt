Provisions of the 21Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 22adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 23initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall   HB1647- 2 -LRB104 08523 RTM 18575 b1continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 2Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 3and any other law, this Section shall control.4    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 5administer its fire department process for original 6appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 7Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 8Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 9concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 10functions exercised by the State.11    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 12consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 13fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 14Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 15Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree. 16    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 17(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 18than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 19    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 20to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 21eligibles established in accordance with the processes 22established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 23the performance standards required by this Section shall be 24placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 25an affected fire department.26    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire   HB1647- 3 -LRB104 08523 RTM 18575 b1a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 2firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 3position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 4death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 5any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 6that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 7eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 8conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 9minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 10authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 11the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 12the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 13either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 14register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 15highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 16of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 17eligibles is less than 5 people.18    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 19losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 20candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 21by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 22not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 23future examinations, including an examination held during the 24time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 25eligibles.26    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment   HB1647- 4 -LRB104 08523 RTM 18575 b1shall be vested in the Civil Service Commission. All 2certificates of appointment issued to any officer or member of 3an affected department shall be signed by the chairperson and 4secretary, respectively, of the commission upon appointment of 5such officer or member to the affected department by the 6commission.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 20Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 21extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 22employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 23sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 24hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 25licensure.26    In the event that any applicant who has been found   HB1647- 8 -LRB104 08523 RTM 18575 b1eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 2the final eligibility register provided for in this Division 1 3has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 4year after the date of his or her physical ability 5examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 6be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 7her appointment.

The minimum score 19set by the commission shall be supported by appropriate 20validation evidence and shall comply with all applicable State 21and federal laws. The appointing authority may conduct the 22physical ability component and any subjective components 23subsequent to the posting of the preliminary eligibility 24register.25    The examination components for an initial eligibility 26register shall be graded on a 100-point scale.

This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 14Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 15concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 16functions exercised by the State.17    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 18consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 19fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 20Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 21Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree.22    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 23(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 24than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 25    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 26to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of   HB1647- 34 -LRB104 08523 RTM 18575 b1eligibles established in accordance with the processes 2established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 3the performance standards required by this Section shall be 4placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 5an affected fire department.6    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire 7a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 8firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 9position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 10death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 11any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 12that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 13eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 14conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 15minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 16authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 17the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 18the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 19either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 20register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 21highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 22of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 23eligibles is less than 5 people.24    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 25losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 26candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list   HB1647- 35 -LRB104 08523 RTM 18575 b1by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 2not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 3future examinations, including an examination held during the 4time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 5eligibles.6    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment 7shall be vested in the board of fire and police commissioners. 8All certificates of appointment issued to any officer or 9member of an affected department shall be signed by the 10chairperson and secretary, respectively, of the board upon 11appointment of such officer or member to the affected 12department by action of the board.

Provisions of the 21Illinois Municipal Code, municipal ordinances, and rules 22adopted pursuant to such authority and other laws relating to 23initial hiring of firefighters in affected departments shall   HB1647- 2 -LRB104 08523 RTM 18575 b1continue to apply to the extent they are compatible with this 2Section, but in the event of a conflict between this Section 3and any other law, this Section shall control.4    A home rule or non-home rule municipality may not 5administer its fire department process for original 6appointments in a manner that is less stringent than this 7Section. This Section is a limitation under subsection (i) of 8Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the 9concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 10functions exercised by the State.11    A municipality that is operating under a court order or 12consent decree regarding original appointments to a full-time 13fire department before August 4, 2011 (the effective date of 14Public Act 97-251) is exempt from the requirements of this 15Section for the duration of the court order or consent decree. 16    Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection 17(a), this Section does not apply to a municipality with more 18than 1,000,000 inhabitants. 19    (b) Original appointments. All original appointments made 20to an affected fire department shall be made from a register of 21eligibles established in accordance with the processes 22established by this Section. Only persons who meet or exceed 23the performance standards required by this Section shall be 24placed on a register of eligibles for original appointment to 25an affected fire department.26    Whenever an appointing authority authorizes action to hire   HB1647- 3 -LRB104 08523 RTM 18575 b1a person to perform the duties of a firefighter or to hire a 2firefighter-paramedic to fill a position that is a new 3position or vacancy due to resignation, discharge, promotion, 4death, the granting of a disability or retirement pension, or 5any other cause, the appointing authority shall appoint to 6that position the person with the highest ranking on the final 7eligibility list. If the appointing authority has reason to 8conclude that the highest ranked person fails to meet the 9minimum standards for the position or if the appointing 10authority believes an alternate candidate would better serve 11the needs of the department, then the appointing authority has 12the right to pass over the highest ranked person and appoint 13either: (i) any person who has a ranking in the top 5% of the 14register of eligibles or (ii) any person who is among the top 5 15highest ranked persons on the list of eligibles if the number 16of people who have a ranking in the top 5% of the register of 17eligibles is less than 5 people.18    Any candidate may pass on an appointment once without 19losing his or her position on the register of eligibles. Any 20candidate who passes a second time may be removed from the list 21by the appointing authority provided that such action shall 22not prejudice a person's opportunities to participate in 23future examinations, including an examination held during the 24time a candidate is already on the municipality's register of 25eligibles.26    The sole authority to issue certificates of appointment   HB1647- 4 -LRB104 08523 RTM 18575 b1shall be vested in the Civil Service Commission. All 2certificates of appointment issued to any officer or member of 3an affected department shall be signed by the chairperson and 4secretary, respectively, of the commission upon appointment of 5such officer or member to the affected department by the 6commission.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 20Section, the probationary employment period limitation may be 21extended for a firefighter who is required, as a condition of 22employment, to be a licensed paramedic, during which time the 23sole reason that a firefighter may be discharged without a 24hearing is for failing to meet the requirements for paramedic 25licensure.26    In the event that any applicant who has been found   HB1647- 8 -LRB104 08523 RTM 18575 b1eligible for appointment and whose name has been placed upon 2the final eligibility register provided for in this Division 1 3has not been appointed to a firefighter position within one 4year after the date of his or her physical ability 5examination, the commission may cause a second examination to 6be made of that applicant's physical ability prior to his or 7her appointment.

Appointing 11authorities may create a preliminary eligibility register.

Minimum scores should be set by 17the commission so as to demonstrate a candidate's ability to 18perform the essential functions of the job. The minimum score 19set by the commission shall be supported by appropriate 20validation evidence and shall comply with all applicable State 21and federal laws. The appointing authority may conduct the 22physical ability component and any subjective components 23subsequent to the posting of the preliminary eligibility 24register.25    The examination components for an initial eligibility 26register shall be graded on a 100-point scale.

The local appointing authority may prescribe the 11score to qualify for placement on the final eligibility 12register, but the score shall not be less than the minimum 13score set by the commission.14    The commission shall prepare and keep a register of 15persons whose total score is not less than the minimum score 16for passage and who have passed the physical ability 17examination. These persons shall take rank upon the register 18as candidates in the order of their relative excellence based 19on the highest to the lowest total points scored on the mental 20aptitude, subjective component, and preference components of 21the test administered in accordance with this Section. No more 22than 60 days after each examination, an initial eligibility 23list shall be posted by the commission.
