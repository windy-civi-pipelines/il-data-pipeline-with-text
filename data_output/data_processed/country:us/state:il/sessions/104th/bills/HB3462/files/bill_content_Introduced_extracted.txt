In provisions concerning applicants with criminal convictions, requires the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation to consider various factors when considering whether a prior conviction is directly related to the ability of an applicant to safely perform the duties, functions, and responsibilities of the position (instead of whether a prior conviction will impair the ability of the applicant to engage in the practice).

Prohibits the Department from using a vague term in its consideration of a criminal record and decision regarding whether a criminal record is disqualifying for licensure, certification, or registration, including, but not limited to, "good moral character", "moral turpitude", or "character and fitness". Makes other changes. Amends the Barber, Cosmetology, Esthetics, Hair Braiding, and Nail Technology Act of 1985.
