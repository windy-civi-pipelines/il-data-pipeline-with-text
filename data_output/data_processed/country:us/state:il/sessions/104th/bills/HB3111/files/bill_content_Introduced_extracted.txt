Subject to the 9limitation of the preceding sentence, placement in special 10classes, separate schools or other removal of the child with a 11disability from the regular educational environment shall 12occur only when the nature of the severity of the disability is 13such that education in the regular classes with the use of 14supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved 15satisfactorily. The placement of English learners with 16disabilities shall be in non-restrictive environments which 17provide for integration with peers who do not have 18disabilities in bilingual classrooms. Annually, each January, 19school districts shall report data on students from 20non-English speaking backgrounds receiving special education 21and related services in public and private facilities as 22prescribed in Section 2-3.30.

All testing and evaluation materials and 8procedures utilized for evaluation and placement shall not be 9linguistically, racially or culturally discriminatory.10    (f) Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require 11any child to undergo any physical examination or medical 12treatment whose parents object thereto on the grounds that 13such examination or treatment conflicts with his religious 14beliefs.15    (g) School boards or their designee shall provide to the 16parents of a child or, if applicable, the Department of 17Children and Family Services' Office of Education and 18Transition Services prior written notice of any decision (a) 19proposing to initiate or change, or (b) refusing to initiate 20or change, the identification, evaluation, or educational 21placement of the child or the provision of a free appropriate 22public education to their child, and the reasons therefor. For 23a parent, such written notification shall also inform the 24parent of the opportunity to present complaints with respect 25to any matter relating to the educational placement of the 26student, or the provision of a free appropriate public   HB3111- 12 -LRB104 08414 LNS 18465 b1education and to have an impartial due process hearing on the 2complaint.

The placement of English learners with 16disabilities shall be in non-restrictive environments which 17provide for integration with peers who do not have 18disabilities in bilingual classrooms. Annually, each January, 19school districts shall report data on students from 20non-English speaking backgrounds receiving special education 21and related services in public and private facilities as 22prescribed in Section 2-3.30.
