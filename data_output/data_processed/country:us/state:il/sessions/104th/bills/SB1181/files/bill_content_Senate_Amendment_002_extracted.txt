The Citizen Participation Act is amended by 5changing Sections 5 and 15 and by adding Sections 17 and 32 as 6follows: 7    (735 ILCS 110/5)8    Sec. 5. Public policy. Pursuant to the fundamental 9philosophy of the American constitutional form of government, 10it is declared to be the public policy of the State of Illinois 11that the constitutional rights of citizens and organizations 12to be involved and participate freely in the process of 13government must be encouraged and safeguarded with great 14diligence. The information, reports, opinions, claims, 15arguments, and other expressions provided by citizens are 16vital to effective law enforcement, the operation of   10400SB1181sam002- 2 -LRB104 05566 JRC 23885 a1government, the making of public policy and decisions, and the 2continuation of representative democracy. The laws, courts, 3and other agencies of this State must provide the utmost 4protection for freedom of the press and the free exercise of 5these rights of petition, speech, association, and government 6participation.7    Civil actions for money damages have been filed against 8citizens and organizations of this State as a result of their 9valid exercise of their constitutional rights to petition, 10speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise participate in 11and communicate with government.

There has been a 14disturbing increase in lawsuits termed "Strategic Lawsuits 15Against Public Participation" in government or "SLAPPs" as 16they are popularly called. 17    The threat of SLAPPs significantly chills and diminishes 18citizen participation in government, voluntary public service, 19and the exercise of these important constitutional rights. 20This abuse of the judicial process can and has been used as a 21means of intimidating, harassing, or punishing citizens and 22organizations, including the press, for involving themselves 23in public affairs. 24    It is in the public interest and it is the purpose of this 25Act to strike a balance between the rights of persons to file 26lawsuits for injury and the constitutional rights of persons   10400SB1181sam002- 3 -LRB104 05566 JRC 23885 a1to petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise 2participate in government; to protect and encourage public 3participation in government to the maximum extent permitted by 4law; to establish an efficient process for identification and 5adjudication of SLAPPs; and to provide for attorney's fees and 6costs to prevailing movants. As such, this Act should be 7construed broadly in striking the balance of rights described 8in this Act. 9(Source: P.A. 95-506, eff. 8-28-07.) 10    (735 ILCS 110/15)11    Sec. 15. Applicability. This Act applies to any motion to 12dispose of a claim in a judicial proceeding on the grounds that 13the claim is based on, relates to, or is in response to any act 14or acts of the moving party in furtherance of the moving 15party's rights of petition, speech, association, or to 16otherwise participate in government. The claim does not need 17to solely pertain to the moving party's constitutional rights 18as this Act applies regardless of the motives of the person who 19brought the claim that the moving party is seeking to dispose 20of. 21    Acts in furtherance of the constitutional rights to 22petition, speech, association, and participation in government 23are immune from liability, regardless of intent or purpose, 24except when not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable 25government action, result, or outcome.   10400SB1181sam002- 4 -LRB104 05566 JRC 23885 a1(Source: P.A. 95-506, eff. 8-28-07.) 2    (735 ILCS 110/17 new)3    Sec. 17.
