Amend Senate Bill 1181 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 5. The Citizen Participation Act is amended by 5changing Sections 5 and 15 and by adding Section 17 as follows: 6    (735 ILCS 110/5)7    Sec. 5. Public policy. Pursuant to the fundamental 8philosophy of the American constitutional form of government, 9it is declared to be the public policy of the State of Illinois 10that the constitutional rights of citizens and organizations 11to be involved and participate freely in the process of 12government must be encouraged and safeguarded with great 13diligence. The information, reports, opinions, claims, 14arguments, and other expressions provided by citizens are 15vital to effective law enforcement, the operation of 16government, the making of public policy and decisions, and the   10400SB1181sam001- 2 -LRB104 05566 JRC 23569 a1continuation of representative democracy. The laws, courts, 2and other agencies of this State must provide the utmost 3protection for the free exercise of these rights of petition, 4speech, association, and government participation, including 5freedom of the press. 6    Civil actions for money damages have been filed against 7citizens and organizations of this State as a result of their 8valid exercise of their constitutional rights to petition, 9speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise participate in 10and communicate with government. The press opining, reporting, 11or investigating matters of public concern is participating 12and communicating with the government. There has been a 13disturbing increase in lawsuits termed "Strategic Lawsuits 14Against Public Participation" in government or "SLAPPs" as 15they are popularly called. 16    The threat of SLAPPs significantly chills and diminishes 17citizen participation in government, voluntary public service, 18and the exercise of these important constitutional rights. 19This abuse of the judicial process can and has been used as a 20means of intimidating, harassing, or punishing citizens and 21organizations, including the press, for involving themselves 22in public affairs. 23    It is in the public interest and it is the purpose of this 24Act to strike a balance between the rights of persons to file 25lawsuits for injury and the constitutional rights of persons 26to petition, speak freely, associate freely, and otherwise   10400SB1181sam001- 3 -LRB104 05566 JRC 23569 a1participate in government; to protect and encourage public 2participation in government to the maximum extent permitted by 3law; to establish an efficient process for identification and 4adjudication of SLAPPs; and to provide for attorney's fees and 5costs to prevailing movants. As such, this Act should be 6construed broadly in striking the balance of rights described 7in this Act. 8(Source: P.A. 95-506, eff. 8-28-07.) 9    (735 ILCS 110/15)10    Sec. 15. Applicability. This Act applies to any motion to 11dispose of a claim in a judicial proceeding on the grounds that 12the claim is based on, relates to, or is in response to any act 13or acts of the moving party in furtherance of the moving 14party's rights of petition, speech, association, or to 15otherwise participate in government. The claim does not need 16to solely pertain to the moving party's constitutional rights 17as this Act applies regardless of the motives of the person who 18brought the claim that the moving party is seeking to dispose 19of. 20    Acts in furtherance of the constitutional rights to 21petition, speech, association, and participation in government 22are immune from liability, regardless of intent or purpose, 23except when not genuinely aimed at procuring favorable 24government action, result, or outcome. 25(Source: P.A. 95-506, eff. 8-28-07.)   10400SB1181sam001- 4 -LRB104 05566 JRC 23569 a1    (735 ILCS 110/17 new)2    Sec. 17.
