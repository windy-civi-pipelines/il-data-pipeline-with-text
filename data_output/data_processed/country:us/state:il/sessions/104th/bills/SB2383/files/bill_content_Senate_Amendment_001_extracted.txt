Summary suspension of a license. The 5Comptroller may summarily suspend a license of a licensed 6natural organic reduction facility without a hearing, 7simultaneously with the institution of proceedings for a 8hearing provided for in this Act, if the Comptroller finds 9that evidence in the Comptroller's possession indicates that 10the licensee's continued practice would constitute an imminent 11danger to the public. If the Comptroller summarily suspends 12the license of a licensed natural organic reduction facility 13without a hearing, a hearing must be commenced within 30 days 14after the suspension has occurred and concluded as 15expeditiously as practical. In the event of a summary 16suspension, the county coroner or medical examiner responsible 17for the area where the natural organic reduction facility is 18located shall make arrangements to dispose of any bodies in 19the suspended licensee's possession after consulting with the 20authorizing agents for those bodies. 21    Section 999.

Any notice of 22hearing, complaint, all other documents in the nature of 23pleadings, written motions filed in the proceedings, the   10400SB2383sam001- 50 -LRB104 06219 AAS 23491 a1transcripts of testimony, the report of the hearing officer, 2and orders of the Comptroller shall be in the record of the 3proceeding. The Comptroller shall furnish a transcript of such 4record to any person interested in such hearing upon payment 5of a reasonable fee. 6    Section 145. Subpoenas; depositions; oaths. The 7Comptroller has the power to subpoena documents, books, 8records, or other materials and to bring before it any person 9and to take testimony either orally or by deposition, or both, 10with the same fees and mileage and in the same manner as 11prescribed in civil cases in the courts of this State. The 12Comptroller, the designated hearing officer, or any qualified 13person the Comptroller may designate has the power to 14administer oaths to witnesses at any hearing that the 15Comptroller is authorized to conduct, and any other oaths 16authorized in any Act administered by the Comptroller.

Findings and recommendations. At the 2conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall present 3to the Comptroller a written report of its findings of fact, 4conclusions of law, and recommendations. The report shall 5contain a finding whether or not the accused person violated 6this Act or its rules or failed to comply with the conditions 7required in this Act or its rules. The hearing officer shall 8specify the nature of any violations or failure to comply and 9shall make recommendations to the Comptroller. In making 10recommendations for any disciplinary actions, the hearing 11officer may take into consideration all facts and 12circumstances bearing upon the reasonableness of the conduct 13of the accused and the potential for future harm to the public, 14including, but not limited to, previous discipline of the 15accused by the Comptroller, intent, degree of harm to the 16public and likelihood of harm in the future, any restitution 17made by the accused, and whether the incident or incidents 18contained in the complaint appear to be isolated or represent 19a continuing pattern of conduct. In making its recommendations 20for discipline, the hearing officer shall endeavor to ensure 21that the severity of the discipline recommended is reasonably 22related to the severity of the violation. The report of 23findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendation of 24the hearing officer shall be the basis for the Comptroller's 25order refusing to issue, restore, place on probation, fine, 26suspend, revoke a license, or otherwise discipline a licensee.   10400SB2383sam001- 52 -LRB104 06219 AAS 23491 a1If the Comptroller disagrees with the recommendations of the 2hearing officer, the Comptroller may issue an order in 3contravention of the hearing officer's recommendations. The 4finding is not admissible in evidence against the person in a 5criminal prosecution brought for a violation of this Act, but 6the hearing and finding are not a bar to a criminal prosecution 7brought for a violation of this Act. 8    Section 155. Rehearing. At the conclusion of the hearing, 9a copy of the hearing officer's report shall be served upon the 10applicant or licensee by the Comptroller, either personally or 11as provided in this Act. Within 20 days after service, the 12applicant or licensee may present to the Comptroller a motion 13in writing for a rehearing, which shall specify the particular 14grounds for rehearing. The Comptroller may respond to the 15motion for rehearing within 20 days after its service on the 16Comptroller. If no motion for rehearing is filed, then upon 17the expiration of the time specified for filing such a motion, 18or if a motion for rehearing is denied, then upon denial, the 19Comptroller may enter an order in accordance with 20recommendations of the hearing officer except as provided in 21Section 160 of this Act. 22    If the applicant or licensee orders from the reporting 23service and pays for a transcript of the record within the time 24for filing a motion for rehearing, the 20-day period within 25which a motion may be filed shall commence upon the delivery of   10400SB2383sam001- 53 -LRB104 06219 AAS 23491 a1the transcript to the applicant or licensee.  2    Section 160. Comptroller. Whenever the Comptroller 3believes that substantial justice has not been done in the 4revocation, suspension, or refusal to issue or restore a 5license or other discipline of an applicant or licensee, he or 6she may order a rehearing by the same or other hearing 7officers. 8    Section 165. Order or certified copy; prima facie proof. 9An order or certified copy thereof, over the seal of the 10Comptroller and purporting to be signed by the Comptroller, is 11prima facie proof that: 12        (1) the signature is the genuine signature of the 13    Comptroller; 14        (2) the Comptroller is duly appointed and qualified; 15    and 16        (3) the hearing officer is qualified to act.  17    Section 170. Civil action and civil penalties. In addition 18to the other penalties and remedies provided in this Act, the 19Comptroller may bring a civil action in the county of 20residence of the licensee or any other person to enjoin any 21violation or threatened violation of this Act. In addition to 22any other penalty provided by law, any person who violates 23this Act shall forfeit and pay a civil penalty to the   10400SB2383sam001- 54 -LRB104 06219 AAS 23491 a1Comptroller in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for each 2violation as determined by the Comptroller. The civil penalty 3shall be assessed by the Comptroller in accordance with the 4provisions of this Act. 5    Any civil penalty shall be paid within 60 days after the 6effective date of the order imposing the civil penalty. The 7order shall constitute a judgment and may be filed and 8execution had thereon in the same manner as any judgment from 9any court of record. All moneys collected under this Section 10shall be deposited with the Comptroller.  11    Section 175. Consent order. At any point in any 12investigation or disciplinary proceedings as provided in this 13Act, both parties may agree to a negotiated consent order. The 14consent order shall be final upon signature of the 15Comptroller. 16    Section 180. Illinois Administrative Procedure Act; 17application. The Illinois Administrative Procedure Act is 18expressly adopted and incorporated in this Act as if all of the 19provisions of that Act were included in this Act, except that 20the provision of paragraph (d) of Section 10-65 of the 21Illinois Administrative Procedure Act, which provides that at 22hearings the licensee has the right to show compliance with 23all lawful requirements for retention or continuation of the 24license, is specifically excluded. For the purpose of this   10400SB2383sam001- 55 -LRB104 06219 AAS 23491 a1Act, the notice required under Section 10-25 of the Illinois 2Administrative Procedure Act is considered sufficient when 3mailed to the address of record. 4    Section 185. Summary suspension of a license. The 5Comptroller may summarily suspend a license of a licensed 6natural organic reduction facility without a hearing, 7simultaneously with the institution of proceedings for a 8hearing provided for in this Act, if the Comptroller finds 9that evidence in the Comptroller's possession indicates that 10the licensee's continued practice would constitute an imminent 11danger to the public. If the Comptroller summarily suspends 12the license of a licensed natural organic reduction facility 13without a hearing, a hearing must be commenced within 30 days 14after the suspension has occurred and concluded as 15expeditiously as practical. In the event of a summary 16suspension, the county coroner or medical examiner responsible 17for the area where the natural organic reduction facility is 18located shall make arrangements to dispose of any bodies in 19the suspended licensee's possession after consulting with the 20authorizing agents for those bodies. 21    Section 999. Effective date. This Act takes effect June 1, 222026.".
