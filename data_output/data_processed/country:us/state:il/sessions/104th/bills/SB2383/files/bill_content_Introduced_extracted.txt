Natural organic reduction procedures. 14    (a) Human remains shall not be reduced within 24 hours 15after the time of death, as indicated on the Medical 16Examiner's or Coroner's Certificate of Death. In any death, 17the human remains shall not be reduced by the disposition 18authority until a natural organic reduction permit has been 19received from the coroner or medical examiner of the county in 20which the death occurred and the disposition authority has 21received a natural organic reduction authorization form, 22executed by an authorizing agent, in accordance with the 23provisions of Section 60 of this Act. In no instance, however, 24shall the lapse of time between the death and the natural 25organic reduction be less than 24 hours, unless because of a   SB2383- 27 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b1religious requirement. 2    (b) Except as set forth in subsection (a), a disposition 3authority shall have the right to schedule the natural organic 4reduction to be performed at its own convenience, at any time 5after the human remains have been delivered to the disposition 6authority, unless the disposition authority has received 7specific instructions to the contrary on the natural organic 8reduction authorization form. 9    (c) No disposition authority shall reduce human remains 10when it has actual knowledge that human remains contain 11material or implant that may be potentially hazardous to the 12person performing the natural organic reduction. 13    (d) No disposition authority shall accept embalmed remains 14or remains that were treated with nuclear medicine for natural 15organic reduction. No disposition authority should reduce 16human remains if the human remains are confirmed to have or 17suspected of having one or more of the following conditions:18        (1) a prion disease infection, mycobacterium 19    tuberculosis infection, or Ebola virus disease infection; 20        (2) a contagious disease infection which may be a 21    public health hazard as identified by the Illinois 22    Department of Health, local health officer, or medical 23    examiner;24        (3) a radioactive seed implant within 30 days of death 25    until such time that 30 days have elapsed or the organ 26    containing the seed or seeds have been removed;   SB2383- 28 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b1        (4) containing a nuclear pacemaker until such time 2    that the nuclear pacemaker is removed; 3        (5) perishing as a result of a radiologic incident or 4    accident, unless a written release is provided by the 5    Department of Health Office of Radiation Protection or 6    other state or federal agency in charge of the response to 7    the radiological incident or accident; or8        (6) embalmed.9    (e) Whenever a disposition authority is unable or 10unauthorized to reduce human remains immediately upon taking 11custody of the remains, the disposition authority shall place 12the human remains in an operable refrigeration unit with 13cleanable, noncorrosive interior and exterior finishes. The 14unit must be capable of maintaining a temperature of less than 1540 degrees Fahrenheit or below and of holding at least 3 16bodies. For purposes of this Section, "immediately upon taking 17custody" means within 24 hours of taking custody.

No disposition authority should reduce 16human remains if the human remains are confirmed to have or 17suspected of having one or more of the following conditions:18        (1) a prion disease infection, mycobacterium 19    tuberculosis infection, or Ebola virus disease infection; 20        (2) a contagious disease infection which may be a 21    public health hazard as identified by the Illinois 22    Department of Health, local health officer, or medical 23    examiner;24        (3) a radioactive seed implant within 30 days of death 25    until such time that 30 days have elapsed or the organ 26    containing the seed or seeds have been removed;   SB2383- 28 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b1        (4) containing a nuclear pacemaker until such time 2    that the nuclear pacemaker is removed; 3        (5) perishing as a result of a radiologic incident or 4    accident, unless a written release is provided by the 5    Department of Health Office of Radiation Protection or 6    other state or federal agency in charge of the response to 7    the radiological incident or accident; or8        (6) embalmed.9    (e) Whenever a disposition authority is unable or 10unauthorized to reduce human remains immediately upon taking 11custody of the remains, the disposition authority shall place 12the human remains in an operable refrigeration unit with 13cleanable, noncorrosive interior and exterior finishes. The 14unit must be capable of maintaining a temperature of less than 1540 degrees Fahrenheit or below and of holding at least 3 16bodies. For purposes of this Section, "immediately upon taking 17custody" means within 24 hours of taking custody. The 18disposition authority must notify the authorizing agent of the 19reasons for delay in the natural organic reduction if a 20properly authorized natural organic reduction is not performed 21within any time period expressly contemplated in the 22authorization. 23    (f) A disposition authority shall not accept an 24alternative container or external wrapping from which there is 25any evidence of the leakage of body fluids. 26    (g) A disposition authority shall not reduce the remains   SB2383- 29 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b1of more than one person at the same time and in the same 2reduction chamber or introduce the remains of a second person 3into the reduction chamber until the reduction of preceding 4remains has been terminated and reasonable efforts have been 5employed to remove all fragments of preceding remains. The 6fact that there is residue in the reduction chamber or other 7equipment or a container used in a prior reduction does not 8violate this Section. 9    (h) No unauthorized person shall be permitted in the 10holding facility or natural organic reduction room while any 11human remains are being held there awaiting natural organic 12reduction, being reduced, or being removed from the reduction 13chamber. 14    (i) A disposition authority shall not remove any dental 15gold, body parts, organs, or any item of value prior to or 16subsequent to a natural organic reduction without previously 17having received specific written authorization from the 18authorizing agent and written instructions for the delivery of 19these items to the authorizing agent. Under no circumstances 20shall a disposition authority profit from making or assisting 21in any removal of valuables. 22    (j) In instances when the remains of deceased human beings 23are to be delivered to a natural organic reduction facility in 24a casket that is not to be organically reduced with the 25deceased, timely disclosure thereof must be made by the person 26making the funeral arrangements to the natural organic   SB2383- 30 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b1reduction facility that prior to the natural organic reduction 2the remains of the deceased human being shall be transferred 3to an alternative container. Such signed acknowledgment of the 4authorizing person, that the timely disclosure has been made, 5shall be retained by the natural organic reduction facility in 6its permanent records. 7    (k) A disposition authority shall:8        (1) ensure that the material in the natural organic 9    reduction chamber naturally reaches and maintains a 10    minimum temperature of 131 degrees Fahrenheit for a 11    minimum of 72 consecutive hours during the process of 12    natural organic reduction; 13        (2) analyze each instance of the reduced human remains 14    for physical contaminants, including, but not limited to, 15    intact bone, dental fillings, and medical implants, and 16    ensure reduced human remains have less than 0.01 mg/kg dry 17    weight of any physical contaminants;18        (3) collect material samples for analysis that are 19    representative of each instance of natural organic 20    reduction, using a sampling method such as those described 21    in the U.S. Composting Council 2002 Test Methods for the 22    Examination of Composting and Compost, method 02.01-A 23    through E; 24        (4) develop and use a natural organic reduction 25    process in which the reduced human remains from the 26    process do not exceed the following limits:   SB2383- 31 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b12Metals and other testing 3parameters Limit (mg/kg dry weight), unless otherwise specified4Fecal coliform5Less than 1,000 most probable number per gram of total solids (dry weight)6Salmonella7Less than 3 most probable number per 4 grams of total solids (dry weight)8ArsenicLess than or equal to 11 ppm9CadmiumLess than or equal to 7.1 ppm10LeadLess than or equal to 150 ppm11MercuryLess than or equal to 5 ppm12SeleniumLess than or equal to 18 ppm; 13        (5) analyze, using a third-party laboratory accredited 14    by the Illinois Environmental Laboratory Accreditation 15    Program or the Illinois Department of Public Health, or an 16    STA Compost-Certified Laboratory, the natural organic 17    reduction facility's material samples of reduced human 18    remains according to the following schedule:19            (A) the natural organic reduction facility must 20        analyze each of the first 20 instances of reduced 21        human remains for the parameters in paragraph (4) of 22        this subsection (k);  SB2383- 32 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b1            (B) if any of the first 20 instances of reduced 2        human remains yield results exceeding the limits in 3        paragraph (4) of this subsection (k), the natural 4        organic reduction facility must conduct appropriate 5        processes to correct the levels of the substances in 6        paragraph (4) and have the resultant remains tested to 7        ensure they fall within the identified limits;8            (C) if any of the first 20 instances of reduced 9        human remains yield results exceeding the limits in 10        paragraph (4) of this subsection (k), the natural 11        organic reduction facility must analyze each 12        additional instance of reduced human remains for the 13        parameters in paragraph (4) until a total of 20 14        samples, not including those from remains that were 15        reprocessed as required in subparagraph (B) of this 16        paragraph (5) have yielded results within the limits 17        in paragraph (4) on initial testing;18            (D) after 20 material samples of reduced human 19        remains have met the limits in paragraph (4) of this 20        subsection (k), the natural organic reduction facility 21        must analyze at least 25% of the natural organic 22        reduction facility's monthly instances of reduced 23        human remains for the parameters in paragraph (4) 24        until 80 total material samples of reduced remains are 25        found to meet the limits in paragraph (4), not 26        including any samples that required reprocessing to   SB2383- 33 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b1        meet those limits; and2            (E) after 80 material samples of reduced human 3        remains are found to meet the limits in paragraph (4) 4        of this subsection (k), the natural organic reduction 5        facility must analyze at least one randomly chosen 6        instance of reduced human remains each month for the 7        parameters in paragraph (4). If fecal coliform or 8        salmonella in the tested reduced human remains exceeds 9        the limit for that substance in paragraph (4), the 10        natural organic reduction facility must analyze each 11        subsequent instance of reduced human remains for fecal 12        coliform and salmonella until 10 total material 13        samples are found to meet the limits for those 14        substances in paragraph (4) on initial testing, 15        demonstrating the natural organic reduction process 16        was effectively corrected;17        (6) comply with any testing requirements established 18    by the Comptroller, Department of Public Health, or local 19    health department for content parameters in addition to 20    those specified in paragraph (4) of this subsection (k);21        (7) not release any reduced human remains that exceed 22    the limits in paragraph (4) of this subsection (k); and23        (8) prepare, maintain, and provide to the Comptroller 24    a report for each calendar year detailing the natural 25    organic reduction facility's activities during the 26    previous calendar year. The report must include the   SB2383- 34 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b1    following information:2            (A) the name and address of the natural organic 3        reduction facility;4            (B) the calendar year covered by the report;5            (C) the annual quantity of reduced human remains;6            (D) the results of any laboratory analyses of 7        reduced human remains, including an affirmation that 8        the analysis was prepared in accordance with this 9        subsection (k); and10            (E) any additional information required by the 11        Comptroller, Department of Public Health, or local 12        health department.13        (9) The Department of Public Health shall conduct an 14    annual audit of the results of the laboratory analyses of 15    reduced human remains prepared in accordance with 16    paragraph (4) of this subsection (k).17    (l) Upon the completion of each natural organic reduction, 18all of the recoverable residue of the reduction process shall 19be removed from the reduction chamber. 20    (m) If all of the recovered reduced human remains will not 21fit within the receptacle that has been selected, the 22remainder of the reduced human remains shall be disposed of in 23accordance with subsection (i) of Section 55. 24    (n) A disposition authority shall not knowingly represent 25to an authorizing agent or the agent's designee that a 26temporary container or urn contains the reduced remains of a   SB2383- 35 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b1specific decedent when it does not. 2    (o) Reduced human remains shall be shipped only by a 3method that has an internal tracing system available and that 4provides a receipt signed by the person accepting delivery. 5    (p) A disposition authority shall maintain an 6identification system that shall ensure that it shall be able 7to identify the human remains in its possession throughout all 8phases of the natural organic reduction process. 9    (q) A disposition authority shall not reduce via natural 10organic reduction the remains required to be labeled as an 11infection hazard under 77 Ill. Adm. Code 690.1200(k). 12    (r) In the case of an event where the health of the public 13may be at risk or there are signs at a facility of a potential 14health hazard, the Illinois Department of Public Health may be 15consulted to assess the natural organic reduction facility's 16compliance with this Act. 17    Section 75. Disposition of reduced human remains. 18    (a) The authorizing agent shall be responsible for the 19final disposition of the reduced human remains delivered to 20the authorizing agent.

The integration into the soil of the reduced 12human remains of more than one person in one location pursuant 13to this Section does not create a cemetery. 14    (d) Upon the completion of the natural organic reduction 15process, and except as provided for in subparagraph (I) of 16paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section 55, if the 17disposition authority has not been instructed to arrange for 18the interment, entombment, inurnment, or scattering of the 19reduced human remains, the disposition authority shall deliver 20the reduced human remains to the individual specified on the 21natural organic reduction authorization form or, if no 22individual is specified, then to the authorizing agent. Upon 23receipt of the reduced human remains, the individual receiving 24them may transport them in any manner in this State without a 25permit and may dispose of them in accordance with this 26Section. After delivery, the disposition authority shall be   SB2383- 37 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b1discharged from any legal obligation or liability concerning 2the reduced human remains.3    (e) If, after a period of 60 days from the date the natural 4organic reduction process is complete, the authorizing agent 5or the agent's designee has not instructed the disposition 6authority to arrange for the final disposition of the reduced 7human remains, claimed the reduced human remains, or claimed 8only a portion of the reduced human remains, the disposition 9authority may dispose of the reduced human remains in a 10cemetery or on conservation land, which is land that is 11protected and cannot be built on and that is only used for the 12conservation of nature. The disposition authority, however, 13shall keep a permanent record identifying the site of final 14disposition and the estimated volume of human remains. The 15authorizing agent shall be responsible for reimbursing the 16disposition authority for all reasonable expenses incurred in 17disposing of the reduced human remains. Upon disposing of the 18reduced human remains, the disposition authority shall be 19discharged from any legal obligation or liability concerning 20the reduced remains. Any person who was in possession of 21reduced remains prior to the effective date of this Act may 22dispose of them in accordance with this Section. 23    (f) Except with the express written permission of the 24authorizing agent, no person shall: 25        (1) dispose of reduced human remains in a manner or in 26    a location so that the reduced human remains are   SB2383- 38 -LRB104 06219 AAS 16254 b1    commingled with those of another person; this prohibition 2    shall not apply to the scattering of reduced remains in an 3    area located in a dedicated cemetery or conservation land, 4    which is land that is protected, cannot be built on, and is 5    only used for the conservation of nature; or 6        (2) place reduced human remains of more than one 7    person in the same temporary container or urn. 8    (g) No person shall sell the soil resulting from reduced 9human remains for commercial purposes. 10    (h) No person shall use the soil resulting from reduced 11human remains to grow food for human or livestock consumption. 12    Section 80.
