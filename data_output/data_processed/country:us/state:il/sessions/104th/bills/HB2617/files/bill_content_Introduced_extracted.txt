Reproductive health care facility 3requirements; civil remedies; professional sanctions.4    (a) A facility shall conspicuously post signs visible to 5all who enter in its waiting, consultation, and procedure 6rooms to be clearly readable, which state the following 7notices and information:8        (1) "It is against the law for anyone, regardless of 9    his or her relationship to you, to force you to have an 10    abortion."11        (2) "You have the right to contact any local or State 12    law enforcement or social service agency to receive 13    protection from any actual or threatened physical, 14    emotional, or psychological abuse."15        (3) "It is against the law to perform, induce, 16    prescribe for, or provide you with the means for an 17    abortion without your voluntary consent."18        (4) Local and State law enforcement and social service 19    agency telephone numbers.20    The continued posting of such signs shall be a condition 21of licensure of any reproductive health care facility under 22the Department of Public Health.23    The display of such signs does not discharge the duty of a 24reproductive health care facility to have a health care 25professional orally inform the pregnant woman of information   HB2617- 9 -LRB104 10402 BDA 20477 b1required by subsections (b) and (c).2    (b) A mandatory reporter shall personally report every 3instance of alleged or suspected coerced abortion as defined 4in and proscribed by Section 15 to the Department of Children 5and Family Services or the local law enforcement authority of 6the county the facility is in.

The mandatory reporter shall also report 25any pertinent information he or she may have relating to the 26alleged or suspected coercion, force, attempted coercion,   HB2617- 10 -LRB104 10402 BDA 20477 b1attempted force, threatened coercion, or threatened force.2    The attending health care professional shall orally inform 3the pregnant woman that no one can force her to have an 4abortion.5    (c) In a private room, the attending health care 6professional shall orally ask the pregnant woman, without any 7individual accompanying her, if she is being coerced or forced 8to have an abortion.9        (1) If it is reasonably suspected that the woman is 10    being coerced or forced into having an abortion, the 11    health care professional shall inform the woman that:12            (A) such coercion is illegal;13            (B) the woman may have legal remedies;14            (C) a request or demand by the father to have an 15        abortion does not relieve his financial support 16        responsibilities.17        (2) The attending health care professional shall also 18    provide the pregnant woman with:19            (A) information about assistance, counseling, and 20        protective services offered by:21                (i) social programs; or22                (ii) local or State law enforcement agencies;23            (B) access to a telephone where she can make a 24        private call; and25            (C) an alternate exit from the facility so that, 26        if necessary, she can exit the abortion facility   HB2617- 11 -LRB104 10402 BDA 20477 b1        without being seen or confronted.2    (d) Any mandatory reporter who has reason to believe a 3woman is or has been a victim of conduct defined in and 4proscribed by Section 15, and willfully and knowingly does not 5report such coercion, force, attempted coercion, attempted 6force, threatened coercion, or threatened force as required by 7this Act is guilty of a business offense with a fine of $5,000.8    Any person who performs an abortion which is inconsistent 9with this subsection is guilty of a business offense with a 10fine of $5,000.11    Any health care professional who willfully violates this 12subsection or subsection (b) or (c) shall be referred to the 13Illinois State Medical Board for action on whether to suspend 14or revoke his or her license.15    A pregnant woman injured by a facility's violation of this 16Act may bring a civil suit to recover damages for such injury, 17including wrongful death on behalf of an aborted child as 18provided for under the Wrongful Death Act, regardless of 19whether the attending health care professional or the facility 20is criminally prosecuted and whether the pregnant woman had an 21abortion. In such a civil suit, the pregnant woman, if she is 22the prevailing party, is entitled to recover, in addition to 23any other damages, her reasonable attorney's fees and costs.24    Initial and continuing adherence to the requirements of 25this Section shall be a condition of licensure for any 26reproductive health care facility under the Department of   HB2617- 12 -LRB104 10402 BDA 20477 b1Public Health.2    A woman receiving an abortion inconsistent with any 3provision of this Act cannot be prosecuted or held civilly 4liable. 5    Section 25.
