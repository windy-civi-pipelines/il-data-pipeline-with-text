After 24administrative and judicial challenges to such restrictions 25have been exhausted, the Agency shall file such restrictions 26of record in the Office of the Recorder of the county in which   HB1608- 18 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1the hazardous waste disposal site is located.2    (h) A hazardous waste stream may not be deposited in a 3permitted hazardous waste site unless specific authorization 4is obtained from the Agency by the generator and disposal site 5owner and operator for the deposit of that specific hazardous 6waste stream. The Agency may grant specific authorization for 7disposal of hazardous waste streams only after the generator 8has reasonably demonstrated that, considering technological 9feasibility and economic reasonableness, the hazardous waste 10cannot be reasonably recycled for reuse, nor incinerated or 11chemically, physically, or biologically treated so as to 12neutralize the hazardous waste and render it nonhazardous. In 13granting authorization under this Section, the Agency may 14impose such conditions as may be necessary to accomplish the 15purposes of the Act and are consistent with this Act and 16regulations promulgated by the Board hereunder. If the Agency 17refuses to grant authorization under this Section, the 18applicant may appeal as if the Agency refused to grant a 19permit, pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of 20Section 40 of this Act. For purposes of this subsection (h), 21the term "generator" has the meaning given in Section 3.205 of 22this Act, unless: (1) the hazardous waste is treated, 23incinerated, or partially recycled for reuse prior to 24disposal, in which case the last person who treats, 25incinerates, or partially recycles the hazardous waste prior 26to disposal is the generator; or (2) the hazardous waste is   HB1608- 19 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1from a response action, in which case the person performing 2the response action is the generator.

Before July 1, 1998, the Board shall 6revise its rules for the existing State air pollution 7operating permit program consistent with this paragraph and 8shall adopt rules that require a source to demonstrate that it 9qualifies for a permit under this paragraph.10    (b) The Agency may issue NPDES permits exclusively under 11this subsection for the discharge of contaminants from point 12sources into navigable waters, all as defined in the Federal 13Water Pollution Control Act, as now or hereafter amended, 14within the jurisdiction of the State, or into any well.15    All NPDES permits shall contain those terms and 16conditions, including, but not limited to, schedules of 17compliance, which may be required to accomplish the purposes 18and provisions of this Act.19    The Agency may issue general NPDES permits for discharges 20from categories of point sources which are subject to the same 21permit limitations and conditions. Such general permits may be 22issued without individual applications and shall conform to 23regulations promulgated under Section 402 of the Federal Water 24Pollution Control Act, as now or hereafter amended.25    The Agency may include, among such conditions, effluent 26limitations and other requirements established under this Act,   HB1608- 9 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1Board regulations, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as 2now or hereafter amended, and regulations pursuant thereto, 3and schedules for achieving compliance therewith at the 4earliest reasonable date.5    The Agency shall adopt filing requirements and procedures 6which are necessary and appropriate for the issuance of NPDES 7permits, and which are consistent with the Act or regulations 8adopted by the Board, and with the Federal Water Pollution 9Control Act, as now or hereafter amended, and regulations 10pursuant thereto.11    The Agency, subject to any conditions which may be 12prescribed by Board regulations, may issue NPDES permits to 13allow discharges beyond deadlines established by this Act or 14by regulations of the Board without the requirement of a 15variance, subject to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 16as now or hereafter amended, and regulations pursuant thereto.17    (c) Except for those facilities owned or operated by 18sanitary districts organized under the Metropolitan Water 19Reclamation District Act, no permit for the development or 20construction of a new pollution control facility may be 21granted by the Agency unless the applicant submits proof to 22the Agency that the location of the facility has been approved 23by the county board of the county if in an unincorporated area, 24or the governing body of the municipality when in an 25incorporated area, in which the facility is to be located in 26accordance with Section 39.2 of this Act. For purposes of this   HB1608- 10 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1subsection (c), and for purposes of Section 39.2 of this Act, 2the appropriate county board or governing body of the 3municipality shall be the county board of the county or the 4governing body of the municipality in which the facility is to 5be located as of the date when the application for siting 6approval is filed. 7    In the event that siting approval granted pursuant to 8Section 39.2 has been transferred to a subsequent owner or 9operator, that subsequent owner or operator may apply to the 10Agency for, and the Agency may grant, a development or 11construction permit for the facility for which local siting 12approval was granted. Upon application to the Agency for a 13development or construction permit by that subsequent owner or 14operator, the permit applicant shall cause written notice of 15the permit application to be served upon the appropriate 16county board or governing body of the municipality that 17granted siting approval for that facility and upon any party 18to the siting proceeding pursuant to which siting approval was 19granted. In that event, the Agency shall conduct an evaluation 20of the subsequent owner or operator's prior experience in 21waste management operations in the manner conducted under 22subsection (i) of Section 39 of this Act.23    Beginning August 20, 1993, if the pollution control 24facility consists of a hazardous or solid waste disposal 25facility for which the proposed site is located in an 26unincorporated area of a county with a population of less than   HB1608- 11 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1100,000 and includes all or a portion of a parcel of land that 2was, on April 1, 1993, adjacent to a municipality having a 3population of less than 5,000, then the local siting review 4required under this subsection (c) in conjunction with any 5permit applied for after that date shall be performed by the 6governing body of that adjacent municipality rather than the 7county board of the county in which the proposed site is 8located; and for the purposes of that local siting review, any 9references in this Act to the county board shall be deemed to 10mean the governing body of that adjacent municipality; 11provided, however, that the provisions of this paragraph shall 12not apply to any proposed site which was, on April 1, 1993, 13owned in whole or in part by another municipality.14    In the case of a pollution control facility for which a 15development permit was issued before November 12, 1981, if an 16operating permit has not been issued by the Agency prior to 17August 31, 1989 for any portion of the facility, then the 18Agency may not issue or renew any development permit nor issue 19an original operating permit for any portion of such facility 20unless the applicant has submitted proof to the Agency that 21the location of the facility has been approved by the 22appropriate county board or municipal governing body pursuant 23to Section 39.2 of this Act.24    After January 1, 1994, if a solid waste disposal facility, 25any portion for which an operating permit has been issued by 26the Agency, has not accepted waste disposal for 5 or more   HB1608- 12 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1consecutive calendar years, before that facility may accept 2any new or additional waste for disposal, the owner and 3operator must obtain a new operating permit under this Act for 4that facility unless the owner and operator have applied to 5the Agency for a permit authorizing the temporary suspension 6of waste acceptance. The Agency may not issue a new operation 7permit under this Act for the facility unless the applicant 8has submitted proof to the Agency that the location of the 9facility has been approved or re-approved by the appropriate 10county board or municipal governing body under Section 39.2 of 11this Act after the facility ceased accepting waste.12    Except for those facilities owned or operated by sanitary 13districts organized under the Metropolitan Water Reclamation 14District Act, and except for new pollution control facilities 15governed by Section 39.2, and except for fossil fuel mining 16facilities, the granting of a permit under this Act shall not 17relieve the applicant from meeting and securing all necessary 18zoning approvals from the unit of government having zoning 19jurisdiction over the proposed facility.20    Before beginning construction on any new sewage treatment 21plant or sludge drying site to be owned or operated by a 22sanitary district organized under the Metropolitan Water 23Reclamation District Act for which a new permit (rather than 24the renewal or amendment of an existing permit) is required, 25such sanitary district shall hold a public hearing within the 26municipality within which the proposed facility is to be   HB1608- 13 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1located, or within the nearest community if the proposed 2facility is to be located within an unincorporated area, at 3which information concerning the proposed facility shall be 4made available to the public, and members of the public shall 5be given the opportunity to express their views concerning the 6proposed facility.7    The Agency may issue a permit for a municipal waste 8transfer station without requiring approval pursuant to 9Section 39.2 provided that the following demonstration is 10made:11        (1) the municipal waste transfer station was in 12    existence on or before January 1, 1979 and was in 13    continuous operation from January 1, 1979 to January 1, 14    1993;15        (2) the operator submitted a permit application to the 16    Agency to develop and operate the municipal waste transfer 17    station during April of 1994;18        (3) the operator can demonstrate that the county board 19    of the county, if the municipal waste transfer station is 20    in an unincorporated area, or the governing body of the 21    municipality, if the station is in an incorporated area, 22    does not object to resumption of the operation of the 23    station; and24        (4) the site has local zoning approval.25    (d) The Agency may issue RCRA permits exclusively under 26this subsection to persons owning or operating a facility for   HB1608- 14 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste as 2defined under this Act. Subsection (y) of this Section, rather 3than this subsection (d), shall apply to permits issued for 4CCR surface impoundments. 5    All RCRA permits shall contain those terms and conditions, 6including, but not limited to, schedules of compliance, which 7may be required to accomplish the purposes and provisions of 8this Act. The Agency may include among such conditions 9standards and other requirements established under this Act, 10Board regulations, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 11of 1976 (P.L. 94-580), as amended, and regulations pursuant 12thereto, and may include schedules for achieving compliance 13therewith as soon as possible. The Agency shall require that a 14performance bond or other security be provided as a condition 15for the issuance of a RCRA permit.16    In the case of a permit to operate a hazardous waste or PCB 17incinerator as defined in subsection (k) of Section 44, the 18Agency shall require, as a condition of the permit, that the 19operator of the facility perform such analyses of the waste to 20be incinerated as may be necessary and appropriate to ensure 21the safe operation of the incinerator.22    The Agency shall adopt filing requirements and procedures 23which are necessary and appropriate for the issuance of RCRA 24permits, and which are consistent with the Act or regulations 25adopted by the Board, and with the Resource Conservation and 26Recovery Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-580), as amended, and   HB1608- 15 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1regulations pursuant thereto.2    The applicant shall make available to the public for 3inspection all documents submitted by the applicant to the 4Agency in furtherance of an application, with the exception of 5trade secrets, at the office of the county board or governing 6body of the municipality. Such documents may be copied upon 7payment of the actual cost of reproduction during regular 8business hours of the local office. The Agency shall issue a 9written statement concurrent with its grant or denial of the 10permit explaining the basis for its decision.11    (e) The Agency may issue UIC permits exclusively under 12this subsection to persons owning or operating a facility for 13the underground injection of contaminants as defined under 14this Act.15    All UIC permits shall contain those terms and conditions, 16including, but not limited to, schedules of compliance, which 17may be required to accomplish the purposes and provisions of 18this Act. The Agency may include among such conditions 19standards and other requirements established under this Act, 20Board regulations, the Safe Drinking Water Act (P.L. 93-523), 21as amended, and regulations pursuant thereto, and may include 22schedules for achieving compliance therewith.

Such documents may be copied upon 9payment of the actual cost of reproduction during regular 10business hours of the local office. The Agency shall issue a 11written statement concurrent with its grant or denial of the 12permit explaining the basis for its decision.13    (f) In making any determination pursuant to Section 9.1 of 14this Act:15        (1) The Agency shall have authority to make the 16    determination of any question required to be determined by 17    the Clean Air Act, as now or hereafter amended, this Act, 18    or the regulations of the Board, including the 19    determination of the Lowest Achievable Emission Rate, 20    Maximum Achievable Control Technology, or Best Available 21    Control Technology, consistent with the Board's 22    regulations, if any.23        (2) The Agency shall adopt requirements as necessary 24    to implement public participation procedures, including, 25    but not limited to, public notice, comment, and an 26    opportunity for hearing, which must accompany the   HB1608- 17 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1    processing of applications for PSD permits. The Agency 2    shall briefly describe and respond to all significant 3    comments on the draft permit raised during the public 4    comment period or during any hearing. The Agency may group 5    related comments together and provide one unified response 6    for each issue raised.7        (3) Any complete permit application submitted to the 8    Agency under this subsection for a PSD permit shall be 9    granted or denied by the Agency not later than one year 10    after the filing of such completed application. 11        (4) The Agency shall, after conferring with the 12    applicant, give written notice to the applicant of its 13    proposed decision on the application, including the terms 14    and conditions of the permit to be issued and the facts, 15    conduct, or other basis upon which the Agency will rely to 16    support its proposed action.17    (g) The Agency shall include as conditions upon all 18permits issued for hazardous waste disposal sites such 19restrictions upon the future use of such sites as are 20reasonably necessary to protect public health and the 21environment, including permanent prohibition of the use of 22such sites for purposes which may create an unreasonable risk 23of injury to human health or to the environment. After 24administrative and judicial challenges to such restrictions 25have been exhausted, the Agency shall file such restrictions 26of record in the Office of the Recorder of the county in which   HB1608- 18 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1the hazardous waste disposal site is located.2    (h) A hazardous waste stream may not be deposited in a 3permitted hazardous waste site unless specific authorization 4is obtained from the Agency by the generator and disposal site 5owner and operator for the deposit of that specific hazardous 6waste stream. The Agency may grant specific authorization for 7disposal of hazardous waste streams only after the generator 8has reasonably demonstrated that, considering technological 9feasibility and economic reasonableness, the hazardous waste 10cannot be reasonably recycled for reuse, nor incinerated or 11chemically, physically, or biologically treated so as to 12neutralize the hazardous waste and render it nonhazardous. In 13granting authorization under this Section, the Agency may 14impose such conditions as may be necessary to accomplish the 15purposes of the Act and are consistent with this Act and 16regulations promulgated by the Board hereunder. If the Agency 17refuses to grant authorization under this Section, the 18applicant may appeal as if the Agency refused to grant a 19permit, pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a) of 20Section 40 of this Act. For purposes of this subsection (h), 21the term "generator" has the meaning given in Section 3.205 of 22this Act, unless: (1) the hazardous waste is treated, 23incinerated, or partially recycled for reuse prior to 24disposal, in which case the last person who treats, 25incinerates, or partially recycles the hazardous waste prior 26to disposal is the generator; or (2) the hazardous waste is   HB1608- 19 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1from a response action, in which case the person performing 2the response action is the generator. This subsection (h) does 3not apply to any hazardous waste that is restricted from land 4disposal under 35 Ill. Adm. Code 728.5    (i) Before issuing any RCRA permit, any permit for a waste 6storage site, sanitary landfill, waste disposal site, waste 7transfer station, waste treatment facility, waste incinerator, 8or any waste-transportation operation, any permit or interim 9authorization for a clean construction or demolition debris 10fill operation, or any permit required under subsection (d-5) 11of Section 55, the Agency shall conduct an evaluation of the 12prospective owner's or operator's prior experience in waste 13management operations, clean construction or demolition debris 14fill operations, and tire storage site management. The Agency 15may deny such a permit, or deny or revoke interim 16authorization, if the prospective owner or operator or any 17employee or officer of the prospective owner or operator has a 18history of:19        (1) repeated violations of federal, State, or local 20    laws, regulations, standards, or ordinances in the 21    operation of waste management facilities or sites, clean 22    construction or demolition debris fill operation 23    facilities or sites, or tire storage sites; or24        (2) conviction in this or another State of any crime 25    which is a felony under the laws of this State, or 26    conviction of a felony in a federal court; or conviction   HB1608- 20 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1    in this or another state or federal court of any of the 2    following crimes: forgery, official misconduct, bribery, 3    perjury, or knowingly submitting false information under 4    any environmental law, regulation, or permit term or 5    condition; or6        (3) proof of gross carelessness or incompetence in 7    handling, storing, processing, transporting, or disposing 8    of waste, clean construction or demolition debris, or used 9    or waste tires, or proof of gross carelessness or 10    incompetence in using clean construction or demolition 11    debris as fill.12    (i-5) Before issuing any permit or approving any interim 13authorization for a clean construction or demolition debris 14fill operation in which any ownership interest is transferred 15between January 1, 2005, and the effective date of the 16prohibition set forth in Section 22.52 of this Act, the Agency 17shall conduct an evaluation of the operation if any previous 18activities at the site or facility may have caused or allowed 19contamination of the site. It shall be the responsibility of 20the owner or operator seeking the permit or interim 21authorization to provide to the Agency all of the information 22necessary for the Agency to conduct its evaluation. The Agency 23may deny a permit or interim authorization if previous 24activities at the site may have caused or allowed 25contamination at the site, unless such contamination is 26authorized under any permit issued by the Agency.   HB1608- 21 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1    (j) The issuance under this Act of a permit to engage in 2the surface mining of any resources other than fossil fuels 3shall not relieve the permittee from its duty to comply with 4any applicable local law regulating the commencement, 5location, or operation of surface mining facilities.6    (k) A development permit issued under subsection (a) of 7Section 39 for any facility or site which is required to have a 8permit under subsection (d) of Section 21 shall expire at the 9end of 2 calendar years from the date upon which it was issued, 10unless within that period the applicant has taken action to 11develop the facility or the site. In the event that review of 12the conditions of the development permit is sought pursuant to 13Section 40 or 41, or permittee is prevented from commencing 14development of the facility or site by any other litigation 15beyond the permittee's control, such two-year period shall be 16deemed to begin on the date upon which such review process or 17litigation is concluded.18    (l) No permit shall be issued by the Agency under this Act 19for construction or operation of any facility or site located 20within the boundaries of any setback zone established pursuant 21to this Act, where such construction or operation is 22prohibited.23    (m) The Agency may issue permits to persons owning or 24operating a facility for composting landscape waste. In 25granting such permits, the Agency may impose such conditions 26as may be necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Act, and   HB1608- 22 -LRB104 08109 BDA 18155 b1as are not inconsistent with applicable regulations 2promulgated by the Board. Except as otherwise provided in this 3Act, a bond or other security shall not be required as a 4condition for the issuance of a permit. If the Agency denies 5any permit pursuant to this subsection, the Agency shall 6transmit to the applicant within the time limitations of this 7subsection specific, detailed statements as to the reasons the 8permit application was denied. Such statements shall include 9but not be limited to the following:10        (1) the Sections of this Act that may be violated if 11    the permit were granted;12        (2) the specific regulations promulgated pursuant to 13    this Act that may be violated if the permit were granted;14        (3) the specific information, if any, the Agency deems 15    the applicant did not provide in its application to the 16    Agency; and17        (4) a statement of specific reasons why the Act and 18    the regulations might be violated if the permit were 19    granted.20    If no final action is taken by the Agency within 90 days 21after the filing of the application for permit, the applicant 22may deem the permit issued.
