A more reflective workforce in school support personnel 23professions allows for improved outcomes for students and 24better utilization of services. Therefore, the Commission 25should give priority to those applicants who are members of a 26racial minority.  HB2848- 11 -LRB104 11375 LNS 21463 b1    In this subsection (e), "racial minority" means a person 2who is a citizen of the United States or a lawful permanent 3resident alien of the United States and who is:4        (1) Black (a person having origins in any of the black 5    racial groups in Africa);6        (2) Hispanic (a person of Spanish or Portuguese 7    culture with origins in Mexico, South or Central America, 8    or the Caribbean Islands, regardless of race);9        (3) Asian American (a person having origins in any of 10    the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, the 11    Indian Subcontinent, or the Pacific Islands); or12        (4) American Indian or Alaskan Native (a person having 13    origins in any of the original peoples of North America).14    In awarding grants under this Section, the Commission 15shall give priority to those applicants who are members of a 16racial minority.  17    Section 99.
