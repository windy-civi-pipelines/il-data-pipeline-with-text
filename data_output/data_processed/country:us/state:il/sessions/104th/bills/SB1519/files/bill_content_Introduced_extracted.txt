Findings and intent.5    (a) The General Assembly finds the following:6        (1) Public Act 99-456 prohibited schools from issuing 7    monetary fines or fees as a disciplinary consequence.8        (2) Public Act 100-810 prohibited schools from 9    referring truant minors to local public entities for the 10    purpose of issuing fines or fees as punishment for truancy 11    and required schools to document the provision of all 12    appropriate and available supportive services before 13    referring an individual having custody of a truant minor 14    to a local public entity.15        (3) Thousands of students have been referred to 16    municipalities for behaviors occurring on school grounds, 17    during school-related events, or while taking school 18    transportation.19        (4) Municipal tickets, citations, and ordinance 20    violations disproportionately impact students of color and 21    students with disabilities.22        (5) Municipal fines and fees associated with municipal 23    tickets, citations, and ordinance violations create 24    financial hardship for minors and their families.  SB1519- 2 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1        (6) Municipal proceedings do not provide minors with 2    sufficient due process, confidentiality, or record 3    expungement protections.4        (7) In accordance with federal law and regulations, 5    Illinois schools provide data to the Civil Rights Data 6    Collection required by the Office for Civil Rights of the 7    U.S. Department of Education, including data on referrals 8    to law enforcement, and which disaggregates referrals 9    resulting in arrests, but does not disaggregate referrals 10    resulting in a municipal ticket, citation, or ordinance 11    violation.12    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to learn more 13about the prevalence of student referrals to law enforcement, 14particularly those resulting in municipal tickets, citations, 15and ordinance violations for behaviors occurring on school 16grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school 17transportation. It is not the intent of the General Assembly 18to modify current school disciplinary responses provided in 19the School Code or responses to alleged delinquent or criminal 20conduct as set forth in the School Code, the Juvenile Court Act 21of 1987, or the Criminal Code of 2012. 22    Section 5.

The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 15at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 16date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 17hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 18shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 19heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 20as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 21the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 22reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 23is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 24shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 25the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately   SB1519- 8 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 2in Article 13A or 13B of this Code.

Upon request of the parents or guardians, 26the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall   SB1519- 20 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1review such action of the superintendent or principal, 2assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 3parents or guardians of the student may appear and discuss the 4suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 5officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 6a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 7its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 8hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 9appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 10subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 11decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 12misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 13suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 14specific duration of the suspension.15    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 16and consequences available to school officials, school 17exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 18are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 19and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 20extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 21only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 22students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 23recommended that school officials consider forms of 24non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 25suspensions or expulsions. 26    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this   SB1519- 21 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 2by which school administrators are required to suspend or 3expel students for particular behaviors.4    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 5used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 6pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 7students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 8subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 9other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 10a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 11School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 12such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 13length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.14    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 15out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 16and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 17only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 18disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 19student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 20a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 21the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 22interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 23this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 24students, staff, or members of the school community" and 25"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 26operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case   SB1519- 22 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 2(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 3available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 4exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 5shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 6address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 7exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 8suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 9Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 10of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 11interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 12there were no other appropriate and available interventions.13    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 14than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 15support services during the period of their suspension. For 16purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 17support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 18Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 19this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 20to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 21such appropriate and available services. 22    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 23appropriate and available support services.24    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 25re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 26expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In   SB1519- 23 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 2Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 3and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 4suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 5alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 6Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 7    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 8suspended students, including those students suspended from 9the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 10school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 11equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 12a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 13that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 14alternate transportation to school. 15    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 16subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 17subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be 18considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 19parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 20violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 21parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 22emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 23throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 24its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 25student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 26emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany   SB1519- 24 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 2representative or support person must comply with any rules of 3the school district's hearing process. If the representative 4or support person violates the rules or engages in behavior or 5advocacy that harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a 6witness, or anyone else in attendance at the hearing, the 7representative or support person may be prohibited from 8further participation in the hearing or proceeding. A 9suspension or expulsion proceeding under this subsection 10(b-35) must be conducted independently from any ongoing 11criminal investigation or proceeding, and an absence of 12pending or possible criminal charges, criminal investigations, 13or proceedings may not be a factor in school disciplinary 14decisions.15    (b-40) During a suspension review hearing conducted under 16subsection (b) or an expulsion hearing conducted under 17subsection (a) that involves allegations of sexual violence by 18the student who is subject to discipline, neither the student 19nor his or her representative shall directly question nor have 20direct contact with the alleged victim. The student who is 21subject to discipline or his or her representative may, at the 22discretion and direction of the school board or its appointed 23hearing officer, suggest questions to be posed by the school 24board or its appointed hearing officer to the alleged victim. 25    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 26local mental health agency to consult with the board at the   SB1519- 25 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 2the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.3    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 4provide ongoing professional development to all school 5personnel, school board members, and school resource officers 6on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 7adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 8involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 9culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 10environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 11the appropriate and available supportive services for the 12promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 13developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 14positive and healthy school climates. 15    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 16time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 17case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 18brought one of the following objects to school, any 19school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 20that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 21expelled for a period of not less than one year:22        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 23    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 24    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 25    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 26    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section   SB1519- 26 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period 2    under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the 3    superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may 4    be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.5        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon 6    regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other 7    object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily 8    harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in 9    subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). The expulsion 10    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 11    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 12    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 13Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 14consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 15Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 16expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 17transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 18Article 13A of the School Code.19    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 20superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 21principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 22student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 23a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 24calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 25that student has been determined to have made an explicit 26threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a   SB1519- 27 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 2website through which the threat was made is a site that was 3accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 4was available to third parties who worked or studied within 5the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 6the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 7the safety and security of the threatened individual because 8of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 9student inside the school. 10    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 11authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 12lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 13equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 14personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 15without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 16search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 17Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 18privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 19left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 20the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 21conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 22lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 23controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 24illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 25searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 26If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces   SB1519- 28 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 2the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 3such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 4disciplinary action may be taken.
