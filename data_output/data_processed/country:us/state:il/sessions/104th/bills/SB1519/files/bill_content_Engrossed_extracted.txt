Findings and intent.5    (a) The General Assembly finds the following:6        (1) Public Act 99-456 prohibited schools from issuing 7    monetary fines or fees as a disciplinary consequence.8        (2) Public Act 100-810 prohibited schools from 9    referring truant minors to local public entities for the 10    purpose of issuing fines or fees as punishment for truancy 11    and required schools to document the provision of all 12    appropriate and available supportive services before 13    referring an individual having custody of a truant minor 14    to a local public entity.15        (3) Thousands of students have been referred to 16    municipalities for behaviors occurring on school grounds, 17    during school-related events, or while taking school 18    transportation.19        (4) Municipal tickets, citations, and ordinance 20    violations disproportionately impact students of color and 21    students with disabilities.22        (5) Municipal fines and fees associated with municipal 23    tickets, citations, and ordinance violations create 24    financial hardship for minors and their families.  SB1519 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1        (6) Municipal proceedings do not provide minors with 2    sufficient due process, confidentiality, or record 3    expungement protections.4        (7) In accordance with federal law and regulations, 5    Illinois schools provide data to the Civil Rights Data 6    Collection required by the Office for Civil Rights of the 7    U.S. Department of Education, including data on referrals 8    to law enforcement, and which disaggregates referrals 9    resulting in arrests, but does not disaggregate referrals 10    resulting in a municipal ticket, citation, or ordinance 11    violation.12    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to learn more 13about the prevalence of student referrals to law enforcement, 14particularly those resulting in municipal tickets, citations, 15and ordinance violations for behaviors occurring on school 16grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school 17transportation. It is not the intent of the General Assembly 18to modify current school disciplinary responses provided in 19the School Code or responses to alleged delinquent or criminal 20conduct as set forth in the School Code, the Juvenile Court Act 21of 1987, or the Criminal Code of 2012. 22    Section 5.

The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 9at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 10date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 11hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 12shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 13heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 14as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 15the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 16reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 17is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 18shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 19the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 20transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 21in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 22denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 23which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 24of students or staff in the alternative program. 25    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 26superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant   SB1519 Engrossed- 10 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 2students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 3suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 4the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 5subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 6shall lie against them for such suspension.

The 7suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 8specific duration of the suspension.9    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 10and consequences available to school officials, school 11exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 12are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 13and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 14extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 15only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 16students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 17recommended that school officials consider forms of 18non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 19suspensions or expulsions. 20    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 21Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 22by which school administrators are required to suspend or 23expel students for particular behaviors.24    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 25used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 26pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other   SB1519 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 2subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 3other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 4a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 5School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 6such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 7length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.8    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 9out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 10and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 11only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 12disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 13student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 14a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 15the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 16interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 17this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 18students, staff, or members of the school community" and 19"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 20operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 21basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 22(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 23available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 24exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 25shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 26address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student   SB1519 Engrossed- 13 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 2suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 3Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 4of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 5interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 6there were no other appropriate and available interventions.7    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 8than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 9support services during the period of their suspension. For 10purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 11support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 12Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 13this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 14to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 15such appropriate and available services. 16    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 17appropriate and available support services.18    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 19re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 20expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 21consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 22Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 23and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 24suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 25alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 26Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025.   SB1519 Engrossed- 14 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 2suspended students, including those students suspended from 3the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 4school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 5equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 6a student's parent or guardian to notify school officials that 7a student suspended from the school bus does not have 8alternate transportation to school. 9    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 10local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 11meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 12the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.13    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 14provide ongoing professional development to all school 15personnel, school board members, and school resource officers, 16on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 17adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 18involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 19culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 20environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 21the appropriate and available supportive services for the 22promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 23developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 24positive and healthy school climates. 25    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 26time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a   SB1519 Engrossed- 15 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 2brought one of the following objects to school, any 3school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 4that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 5expelled for a period of not less than one year:6        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 7    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 8    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 9    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 10    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 11    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012.

The expulsion 20    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 21    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 22    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 23Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 24consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 25Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 26expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a   SB1519 Engrossed- 16 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 2Article 13A of the School Code.3    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 4superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 5principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 6student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 7a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 8calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 9that student has been determined to have made an explicit 10threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 11student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 12website through which the threat was made is a site that was 13accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 14was available to third parties who worked or studied within 15the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 16the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 17the safety and security of the threatened individual because 18of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 19student inside the school. 20    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 21authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 22lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 23equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 24personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 25without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 26search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General   SB1519 Engrossed- 17 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 2privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 3left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 4the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 5conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 6lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 7controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 8illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 9searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 10If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 11evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 12the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 13such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 14disciplinary action may be taken.

The board may by 2policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 3principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 4school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 5to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 6gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 7may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 8reasons. 9    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 10parents or guardians of a student along with a full statement 11of the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right 12to a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 13notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 14suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardians, 15the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 16review such action of the superintendent or principal, 17assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 18parents or guardians of the student may appear and discuss the 19suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 20officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 21a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 22its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 23hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 24appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 25subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 26decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or   SB1519 Engrossed- 22 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 2suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 3specific duration of the suspension.4    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 5and consequences available to school officials, school 6exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 7are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 8and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 9extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 10only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 11students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 12recommended that school officials consider forms of 13non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 14suspensions or expulsions. 15    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 16Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 17by which school administrators are required to suspend or 18expel students for particular behaviors.19    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 20used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 21pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 22students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 23subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 24other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 25a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 26School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve   SB1519 Engrossed- 23 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 2length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.3    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 4out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 5and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 6only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 7disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 8student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 9a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 10the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 11interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 12this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 13students, staff, or members of the school community" and 14"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 15operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 16basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 17(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 18available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 19exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 20shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 21address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 22exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 23suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 24Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 25of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 26interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that   SB1519 Engrossed- 24 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1there were no other appropriate and available interventions.2    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 3than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 4support services during the period of their suspension. For 5purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 6support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 7Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 8this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 9to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 10such appropriate and available services. 11    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 12appropriate and available support services.13    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 14re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 15expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 16consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 17Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 18and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 19suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 20alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 21Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 22    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 23suspended students, including those students suspended from 24the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 25school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 26equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of   SB1519 Engrossed- 25 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 2that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 3alternate transportation to school. 4    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 5subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 6subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be 7considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 8parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 9violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 10parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 11emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 12throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 13its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 14student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 15emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany 16the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 17representative or support person must comply with any rules of 18the school district's hearing process. If the representative 19or support person violates the rules or engages in behavior or 20advocacy that harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a 21witness, or anyone else in attendance at the hearing, the 22representative or support person may be prohibited from 23further participation in the hearing or proceeding. A 24suspension or expulsion proceeding under this subsection 25(b-35) must be conducted independently from any ongoing 26criminal investigation or proceeding, and an absence of   SB1519 Engrossed- 26 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1pending or possible criminal charges, criminal investigations, 2or proceedings may not be a factor in school disciplinary 3decisions.4    (b-40) During a suspension review hearing conducted under 5subsection (b) or an expulsion hearing conducted under 6subsection (a) that involves allegations of sexual violence by 7the student who is subject to discipline, neither the student 8nor his or her representative shall directly question nor have 9direct contact with the alleged victim. The student who is 10subject to discipline or his or her representative may, at the 11discretion and direction of the school board or its appointed 12hearing officer, suggest questions to be posed by the school 13board or its appointed hearing officer to the alleged victim. 14    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 15local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 16meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 17the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.18    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 19provide ongoing professional development to all school 20personnel, school board members, and school resource officers 21on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 22adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 23involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 24culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 25environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 26the appropriate and available supportive services for the   SB1519 Engrossed- 27 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 2developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 3positive and healthy school climates. 4    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 5time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 6case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 7brought one of the following objects to school, any 8school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 9that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 10expelled for a period of not less than one year:11        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 12    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 13    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 14    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 15    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 16    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period 17    under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the 18    superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may 19    be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.20        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon 21    regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other 22    object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily 23    harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in 24    subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). The expulsion 25    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 26    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination   SB1519 Engrossed- 28 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 2Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 3consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 4Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 5expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 6transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 7Article 13A of the School Code.8    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 9superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 10principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 11student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 12a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 13calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 14that student has been determined to have made an explicit 15threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 16student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 17website through which the threat was made is a site that was 18accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 19was available to third parties who worked or studied within 20the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 21the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 22the safety and security of the threatened individual because 23of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 24student inside the school. 25    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 26authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as   SB1519 Engrossed- 29 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 2equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 3personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 4without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 5search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 6Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 7privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 8left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 9the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 10conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 11lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 12controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 13illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 14searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 15If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 16evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 17the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 18such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 19disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also 20turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.21    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or 22expulsion from school and all school activities and a 23prohibition from being present on school grounds.24    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if 25a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any 26public or private school in this or any other state, the   SB1519 Engrossed- 30 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1student must complete the entire term of the suspension or 2expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A 3of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program 4under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the 5school district if there is no threat to the safety of students 6or staff in the alternative program. A school district that 7adopts a policy under this subsection (g) must include a 8provision allowing for consideration of any mitigating 9factors, including, but not limited to, a student's status as 10a parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 11violence, as defined in Article 26A. 12    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 13students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 14difficulties.15    (i) In this subsection (i), "municipal code violation" 16means the violation of a rule or regulation established by a 17local government authority, authorized by Section 1-2-1 of the 18Illinois Municipal Code.19    A student must may not be issued a monetary fine, or fee, 20ticket, or citation as a school-based disciplinary consequence 21or for a municipal code violation on school grounds during 22school hours or while taking school transportation by any 23person as a disciplinary consequence, though this shall not 24preclude requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, 25stolen, or damaged property.26    This subsection (i) does not modify school disciplinary   SB1519 Engrossed- 31 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1responses under this Section or Section 10-20.14 of this Code 2that existed before the effective date of this amendatory Act 3of the 104th General Assembly or responses to alleged 4delinquent or criminal conduct set forth in this Code, Article 5V of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, or the Criminal Code of 62012.

Findings and intent.5    (a) The General Assembly finds the following:6        (1) Public Act 99-456 prohibited schools from issuing 7    monetary fines or fees as a disciplinary consequence.8        (2) Public Act 100-810 prohibited schools from 9    referring truant minors to local public entities for the 10    purpose of issuing fines or fees as punishment for truancy 11    and required schools to document the provision of all 12    appropriate and available supportive services before 13    referring an individual having custody of a truant minor 14    to a local public entity.15        (3) Thousands of students have been referred to 16    municipalities for behaviors occurring on school grounds, 17    during school-related events, or while taking school 18    transportation.19        (4) Municipal tickets, citations, and ordinance 20    violations disproportionately impact students of color and 21    students with disabilities.22        (5) Municipal fines and fees associated with municipal 23    tickets, citations, and ordinance violations create 24    financial hardship for minors and their families.  SB1519 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 06247 LNS 16282 b1        (6) Municipal proceedings do not provide minors with 2    sufficient due process, confidentiality, or record 3    expungement protections.4        (7) In accordance with federal law and regulations, 5    Illinois schools provide data to the Civil Rights Data 6    Collection required by the Office for Civil Rights of the 7    U.S. Department of Education, including data on referrals 8    to law enforcement, and which disaggregates referrals 9    resulting in arrests, but does not disaggregate referrals 10    resulting in a municipal ticket, citation, or ordinance 11    violation.12    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to learn more 13about the prevalence of student referrals to law enforcement, 14particularly those resulting in municipal tickets, citations, 15and ordinance violations for behaviors occurring on school 16grounds, during school-related events, or while taking school 17transportation. It is not the intent of the General Assembly 18to modify current school disciplinary responses provided in 19the School Code or responses to alleged delinquent or criminal 20conduct as set forth in the School Code, the Juvenile Court Act 21of 1987, or the Criminal Code of 2012. 22    Section 5.
