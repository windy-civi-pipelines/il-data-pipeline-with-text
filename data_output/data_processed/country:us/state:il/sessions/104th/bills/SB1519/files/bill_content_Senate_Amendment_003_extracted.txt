If the board acts to expel a student, 22the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 23reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 24is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 25shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of   10400SB1519sam003- 10 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 2transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 3in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 4denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 5which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 6of students or staff in the alternative program. 7    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 8superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 9principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 10students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 11suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 12the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 13subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 14shall lie against them for such suspension.

A 24student must not be denied transfer because of the expulsion, 25except in cases in which such transfer is deemed to cause a 26threat to the safety of students or staff in the alternative   10400SB1519sam003- 21 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1program. 2    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 3superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 4principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 5students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 6suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 7the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 8subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 9shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 10policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 11principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 12school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 13to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 14gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 15may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 16reasons. 17    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 18parents or guardians of a student along with a full statement 19of the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right 20to a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 21notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 22suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardians, 23the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 24review such action of the superintendent or principal, 25assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 26parents or guardians of the student may appear and discuss the   10400SB1519sam003- 22 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 2officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 3a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 4its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 5hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 6appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 7subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 8decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 9misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 10suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 11specific duration of the suspension.12    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 13and consequences available to school officials, school 14exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 15are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 16and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 17extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 18only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 19students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 20recommended that school officials consider forms of 21non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 22suspensions or expulsions. 23    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 24Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 25by which school administrators are required to suspend or 26expel students for particular behaviors.  10400SB1519sam003- 23 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 2used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 3pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 4students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 5subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 6other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 7a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 8School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 9such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 10length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.11    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 12out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 13and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 14only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 15disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 16student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 17a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 18the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 19interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 20this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 21students, staff, or members of the school community" and 22"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 23operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 24basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 25(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 26available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been   10400SB1519sam003- 24 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 2shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 3address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 4exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 5suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 6Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 7of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 8interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 9there were no other appropriate and available interventions.10    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 11than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 12support services during the period of their suspension. For 13purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 14support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 15Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 16this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 17to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 18such appropriate and available services. 19    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 20appropriate and available support services.21    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 22re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 23expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 24consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 25Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 26and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are   10400SB1519sam003- 25 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 2alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 3Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 4    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 5suspended students, including those students suspended from 6the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 7school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 8equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 9a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 10that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 11alternate transportation to school. 12    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 13subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 14subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be 15considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 16parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 17violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 18parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 19emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 20throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 21its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 22student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 23emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany 24the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 25representative or support person must comply with any rules of 26the school district's hearing process. If the representative   10400SB1519sam003- 26 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1or support person violates the rules or engages in behavior or 2advocacy that harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a 3witness, or anyone else in attendance at the hearing, the 4representative or support person may be prohibited from 5further participation in the hearing or proceeding. A 6suspension or expulsion proceeding under this subsection 7(b-35) must be conducted independently from any ongoing 8criminal investigation or proceeding, and an absence of 9pending or possible criminal charges, criminal investigations, 10or proceedings may not be a factor in school disciplinary 11decisions.12    (b-40) During a suspension review hearing conducted under 13subsection (b) or an expulsion hearing conducted under 14subsection (a) that involves allegations of sexual violence by 15the student who is subject to discipline, neither the student 16nor his or her representative shall directly question nor have 17direct contact with the alleged victim. The student who is 18subject to discipline or his or her representative may, at the 19discretion and direction of the school board or its appointed 20hearing officer, suggest questions to be posed by the school 21board or its appointed hearing officer to the alleged victim. 22    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 23local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 24meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 25the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.26    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to   10400SB1519sam003- 27 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1provide ongoing professional development to all school 2personnel, school board members, and school resource officers 3on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 4adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 5involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 6culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 7environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 8the appropriate and available supportive services for the 9promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 10developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 11positive and healthy school climates. 12    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 13time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 14case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 15brought one of the following objects to school, any 16school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 17that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 18expelled for a period of not less than one year:19        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 20    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 21    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 22    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 23    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 24    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period 25    under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the 26    superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may   10400SB1519sam003- 28 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1    be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.2        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon 3    regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other 4    object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily 5    harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in 6    subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). The expulsion 7    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 8    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 9    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 10Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 11consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 12Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 13expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 14transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 15Article 13A of the School Code.16    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 17superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 18principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 19student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 20a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 21calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 22that student has been determined to have made an explicit 23threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 24student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 25website through which the threat was made is a site that was 26accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or   10400SB1519sam003- 29 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1was available to third parties who worked or studied within 2the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 3the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 4the safety and security of the threatened individual because 5of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 6student inside the school. 7    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 8authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 9lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 10equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 11personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 12without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 13search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 14Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 15privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 16left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 17the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 18conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 19lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 20controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 21illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 22searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 23If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 24evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 25the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 26such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and   10400SB1519sam003- 30 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also 2turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.3    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or 4expulsion from school and all school activities and a 5prohibition from being present on school grounds.6    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if 7a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any 8public or private school in this or any other state, the 9student must complete the entire term of the suspension or 10expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A 11of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program 12under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the 13school district if there is no threat to the safety of students 14or staff in the alternative program. A school district that 15adopts a policy under this subsection (g) must include a 16provision allowing for consideration of any mitigating 17factors, including, but not limited to, a student's status as 18a parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 19violence, as defined in Article 26A. 20    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 21students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 22difficulties.23    (i) In this subsection (i), "municipal code violation" 24means the violation of a rule or regulation established by a 25local government authority, authorized by Section 1-2-1 of the 26Illinois Municipal Code.  10400SB1519sam003- 31 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1    A student must may not be issued a monetary fine, or fee, 2ticket, or citation as a school-based disciplinary consequence 3or for a municipal code violation on school grounds during 4school hours or while taking school transportation by any 5person as a disciplinary consequence, though this shall not 6preclude requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, 7stolen, or damaged property.8    This subsection (i) does not modify school disciplinary 9responses under this Section or Section 10-20.14 of this Code 10that existed before the effective date of this amendatory Act 11of the 104th General Assembly or responses to alleged 12delinquent or criminal conduct set forth in this Code, Article 13V of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, or the Criminal Code of 142012. This subsection (i) does not apply to violations of 15traffic, boating, or fish and game laws. 16    (j) Subsections (a) through (i) of this Section shall 17apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter schools, 18special charter districts, and school districts organized 19under Article 34 of this Code. 20    (k) Through June 30, 2026, the expulsion of students 21enrolled in programs funded under Section 1C-2 of this Code is 22subject to the requirements under paragraph (7) of subsection 23(a) of Section 2-3.71 of this Code.24    (k-5) On and after July 1, 2026, the expulsion of children 25enrolled in programs funded under Section 15-25 of the 26Department of Early Childhood Act is subject to the   10400SB1519sam003- 32 -LRB104 06247 LNS 24671 a1requirements of paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 215-30 of the Department of Early Childhood Act. 3    (l) An in-school suspension program provided by a school 4district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may 5focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and 6positive interaction with other students and school personnel. 7A school district may employ a school social worker or a 8licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school 9suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12.10(Source: P.A. 102-466, eff. 7-1-25; 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 11102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-594, eff. 6-25-24; 103-896, eff. 128-9-24; revised 9-25-24.) 13    (105 ILCS 5/26-12)  (from Ch. 122, par. 26-12)14    Sec. 26-12.
