The Department 5shall establish, by rule, a method for verifying the accuracy 6of affidavits filed by applicants under this Section, and the 7Chief County Assessment Officer may conduct audits of any 8taxpayer claiming an exemption under this Section to verify 9that the taxpayer is eligible to receive the exemption. Each 10application shall contain or be verified by a written 11declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury. A 12taxpayer's signing a fraudulent application under this Act is 13perjury, as defined in Section 32-2 of the Criminal Code of 142012. The applications shall be clearly marked as applications 15for the Low-Income Senior Citizens Assessment Freeze Homestead 16Exemption and must contain a notice that any taxpayer who 17receives the exemption is subject to an audit by the Chief 18County Assessment Officer.19    Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, in 20counties having fewer than 3,000,000 inhabitants, if an 21applicant fails to file the application required by this 22Section in a timely manner and this failure to file is due to a 23mental or physical condition sufficiently severe so as to 24render the applicant incapable of filing the application in a 25timely manner, the Chief County Assessment Officer may extend 26the filing deadline for a period of 30 days after the applicant   10400HB3790sam003- 12 -LRB104 09716 HLH 27141 a1regains the capability to file the application, but in no case 2may the filing deadline be extended beyond 3 months of the 3original filing deadline.
