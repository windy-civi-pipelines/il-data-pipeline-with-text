In order to receive the extension provided in this 25paragraph, the applicant shall provide the Chief County 26Assessment Officer with a signed statement from the   10400HB3790sam002- 14 -LRB104 09716 HLH 27127 a1applicant's physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or 2physician assistant stating the nature and extent of the 3condition, and that, in the physician's, advanced practice 4registered nurse's, or physician assistant's opinion, the 5condition was so severe that it rendered the applicant 6incapable of filing the application in a timely manner.7    In counties having less than 3,000,000 inhabitants, if an 8applicant was denied an exemption in taxable year 1994 and the 9denial occurred due to an error on the part of an assessment 10official, or his or her agent or employee, then beginning in 11taxable year 1997 the applicant's base year, for purposes of 12determining the amount of the exemption, shall be 1993 rather 13than 1994. In addition, in taxable year 1997, the applicant's 14exemption shall also include an amount equal to (i) the amount 15of any exemption denied to the applicant in taxable year 1995 16as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, as the base year, 17(ii) the amount of any exemption denied to the applicant in 18taxable year 1996 as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, 19as the base year, and (iii) the amount of the exemption 20erroneously denied for taxable year 1994.21    For purposes of this Section, a person who will be 65 years 22of age during the current taxable year shall be eligible to 23apply for the homestead exemption during that taxable year. 24Application shall be made during the application period in 25effect for the county of his or her residence. 26    The Chief County Assessment Officer may determine the   10400HB3790sam002- 15 -LRB104 09716 HLH 27127 a1eligibility of a life care facility that qualifies as a 2cooperative to receive the benefits provided by this Section 3by use of an affidavit, application, visual inspection, 4questionnaire, or other reasonable method in order to insure 5that the tax savings resulting from the exemption are credited 6by the management firm to the apportioned tax liability of 7each qualifying resident.
