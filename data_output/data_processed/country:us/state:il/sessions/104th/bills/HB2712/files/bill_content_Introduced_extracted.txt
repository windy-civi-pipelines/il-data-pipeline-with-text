Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 24Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 25the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's 26existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than   HB2712- 11 -LRB104 10288 AAS 20362 b12.5%. 2    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 3public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 4cost for financing set at the large public utility's 5determined rate for allowance for funds used during 6construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax 7gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 8was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 9has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 10the time the rates are implemented in the large public 11utility's next rate case.12    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 13utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 14for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 15was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 16has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 17the time the rates are implemented in the large public 18utility's next rate case.19    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 20public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 21acquisition of water or sewer utilities. Any petitions filed 22with the Commission related to the acquisitions described in 23this Section, including petitions seeking approvals or 24certificates required by this Act, shall be deemed approved 25unless the Commission issues its final order within 11 months 26after the date the large public utility filed its initial   HB2712- 12 -LRB104 10288 AAS 20362 b1petition.

If 23the large public utility recommends a lesser rate, it shall 24submit to the Commission its proposed rate schedule and the 25proposed final tariff group for the acquired water or sewer 26utility. The Commission's approved district or tariff group or   HB2712- 9 -LRB104 10288 AAS 20362 b1rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's 2recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 3contrary to the public interest.4    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new 5rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 6next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer 7utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 8district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 9lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and 10approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided, 11that, if the application of such rates of the large public 12utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 13using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 14total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 15utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 16the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 17the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 18reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 19results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 20or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 21sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 22latest median household income as reported by the United 23States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 24county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 25potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained, 26a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned.

This rate tariff shall not 16be deemed to violate this Act including, but not limited to, 17Section 9-101 of this Act. In the acquiring large public 18utility's 2 rate cases after an acquisition, but in no 19subsequent rate case, the large public utility may file a rate 20tariff for a water or sewer utility acquired under this 21Section that establishes lesser rates than the district or 22tariff group into which the water or sewer utility is to be 23combined. Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 24Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 25the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's 26existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than   HB2712- 11 -LRB104 10288 AAS 20362 b12.5%. 2    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 3public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 4cost for financing set at the large public utility's 5determined rate for allowance for funds used during 6construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax 7gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 8was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 9has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 10the time the rates are implemented in the large public 11utility's next rate case.12    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 13utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 14for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 15was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 16has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 17the time the rates are implemented in the large public 18utility's next rate case.19    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 20public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 21acquisition of water or sewer utilities.
