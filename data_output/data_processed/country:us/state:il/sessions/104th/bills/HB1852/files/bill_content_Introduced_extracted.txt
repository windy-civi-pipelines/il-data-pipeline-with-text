The General 6Assembly finds that the minimum live racing guarantees 7contained in subsections (e-1), (e-2), and (e-3) are in the 8best interest of the sport of horse racing, and that such 9guarantees may only be reduced in the calendar year in which 10they will be conducted in the limited circumstances described 11in this subsection. The Board may decrease the number of 12racing days without affecting an organization licensee's 13ability to conduct gaming pursuant to an organization gaming 14license issued under the Illinois Gambling Act only if the 15Board determines, after notice and hearing, that: 16        (i) a decrease is necessary to maintain a sufficient 17    number of betting interests per race to ensure the 18    integrity of racing; 19        (ii) there are unsafe track conditions due to weather 20    or acts of God;21        (iii) there is an agreement between an organization 22    licensee and the breed association that is applicable to 23    the involved live racing guarantee, such association 24    representing either the largest number of thoroughbred 25    owners and trainers or the largest number of standardbred 26    owners, trainers and drivers who race horses at the   HB1852- 18 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    involved organization licensee's racing meeting, so long 2    as the agreement does not compromise the integrity of the 3    sport of horse racing; or4        (iv) the horse population or purse levels are 5    insufficient to provide the number of racing opportunities 6    otherwise required in this Act. 7    In decreasing the number of racing dates in accordance 8with this subsection, the Board shall hold a hearing and shall 9provide the public and all interested parties notice and an 10opportunity to be heard. The Board shall accept testimony from 11all interested parties, including any association representing 12owners, trainers, jockeys, or drivers who will be affected by 13the decrease in racing dates. The Board shall provide a 14written explanation of the reasons for the decrease and the 15Board's findings. The written explanation shall include a 16listing and content of all communication between any party and 17any Illinois Racing Board member or staff that does not take 18place at a public meeting of the Board. 19    (e-5) In reviewing an application for the purpose of 20granting an organization license consistent with the best 21interests of the public and the sport of horse racing, the 22Board shall consider: 23        (1) the character, reputation, experience, and 24    financial integrity of the applicant and of any other 25    separate person that either: 26            (i) controls the applicant, directly or   HB1852- 19 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1        indirectly, or 2            (ii) is controlled, directly or indirectly, by 3        that applicant or by a person who controls, directly 4        or indirectly, that applicant; 5        (2) the applicant's facilities or proposed facilities 6    for conducting horse racing; 7        (3) the total revenue without regard to Section 32.1 8    to be derived by the State and horsemen from the 9    applicant's conducting a race meeting; 10        (4) the applicant's good faith affirmative action plan 11    to recruit, train, and upgrade minorities in all 12    employment classifications; 13        (5) the applicant's financial ability to purchase and 14    maintain adequate liability and casualty insurance; 15        (6) the applicant's proposed and prior year's 16    promotional and marketing activities and expenditures of 17    the applicant associated with those activities; 18        (7) an agreement, if any, among organization licensees 19    as provided in subsection (b) of Section 21 of this Act; 20    and 21        (8) the extent to which the applicant exceeds or meets 22    other standards for the issuance of an organization 23    license that the Board shall adopt by rule.24    In granting organization licenses and allocating dates for 25horse race meetings, the Board shall have discretion to 26determine an overall schedule, including required simulcasts   HB1852- 20 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1of Illinois races by host tracks that will, in its judgment, be 2conducive to the best interests of the public and the sport of 3horse racing.4    (e-10) The Illinois Administrative Procedure Act shall 5apply to administrative procedures of the Board under this Act 6for the granting of an organization license, except that (1) 7notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 810-40 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding 9cross-examination, the Board may prescribe rules limiting the 10right of an applicant or participant in any proceeding to 11award an organization license to conduct cross-examination of 12witnesses at that proceeding where that cross-examination 13would unduly obstruct the timely award of an organization 14license under subsection (e) of Section 20 of this Act; (2) the 15provisions of Section 10-45 of the Illinois Administrative 16Procedure Act regarding proposals for decision are excluded 17under this Act; (3) notwithstanding the provisions of 18subsection (a) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois Administrative 19Procedure Act regarding ex parte communications, the Board may 20prescribe rules allowing ex parte communications with 21applicants or participants in a proceeding to award an 22organization license where conducting those communications 23would be in the best interest of racing, provided all those 24communications are made part of the record of that proceeding 25pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois 26Administrative Procedure Act; (4) the provisions of Section   HB1852- 21 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b114a of this Act and the rules of the Board promulgated under 2that Section shall apply instead of the provisions of Article 310 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding 4administrative law judges; and (5) the provisions of 5subsection (d) of Section 10-65 of the Illinois Administrative 6Procedure Act that prevent summary suspension of a license 7pending revocation or other action shall not apply.8    (f) The Board may allot racing dates to an organization 9licensee for more than one calendar year but for no more than 3 10successive calendar years in advance, provided that the Board 11shall review such allotment for more than one calendar year 12prior to each year for which such allotment has been made. The 13granting of an organization license to a person constitutes a 14privilege to conduct a horse race meeting under the provisions 15of this Act, and no person granted an organization license 16shall be deemed to have a vested interest, property right, or 17future expectation to receive an organization license in any 18subsequent year as a result of the granting of an organization 19license. Organization licenses shall be subject to revocation 20if the organization licensee has violated any provision of 21this Act or the rules and regulations promulgated under this 22Act or has been convicted of a crime or has failed to disclose 23or has stated falsely any information called for in the 24application for an organization license. Any organization 25license revocation proceeding shall be in accordance with 26Section 16 regarding suspension and revocation of occupation   HB1852- 22 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1licenses.2    (f-5) If, (i) an applicant does not file an acceptance of 3the racing dates awarded by the Board as required under part 4(1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20, or (ii) an 5organization licensee has its license suspended or revoked 6under this Act, the Board, upon conducting an emergency 7hearing as provided for in this Act, may reaward on an 8emergency basis pursuant to rules established by the Board, 9racing dates not accepted or the racing dates associated with 10any suspension or revocation period to one or more 11organization licensees, new applicants, or any combination 12thereof, upon terms and conditions that the Board determines 13are in the best interest of racing, provided, the organization 14licensees or new applicants receiving the awarded racing dates 15file an acceptance of those reawarded racing dates as required 16under paragraph (1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20 and 17comply with the other provisions of this Act. The Illinois 18Administrative Procedure Act shall not apply to the 19administrative procedures of the Board in conducting the 20emergency hearing and the reallocation of racing dates on an 21emergency basis.22    (g) (Blank).23    (h) The Board shall send the applicant a copy of its 24formally executed order by certified mail addressed to the 25applicant at the address stated in his application, which 26notice shall be mailed within 5 days of the date the formal   HB1852- 23 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1order is executed.2    Each applicant notified shall, within 10 days after 3receipt of the final executed order of the Board awarding 4racing dates: 5        (1) file with the Board an acceptance of such award in 6    the form prescribed by the Board; 7        (2) pay to the Board an additional amount equal to 8    $110 for each racing date awarded; and 9        (3) file with the Board the bonds required in Sections 10    21 and 25 at least 20 days prior to the first day of each 11    race meeting.12Upon compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), 13and (3) of this subsection (h), the applicant shall be issued 14an organization license.15    If any applicant fails to comply with this Section or 16fails to pay the organization license fees herein provided, no 17organization license shall be issued to such applicant.18(Source: P.A. 101-31, eff. 6-28-19.) 19    (230 ILCS 5/26)  (from Ch. 8, par. 37-26)20    Sec. 26. Wagering. 21    (a) Any licensee may conduct and supervise the pari-mutuel 22system of wagering, as defined in Section 3.12 of this Act, on 23horse races conducted by an Illinois organization licensee or 24conducted at a racetrack located in another state or country 25in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 26 of this Act.   HB1852- 24 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1Subject to the prior consent of the Board, licensees may 2supplement any pari-mutuel pool in order to guarantee a 3minimum distribution. Such pari-mutuel method of wagering 4shall not, under any circumstances if conducted under the 5provisions of this Act, be held or construed to be unlawful, 6other statutes of this State to the contrary notwithstanding. 7Subject to rules for advance wagering promulgated by the 8Board, any licensee may accept wagers in advance of the day the 9race wagered upon occurs.10    (b) Except for those gaming activities for which a license 11is obtained and authorized under the Illinois Lottery Law, the 12Charitable Games Act, the Raffles and Poker Runs Act, or the 13Illinois Gambling Act, no other method of betting, pool 14making, wagering or gambling shall be used or permitted by the 15licensee. Each licensee may retain, subject to the payment of 16all applicable taxes and purses, an amount not to exceed 17% of 17all money wagered under subsection (a) of this Section, except 18as may otherwise be permitted under this Act.19    (b-5) An individual may place a wager under the 20pari-mutuel system from any licensed location authorized under 21this Act provided that wager is electronically recorded in the 22manner described in Section 3.12 of this Act. Any wager made 23electronically by an individual while physically on the 24premises of a licensee shall be deemed to have been made at the 25premises of that licensee.26    (c) (Blank).  HB1852- 25 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    (c-5) The sum held by any licensee for payment of 2outstanding pari-mutuel tickets, if unclaimed prior to 3December 31 of the next year, shall be retained by the licensee 4for payment of such tickets until that date. Within 10 days 5thereafter, the balance of such sum remaining unclaimed, less 6any uncashed supplements contributed by such licensee for the 7purpose of guaranteeing minimum distributions of any 8pari-mutuel pool, shall be evenly distributed to the purse 9account of the organization licensee and the organization 10licensee, except that the balance of the sum of all 11outstanding pari-mutuel tickets generated from simulcast 12wagering and inter-track wagering by an organization licensee 13located in a county with a population in excess of 230,000 and 14borders the Mississippi River or any licensee that derives its 15license from that organization licensee shall be evenly 16distributed to the purse account of the organization licensee 17and the organization licensee.18    (d) A pari-mutuel ticket shall be honored until December 1931 of the next calendar year, and the licensee shall pay the 20same and may charge the amount thereof against unpaid money 21similarly accumulated on account of pari-mutuel tickets not 22presented for payment.23    (e) No licensee shall knowingly permit any minor, other 24than an employee of such licensee or an owner, trainer, 25jockey, driver, or employee thereof, to be admitted during a 26racing program unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, or   HB1852- 26 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1any minor to be a patron of the pari-mutuel system of wagering 2conducted or supervised by it. The admission of any 3unaccompanied minor, other than an employee of the licensee or 4an owner, trainer, jockey, driver, or employee thereof at a 5race track is a Class C misdemeanor.6    (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Act, an 7organization licensee may contract with an entity in another 8state or country to permit any legal wagering entity in 9another state or country to accept wagers solely within such 10other state or country on races conducted by the organization 11licensee in this State. Beginning January 1, 2000, these 12wagers shall not be subject to State taxation. Until January 131, 2000, when the out-of-State entity conducts a pari-mutuel 14pool separate from the organization licensee, a privilege tax 15equal to 7 1/2% of all monies received by the organization 16licensee from entities in other states or countries pursuant 17to such contracts is imposed on the organization licensee, and 18such privilege tax shall be remitted to the Department of 19Revenue within 48 hours of receipt of the moneys from the 20simulcast. When the out-of-State entity conducts a combined 21pari-mutuel pool with the organization licensee, the tax shall 22be 10% of all monies received by the organization licensee 23with 25% of the receipts from this 10% tax to be distributed to 24the county in which the race was conducted.25    An organization licensee may permit one or more of its 26races to be utilized for pari-mutuel wagering at one or more   HB1852- 27 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1locations in other states and may transmit audio and visual 2signals of races the organization licensee conducts to one or 3more locations outside the State or country and may also 4permit pari-mutuel pools in other states or countries to be 5combined with its gross or net wagering pools or with wagering 6pools established by other states.7    (g) A host track may accept interstate simulcast wagers on 8horse races conducted in other states or countries and shall 9control the number of signals and types of breeds of racing in 10its simulcast program, subject to the disapproval of the 11Board. The Board may prohibit a simulcast program only if it 12finds that the simulcast program is clearly adverse to the 13integrity of racing. The host track simulcast program shall 14include the signal of live racing of all organization 15licensees. All non-host licensees and advance deposit wagering 16licensees shall carry the signal of and accept wagers on live 17racing of all organization licensees. Advance deposit wagering 18licensees shall not be permitted to accept out-of-state wagers 19on any Illinois signal provided pursuant to this Section 20without the approval and consent of the organization licensee 21providing the signal. For one year after August 15, 2014 (the 22effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host licensees may 23carry the host track simulcast program and shall accept wagers 24on all races included as part of the simulcast program of horse 25races conducted at race tracks located within North America 26upon which wagering is permitted. For a period of one year   HB1852- 28 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1after August 15, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 298-968), on horse races conducted at race tracks located 3outside of North America, non-host licensees may accept wagers 4on all races included as part of the simulcast program upon 5which wagering is permitted. Beginning August 15, 2015 (one 6year after the effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host 7licensees may carry the host track simulcast program and shall 8accept wagers on all races included as part of the simulcast 9program upon which wagering is permitted. All organization 10licensees shall provide their live signal to all advance 11deposit wagering licensees for a simulcast commission fee not 12to exceed 6% of the advance deposit wagering licensee's 13Illinois handle on the organization licensee's signal without 14prior approval by the Board. The Board may adopt rules under 15which it may permit simulcast commission fees in excess of 6%. 16The Board shall adopt rules limiting the interstate commission 17fees charged to an advance deposit wagering licensee. The 18Board shall adopt rules regarding advance deposit wagering on 19interstate simulcast races that shall reflect, among other 20things, the General Assembly's desire to maximize revenues to 21the State, horsemen purses, and organization licensees. 22However, organization licensees providing live signals 23pursuant to the requirements of this subsection (g) may 24petition the Board to withhold their live signals from an 25advance deposit wagering licensee if the organization licensee 26discovers and the Board finds reputable or credible   HB1852- 29 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1information that the advance deposit wagering licensee is 2under investigation by another state or federal governmental 3agency, the advance deposit wagering licensee's license has 4been suspended in another state, or the advance deposit 5wagering licensee's license is in revocation proceedings in 6another state. The organization licensee's provision of their 7live signal to an advance deposit wagering licensee under this 8subsection (g) pertains to wagers placed from within Illinois. 9Advance deposit wagering licensees may place advance deposit 10wagering terminals at wagering facilities as a convenience to 11customers. The advance deposit wagering licensee shall not 12charge or collect any fee from purses for the placement of the 13advance deposit wagering terminals. The costs and expenses of 14the host track and non-host licensees associated with 15interstate simulcast wagering, other than the interstate 16commission fee, shall be borne by the host track and all 17non-host licensees incurring these costs. The interstate 18commission fee shall not exceed 5% of Illinois handle on the 19interstate simulcast race or races without prior approval of 20the Board. The Board shall promulgate rules under which it may 21permit interstate commission fees in excess of 5%. The 22interstate commission fee and other fees charged by the 23sending racetrack, including, but not limited to, satellite 24decoder fees, shall be uniformly applied to the host track and 25all non-host licensees.26    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an   HB1852- 30 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 2association representing the largest number of owners, 3trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 4that organization licensee's racing meeting, may maintain a 5system whereby advance deposit wagering may take place or an 6organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 7association representing the largest number of owners, 8trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 9that organization licensee's racing meeting, may contract with 10another person to carry out a system of advance deposit 11wagering. Such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Only 12with respect to an appeal to the Board that consent for an 13organization licensee that maintains its own advance deposit 14wagering system is being unreasonably withheld, the Board 15shall issue a final order within 30 days after initiation of 16the appeal, and the organization licensee's advance deposit 17wagering system may remain operational during that 30-day 18period. The actions of any organization licensee who conducts 19advance deposit wagering or any person who has a contract with 20an organization licensee to conduct advance deposit wagering 21who conducts advance deposit wagering on or after January 1, 222013 and prior to June 7, 2013 (the effective date of Public 23Act 98-18) taken in reliance on the changes made to this 24subsection (g) by Public Act 98-18 are hereby validated, 25provided payment of all applicable pari-mutuel taxes are 26remitted to the Board. All advance deposit wagers placed from   HB1852- 31 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1within Illinois must be placed through a Board-approved 2advance deposit wagering licensee; no other entity may accept 3an advance deposit wager from a person within Illinois. All 4advance deposit wagering is subject to any rules adopted by 5the Board. The Board may adopt rules necessary to regulate 6advance deposit wagering through the use of emergency 7rulemaking in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Illinois 8Administrative Procedure Act. The General Assembly finds that 9the adoption of rules to regulate advance deposit wagering is 10deemed an emergency and necessary for the public interest, 11safety, and welfare. An advance deposit wagering licensee may 12retain all moneys as agreed to by contract with an 13organization licensee. Any moneys retained by the organization 14licensee from advance deposit wagering, not including moneys 15retained by the advance deposit wagering licensee, shall be 16paid 50% to the organization licensee's purse account and 50% 17to the organization licensee. With the exception of any 18organization licensee that is owned by a publicly traded 19company that is incorporated in a state other than Illinois 20and advance deposit wagering licensees under contract with 21such organization licensees, organization licensees that 22maintain advance deposit wagering systems and advance deposit 23wagering licensees that contract with organization licensees 24shall provide sufficiently detailed monthly accountings to the 25horsemen association representing the largest number of 26owners, trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race   HB1852- 32 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1horses at that organization licensee's racing meeting so that 2the horsemen association, as an interested party, can confirm 3the accuracy of the amounts paid to the purse account at the 4horsemen association's affiliated organization licensee from 5advance deposit wagering. If more than one breed races at the 6same race track facility, then the 50% of the moneys to be paid 7to an organization licensee's purse account shall be allocated 8among all organization licensees' purse accounts operating at 9that race track facility proportionately based on the actual 10number of host days that the Board grants to that breed at that 11race track facility in the current calendar year. To the 12extent any fees from advance deposit wagering conducted in 13Illinois for wagers in Illinois or other states have been 14placed in escrow or otherwise withheld from wagers pending a 15determination of the legality of advance deposit wagering, no 16action shall be brought to declare such wagers or the 17disbursement of any fees previously escrowed illegal.18        (1) Between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. an 19    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 20    may supplement the host track simulcast program with 21    additional simulcast races or race programs, provided that 22    between January 1 and the third Friday in February of any 23    year, inclusive, if no live thoroughbred racing is 24    occurring in Illinois during this period, only 25    thoroughbred races may be used for supplemental interstate 26    simulcast purposes. The Board shall withhold approval for   HB1852- 33 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    a supplemental interstate simulcast only if it finds that 2    the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 3    racing. A supplemental interstate simulcast may be 4    transmitted from an inter-track wagering licensee to its 5    affiliated non-host licensees. The interstate commission 6    fee for a supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid 7    by the non-host licensee and its affiliated non-host 8    licensees receiving the simulcast.9        (2) Between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. an 10    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 11    may receive supplemental interstate simulcasts only with 12    the consent of the host track, except when the Board finds 13    that the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 14    racing. Consent granted under this paragraph (2) to any 15    inter-track wagering licensee shall be deemed consent to 16    all non-host licensees. The interstate commission fee for 17    the supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid by all 18    participating non-host licensees.19        (3) Each licensee conducting interstate simulcast 20    wagering may retain, subject to the payment of all 21    applicable taxes and the purses, an amount not to exceed 22    17% of all money wagered. If any licensee conducts the 23    pari-mutuel system wagering on races conducted at 24    racetracks in another state or country, each such race or 25    race program shall be considered a separate racing day for 26    the purpose of determining the daily handle and computing   HB1852- 34 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    the privilege tax of that daily handle as provided in 2    subsection (a) of Section 27. Until January 1, 2000, from 3    the sums permitted to be retained pursuant to this 4    subsection, each inter-track wagering location licensee 5    shall pay 1% of the pari-mutuel handle wagered on 6    simulcast wagering to the Horse Racing Tax Allocation 7    Fund, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of 8    paragraph (11) of subsection (h) of Section 26 of this 9    Act.10        (4) A licensee who receives an interstate simulcast 11    may combine its gross or net pools with pools at the 12    sending racetracks pursuant to rules established by the 13    Board. All licensees combining their gross pools at a 14    sending racetrack shall adopt the takeout percentages of 15    the sending racetrack. A licensee may also establish a 16    separate pool and takeout structure for wagering purposes 17    on races conducted at race tracks outside of the State of 18    Illinois. The licensee may permit pari-mutuel wagers 19    placed in other states or countries to be combined with 20    its gross or net wagering pools or other wagering pools.21        (5) After the payment of the interstate commission fee 22    (except for the interstate commission fee on a 23    supplemental interstate simulcast, which shall be paid by 24    the host track and by each non-host licensee through the 25    host track) and all applicable State and local taxes, 26    except as provided in subsection (g) of Section 27 of this   HB1852- 35 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    Act, the remainder of moneys retained from simulcast 2    wagering pursuant to this subsection (g), and Section 26.2 3    shall be divided as follows:4            (A) For interstate simulcast wagers made at a host 5        track, 50% to the host track and 50% to purses at the 6        host track.7            (B) For wagers placed on interstate simulcast 8        races, supplemental simulcasts as defined in 9        subparagraphs (1) and (2), and separately pooled races 10        conducted outside of the State of Illinois made at a 11        non-host licensee, 25% to the host track, 25% to the 12        non-host licensee, and 50% to the purses at the host 13        track.14        (6) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the 15    contrary, non-host licensees who derive their licenses 16    from a track located in a county with a population in 17    excess of 230,000 and that borders the Mississippi River 18    may receive supplemental interstate simulcast races at all 19    times subject to Board approval, which shall be withheld 20    only upon a finding that a supplemental interstate 21    simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of racing.22        (7) Effective January 1, 2017, notwithstanding any 23    provision of this Act to the contrary, after payment of 24    all applicable State and local taxes and interstate 25    commission fees, non-host licensees who derive their 26    licenses from a track located in a county with a   HB1852- 36 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    population in excess of 230,000 and that borders the 2    Mississippi River shall retain 50% of the retention from 3    interstate simulcast wagers and shall pay 50% to purses at 4    the track from which the non-host licensee derives its 5    license.6        (7.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 7    to the contrary, if no standardbred racing is conducted at 8    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar 9    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, all moneys 10    derived by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and 11    inter-track wagering that (1) are to be used for purses 12    and (2) are generated between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 13    6:30 a.m. during that calendar year shall be paid as 14    follows:15            (A) If the licensee that conducts horse racing at 16        that racetrack requests from the Board at least as 17        many racing dates as were conducted in calendar year 18        2000, 80% shall be paid to its thoroughbred purse 19        account; and20            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 21        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund and shall 22        be paid to purses for standardbred races for Illinois 23        conceived and foaled horses conducted at any county 24        fairgrounds. The moneys deposited into the Fund 25        pursuant to this subparagraph (B) shall be deposited 26        within 2 weeks after the day they were generated,   HB1852- 37 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1        shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any other 2        moneys paid to standardbred purses under this Act, and 3        shall not be commingled with other moneys paid into 4        that Fund.

The General 6Assembly finds that the minimum live racing guarantees 7contained in subsections (e-1), (e-2), and (e-3) are in the 8best interest of the sport of horse racing, and that such 9guarantees may only be reduced in the calendar year in which 10they will be conducted in the limited circumstances described 11in this subsection. The Board may decrease the number of 12racing days without affecting an organization licensee's 13ability to conduct gaming pursuant to an organization gaming 14license issued under the Illinois Gambling Act only if the 15Board determines, after notice and hearing, that: 16        (i) a decrease is necessary to maintain a sufficient 17    number of betting interests per race to ensure the 18    integrity of racing; 19        (ii) there are unsafe track conditions due to weather 20    or acts of God;21        (iii) there is an agreement between an organization 22    licensee and the breed association that is applicable to 23    the involved live racing guarantee, such association 24    representing either the largest number of thoroughbred 25    owners and trainers or the largest number of standardbred 26    owners, trainers and drivers who race horses at the   HB1852- 18 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    involved organization licensee's racing meeting, so long 2    as the agreement does not compromise the integrity of the 3    sport of horse racing; or4        (iv) the horse population or purse levels are 5    insufficient to provide the number of racing opportunities 6    otherwise required in this Act. 7    In decreasing the number of racing dates in accordance 8with this subsection, the Board shall hold a hearing and shall 9provide the public and all interested parties notice and an 10opportunity to be heard. The Board shall accept testimony from 11all interested parties, including any association representing 12owners, trainers, jockeys, or drivers who will be affected by 13the decrease in racing dates. The Board shall provide a 14written explanation of the reasons for the decrease and the 15Board's findings. The written explanation shall include a 16listing and content of all communication between any party and 17any Illinois Racing Board member or staff that does not take 18place at a public meeting of the Board. 19    (e-5) In reviewing an application for the purpose of 20granting an organization license consistent with the best 21interests of the public and the sport of horse racing, the 22Board shall consider: 23        (1) the character, reputation, experience, and 24    financial integrity of the applicant and of any other 25    separate person that either: 26            (i) controls the applicant, directly or   HB1852- 19 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1        indirectly, or 2            (ii) is controlled, directly or indirectly, by 3        that applicant or by a person who controls, directly 4        or indirectly, that applicant; 5        (2) the applicant's facilities or proposed facilities 6    for conducting horse racing; 7        (3) the total revenue without regard to Section 32.1 8    to be derived by the State and horsemen from the 9    applicant's conducting a race meeting; 10        (4) the applicant's good faith affirmative action plan 11    to recruit, train, and upgrade minorities in all 12    employment classifications; 13        (5) the applicant's financial ability to purchase and 14    maintain adequate liability and casualty insurance; 15        (6) the applicant's proposed and prior year's 16    promotional and marketing activities and expenditures of 17    the applicant associated with those activities; 18        (7) an agreement, if any, among organization licensees 19    as provided in subsection (b) of Section 21 of this Act; 20    and 21        (8) the extent to which the applicant exceeds or meets 22    other standards for the issuance of an organization 23    license that the Board shall adopt by rule.24    In granting organization licenses and allocating dates for 25horse race meetings, the Board shall have discretion to 26determine an overall schedule, including required simulcasts   HB1852- 20 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1of Illinois races by host tracks that will, in its judgment, be 2conducive to the best interests of the public and the sport of 3horse racing.4    (e-10) The Illinois Administrative Procedure Act shall 5apply to administrative procedures of the Board under this Act 6for the granting of an organization license, except that (1) 7notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 810-40 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding 9cross-examination, the Board may prescribe rules limiting the 10right of an applicant or participant in any proceeding to 11award an organization license to conduct cross-examination of 12witnesses at that proceeding where that cross-examination 13would unduly obstruct the timely award of an organization 14license under subsection (e) of Section 20 of this Act; (2) the 15provisions of Section 10-45 of the Illinois Administrative 16Procedure Act regarding proposals for decision are excluded 17under this Act; (3) notwithstanding the provisions of 18subsection (a) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois Administrative 19Procedure Act regarding ex parte communications, the Board may 20prescribe rules allowing ex parte communications with 21applicants or participants in a proceeding to award an 22organization license where conducting those communications 23would be in the best interest of racing, provided all those 24communications are made part of the record of that proceeding 25pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 10-60 of the Illinois 26Administrative Procedure Act; (4) the provisions of Section   HB1852- 21 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b114a of this Act and the rules of the Board promulgated under 2that Section shall apply instead of the provisions of Article 310 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act regarding 4administrative law judges; and (5) the provisions of 5subsection (d) of Section 10-65 of the Illinois Administrative 6Procedure Act that prevent summary suspension of a license 7pending revocation or other action shall not apply.8    (f) The Board may allot racing dates to an organization 9licensee for more than one calendar year but for no more than 3 10successive calendar years in advance, provided that the Board 11shall review such allotment for more than one calendar year 12prior to each year for which such allotment has been made. The 13granting of an organization license to a person constitutes a 14privilege to conduct a horse race meeting under the provisions 15of this Act, and no person granted an organization license 16shall be deemed to have a vested interest, property right, or 17future expectation to receive an organization license in any 18subsequent year as a result of the granting of an organization 19license. Organization licenses shall be subject to revocation 20if the organization licensee has violated any provision of 21this Act or the rules and regulations promulgated under this 22Act or has been convicted of a crime or has failed to disclose 23or has stated falsely any information called for in the 24application for an organization license. Any organization 25license revocation proceeding shall be in accordance with 26Section 16 regarding suspension and revocation of occupation   HB1852- 22 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1licenses.2    (f-5) If, (i) an applicant does not file an acceptance of 3the racing dates awarded by the Board as required under part 4(1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20, or (ii) an 5organization licensee has its license suspended or revoked 6under this Act, the Board, upon conducting an emergency 7hearing as provided for in this Act, may reaward on an 8emergency basis pursuant to rules established by the Board, 9racing dates not accepted or the racing dates associated with 10any suspension or revocation period to one or more 11organization licensees, new applicants, or any combination 12thereof, upon terms and conditions that the Board determines 13are in the best interest of racing, provided, the organization 14licensees or new applicants receiving the awarded racing dates 15file an acceptance of those reawarded racing dates as required 16under paragraph (1) of subsection (h) of this Section 20 and 17comply with the other provisions of this Act. The Illinois 18Administrative Procedure Act shall not apply to the 19administrative procedures of the Board in conducting the 20emergency hearing and the reallocation of racing dates on an 21emergency basis.22    (g) (Blank).23    (h) The Board shall send the applicant a copy of its 24formally executed order by certified mail addressed to the 25applicant at the address stated in his application, which 26notice shall be mailed within 5 days of the date the formal   HB1852- 23 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1order is executed.2    Each applicant notified shall, within 10 days after 3receipt of the final executed order of the Board awarding 4racing dates: 5        (1) file with the Board an acceptance of such award in 6    the form prescribed by the Board; 7        (2) pay to the Board an additional amount equal to 8    $110 for each racing date awarded; and 9        (3) file with the Board the bonds required in Sections 10    21 and 25 at least 20 days prior to the first day of each 11    race meeting.12Upon compliance with the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), 13and (3) of this subsection (h), the applicant shall be issued 14an organization license.15    If any applicant fails to comply with this Section or 16fails to pay the organization license fees herein provided, no 17organization license shall be issued to such applicant.18(Source: P.A. 101-31, eff. 6-28-19.) 19    (230 ILCS 5/26)  (from Ch. 8, par. 37-26)20    Sec. 26. Wagering. 21    (a) Any licensee may conduct and supervise the pari-mutuel 22system of wagering, as defined in Section 3.12 of this Act, on 23horse races conducted by an Illinois organization licensee or 24conducted at a racetrack located in another state or country 25in accordance with subsection (g) of Section 26 of this Act.   HB1852- 24 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1Subject to the prior consent of the Board, licensees may 2supplement any pari-mutuel pool in order to guarantee a 3minimum distribution. Such pari-mutuel method of wagering 4shall not, under any circumstances if conducted under the 5provisions of this Act, be held or construed to be unlawful, 6other statutes of this State to the contrary notwithstanding. 7Subject to rules for advance wagering promulgated by the 8Board, any licensee may accept wagers in advance of the day the 9race wagered upon occurs.10    (b) Except for those gaming activities for which a license 11is obtained and authorized under the Illinois Lottery Law, the 12Charitable Games Act, the Raffles and Poker Runs Act, or the 13Illinois Gambling Act, no other method of betting, pool 14making, wagering or gambling shall be used or permitted by the 15licensee. Each licensee may retain, subject to the payment of 16all applicable taxes and purses, an amount not to exceed 17% of 17all money wagered under subsection (a) of this Section, except 18as may otherwise be permitted under this Act.19    (b-5) An individual may place a wager under the 20pari-mutuel system from any licensed location authorized under 21this Act provided that wager is electronically recorded in the 22manner described in Section 3.12 of this Act. Any wager made 23electronically by an individual while physically on the 24premises of a licensee shall be deemed to have been made at the 25premises of that licensee.26    (c) (Blank).  HB1852- 25 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    (c-5) The sum held by any licensee for payment of 2outstanding pari-mutuel tickets, if unclaimed prior to 3December 31 of the next year, shall be retained by the licensee 4for payment of such tickets until that date. Within 10 days 5thereafter, the balance of such sum remaining unclaimed, less 6any uncashed supplements contributed by such licensee for the 7purpose of guaranteeing minimum distributions of any 8pari-mutuel pool, shall be evenly distributed to the purse 9account of the organization licensee and the organization 10licensee, except that the balance of the sum of all 11outstanding pari-mutuel tickets generated from simulcast 12wagering and inter-track wagering by an organization licensee 13located in a county with a population in excess of 230,000 and 14borders the Mississippi River or any licensee that derives its 15license from that organization licensee shall be evenly 16distributed to the purse account of the organization licensee 17and the organization licensee.18    (d) A pari-mutuel ticket shall be honored until December 1931 of the next calendar year, and the licensee shall pay the 20same and may charge the amount thereof against unpaid money 21similarly accumulated on account of pari-mutuel tickets not 22presented for payment.23    (e) No licensee shall knowingly permit any minor, other 24than an employee of such licensee or an owner, trainer, 25jockey, driver, or employee thereof, to be admitted during a 26racing program unless accompanied by a parent or guardian, or   HB1852- 26 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1any minor to be a patron of the pari-mutuel system of wagering 2conducted or supervised by it. The admission of any 3unaccompanied minor, other than an employee of the licensee or 4an owner, trainer, jockey, driver, or employee thereof at a 5race track is a Class C misdemeanor.6    (f) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Act, an 7organization licensee may contract with an entity in another 8state or country to permit any legal wagering entity in 9another state or country to accept wagers solely within such 10other state or country on races conducted by the organization 11licensee in this State. Beginning January 1, 2000, these 12wagers shall not be subject to State taxation. Until January 131, 2000, when the out-of-State entity conducts a pari-mutuel 14pool separate from the organization licensee, a privilege tax 15equal to 7 1/2% of all monies received by the organization 16licensee from entities in other states or countries pursuant 17to such contracts is imposed on the organization licensee, and 18such privilege tax shall be remitted to the Department of 19Revenue within 48 hours of receipt of the moneys from the 20simulcast. When the out-of-State entity conducts a combined 21pari-mutuel pool with the organization licensee, the tax shall 22be 10% of all monies received by the organization licensee 23with 25% of the receipts from this 10% tax to be distributed to 24the county in which the race was conducted.25    An organization licensee may permit one or more of its 26races to be utilized for pari-mutuel wagering at one or more   HB1852- 27 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1locations in other states and may transmit audio and visual 2signals of races the organization licensee conducts to one or 3more locations outside the State or country and may also 4permit pari-mutuel pools in other states or countries to be 5combined with its gross or net wagering pools or with wagering 6pools established by other states.7    (g) A host track may accept interstate simulcast wagers on 8horse races conducted in other states or countries and shall 9control the number of signals and types of breeds of racing in 10its simulcast program, subject to the disapproval of the 11Board. The Board may prohibit a simulcast program only if it 12finds that the simulcast program is clearly adverse to the 13integrity of racing. The host track simulcast program shall 14include the signal of live racing of all organization 15licensees. All non-host licensees and advance deposit wagering 16licensees shall carry the signal of and accept wagers on live 17racing of all organization licensees. Advance deposit wagering 18licensees shall not be permitted to accept out-of-state wagers 19on any Illinois signal provided pursuant to this Section 20without the approval and consent of the organization licensee 21providing the signal. For one year after August 15, 2014 (the 22effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host licensees may 23carry the host track simulcast program and shall accept wagers 24on all races included as part of the simulcast program of horse 25races conducted at race tracks located within North America 26upon which wagering is permitted. For a period of one year   HB1852- 28 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1after August 15, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 298-968), on horse races conducted at race tracks located 3outside of North America, non-host licensees may accept wagers 4on all races included as part of the simulcast program upon 5which wagering is permitted. Beginning August 15, 2015 (one 6year after the effective date of Public Act 98-968), non-host 7licensees may carry the host track simulcast program and shall 8accept wagers on all races included as part of the simulcast 9program upon which wagering is permitted. All organization 10licensees shall provide their live signal to all advance 11deposit wagering licensees for a simulcast commission fee not 12to exceed 6% of the advance deposit wagering licensee's 13Illinois handle on the organization licensee's signal without 14prior approval by the Board. The Board may adopt rules under 15which it may permit simulcast commission fees in excess of 6%. 16The Board shall adopt rules limiting the interstate commission 17fees charged to an advance deposit wagering licensee. The 18Board shall adopt rules regarding advance deposit wagering on 19interstate simulcast races that shall reflect, among other 20things, the General Assembly's desire to maximize revenues to 21the State, horsemen purses, and organization licensees. 22However, organization licensees providing live signals 23pursuant to the requirements of this subsection (g) may 24petition the Board to withhold their live signals from an 25advance deposit wagering licensee if the organization licensee 26discovers and the Board finds reputable or credible   HB1852- 29 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1information that the advance deposit wagering licensee is 2under investigation by another state or federal governmental 3agency, the advance deposit wagering licensee's license has 4been suspended in another state, or the advance deposit 5wagering licensee's license is in revocation proceedings in 6another state. The organization licensee's provision of their 7live signal to an advance deposit wagering licensee under this 8subsection (g) pertains to wagers placed from within Illinois. 9Advance deposit wagering licensees may place advance deposit 10wagering terminals at wagering facilities as a convenience to 11customers. The advance deposit wagering licensee shall not 12charge or collect any fee from purses for the placement of the 13advance deposit wagering terminals. The costs and expenses of 14the host track and non-host licensees associated with 15interstate simulcast wagering, other than the interstate 16commission fee, shall be borne by the host track and all 17non-host licensees incurring these costs. The interstate 18commission fee shall not exceed 5% of Illinois handle on the 19interstate simulcast race or races without prior approval of 20the Board. The Board shall promulgate rules under which it may 21permit interstate commission fees in excess of 5%. The 22interstate commission fee and other fees charged by the 23sending racetrack, including, but not limited to, satellite 24decoder fees, shall be uniformly applied to the host track and 25all non-host licensees.26    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, an   HB1852- 30 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 2association representing the largest number of owners, 3trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 4that organization licensee's racing meeting, may maintain a 5system whereby advance deposit wagering may take place or an 6organization licensee, with the consent of the horsemen 7association representing the largest number of owners, 8trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race horses at 9that organization licensee's racing meeting, may contract with 10another person to carry out a system of advance deposit 11wagering. Such consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Only 12with respect to an appeal to the Board that consent for an 13organization licensee that maintains its own advance deposit 14wagering system is being unreasonably withheld, the Board 15shall issue a final order within 30 days after initiation of 16the appeal, and the organization licensee's advance deposit 17wagering system may remain operational during that 30-day 18period. The actions of any organization licensee who conducts 19advance deposit wagering or any person who has a contract with 20an organization licensee to conduct advance deposit wagering 21who conducts advance deposit wagering on or after January 1, 222013 and prior to June 7, 2013 (the effective date of Public 23Act 98-18) taken in reliance on the changes made to this 24subsection (g) by Public Act 98-18 are hereby validated, 25provided payment of all applicable pari-mutuel taxes are 26remitted to the Board. All advance deposit wagers placed from   HB1852- 31 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1within Illinois must be placed through a Board-approved 2advance deposit wagering licensee; no other entity may accept 3an advance deposit wager from a person within Illinois. All 4advance deposit wagering is subject to any rules adopted by 5the Board. The Board may adopt rules necessary to regulate 6advance deposit wagering through the use of emergency 7rulemaking in accordance with Section 5-45 of the Illinois 8Administrative Procedure Act. The General Assembly finds that 9the adoption of rules to regulate advance deposit wagering is 10deemed an emergency and necessary for the public interest, 11safety, and welfare. An advance deposit wagering licensee may 12retain all moneys as agreed to by contract with an 13organization licensee. Any moneys retained by the organization 14licensee from advance deposit wagering, not including moneys 15retained by the advance deposit wagering licensee, shall be 16paid 50% to the organization licensee's purse account and 50% 17to the organization licensee. With the exception of any 18organization licensee that is owned by a publicly traded 19company that is incorporated in a state other than Illinois 20and advance deposit wagering licensees under contract with 21such organization licensees, organization licensees that 22maintain advance deposit wagering systems and advance deposit 23wagering licensees that contract with organization licensees 24shall provide sufficiently detailed monthly accountings to the 25horsemen association representing the largest number of 26owners, trainers, jockeys, or standardbred drivers who race   HB1852- 32 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1horses at that organization licensee's racing meeting so that 2the horsemen association, as an interested party, can confirm 3the accuracy of the amounts paid to the purse account at the 4horsemen association's affiliated organization licensee from 5advance deposit wagering. If more than one breed races at the 6same race track facility, then the 50% of the moneys to be paid 7to an organization licensee's purse account shall be allocated 8among all organization licensees' purse accounts operating at 9that race track facility proportionately based on the actual 10number of host days that the Board grants to that breed at that 11race track facility in the current calendar year. To the 12extent any fees from advance deposit wagering conducted in 13Illinois for wagers in Illinois or other states have been 14placed in escrow or otherwise withheld from wagers pending a 15determination of the legality of advance deposit wagering, no 16action shall be brought to declare such wagers or the 17disbursement of any fees previously escrowed illegal.18        (1) Between the hours of 6:30 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. an 19    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 20    may supplement the host track simulcast program with 21    additional simulcast races or race programs, provided that 22    between January 1 and the third Friday in February of any 23    year, inclusive, if no live thoroughbred racing is 24    occurring in Illinois during this period, only 25    thoroughbred races may be used for supplemental interstate 26    simulcast purposes. The Board shall withhold approval for   HB1852- 33 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    a supplemental interstate simulcast only if it finds that 2    the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 3    racing. A supplemental interstate simulcast may be 4    transmitted from an inter-track wagering licensee to its 5    affiliated non-host licensees. The interstate commission 6    fee for a supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid 7    by the non-host licensee and its affiliated non-host 8    licensees receiving the simulcast.9        (2) Between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. an 10    inter-track wagering licensee other than the host track 11    may receive supplemental interstate simulcasts only with 12    the consent of the host track, except when the Board finds 13    that the simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of 14    racing. Consent granted under this paragraph (2) to any 15    inter-track wagering licensee shall be deemed consent to 16    all non-host licensees. The interstate commission fee for 17    the supplemental interstate simulcast shall be paid by all 18    participating non-host licensees.19        (3) Each licensee conducting interstate simulcast 20    wagering may retain, subject to the payment of all 21    applicable taxes and the purses, an amount not to exceed 22    17% of all money wagered. If any licensee conducts the 23    pari-mutuel system wagering on races conducted at 24    racetracks in another state or country, each such race or 25    race program shall be considered a separate racing day for 26    the purpose of determining the daily handle and computing   HB1852- 34 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    the privilege tax of that daily handle as provided in 2    subsection (a) of Section 27. Until January 1, 2000, from 3    the sums permitted to be retained pursuant to this 4    subsection, each inter-track wagering location licensee 5    shall pay 1% of the pari-mutuel handle wagered on 6    simulcast wagering to the Horse Racing Tax Allocation 7    Fund, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (B) of 8    paragraph (11) of subsection (h) of Section 26 of this 9    Act.10        (4) A licensee who receives an interstate simulcast 11    may combine its gross or net pools with pools at the 12    sending racetracks pursuant to rules established by the 13    Board. All licensees combining their gross pools at a 14    sending racetrack shall adopt the takeout percentages of 15    the sending racetrack. A licensee may also establish a 16    separate pool and takeout structure for wagering purposes 17    on races conducted at race tracks outside of the State of 18    Illinois. The licensee may permit pari-mutuel wagers 19    placed in other states or countries to be combined with 20    its gross or net wagering pools or other wagering pools.21        (5) After the payment of the interstate commission fee 22    (except for the interstate commission fee on a 23    supplemental interstate simulcast, which shall be paid by 24    the host track and by each non-host licensee through the 25    host track) and all applicable State and local taxes, 26    except as provided in subsection (g) of Section 27 of this   HB1852- 35 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    Act, the remainder of moneys retained from simulcast 2    wagering pursuant to this subsection (g), and Section 26.2 3    shall be divided as follows:4            (A) For interstate simulcast wagers made at a host 5        track, 50% to the host track and 50% to purses at the 6        host track.7            (B) For wagers placed on interstate simulcast 8        races, supplemental simulcasts as defined in 9        subparagraphs (1) and (2), and separately pooled races 10        conducted outside of the State of Illinois made at a 11        non-host licensee, 25% to the host track, 25% to the 12        non-host licensee, and 50% to the purses at the host 13        track.14        (6) Notwithstanding any provision in this Act to the 15    contrary, non-host licensees who derive their licenses 16    from a track located in a county with a population in 17    excess of 230,000 and that borders the Mississippi River 18    may receive supplemental interstate simulcast races at all 19    times subject to Board approval, which shall be withheld 20    only upon a finding that a supplemental interstate 21    simulcast is clearly adverse to the integrity of racing.22        (7) Effective January 1, 2017, notwithstanding any 23    provision of this Act to the contrary, after payment of 24    all applicable State and local taxes and interstate 25    commission fees, non-host licensees who derive their 26    licenses from a track located in a county with a   HB1852- 36 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    population in excess of 230,000 and that borders the 2    Mississippi River shall retain 50% of the retention from 3    interstate simulcast wagers and shall pay 50% to purses at 4    the track from which the non-host licensee derives its 5    license.6        (7.1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act 7    to the contrary, if no standardbred racing is conducted at 8    a racetrack located in Madison County during any calendar 9    year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, all moneys 10    derived by that racetrack from simulcast wagering and 11    inter-track wagering that (1) are to be used for purses 12    and (2) are generated between the hours of 6:30 p.m. and 13    6:30 a.m. during that calendar year shall be paid as 14    follows:15            (A) If the licensee that conducts horse racing at 16        that racetrack requests from the Board at least as 17        many racing dates as were conducted in calendar year 18        2000, 80% shall be paid to its thoroughbred purse 19        account; and20            (B) Twenty percent shall be deposited into the 21        Illinois Colt Stakes Purse Distribution Fund and shall 22        be paid to purses for standardbred races for Illinois 23        conceived and foaled horses conducted at any county 24        fairgrounds.

However, inter-track wagering and simulcast 20    wagering shall not be conducted by those licensees at any 21    location within 5 miles of any race track at which a horse 22    race meeting has been licensed in the current year, unless 23    the person having operating control of such race track has 24    given its written consent to such inter-track wagering 25    location licensees, which consent must be filed with the 26    Board at or prior to the time application is made. In the   HB1852- 46 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    case of any inter-track wagering location licensee 2    initially licensed after December 31, 2013, inter-track 3    wagering and simulcast wagering shall not be conducted by 4    those inter-track wagering location licensees that are 5    located outside the City of Chicago at any location within 6    8 miles of any race track at which a horse race meeting has 7    been licensed in the current year, unless the person 8    having operating control of such race track has given its 9    written consent to such inter-track wagering location 10    licensees, which consent must be filed with the Board at 11    or prior to the time application is made. 12        (8.2) Inter-track wagering or simulcast wagering shall 13    not be conducted by an inter-track wagering location 14    licensee at any location within 100 feet of an existing 15    church, an existing elementary or secondary public school, 16    or an existing elementary or secondary private school 17    registered with or recognized by the State Board of 18    Education.

However, inter-track wagering 23    or simulcast wagering may be conducted at a site within 24    100 feet of a church or school if such church or school has 25    been erected or established after the Board issues the 26    original inter-track wagering location license at the site   HB1852- 47 -LRB104 09431 LNS 19491 b1    in question. Inter-track wagering location licensees may 2    conduct inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering only 3    in areas that are zoned for commercial or manufacturing 4    purposes or in areas for which a special use has been 5    approved by the local zoning authority. However, no 6    license to conduct inter-track wagering and simulcast 7    wagering shall be granted by the Board with respect to any 8    inter-track wagering location within the jurisdiction of 9    any local zoning authority which has, by ordinance or by 10    resolution, prohibited the establishment of an inter-track 11    wagering location within its jurisdiction. However, 12    inter-track wagering and simulcast wagering may be 13    conducted at a site if such ordinance or resolution is 14    enacted after the Board licenses the original inter-track 15    wagering location licensee for the site in question.16        (9) (Blank).17        (10) An inter-track wagering licensee or an 18    inter-track wagering location licensee may retain, subject 19    to the payment of the privilege taxes and the purses, an 20    amount not to exceed 17% of all money wagered.
