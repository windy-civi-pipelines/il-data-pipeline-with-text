If the victim or 21        the victim's attorney was not allowed to be heard at 22        the hearing regarding the prosecuting attorney's 23        motion, and the court denies the prosecuting 24        attorney's assertion of the right or denies the 25        request for enforcement of a right, the victim or 26        victim's attorney may file a motion to assert the   HB1302 Enrolled- 21 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        victim's right or to request enforcement of the right 2        within 10 days of the court's ruling. The motion need 3        not demonstrate the grounds for a motion for 4        reconsideration. The court shall rule on the merits of 5        the motion.6            (D) The court shall take up and decide any motion 7        or request asserting or seeking enforcement of a 8        victim's right without delay, unless a specific time 9        period is specified by law or court rule. The reasons 10        for any decision denying the motion or request shall 11        be clearly stated on the record.12            (E) No later than January 1, 2023, the Office of 13        the Attorney General shall: 14                (i) designate an administrative authority 15            within the Office of the Attorney General to 16            receive and investigate complaints relating to the 17            provision or violation of the rights of a crime 18            victim as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 19            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act;20                (ii) create and administer a course of 21            training for employees and offices of the State of 22            Illinois that fail to comply with provisions of 23            Illinois law pertaining to the treatment of crime 24            victims as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 25            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act as 26            required by the court under Section 5 of this Act;   HB1302 Enrolled- 22 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1            and2                (iii) have the authority to make 3            recommendations to employees and offices of the 4            State of Illinois to respond more effectively to 5            the needs of crime victims, including regarding 6            the violation of the rights of a crime victim.7            (F) Crime victims' rights may also be asserted by 8        filing a complaint for mandamus, injunctive, or 9        declaratory relief in the jurisdiction in which the 10        victim's right is being violated or where the crime is 11        being prosecuted. For complaints or motions filed by 12        or on behalf of the victim, the clerk of court shall 13        waive filing fees that would otherwise be owed by the 14        victim for any court filing with the purpose of 15        enforcing crime victims' rights. If the court denies 16        the relief sought by the victim, the reasons for the 17        denial shall be clearly stated on the record in the 18        transcript of the proceedings, in a written opinion, 19        or in the docket entry, and the victim may appeal the 20        circuit court's decision to the appellate court. The 21        court shall issue prompt rulings regarding victims' 22        rights. Proceedings seeking to enforce victims' rights 23        shall not be stayed or subject to unreasonable delay 24        via continuances. 25        (5) Violation of rights and remedies. 26            (A) If the court determines that a victim's right   HB1302 Enrolled- 23 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        has been violated, the court shall determine the 2        appropriate remedy for the violation of the victim's 3        right by hearing from the victim and the parties, 4        considering all factors relevant to the issue, and 5        then awarding appropriate relief to the victim.6            (A-5) Consideration of an issue of a substantive 7        nature or an issue that implicates the constitutional 8        or statutory right of a victim at a court proceeding 9        labeled as a status hearing shall constitute a per se 10        violation of a victim's right. 11            (B) The appropriate remedy shall include only 12        actions necessary to provide the victim the right to 13        which the victim was entitled. Remedies may include, 14        but are not limited to: injunctive relief requiring 15        the victim's right to be afforded; declaratory 16        judgment recognizing or clarifying the victim's 17        rights; a writ of mandamus; and may include reopening 18        previously held proceedings; however, in no event 19        shall the court vacate a conviction. Any remedy shall 20        be tailored to provide the victim an appropriate 21        remedy without violating any constitutional right of 22        the defendant. In no event shall the appropriate 23        remedy to the victim be a new trial or damages.24        The court shall impose a mandatory training course 25    provided by the Attorney General for the employee under 26    item (ii) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph (4), which must   HB1302 Enrolled- 24 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    be successfully completed within 6 months of the entry of 2    the court order.3        This paragraph (5) takes effect January 2, 2023.4        (6) Right to be heard. Whenever a victim has the right 5    to be heard, the court shall allow the victim to exercise 6    the right in any reasonable manner the victim chooses.7        (7) Right to attend trial. A party must file a written 8    motion to exclude a victim from trial at least 60 days 9    prior to the date set for trial. The motion must state with 10    specificity the reason exclusion is necessary to protect a 11    constitutional right of the party, and must contain an 12    offer of proof. The court shall rule on the motion within 13    30 days. If the motion is granted, the court shall set 14    forth on the record the facts that support its finding 15    that the victim's testimony will be materially affected if 16    the victim hears other testimony at trial.17        (8) Right to have advocate and support person present 18    at court proceedings.19            (A) A party who intends to call an advocate as a 20        witness at trial must seek permission of the court 21        before the subpoena is issued. The party must file a 22        written motion at least 90 days before trial that sets 23        forth specifically the issues on which the advocate's 24        testimony is sought and an offer of proof regarding 25        (i) the content of the anticipated testimony of the 26        advocate; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and   HB1302 Enrolled- 25 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        materiality of the anticipated testimony. The court 2        shall consider the motion and make findings within 30 3        days of the filing of the motion. If the court finds by 4        a preponderance of the evidence that: (i) the 5        anticipated testimony is not protected by an absolute 6        privilege; and (ii) the anticipated testimony contains 7        relevant, admissible, and material evidence that is 8        not available through other witnesses or evidence, the 9        court shall issue a subpoena requiring the advocate to 10        appear to testify at an in camera hearing. The 11        prosecuting attorney and the victim shall have 15 days 12        to seek appellate review before the advocate is 13        required to testify at an ex parte in camera 14        proceeding. 15            The prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the 16        advocate's attorney shall be allowed to be present at 17        the ex parte in camera proceeding. If, after 18        conducting the ex parte in camera hearing, the court 19        determines that due process requires any testimony 20        regarding confidential or privileged information or 21        communications, the court shall provide to the 22        prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the advocate's 23        attorney a written memorandum on the substance of the 24        advocate's testimony. The prosecuting attorney, the 25        victim, and the advocate's attorney shall have 15 days 26        to seek appellate review before a subpoena may be   HB1302 Enrolled- 26 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        issued for the advocate to testify at trial. The 2        presence of the prosecuting attorney at the ex parte 3        in camera proceeding does not make the substance of 4        the advocate's testimony that the court has ruled 5        inadmissible subject to discovery.6            (B) If a victim has asserted the right to have a 7        support person present at the court proceedings, the 8        victim shall provide the name of the person the victim 9        has chosen to be the victim's support person to the 10        prosecuting attorney, within 60 days of trial. The 11        prosecuting attorney shall provide the name to the 12        defendant. If the defendant intends to call the 13        support person as a witness at trial, the defendant 14        must seek permission of the court before a subpoena is 15        issued. The defendant must file a written motion at 16        least 45 days prior to trial that sets forth 17        specifically the issues on which the support person 18        will testify and an offer of proof regarding: (i) the 19        content of the anticipated testimony of the support 20        person; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 21        materiality of the anticipated testimony.22            If the prosecuting attorney intends to call the 23        support person as a witness during the State's 24        case-in-chief, the prosecuting attorney shall inform 25        the court of this intent in the response to the 26        defendant's written motion. The victim may choose a   HB1302 Enrolled- 27 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        different person to be the victim's support person. 2        The court may allow the defendant to inquire about 3        matters outside the scope of the direct examination 4        during cross-examination. If the court allows the 5        defendant to do so, the support person shall be 6        allowed to remain in the courtroom after the support 7        person has testified. A defendant who fails to 8        question the support person about matters outside the 9        scope of direct examination during the State's 10        case-in-chief waives the right to challenge the 11        presence of the support person on appeal. The court 12        shall allow the support person to testify if called as 13        a witness in the defendant's case-in-chief or the 14        State's rebuttal.15            If the court does not allow the defendant to 16        inquire about matters outside the scope of the direct 17        examination, the support person shall be allowed to 18        remain in the courtroom after the support person has 19        been called by the defendant or the defendant has 20        rested. The court shall allow the support person to 21        testify in the State's rebuttal.22            If the prosecuting attorney does not intend to 23        call the support person in the State's case-in-chief, 24        the court shall verify with the support person whether 25        the support person, if called as a witness, would 26        testify as set forth in the offer of proof. If the   HB1302 Enrolled- 28 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        court finds that the support person would testify as 2        set forth in the offer of proof, the court shall rule 3        on the relevance, materiality, and admissibility of 4        the anticipated testimony. If the court rules the 5        anticipated testimony is admissible, the court shall 6        issue the subpoena. The support person may remain in 7        the courtroom after the support person testifies and 8        shall be allowed to testify in rebuttal.9            If the court excludes the victim's support person 10        during the State's case-in-chief, the victim shall be 11        allowed to choose another support person to be present 12        in court. 13            If the victim fails to designate a support person 14        within 60 days of trial and the defendant has 15        subpoenaed the support person to testify at trial, the 16        court may exclude the support person from the trial 17        until the support person testifies. If the court 18        excludes the support person the victim may choose 19        another person as a support person. 20        (9) Right to notice and hearing before disclosure of 21    confidential or privileged information or records.22            (A) A defendant who seeks to subpoena testimony or 23        records of or concerning the victim that are 24        confidential or privileged by law must seek permission 25        of the court before the subpoena is issued. The 26        defendant must file a written motion and an offer of   HB1302 Enrolled- 29 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        proof regarding the relevance, admissibility and 2        materiality of the testimony or records. If the court 3        finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:4                (i) the testimony or records are not protected 5            by an absolute privilege and6                (ii) the testimony or records contain 7            relevant, admissible, and material evidence that 8            is not available through other witnesses or 9            evidence, the court shall issue a subpoena 10            requiring the witness to appear in camera or a 11            sealed copy of the records be delivered to the 12            court to be reviewed in camera. If, after 13            conducting an in camera review of the witness 14            statement or records, the court determines that 15            due process requires disclosure of any potential 16            testimony or any portion of the records, the court 17            shall provide copies of the records that it 18            intends to disclose to the prosecuting attorney 19            and the victim. The prosecuting attorney and the 20            victim shall have 30 days to seek appellate review 21            before the records are disclosed to the defendant, 22            used in any court proceeding, or disclosed to 23            anyone or in any way that would subject the 24            testimony or records to public review. The 25            disclosure of copies of any portion of the 26            testimony or records to the prosecuting attorney   HB1302 Enrolled- 30 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1            under this Section does not make the records 2            subject to discovery or required to be provided to 3            the defendant.4            (B) A prosecuting attorney who seeks to subpoena 5        information or records concerning the victim that are 6        confidential or privileged by law must first request 7        the written consent of the crime victim. If the victim 8        does not provide such written consent, including where 9        necessary the appropriate signed document required for 10        waiving privilege, the prosecuting attorney must serve 11        the subpoena at least 21 days prior to the date a 12        response or appearance is required to allow the 13        subject of the subpoena time to file a motion to quash 14        or request a hearing. The prosecuting attorney must 15        also send a written notice to the victim at least 21 16        days prior to the response date to allow the victim to 17        file a motion or request a hearing. The notice to the 18        victim shall inform the victim (i) that a subpoena has 19        been issued for confidential information or records 20        concerning the victim, (ii) that the victim has the 21        right to request a hearing prior to the response date 22        of the subpoena, and (iii) how to request the hearing. 23        The notice to the victim shall also include a copy of 24        the subpoena. If requested, a hearing regarding the 25        subpoena shall occur before information or records are 26        provided to the prosecuting attorney.   HB1302 Enrolled- 31 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        (10) Right to notice of court proceedings. If the 2    victim is not present at a court proceeding in which a 3    right of the victim is at issue, the court shall ask the 4    prosecuting attorney whether the victim was notified of 5    the time, place, and purpose of the court proceeding and 6    that the victim had a right to be heard at the court 7    proceeding. If the court determines that timely notice was 8    not given or that the victim was not adequately informed 9    of the nature of the court proceeding, the court shall not 10    rule on any substantive issues, accept a plea, or impose a 11    sentence and shall continue the hearing for the time 12    necessary to notify the victim of the time, place and 13    nature of the court proceeding. The time between court 14    proceedings shall not be attributable to the State under 15    Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.16        (11) Right to timely disposition of the case. A victim 17    has the right to timely disposition of the case so as to 18    minimize the stress, cost, and inconvenience resulting 19    from the victim's involvement in the case. Before ruling 20    on a motion to continue trial or other court proceeding, 21    the court shall inquire into the circumstances for the 22    request for the delay and, if the victim has provided 23    written notice of the assertion of the right to a timely 24    disposition, and whether the victim objects to the delay. 25    If the victim objects, the prosecutor shall inform the 26    court of the victim's objections. If the prosecutor has   HB1302 Enrolled- 32 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    not conferred with the victim about the continuance, the 2    prosecutor shall inform the court of the attempts to 3    confer. If the court finds the attempts of the prosecutor 4    to confer with the victim were inadequate to protect the 5    victim's right to be heard, the court shall give the 6    prosecutor at least 3 but not more than 5 business days to 7    confer with the victim. In ruling on a motion to continue, 8    the court shall consider the reasons for the requested 9    continuance, the number and length of continuances that 10    have been granted, the victim's objections and procedures 11    to avoid further delays. If a continuance is granted over 12    the victim's objection, the court shall specify on the 13    record the reasons for the continuance and the procedures 14    that have been or will be taken to avoid further delays.15        (12) Right to Restitution.16            (A) If the victim has asserted the right to 17        restitution and the amount of restitution is known at 18        the time of sentencing, the court shall enter the 19        judgment of restitution at the time of sentencing. 20            (B) If the victim has asserted the right to 21        restitution and the amount of restitution is not known 22        at the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall, 23        within 5 days after sentencing, notify the victim what 24        information and documentation related to restitution 25        is needed and that the information and documentation 26        must be provided to the prosecutor within 45 days   HB1302 Enrolled- 33 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        after sentencing. Failure to timely provide 2        information and documentation related to restitution 3        shall be deemed a waiver of the right to restitution. 4        The prosecutor shall file and serve within 60 days 5        after sentencing a proposed judgment for restitution 6        and a notice that includes information concerning the 7        identity of any victims or other persons seeking 8        restitution, whether any victim or other person 9        expressly declines restitution, the nature and amount 10        of any damages together with any supporting 11        documentation, a restitution amount recommendation, 12        and the names of any co-defendants and their case 13        numbers. Within 30 days after receipt of the proposed 14        judgment for restitution, the defendant shall file any 15        objection to the proposed judgment, a statement of 16        grounds for the objection, and a financial statement. 17        If the defendant does not file an objection, the court 18        may enter the judgment for restitution without further 19        proceedings. If the defendant files an objection and 20        either party requests a hearing, the court shall 21        schedule a hearing. 22        (13) Access to presentence reports.23            (A) The victim may request a copy of the 24        presentence report prepared under the Unified Code of 25        Corrections from the State's Attorney. The State's 26        Attorney shall redact the following information before   HB1302 Enrolled- 34 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        providing a copy of the report:2                (i) the defendant's mental history and 3            condition;4                (ii) any evaluation prepared under subsection 5            (b) or (b-5) of Section 5-3-2; and6                (iii) the name, address, phone number, and 7            other personal information about any other victim.8            (B) The State's Attorney or the defendant may 9        request the court redact other information in the 10        report that may endanger the safety of any person.11            (C) The State's Attorney may orally disclose to 12        the victim any of the information that has been 13        redacted if there is a reasonable likelihood that the 14        information will be stated in court at the sentencing.15            (D) The State's Attorney must advise the victim 16        that the victim must maintain the confidentiality of 17        the report and other information. Any dissemination of 18        the report or information that was not stated at a 19        court proceeding constitutes indirect criminal 20        contempt of court. 21        (14) Appellate relief. If the trial court denies the 22    relief requested, the victim, the victim's attorney, or 23    the prosecuting attorney may file an appeal within 30 days 24    of the trial court's ruling. The trial or appellate court 25    may stay the court proceedings if the court finds that a 26    stay would not violate a constitutional right of the   HB1302 Enrolled- 35 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    defendant. If the appellate court denies the relief 2    sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated 3    in a written opinion. In any appeal in a criminal case, the 4    State may assert as error the court's denial of any crime 5    victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal 6    relates.7        (15) Limitation on appellate relief. In no case shall 8    an appellate court provide a new trial to remedy the 9    violation of a victim's right. 10        (16) The right to be reasonably protected from the 11    accused throughout the criminal justice process and the 12    right to have the safety of the victim and the victim's 13    family considered in determining whether to release the 14    defendant, and setting conditions of release after arrest 15    and conviction. A victim of domestic violence, a sexual 16    offense, or stalking may request the entry of a protective 17    order under Article 112A of the Code of Criminal Procedure 18    of 1963. 19    (d) Procedures after the imposition of sentence.20        (1) The Prisoner Review Board shall inform a victim or 21    any other concerned citizen, upon written request, of the 22    prisoner's release on parole, mandatory supervised 23    release, electronic detention, work release, international 24    transfer or exchange, or by the custodian, other than the 25    Department of Juvenile Justice, of the discharge of any 26    individual who was adjudicated a delinquent for a crime   HB1302 Enrolled- 36 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    from State custody and by the sheriff of the appropriate 2    county of any such person's final discharge from county 3    custody. The Prisoner Review Board, upon written request, 4    shall provide to a victim or any other concerned citizen a 5    recent photograph of any person convicted of a felony, 6    upon his or her release from custody. The Prisoner Review 7    Board, upon written request, shall inform a victim or any 8    other concerned citizen when feasible at least 7 days 9    prior to the prisoner's release on furlough of the times 10    and dates of such furlough. Upon written request by the 11    victim or any other concerned citizen, the State's 12    Attorney shall notify the person once of the times and 13    dates of release of a prisoner sentenced to periodic 14    imprisonment. Notification shall be based on the most 15    recent information as to the victim's or other concerned 16    citizen's residence or other location available to the 17    notifying authority. 18        (2) When the defendant has been committed to the 19    Department of Human Services pursuant to Section 5-2-4 or 20    any other provision of the Unified Code of Corrections, 21    the victim may request to be notified by the releasing 22    authority of the approval by the court of an on-grounds 23    pass, a supervised off-grounds pass, an unsupervised 24    off-grounds pass, or conditional release; the release on 25    an off-grounds pass; the return from an off-grounds pass; 26    transfer to another facility; conditional release; escape;   HB1302 Enrolled- 37 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    death; or final discharge from State custody. The 2    Department of Human Services shall establish and maintain 3    a statewide telephone number to be used by victims to make 4    notification requests under these provisions and shall 5    publicize this telephone number on its website and to the 6    State's Attorney of each county.7        (3) In the event of an escape from State custody, the 8    Department of Corrections or the Department of Juvenile 9    Justice immediately shall notify the Prisoner Review Board 10    of the escape and the Prisoner Review Board shall notify 11    the victim. The notification shall be based upon the most 12    recent information as to the victim's residence or other 13    location available to the Board. When no such information 14    is available, the Board shall make all reasonable efforts 15    to obtain the information and make the notification. When 16    the escapee is apprehended, the Department of Corrections 17    or the Department of Juvenile Justice immediately shall 18    notify the Prisoner Review Board and the Board shall 19    notify the victim.20        (4) The victim of the crime for which the prisoner has 21    been sentenced has the right to register with the Prisoner 22    Review Board's victim registry. Victims registered with 23    the Board shall receive reasonable written notice not less 24    than 30 days prior to the parole hearing or target 25    aftercare release date. The victim has the right to submit 26    a victim statement for consideration by the Prisoner   HB1302 Enrolled- 38 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    Review Board or the Department of Juvenile Justice in 2    writing, on film, videotape, or other electronic means, or 3    in the form of a recording prior to the parole hearing or 4    target aftercare release date, or in person at the parole 5    hearing or aftercare release protest hearing, or by 6    calling the toll-free number established in subsection (f) 7    of this Section. The victim shall be notified within 7 8    days after the prisoner has been granted parole or 9    aftercare release and shall be informed of the right to 10    inspect the registry of parole decisions, established 11    under subsection (g) of Section 3-3-5 of the Unified Code 12    of Corrections. The provisions of this paragraph (4) are 13    subject to the Open Parole Hearings Act.

The 26    Office of the State's Attorney shall further notify the   HB1302 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    crime victim of the right to request from the Prisoner 2    Review Board or Department of Juvenile Justice information 3    concerning the release of the defendant;4        (11) shall request restitution at sentencing and as 5    part of a plea agreement if the victim requests 6    restitution;7        (12) shall, upon the court entering a verdict of not 8    guilty by reason of insanity, inform the victim of the 9    notification services available from the Department of 10    Human Services, including the statewide telephone number, 11    under subparagraph (d)(2) of this Section; 12        (13) shall provide notice within a reasonable time 13    after receipt of notice from the custodian, of the release 14    of the defendant on pretrial release or personal 15    recognizance or the release from detention of a minor who 16    has been detained;17        (14) shall explain in nontechnical language the 18    details of any plea or verdict of a defendant, or any 19    adjudication of a juvenile as a delinquent;20        (15) shall make all reasonable efforts to consult with 21    the crime victim before the Office of the State's Attorney 22    makes an offer of a plea bargain to the defendant or enters 23    into negotiations with the defendant concerning a possible 24    plea agreement, and shall consider the written statement, 25    if prepared prior to entering into a plea agreement. The 26    right to consult with the prosecutor does not include the   HB1302 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    right to veto a plea agreement or to insist the case go to 2    trial. If the State's Attorney has not consulted with the 3    victim prior to making an offer or entering into plea 4    negotiations with the defendant, the Office of the State's 5    Attorney shall notify the victim of the offer or the 6    negotiations within 2 business days and confer with the 7    victim;8        (16) shall provide notice of the ultimate disposition 9    of the cases arising from an indictment or an information, 10    or a petition to have a juvenile adjudicated as a 11    delinquent for a violent crime;12        (17) shall provide notice of any appeal taken by the 13    defendant and information on how to contact the 14    appropriate agency handling the appeal, and how to request 15    notice of any hearing, oral argument, or decision of an 16    appellate court;17        (18) shall provide timely notice of any request for 18    post-conviction review filed by the defendant under 19    Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, and 20    of the date, time and place of any hearing concerning the 21    petition. Whenever possible, notice of the hearing shall 22    be given within 48 hours of the court's scheduling of the 23    hearing;24        (19) shall forward a copy of any statement presented 25    under Section 6 to the Prisoner Review Board or Department 26    of Juvenile Justice to be considered in making a   HB1302 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    determination under Section 3-2.5-85 or subsection (b) of 2    Section 3-3-8 of the Unified Code of Corrections;3        (20) shall, within a reasonable time, offer to meet 4    with the crime victim regarding the decision of the 5    State's Attorney not to charge an offense, and shall meet 6    with the victim, if the victim agrees. The victim has a 7    right to have an attorney, advocate, and other support 8    person of the victim's choice attend this meeting with the 9    victim; and10        (21) shall give the crime victim timely notice of any 11    decision not to pursue charges and consider the safety of 12    the victim when deciding how to give such notice. 13    (c) The court shall ensure that the rights of the victim 14are afforded. 15    (c-5) The following procedures shall be followed to afford 16victims the rights guaranteed by Article I, Section 8.1 of the 17Illinois Constitution:18        (1) Written notice. A victim may complete a written 19    notice of intent to assert rights on a form prepared by the 20    Office of the Attorney General and provided to the victim 21    by the State's Attorney. The victim may at any time 22    provide a revised written notice to the State's Attorney. 23    The State's Attorney shall file the written notice with 24    the court. At the beginning of any court proceeding in 25    which the right of a victim may be at issue, the court and 26    prosecutor shall review the written notice to determine   HB1302 Enrolled- 19 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    whether the victim has asserted the right that may be at 2    issue.3        (2) Victim's retained attorney. A victim's attorney 4    shall file an entry of appearance limited to assertion of 5    the victim's rights. Upon the filing of the entry of 6    appearance and service on the State's Attorney and the 7    defendant, the attorney is to receive copies of all 8    notices, motions and court orders filed thereafter in the 9    case.10        (3) Standing. The victim has standing to assert the 11    rights enumerated in subsection (a) of Article I, Section 12    8.1 of the Illinois Constitution and the statutory rights 13    under Section 4 of this Act in any court exercising 14    jurisdiction over the criminal case. The prosecuting 15    attorney, a victim, or the victim's retained attorney may 16    assert the victim's rights. The defendant in the criminal 17    case has no standing to assert a right of the victim in any 18    court proceeding, including on appeal.19        (4) Assertion of and enforcement of rights.20            (A) The prosecuting attorney shall assert a 21        victim's right or request enforcement of a right by 22        filing a motion or by orally asserting the right or 23        requesting enforcement in open court in the criminal 24        case outside the presence of the jury. The prosecuting 25        attorney shall consult with the victim and the 26        victim's attorney regarding the assertion or   HB1302 Enrolled- 20 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        enforcement of a right. If the prosecuting attorney 2        decides not to assert or enforce a victim's right, the 3        prosecuting attorney shall notify the victim or the 4        victim's attorney in sufficient time to allow the 5        victim or the victim's attorney to assert the right or 6        to seek enforcement of a right.7            (B) If the prosecuting attorney elects not to 8        assert a victim's right or to seek enforcement of a 9        right, the victim or the victim's attorney may assert 10        the victim's right or request enforcement of a right 11        by filing a motion or by orally asserting the right or 12        requesting enforcement in open court in the criminal 13        case outside the presence of the jury.14            (C) If the prosecuting attorney asserts a victim's 15        right or seeks enforcement of a right, unless the 16        prosecuting attorney objects or the trial court does 17        not allow it, the victim or the victim's attorney may 18        be heard regarding the prosecuting attorney's motion 19        or may file a simultaneous motion to assert or request 20        enforcement of the victim's right. If the victim or 21        the victim's attorney was not allowed to be heard at 22        the hearing regarding the prosecuting attorney's 23        motion, and the court denies the prosecuting 24        attorney's assertion of the right or denies the 25        request for enforcement of a right, the victim or 26        victim's attorney may file a motion to assert the   HB1302 Enrolled- 21 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        victim's right or to request enforcement of the right 2        within 10 days of the court's ruling. The motion need 3        not demonstrate the grounds for a motion for 4        reconsideration. The court shall rule on the merits of 5        the motion.6            (D) The court shall take up and decide any motion 7        or request asserting or seeking enforcement of a 8        victim's right without delay, unless a specific time 9        period is specified by law or court rule. The reasons 10        for any decision denying the motion or request shall 11        be clearly stated on the record.12            (E) No later than January 1, 2023, the Office of 13        the Attorney General shall: 14                (i) designate an administrative authority 15            within the Office of the Attorney General to 16            receive and investigate complaints relating to the 17            provision or violation of the rights of a crime 18            victim as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 19            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act;20                (ii) create and administer a course of 21            training for employees and offices of the State of 22            Illinois that fail to comply with provisions of 23            Illinois law pertaining to the treatment of crime 24            victims as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 25            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act as 26            required by the court under Section 5 of this Act;   HB1302 Enrolled- 22 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1            and2                (iii) have the authority to make 3            recommendations to employees and offices of the 4            State of Illinois to respond more effectively to 5            the needs of crime victims, including regarding 6            the violation of the rights of a crime victim.7            (F) Crime victims' rights may also be asserted by 8        filing a complaint for mandamus, injunctive, or 9        declaratory relief in the jurisdiction in which the 10        victim's right is being violated or where the crime is 11        being prosecuted. For complaints or motions filed by 12        or on behalf of the victim, the clerk of court shall 13        waive filing fees that would otherwise be owed by the 14        victim for any court filing with the purpose of 15        enforcing crime victims' rights. If the court denies 16        the relief sought by the victim, the reasons for the 17        denial shall be clearly stated on the record in the 18        transcript of the proceedings, in a written opinion, 19        or in the docket entry, and the victim may appeal the 20        circuit court's decision to the appellate court. The 21        court shall issue prompt rulings regarding victims' 22        rights. Proceedings seeking to enforce victims' rights 23        shall not be stayed or subject to unreasonable delay 24        via continuances. 25        (5) Violation of rights and remedies. 26            (A) If the court determines that a victim's right   HB1302 Enrolled- 23 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        has been violated, the court shall determine the 2        appropriate remedy for the violation of the victim's 3        right by hearing from the victim and the parties, 4        considering all factors relevant to the issue, and 5        then awarding appropriate relief to the victim.6            (A-5) Consideration of an issue of a substantive 7        nature or an issue that implicates the constitutional 8        or statutory right of a victim at a court proceeding 9        labeled as a status hearing shall constitute a per se 10        violation of a victim's right. 11            (B) The appropriate remedy shall include only 12        actions necessary to provide the victim the right to 13        which the victim was entitled. Remedies may include, 14        but are not limited to: injunctive relief requiring 15        the victim's right to be afforded; declaratory 16        judgment recognizing or clarifying the victim's 17        rights; a writ of mandamus; and may include reopening 18        previously held proceedings; however, in no event 19        shall the court vacate a conviction. Any remedy shall 20        be tailored to provide the victim an appropriate 21        remedy without violating any constitutional right of 22        the defendant. In no event shall the appropriate 23        remedy to the victim be a new trial or damages.24        The court shall impose a mandatory training course 25    provided by the Attorney General for the employee under 26    item (ii) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph (4), which must   HB1302 Enrolled- 24 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    be successfully completed within 6 months of the entry of 2    the court order.3        This paragraph (5) takes effect January 2, 2023.4        (6) Right to be heard. Whenever a victim has the right 5    to be heard, the court shall allow the victim to exercise 6    the right in any reasonable manner the victim chooses.7        (7) Right to attend trial. A party must file a written 8    motion to exclude a victim from trial at least 60 days 9    prior to the date set for trial. The motion must state with 10    specificity the reason exclusion is necessary to protect a 11    constitutional right of the party, and must contain an 12    offer of proof. The court shall rule on the motion within 13    30 days. If the motion is granted, the court shall set 14    forth on the record the facts that support its finding 15    that the victim's testimony will be materially affected if 16    the victim hears other testimony at trial.17        (8) Right to have advocate and support person present 18    at court proceedings.19            (A) A party who intends to call an advocate as a 20        witness at trial must seek permission of the court 21        before the subpoena is issued. The party must file a 22        written motion at least 90 days before trial that sets 23        forth specifically the issues on which the advocate's 24        testimony is sought and an offer of proof regarding 25        (i) the content of the anticipated testimony of the 26        advocate; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and   HB1302 Enrolled- 25 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        materiality of the anticipated testimony. The court 2        shall consider the motion and make findings within 30 3        days of the filing of the motion. If the court finds by 4        a preponderance of the evidence that: (i) the 5        anticipated testimony is not protected by an absolute 6        privilege; and (ii) the anticipated testimony contains 7        relevant, admissible, and material evidence that is 8        not available through other witnesses or evidence, the 9        court shall issue a subpoena requiring the advocate to 10        appear to testify at an in camera hearing. The 11        prosecuting attorney and the victim shall have 15 days 12        to seek appellate review before the advocate is 13        required to testify at an ex parte in camera 14        proceeding. 15            The prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the 16        advocate's attorney shall be allowed to be present at 17        the ex parte in camera proceeding. If, after 18        conducting the ex parte in camera hearing, the court 19        determines that due process requires any testimony 20        regarding confidential or privileged information or 21        communications, the court shall provide to the 22        prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the advocate's 23        attorney a written memorandum on the substance of the 24        advocate's testimony. The prosecuting attorney, the 25        victim, and the advocate's attorney shall have 15 days 26        to seek appellate review before a subpoena may be   HB1302 Enrolled- 26 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        issued for the advocate to testify at trial. The 2        presence of the prosecuting attorney at the ex parte 3        in camera proceeding does not make the substance of 4        the advocate's testimony that the court has ruled 5        inadmissible subject to discovery.6            (B) If a victim has asserted the right to have a 7        support person present at the court proceedings, the 8        victim shall provide the name of the person the victim 9        has chosen to be the victim's support person to the 10        prosecuting attorney, within 60 days of trial. The 11        prosecuting attorney shall provide the name to the 12        defendant. If the defendant intends to call the 13        support person as a witness at trial, the defendant 14        must seek permission of the court before a subpoena is 15        issued. The defendant must file a written motion at 16        least 45 days prior to trial that sets forth 17        specifically the issues on which the support person 18        will testify and an offer of proof regarding: (i) the 19        content of the anticipated testimony of the support 20        person; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 21        materiality of the anticipated testimony.22            If the prosecuting attorney intends to call the 23        support person as a witness during the State's 24        case-in-chief, the prosecuting attorney shall inform 25        the court of this intent in the response to the 26        defendant's written motion. The victim may choose a   HB1302 Enrolled- 27 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        different person to be the victim's support person. 2        The court may allow the defendant to inquire about 3        matters outside the scope of the direct examination 4        during cross-examination. If the court allows the 5        defendant to do so, the support person shall be 6        allowed to remain in the courtroom after the support 7        person has testified. A defendant who fails to 8        question the support person about matters outside the 9        scope of direct examination during the State's 10        case-in-chief waives the right to challenge the 11        presence of the support person on appeal. The court 12        shall allow the support person to testify if called as 13        a witness in the defendant's case-in-chief or the 14        State's rebuttal.15            If the court does not allow the defendant to 16        inquire about matters outside the scope of the direct 17        examination, the support person shall be allowed to 18        remain in the courtroom after the support person has 19        been called by the defendant or the defendant has 20        rested. The court shall allow the support person to 21        testify in the State's rebuttal.22            If the prosecuting attorney does not intend to 23        call the support person in the State's case-in-chief, 24        the court shall verify with the support person whether 25        the support person, if called as a witness, would 26        testify as set forth in the offer of proof. If the   HB1302 Enrolled- 28 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        court finds that the support person would testify as 2        set forth in the offer of proof, the court shall rule 3        on the relevance, materiality, and admissibility of 4        the anticipated testimony. If the court rules the 5        anticipated testimony is admissible, the court shall 6        issue the subpoena. The support person may remain in 7        the courtroom after the support person testifies and 8        shall be allowed to testify in rebuttal.9            If the court excludes the victim's support person 10        during the State's case-in-chief, the victim shall be 11        allowed to choose another support person to be present 12        in court. 13            If the victim fails to designate a support person 14        within 60 days of trial and the defendant has 15        subpoenaed the support person to testify at trial, the 16        court may exclude the support person from the trial 17        until the support person testifies. If the court 18        excludes the support person the victim may choose 19        another person as a support person. 20        (9) Right to notice and hearing before disclosure of 21    confidential or privileged information or records.22            (A) A defendant who seeks to subpoena testimony or 23        records of or concerning the victim that are 24        confidential or privileged by law must seek permission 25        of the court before the subpoena is issued. The 26        defendant must file a written motion and an offer of   HB1302 Enrolled- 29 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        proof regarding the relevance, admissibility and 2        materiality of the testimony or records. If the court 3        finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:4                (i) the testimony or records are not protected 5            by an absolute privilege and6                (ii) the testimony or records contain 7            relevant, admissible, and material evidence that 8            is not available through other witnesses or 9            evidence, the court shall issue a subpoena 10            requiring the witness to appear in camera or a 11            sealed copy of the records be delivered to the 12            court to be reviewed in camera. If, after 13            conducting an in camera review of the witness 14            statement or records, the court determines that 15            due process requires disclosure of any potential 16            testimony or any portion of the records, the court 17            shall provide copies of the records that it 18            intends to disclose to the prosecuting attorney 19            and the victim. The prosecuting attorney and the 20            victim shall have 30 days to seek appellate review 21            before the records are disclosed to the defendant, 22            used in any court proceeding, or disclosed to 23            anyone or in any way that would subject the 24            testimony or records to public review. The 25            disclosure of copies of any portion of the 26            testimony or records to the prosecuting attorney   HB1302 Enrolled- 30 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1            under this Section does not make the records 2            subject to discovery or required to be provided to 3            the defendant.4            (B) A prosecuting attorney who seeks to subpoena 5        information or records concerning the victim that are 6        confidential or privileged by law must first request 7        the written consent of the crime victim. If the victim 8        does not provide such written consent, including where 9        necessary the appropriate signed document required for 10        waiving privilege, the prosecuting attorney must serve 11        the subpoena at least 21 days prior to the date a 12        response or appearance is required to allow the 13        subject of the subpoena time to file a motion to quash 14        or request a hearing. The prosecuting attorney must 15        also send a written notice to the victim at least 21 16        days prior to the response date to allow the victim to 17        file a motion or request a hearing. The notice to the 18        victim shall inform the victim (i) that a subpoena has 19        been issued for confidential information or records 20        concerning the victim, (ii) that the victim has the 21        right to request a hearing prior to the response date 22        of the subpoena, and (iii) how to request the hearing. 23        The notice to the victim shall also include a copy of 24        the subpoena. If requested, a hearing regarding the 25        subpoena shall occur before information or records are 26        provided to the prosecuting attorney.   HB1302 Enrolled- 31 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        (10) Right to notice of court proceedings. If the 2    victim is not present at a court proceeding in which a 3    right of the victim is at issue, the court shall ask the 4    prosecuting attorney whether the victim was notified of 5    the time, place, and purpose of the court proceeding and 6    that the victim had a right to be heard at the court 7    proceeding. If the court determines that timely notice was 8    not given or that the victim was not adequately informed 9    of the nature of the court proceeding, the court shall not 10    rule on any substantive issues, accept a plea, or impose a 11    sentence and shall continue the hearing for the time 12    necessary to notify the victim of the time, place and 13    nature of the court proceeding. The time between court 14    proceedings shall not be attributable to the State under 15    Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.16        (11) Right to timely disposition of the case. A victim 17    has the right to timely disposition of the case so as to 18    minimize the stress, cost, and inconvenience resulting 19    from the victim's involvement in the case. Before ruling 20    on a motion to continue trial or other court proceeding, 21    the court shall inquire into the circumstances for the 22    request for the delay and, if the victim has provided 23    written notice of the assertion of the right to a timely 24    disposition, and whether the victim objects to the delay. 25    If the victim objects, the prosecutor shall inform the 26    court of the victim's objections. If the prosecutor has   HB1302 Enrolled- 32 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    not conferred with the victim about the continuance, the 2    prosecutor shall inform the court of the attempts to 3    confer. If the court finds the attempts of the prosecutor 4    to confer with the victim were inadequate to protect the 5    victim's right to be heard, the court shall give the 6    prosecutor at least 3 but not more than 5 business days to 7    confer with the victim. In ruling on a motion to continue, 8    the court shall consider the reasons for the requested 9    continuance, the number and length of continuances that 10    have been granted, the victim's objections and procedures 11    to avoid further delays. If a continuance is granted over 12    the victim's objection, the court shall specify on the 13    record the reasons for the continuance and the procedures 14    that have been or will be taken to avoid further delays.15        (12) Right to Restitution.16            (A) If the victim has asserted the right to 17        restitution and the amount of restitution is known at 18        the time of sentencing, the court shall enter the 19        judgment of restitution at the time of sentencing. 20            (B) If the victim has asserted the right to 21        restitution and the amount of restitution is not known 22        at the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall, 23        within 5 days after sentencing, notify the victim what 24        information and documentation related to restitution 25        is needed and that the information and documentation 26        must be provided to the prosecutor within 45 days   HB1302 Enrolled- 33 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        after sentencing. Failure to timely provide 2        information and documentation related to restitution 3        shall be deemed a waiver of the right to restitution. 4        The prosecutor shall file and serve within 60 days 5        after sentencing a proposed judgment for restitution 6        and a notice that includes information concerning the 7        identity of any victims or other persons seeking 8        restitution, whether any victim or other person 9        expressly declines restitution, the nature and amount 10        of any damages together with any supporting 11        documentation, a restitution amount recommendation, 12        and the names of any co-defendants and their case 13        numbers. Within 30 days after receipt of the proposed 14        judgment for restitution, the defendant shall file any 15        objection to the proposed judgment, a statement of 16        grounds for the objection, and a financial statement. 17        If the defendant does not file an objection, the court 18        may enter the judgment for restitution without further 19        proceedings. If the defendant files an objection and 20        either party requests a hearing, the court shall 21        schedule a hearing. 22        (13) Access to presentence reports.23            (A) The victim may request a copy of the 24        presentence report prepared under the Unified Code of 25        Corrections from the State's Attorney. The State's 26        Attorney shall redact the following information before   HB1302 Enrolled- 34 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1        providing a copy of the report:2                (i) the defendant's mental history and 3            condition;4                (ii) any evaluation prepared under subsection 5            (b) or (b-5) of Section 5-3-2; and6                (iii) the name, address, phone number, and 7            other personal information about any other victim.8            (B) The State's Attorney or the defendant may 9        request the court redact other information in the 10        report that may endanger the safety of any person.11            (C) The State's Attorney may orally disclose to 12        the victim any of the information that has been 13        redacted if there is a reasonable likelihood that the 14        information will be stated in court at the sentencing.15            (D) The State's Attorney must advise the victim 16        that the victim must maintain the confidentiality of 17        the report and other information. Any dissemination of 18        the report or information that was not stated at a 19        court proceeding constitutes indirect criminal 20        contempt of court. 21        (14) Appellate relief. If the trial court denies the 22    relief requested, the victim, the victim's attorney, or 23    the prosecuting attorney may file an appeal within 30 days 24    of the trial court's ruling. The trial or appellate court 25    may stay the court proceedings if the court finds that a 26    stay would not violate a constitutional right of the   HB1302 Enrolled- 35 -LRB104 05519 RLC 15548 b1    defendant. If the appellate court denies the relief 2    sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated 3    in a written opinion. In any appeal in a criminal case, the 4    State may assert as error the court's denial of any crime 5    victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal 6    relates.7        (15) Limitation on appellate relief. In no case shall 8    an appellate court provide a new trial to remedy the 9    violation of a victim's right. 10        (16) The right to be reasonably protected from the 11    accused throughout the criminal justice process and the 12    right to have the safety of the victim and the victim's 13    family considered in determining whether to release the 14    defendant, and setting conditions of release after arrest 15    and conviction.
