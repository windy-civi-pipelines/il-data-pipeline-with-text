If the prosecuting attorney 9        decides not to assert or enforce a victim's right, the 10        prosecuting attorney shall notify the victim or the 11        victim's attorney in sufficient time to allow the 12        victim or the victim's attorney to assert the right or 13        to seek enforcement of a right.14            (B) If the prosecuting attorney elects not to 15        assert a victim's right or to seek enforcement of a 16        right, the victim or the victim's attorney may assert 17        the victim's right or request enforcement of a right 18        by filing a motion or by orally asserting the right or 19        requesting enforcement in open court in the criminal 20        case outside the presence of the jury.21            (C) If the prosecuting attorney asserts a victim's 22        right or seeks enforcement of a right, unless the 23        prosecuting attorney objects or the trial court does 24        not allow it, the victim or the victim's attorney may 25        be heard regarding the prosecuting attorney's motion 26        or may file a simultaneous motion to assert or request   10400HB1302sam002- 21 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        enforcement of the victim's right. If the victim or 2        the victim's attorney was not allowed to be heard at 3        the hearing regarding the prosecuting attorney's 4        motion, and the court denies the prosecuting 5        attorney's assertion of the right or denies the 6        request for enforcement of a right, the victim or 7        victim's attorney may file a motion to assert the 8        victim's right or to request enforcement of the right 9        within 10 days of the court's ruling. The motion need 10        not demonstrate the grounds for a motion for 11        reconsideration. The court shall rule on the merits of 12        the motion.13            (D) The court shall take up and decide any motion 14        or request asserting or seeking enforcement of a 15        victim's right without delay, unless a specific time 16        period is specified by law or court rule. The reasons 17        for any decision denying the motion or request shall 18        be clearly stated on the record.19            (E) No later than January 1, 2023, the Office of 20        the Attorney General shall: 21                (i) designate an administrative authority 22            within the Office of the Attorney General to 23            receive and investigate complaints relating to the 24            provision or violation of the rights of a crime 25            victim as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 26            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act;  10400HB1302sam002- 22 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1                (ii) create and administer a course of 2            training for employees and offices of the State of 3            Illinois that fail to comply with provisions of 4            Illinois law pertaining to the treatment of crime 5            victims as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 6            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act as 7            required by the court under Section 5 of this Act; 8            and9                (iii) have the authority to make 10            recommendations to employees and offices of the 11            State of Illinois to respond more effectively to 12            the needs of crime victims, including regarding 13            the violation of the rights of a crime victim.14            (F) Crime victims' rights may also be asserted by 15        filing a complaint for mandamus, injunctive, or 16        declaratory relief in the jurisdiction in which the 17        victim's right is being violated or where the crime is 18        being prosecuted. For complaints or motions filed by 19        or on behalf of the victim, the clerk of court shall 20        waive filing fees that would otherwise be owed by the 21        victim for any court filing with the purpose of 22        enforcing crime victims' rights. If the court denies 23        the relief sought by the victim, the reasons for the 24        denial shall be clearly stated on the record in the 25        transcript of the proceedings, in a written opinion, 26        or in the docket entry, and the victim may appeal the   10400HB1302sam002- 23 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        circuit court's decision to the appellate court. The 2        court shall issue prompt rulings regarding victims' 3        rights. Proceedings seeking to enforce victims' rights 4        shall not be stayed or subject to unreasonable delay 5        via continuances. 6        (5) Violation of rights and remedies. 7            (A) If the court determines that a victim's right 8        has been violated, the court shall determine the 9        appropriate remedy for the violation of the victim's 10        right by hearing from the victim and the parties, 11        considering all factors relevant to the issue, and 12        then awarding appropriate relief to the victim.13            (A-5) Consideration of an issue of a substantive 14        nature or an issue that implicates the constitutional 15        or statutory right of a victim at a court proceeding 16        labeled as a status hearing shall constitute a per se 17        violation of a victim's right. 18            (B) The appropriate remedy shall include only 19        actions necessary to provide the victim the right to 20        which the victim was entitled. Remedies may include, 21        but are not limited to: injunctive relief requiring 22        the victim's right to be afforded; declaratory 23        judgment recognizing or clarifying the victim's 24        rights; a writ of mandamus; and may include reopening 25        previously held proceedings; however, in no event 26        shall the court vacate a conviction. Any remedy shall   10400HB1302sam002- 24 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        be tailored to provide the victim an appropriate 2        remedy without violating any constitutional right of 3        the defendant. In no event shall the appropriate 4        remedy to the victim be a new trial or damages.5        The court shall impose a mandatory training course 6    provided by the Attorney General for the employee under 7    item (ii) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph (4), which must 8    be successfully completed within 6 months of the entry of 9    the court order.10        This paragraph (5) takes effect January 2, 2023.11        (6) Right to be heard. Whenever a victim has the right 12    to be heard, the court shall allow the victim to exercise 13    the right in any reasonable manner the victim chooses.14        (7) Right to attend trial. A party must file a written 15    motion to exclude a victim from trial at least 60 days 16    prior to the date set for trial. The motion must state with 17    specificity the reason exclusion is necessary to protect a 18    constitutional right of the party, and must contain an 19    offer of proof. The court shall rule on the motion within 20    30 days. If the motion is granted, the court shall set 21    forth on the record the facts that support its finding 22    that the victim's testimony will be materially affected if 23    the victim hears other testimony at trial.24        (8) Right to have advocate and support person present 25    at court proceedings.26            (A) A party who intends to call an advocate as a   10400HB1302sam002- 25 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        witness at trial must seek permission of the court 2        before the subpoena is issued. The party must file a 3        written motion at least 90 days before trial that sets 4        forth specifically the issues on which the advocate's 5        testimony is sought and an offer of proof regarding 6        (i) the content of the anticipated testimony of the 7        advocate; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 8        materiality of the anticipated testimony. The court 9        shall consider the motion and make findings within 30 10        days of the filing of the motion. If the court finds by 11        a preponderance of the evidence that: (i) the 12        anticipated testimony is not protected by an absolute 13        privilege; and (ii) the anticipated testimony contains 14        relevant, admissible, and material evidence that is 15        not available through other witnesses or evidence, the 16        court shall issue a subpoena requiring the advocate to 17        appear to testify at an in camera hearing. The 18        prosecuting attorney and the victim shall have 15 days 19        to seek appellate review before the advocate is 20        required to testify at an ex parte in camera 21        proceeding. 22            The prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the 23        advocate's attorney shall be allowed to be present at 24        the ex parte in camera proceeding. If, after 25        conducting the ex parte in camera hearing, the court 26        determines that due process requires any testimony   10400HB1302sam002- 26 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        regarding confidential or privileged information or 2        communications, the court shall provide to the 3        prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the advocate's 4        attorney a written memorandum on the substance of the 5        advocate's testimony. The prosecuting attorney, the 6        victim, and the advocate's attorney shall have 15 days 7        to seek appellate review before a subpoena may be 8        issued for the advocate to testify at trial. The 9        presence of the prosecuting attorney at the ex parte 10        in camera proceeding does not make the substance of 11        the advocate's testimony that the court has ruled 12        inadmissible subject to discovery.13            (B) If a victim has asserted the right to have a 14        support person present at the court proceedings, the 15        victim shall provide the name of the person the victim 16        has chosen to be the victim's support person to the 17        prosecuting attorney, within 60 days of trial. The 18        prosecuting attorney shall provide the name to the 19        defendant. If the defendant intends to call the 20        support person as a witness at trial, the defendant 21        must seek permission of the court before a subpoena is 22        issued. The defendant must file a written motion at 23        least 45 days prior to trial that sets forth 24        specifically the issues on which the support person 25        will testify and an offer of proof regarding: (i) the 26        content of the anticipated testimony of the support   10400HB1302sam002- 27 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        person; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 2        materiality of the anticipated testimony.3            If the prosecuting attorney intends to call the 4        support person as a witness during the State's 5        case-in-chief, the prosecuting attorney shall inform 6        the court of this intent in the response to the 7        defendant's written motion. The victim may choose a 8        different person to be the victim's support person. 9        The court may allow the defendant to inquire about 10        matters outside the scope of the direct examination 11        during cross-examination. If the court allows the 12        defendant to do so, the support person shall be 13        allowed to remain in the courtroom after the support 14        person has testified. A defendant who fails to 15        question the support person about matters outside the 16        scope of direct examination during the State's 17        case-in-chief waives the right to challenge the 18        presence of the support person on appeal. The court 19        shall allow the support person to testify if called as 20        a witness in the defendant's case-in-chief or the 21        State's rebuttal.22            If the court does not allow the defendant to 23        inquire about matters outside the scope of the direct 24        examination, the support person shall be allowed to 25        remain in the courtroom after the support person has 26        been called by the defendant or the defendant has   10400HB1302sam002- 28 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        rested. The court shall allow the support person to 2        testify in the State's rebuttal.3            If the prosecuting attorney does not intend to 4        call the support person in the State's case-in-chief, 5        the court shall verify with the support person whether 6        the support person, if called as a witness, would 7        testify as set forth in the offer of proof. If the 8        court finds that the support person would testify as 9        set forth in the offer of proof, the court shall rule 10        on the relevance, materiality, and admissibility of 11        the anticipated testimony. If the court rules the 12        anticipated testimony is admissible, the court shall 13        issue the subpoena. The support person may remain in 14        the courtroom after the support person testifies and 15        shall be allowed to testify in rebuttal.16            If the court excludes the victim's support person 17        during the State's case-in-chief, the victim shall be 18        allowed to choose another support person to be present 19        in court. 20            If the victim fails to designate a support person 21        within 60 days of trial and the defendant has 22        subpoenaed the support person to testify at trial, the 23        court may exclude the support person from the trial 24        until the support person testifies. If the court 25        excludes the support person the victim may choose 26        another person as a support person.   10400HB1302sam002- 29 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        (9) Right to notice and hearing before disclosure of 2    confidential or privileged information or records.3            (A) A defendant who seeks to subpoena testimony or 4        records of or concerning the victim that are 5        confidential or privileged by law must seek permission 6        of the court before the subpoena is issued. The 7        defendant must file a written motion and an offer of 8        proof regarding the relevance, admissibility and 9        materiality of the testimony or records. If the court 10        finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:11                (i) the testimony or records are not protected 12            by an absolute privilege and13                (ii) the testimony or records contain 14            relevant, admissible, and material evidence that 15            is not available through other witnesses or 16            evidence, the court shall issue a subpoena 17            requiring the witness to appear in camera or a 18            sealed copy of the records be delivered to the 19            court to be reviewed in camera. If, after 20            conducting an in camera review of the witness 21            statement or records, the court determines that 22            due process requires disclosure of any potential 23            testimony or any portion of the records, the court 24            shall provide copies of the records that it 25            intends to disclose to the prosecuting attorney 26            and the victim. The prosecuting attorney and the   10400HB1302sam002- 30 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1            victim shall have 30 days to seek appellate review 2            before the records are disclosed to the defendant, 3            used in any court proceeding, or disclosed to 4            anyone or in any way that would subject the 5            testimony or records to public review. The 6            disclosure of copies of any portion of the 7            testimony or records to the prosecuting attorney 8            under this Section does not make the records 9            subject to discovery or required to be provided to 10            the defendant.11            (B) A prosecuting attorney who seeks to subpoena 12        information or records concerning the victim that are 13        confidential or privileged by law must first request 14        the written consent of the crime victim. If the victim 15        does not provide such written consent, including where 16        necessary the appropriate signed document required for 17        waiving privilege, the prosecuting attorney must serve 18        the subpoena at least 21 days prior to the date a 19        response or appearance is required to allow the 20        subject of the subpoena time to file a motion to quash 21        or request a hearing. The prosecuting attorney must 22        also send a written notice to the victim at least 21 23        days prior to the response date to allow the victim to 24        file a motion or request a hearing. The notice to the 25        victim shall inform the victim (i) that a subpoena has 26        been issued for confidential information or records   10400HB1302sam002- 31 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        concerning the victim, (ii) that the victim has the 2        right to request a hearing prior to the response date 3        of the subpoena, and (iii) how to request the hearing. 4        The notice to the victim shall also include a copy of 5        the subpoena. If requested, a hearing regarding the 6        subpoena shall occur before information or records are 7        provided to the prosecuting attorney. 8        (10) Right to notice of court proceedings. If the 9    victim is not present at a court proceeding in which a 10    right of the victim is at issue, the court shall ask the 11    prosecuting attorney whether the victim was notified of 12    the time, place, and purpose of the court proceeding and 13    that the victim had a right to be heard at the court 14    proceeding. If the court determines that timely notice was 15    not given or that the victim was not adequately informed 16    of the nature of the court proceeding, the court shall not 17    rule on any substantive issues, accept a plea, or impose a 18    sentence and shall continue the hearing for the time 19    necessary to notify the victim of the time, place and 20    nature of the court proceeding. The time between court 21    proceedings shall not be attributable to the State under 22    Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.23        (11) Right to timely disposition of the case. A victim 24    has the right to timely disposition of the case so as to 25    minimize the stress, cost, and inconvenience resulting 26    from the victim's involvement in the case. Before ruling   10400HB1302sam002- 32 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1    on a motion to continue trial or other court proceeding, 2    the court shall inquire into the circumstances for the 3    request for the delay and, if the victim has provided 4    written notice of the assertion of the right to a timely 5    disposition, and whether the victim objects to the delay. 6    If the victim objects, the prosecutor shall inform the 7    court of the victim's objections. If the prosecutor has 8    not conferred with the victim about the continuance, the 9    prosecutor shall inform the court of the attempts to 10    confer. If the court finds the attempts of the prosecutor 11    to confer with the victim were inadequate to protect the 12    victim's right to be heard, the court shall give the 13    prosecutor at least 3 but not more than 5 business days to 14    confer with the victim. In ruling on a motion to continue, 15    the court shall consider the reasons for the requested 16    continuance, the number and length of continuances that 17    have been granted, the victim's objections and procedures 18    to avoid further delays. If a continuance is granted over 19    the victim's objection, the court shall specify on the 20    record the reasons for the continuance and the procedures 21    that have been or will be taken to avoid further delays.22        (12) Right to Restitution.23            (A) If the victim has asserted the right to 24        restitution and the amount of restitution is known at 25        the time of sentencing, the court shall enter the 26        judgment of restitution at the time of sentencing.   10400HB1302sam002- 33 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1            (B) If the victim has asserted the right to 2        restitution and the amount of restitution is not known 3        at the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall, 4        within 5 days after sentencing, notify the victim what 5        information and documentation related to restitution 6        is needed and that the information and documentation 7        must be provided to the prosecutor within 45 days 8        after sentencing. Failure to timely provide 9        information and documentation related to restitution 10        shall be deemed a waiver of the right to restitution. 11        The prosecutor shall file and serve within 60 days 12        after sentencing a proposed judgment for restitution 13        and a notice that includes information concerning the 14        identity of any victims or other persons seeking 15        restitution, whether any victim or other person 16        expressly declines restitution, the nature and amount 17        of any damages together with any supporting 18        documentation, a restitution amount recommendation, 19        and the names of any co-defendants and their case 20        numbers. Within 30 days after receipt of the proposed 21        judgment for restitution, the defendant shall file any 22        objection to the proposed judgment, a statement of 23        grounds for the objection, and a financial statement. 24        If the defendant does not file an objection, the court 25        may enter the judgment for restitution without further 26        proceedings. If the defendant files an objection and   10400HB1302sam002- 34 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        either party requests a hearing, the court shall 2        schedule a hearing. 3        (13) Access to presentence reports.4            (A) The victim may request a copy of the 5        presentence report prepared under the Unified Code of 6        Corrections from the State's Attorney. The State's 7        Attorney shall redact the following information before 8        providing a copy of the report:9                (i) the defendant's mental history and 10            condition;11                (ii) any evaluation prepared under subsection 12            (b) or (b-5) of Section 5-3-2; and13                (iii) the name, address, phone number, and 14            other personal information about any other victim.15            (B) The State's Attorney or the defendant may 16        request the court redact other information in the 17        report that may endanger the safety of any person.18            (C) The State's Attorney may orally disclose to 19        the victim any of the information that has been 20        redacted if there is a reasonable likelihood that the 21        information will be stated in court at the sentencing.22            (D) The State's Attorney must advise the victim 23        that the victim must maintain the confidentiality of 24        the report and other information. Any dissemination of 25        the report or information that was not stated at a 26        court proceeding constitutes indirect criminal   10400HB1302sam002- 35 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        contempt of court. 2        (14) Appellate relief. If the trial court denies the 3    relief requested, the victim, the victim's attorney, or 4    the prosecuting attorney may file an appeal within 30 days 5    of the trial court's ruling. The trial or appellate court 6    may stay the court proceedings if the court finds that a 7    stay would not violate a constitutional right of the 8    defendant. If the appellate court denies the relief 9    sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated 10    in a written opinion. In any appeal in a criminal case, the 11    State may assert as error the court's denial of any crime 12    victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal 13    relates.14        (15) Limitation on appellate relief. In no case shall 15    an appellate court provide a new trial to remedy the 16    violation of a victim's right. 17        (16) The right to be reasonably protected from the 18    accused throughout the criminal justice process and the 19    right to have the safety of the victim and the victim's 20    family considered in determining whether to release the 21    defendant, and setting conditions of release after arrest 22    and conviction. A victim of domestic violence, a sexual 23    offense, or stalking may request the entry of a protective 24    order under Article 112A of the Code of Criminal Procedure 25    of 1963. 26    (d) Procedures after the imposition of sentence.  10400HB1302sam002- 36 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        (1) The Prisoner Review Board shall inform a victim or 2    any other concerned citizen, upon written request, of the 3    prisoner's release on parole, mandatory supervised 4    release, electronic detention, work release, international 5    transfer or exchange, or by the custodian, other than the 6    Department of Juvenile Justice, of the discharge of any 7    individual who was adjudicated a delinquent for a crime 8    from State custody and by the sheriff of the appropriate 9    county of any such person's final discharge from county 10    custody. The Prisoner Review Board, upon written request, 11    shall provide to a victim or any other concerned citizen a 12    recent photograph of any person convicted of a felony, 13    upon his or her release from custody. The Prisoner Review 14    Board, upon written request, shall inform a victim or any 15    other concerned citizen when feasible at least 7 days 16    prior to the prisoner's release on furlough of the times 17    and dates of such furlough. Upon written request by the 18    victim or any other concerned citizen, the State's 19    Attorney shall notify the person once of the times and 20    dates of release of a prisoner sentenced to periodic 21    imprisonment. Notification shall be based on the most 22    recent information as to the victim's or other concerned 23    citizen's residence or other location available to the 24    notifying authority. 25        (2) When the defendant has been committed to the 26    Department of Human Services pursuant to Section 5-2-4 or   10400HB1302sam002- 37 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1    any other provision of the Unified Code of Corrections, 2    the victim may request to be notified by the releasing 3    authority of the approval by the court of an on-grounds 4    pass, a supervised off-grounds pass, an unsupervised 5    off-grounds pass, or conditional release; the release on 6    an off-grounds pass; the return from an off-grounds pass; 7    transfer to another facility; conditional release; escape; 8    death; or final discharge from State custody. The 9    Department of Human Services shall establish and maintain 10    a statewide telephone number to be used by victims to make 11    notification requests under these provisions and shall 12    publicize this telephone number on its website and to the 13    State's Attorney of each county.14        (3) In the event of an escape from State custody, the 15    Department of Corrections or the Department of Juvenile 16    Justice immediately shall notify the Prisoner Review Board 17    of the escape and the Prisoner Review Board shall notify 18    the victim. The notification shall be based upon the most 19    recent information as to the victim's residence or other 20    location available to the Board. When no such information 21    is available, the Board shall make all reasonable efforts 22    to obtain the information and make the notification. When 23    the escapee is apprehended, the Department of Corrections 24    or the Department of Juvenile Justice immediately shall 25    notify the Prisoner Review Board and the Board shall 26    notify the victim.  10400HB1302sam002- 38 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        (4) The victim of the crime for which the prisoner has 2    been sentenced has the right to register with the Prisoner 3    Review Board's victim registry. Victims registered with 4    the Board shall receive reasonable written notice not less 5    than 30 days prior to the parole hearing or target 6    aftercare release date. The victim has the right to submit 7    a victim statement for consideration by the Prisoner 8    Review Board or the Department of Juvenile Justice in 9    writing, on film, videotape, or other electronic means, or 10    in the form of a recording prior to the parole hearing or 11    target aftercare release date, or in person at the parole 12    hearing or aftercare release protest hearing, or by 13    calling the toll-free number established in subsection (f) 14    of this Section.

A victim may complete a written 26    notice of intent to assert rights on a form prepared by the   10400HB1302sam002- 19 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1    Office of the Attorney General and provided to the victim 2    by the State's Attorney. The victim may at any time 3    provide a revised written notice to the State's Attorney. 4    The State's Attorney shall file the written notice with 5    the court. At the beginning of any court proceeding in 6    which the right of a victim may be at issue, the court and 7    prosecutor shall review the written notice to determine 8    whether the victim has asserted the right that may be at 9    issue.10        (2) Victim's retained attorney. A victim's attorney 11    shall file an entry of appearance limited to assertion of 12    the victim's rights. Upon the filing of the entry of 13    appearance and service on the State's Attorney and the 14    defendant, the attorney is to receive copies of all 15    notices, motions and court orders filed thereafter in the 16    case.17        (3) Standing. The victim has standing to assert the 18    rights enumerated in subsection (a) of Article I, Section 19    8.1 of the Illinois Constitution and the statutory rights 20    under Section 4 of this Act in any court exercising 21    jurisdiction over the criminal case. The prosecuting 22    attorney, a victim, or the victim's retained attorney may 23    assert the victim's rights. The defendant in the criminal 24    case has no standing to assert a right of the victim in any 25    court proceeding, including on appeal.26        (4) Assertion of and enforcement of rights.  10400HB1302sam002- 20 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1            (A) The prosecuting attorney shall assert a 2        victim's right or request enforcement of a right by 3        filing a motion or by orally asserting the right or 4        requesting enforcement in open court in the criminal 5        case outside the presence of the jury. The prosecuting 6        attorney shall consult with the victim and the 7        victim's attorney regarding the assertion or 8        enforcement of a right. If the prosecuting attorney 9        decides not to assert or enforce a victim's right, the 10        prosecuting attorney shall notify the victim or the 11        victim's attorney in sufficient time to allow the 12        victim or the victim's attorney to assert the right or 13        to seek enforcement of a right.14            (B) If the prosecuting attorney elects not to 15        assert a victim's right or to seek enforcement of a 16        right, the victim or the victim's attorney may assert 17        the victim's right or request enforcement of a right 18        by filing a motion or by orally asserting the right or 19        requesting enforcement in open court in the criminal 20        case outside the presence of the jury.21            (C) If the prosecuting attorney asserts a victim's 22        right or seeks enforcement of a right, unless the 23        prosecuting attorney objects or the trial court does 24        not allow it, the victim or the victim's attorney may 25        be heard regarding the prosecuting attorney's motion 26        or may file a simultaneous motion to assert or request   10400HB1302sam002- 21 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        enforcement of the victim's right. If the victim or 2        the victim's attorney was not allowed to be heard at 3        the hearing regarding the prosecuting attorney's 4        motion, and the court denies the prosecuting 5        attorney's assertion of the right or denies the 6        request for enforcement of a right, the victim or 7        victim's attorney may file a motion to assert the 8        victim's right or to request enforcement of the right 9        within 10 days of the court's ruling. The motion need 10        not demonstrate the grounds for a motion for 11        reconsideration. The court shall rule on the merits of 12        the motion.13            (D) The court shall take up and decide any motion 14        or request asserting or seeking enforcement of a 15        victim's right without delay, unless a specific time 16        period is specified by law or court rule. The reasons 17        for any decision denying the motion or request shall 18        be clearly stated on the record.19            (E) No later than January 1, 2023, the Office of 20        the Attorney General shall: 21                (i) designate an administrative authority 22            within the Office of the Attorney General to 23            receive and investigate complaints relating to the 24            provision or violation of the rights of a crime 25            victim as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 26            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act;  10400HB1302sam002- 22 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1                (ii) create and administer a course of 2            training for employees and offices of the State of 3            Illinois that fail to comply with provisions of 4            Illinois law pertaining to the treatment of crime 5            victims as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 6            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act as 7            required by the court under Section 5 of this Act; 8            and9                (iii) have the authority to make 10            recommendations to employees and offices of the 11            State of Illinois to respond more effectively to 12            the needs of crime victims, including regarding 13            the violation of the rights of a crime victim.14            (F) Crime victims' rights may also be asserted by 15        filing a complaint for mandamus, injunctive, or 16        declaratory relief in the jurisdiction in which the 17        victim's right is being violated or where the crime is 18        being prosecuted. For complaints or motions filed by 19        or on behalf of the victim, the clerk of court shall 20        waive filing fees that would otherwise be owed by the 21        victim for any court filing with the purpose of 22        enforcing crime victims' rights. If the court denies 23        the relief sought by the victim, the reasons for the 24        denial shall be clearly stated on the record in the 25        transcript of the proceedings, in a written opinion, 26        or in the docket entry, and the victim may appeal the   10400HB1302sam002- 23 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        circuit court's decision to the appellate court. The 2        court shall issue prompt rulings regarding victims' 3        rights. Proceedings seeking to enforce victims' rights 4        shall not be stayed or subject to unreasonable delay 5        via continuances. 6        (5) Violation of rights and remedies. 7            (A) If the court determines that a victim's right 8        has been violated, the court shall determine the 9        appropriate remedy for the violation of the victim's 10        right by hearing from the victim and the parties, 11        considering all factors relevant to the issue, and 12        then awarding appropriate relief to the victim.13            (A-5) Consideration of an issue of a substantive 14        nature or an issue that implicates the constitutional 15        or statutory right of a victim at a court proceeding 16        labeled as a status hearing shall constitute a per se 17        violation of a victim's right. 18            (B) The appropriate remedy shall include only 19        actions necessary to provide the victim the right to 20        which the victim was entitled. Remedies may include, 21        but are not limited to: injunctive relief requiring 22        the victim's right to be afforded; declaratory 23        judgment recognizing or clarifying the victim's 24        rights; a writ of mandamus; and may include reopening 25        previously held proceedings; however, in no event 26        shall the court vacate a conviction. Any remedy shall   10400HB1302sam002- 24 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        be tailored to provide the victim an appropriate 2        remedy without violating any constitutional right of 3        the defendant. In no event shall the appropriate 4        remedy to the victim be a new trial or damages.5        The court shall impose a mandatory training course 6    provided by the Attorney General for the employee under 7    item (ii) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph (4), which must 8    be successfully completed within 6 months of the entry of 9    the court order.10        This paragraph (5) takes effect January 2, 2023.11        (6) Right to be heard. Whenever a victim has the right 12    to be heard, the court shall allow the victim to exercise 13    the right in any reasonable manner the victim chooses.14        (7) Right to attend trial. A party must file a written 15    motion to exclude a victim from trial at least 60 days 16    prior to the date set for trial. The motion must state with 17    specificity the reason exclusion is necessary to protect a 18    constitutional right of the party, and must contain an 19    offer of proof. The court shall rule on the motion within 20    30 days. If the motion is granted, the court shall set 21    forth on the record the facts that support its finding 22    that the victim's testimony will be materially affected if 23    the victim hears other testimony at trial.24        (8) Right to have advocate and support person present 25    at court proceedings.26            (A) A party who intends to call an advocate as a   10400HB1302sam002- 25 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        witness at trial must seek permission of the court 2        before the subpoena is issued. The party must file a 3        written motion at least 90 days before trial that sets 4        forth specifically the issues on which the advocate's 5        testimony is sought and an offer of proof regarding 6        (i) the content of the anticipated testimony of the 7        advocate; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 8        materiality of the anticipated testimony. The court 9        shall consider the motion and make findings within 30 10        days of the filing of the motion. If the court finds by 11        a preponderance of the evidence that: (i) the 12        anticipated testimony is not protected by an absolute 13        privilege; and (ii) the anticipated testimony contains 14        relevant, admissible, and material evidence that is 15        not available through other witnesses or evidence, the 16        court shall issue a subpoena requiring the advocate to 17        appear to testify at an in camera hearing. The 18        prosecuting attorney and the victim shall have 15 days 19        to seek appellate review before the advocate is 20        required to testify at an ex parte in camera 21        proceeding. 22            The prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the 23        advocate's attorney shall be allowed to be present at 24        the ex parte in camera proceeding. If, after 25        conducting the ex parte in camera hearing, the court 26        determines that due process requires any testimony   10400HB1302sam002- 26 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        regarding confidential or privileged information or 2        communications, the court shall provide to the 3        prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the advocate's 4        attorney a written memorandum on the substance of the 5        advocate's testimony. The prosecuting attorney, the 6        victim, and the advocate's attorney shall have 15 days 7        to seek appellate review before a subpoena may be 8        issued for the advocate to testify at trial. The 9        presence of the prosecuting attorney at the ex parte 10        in camera proceeding does not make the substance of 11        the advocate's testimony that the court has ruled 12        inadmissible subject to discovery.13            (B) If a victim has asserted the right to have a 14        support person present at the court proceedings, the 15        victim shall provide the name of the person the victim 16        has chosen to be the victim's support person to the 17        prosecuting attorney, within 60 days of trial. The 18        prosecuting attorney shall provide the name to the 19        defendant. If the defendant intends to call the 20        support person as a witness at trial, the defendant 21        must seek permission of the court before a subpoena is 22        issued. The defendant must file a written motion at 23        least 45 days prior to trial that sets forth 24        specifically the issues on which the support person 25        will testify and an offer of proof regarding: (i) the 26        content of the anticipated testimony of the support   10400HB1302sam002- 27 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        person; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 2        materiality of the anticipated testimony.3            If the prosecuting attorney intends to call the 4        support person as a witness during the State's 5        case-in-chief, the prosecuting attorney shall inform 6        the court of this intent in the response to the 7        defendant's written motion. The victim may choose a 8        different person to be the victim's support person. 9        The court may allow the defendant to inquire about 10        matters outside the scope of the direct examination 11        during cross-examination. If the court allows the 12        defendant to do so, the support person shall be 13        allowed to remain in the courtroom after the support 14        person has testified. A defendant who fails to 15        question the support person about matters outside the 16        scope of direct examination during the State's 17        case-in-chief waives the right to challenge the 18        presence of the support person on appeal. The court 19        shall allow the support person to testify if called as 20        a witness in the defendant's case-in-chief or the 21        State's rebuttal.22            If the court does not allow the defendant to 23        inquire about matters outside the scope of the direct 24        examination, the support person shall be allowed to 25        remain in the courtroom after the support person has 26        been called by the defendant or the defendant has   10400HB1302sam002- 28 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        rested. The court shall allow the support person to 2        testify in the State's rebuttal.3            If the prosecuting attorney does not intend to 4        call the support person in the State's case-in-chief, 5        the court shall verify with the support person whether 6        the support person, if called as a witness, would 7        testify as set forth in the offer of proof. If the 8        court finds that the support person would testify as 9        set forth in the offer of proof, the court shall rule 10        on the relevance, materiality, and admissibility of 11        the anticipated testimony. If the court rules the 12        anticipated testimony is admissible, the court shall 13        issue the subpoena. The support person may remain in 14        the courtroom after the support person testifies and 15        shall be allowed to testify in rebuttal.16            If the court excludes the victim's support person 17        during the State's case-in-chief, the victim shall be 18        allowed to choose another support person to be present 19        in court. 20            If the victim fails to designate a support person 21        within 60 days of trial and the defendant has 22        subpoenaed the support person to testify at trial, the 23        court may exclude the support person from the trial 24        until the support person testifies. If the court 25        excludes the support person the victim may choose 26        another person as a support person.   10400HB1302sam002- 29 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        (9) Right to notice and hearing before disclosure of 2    confidential or privileged information or records.3            (A) A defendant who seeks to subpoena testimony or 4        records of or concerning the victim that are 5        confidential or privileged by law must seek permission 6        of the court before the subpoena is issued. The 7        defendant must file a written motion and an offer of 8        proof regarding the relevance, admissibility and 9        materiality of the testimony or records. If the court 10        finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:11                (i) the testimony or records are not protected 12            by an absolute privilege and13                (ii) the testimony or records contain 14            relevant, admissible, and material evidence that 15            is not available through other witnesses or 16            evidence, the court shall issue a subpoena 17            requiring the witness to appear in camera or a 18            sealed copy of the records be delivered to the 19            court to be reviewed in camera. If, after 20            conducting an in camera review of the witness 21            statement or records, the court determines that 22            due process requires disclosure of any potential 23            testimony or any portion of the records, the court 24            shall provide copies of the records that it 25            intends to disclose to the prosecuting attorney 26            and the victim. The prosecuting attorney and the   10400HB1302sam002- 30 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1            victim shall have 30 days to seek appellate review 2            before the records are disclosed to the defendant, 3            used in any court proceeding, or disclosed to 4            anyone or in any way that would subject the 5            testimony or records to public review. The 6            disclosure of copies of any portion of the 7            testimony or records to the prosecuting attorney 8            under this Section does not make the records 9            subject to discovery or required to be provided to 10            the defendant.11            (B) A prosecuting attorney who seeks to subpoena 12        information or records concerning the victim that are 13        confidential or privileged by law must first request 14        the written consent of the crime victim. If the victim 15        does not provide such written consent, including where 16        necessary the appropriate signed document required for 17        waiving privilege, the prosecuting attorney must serve 18        the subpoena at least 21 days prior to the date a 19        response or appearance is required to allow the 20        subject of the subpoena time to file a motion to quash 21        or request a hearing. The prosecuting attorney must 22        also send a written notice to the victim at least 21 23        days prior to the response date to allow the victim to 24        file a motion or request a hearing. The notice to the 25        victim shall inform the victim (i) that a subpoena has 26        been issued for confidential information or records   10400HB1302sam002- 31 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        concerning the victim, (ii) that the victim has the 2        right to request a hearing prior to the response date 3        of the subpoena, and (iii) how to request the hearing. 4        The notice to the victim shall also include a copy of 5        the subpoena. If requested, a hearing regarding the 6        subpoena shall occur before information or records are 7        provided to the prosecuting attorney. 8        (10) Right to notice of court proceedings. If the 9    victim is not present at a court proceeding in which a 10    right of the victim is at issue, the court shall ask the 11    prosecuting attorney whether the victim was notified of 12    the time, place, and purpose of the court proceeding and 13    that the victim had a right to be heard at the court 14    proceeding. If the court determines that timely notice was 15    not given or that the victim was not adequately informed 16    of the nature of the court proceeding, the court shall not 17    rule on any substantive issues, accept a plea, or impose a 18    sentence and shall continue the hearing for the time 19    necessary to notify the victim of the time, place and 20    nature of the court proceeding. The time between court 21    proceedings shall not be attributable to the State under 22    Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.23        (11) Right to timely disposition of the case. A victim 24    has the right to timely disposition of the case so as to 25    minimize the stress, cost, and inconvenience resulting 26    from the victim's involvement in the case. Before ruling   10400HB1302sam002- 32 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1    on a motion to continue trial or other court proceeding, 2    the court shall inquire into the circumstances for the 3    request for the delay and, if the victim has provided 4    written notice of the assertion of the right to a timely 5    disposition, and whether the victim objects to the delay. 6    If the victim objects, the prosecutor shall inform the 7    court of the victim's objections. If the prosecutor has 8    not conferred with the victim about the continuance, the 9    prosecutor shall inform the court of the attempts to 10    confer. If the court finds the attempts of the prosecutor 11    to confer with the victim were inadequate to protect the 12    victim's right to be heard, the court shall give the 13    prosecutor at least 3 but not more than 5 business days to 14    confer with the victim. In ruling on a motion to continue, 15    the court shall consider the reasons for the requested 16    continuance, the number and length of continuances that 17    have been granted, the victim's objections and procedures 18    to avoid further delays. If a continuance is granted over 19    the victim's objection, the court shall specify on the 20    record the reasons for the continuance and the procedures 21    that have been or will be taken to avoid further delays.22        (12) Right to Restitution.23            (A) If the victim has asserted the right to 24        restitution and the amount of restitution is known at 25        the time of sentencing, the court shall enter the 26        judgment of restitution at the time of sentencing.   10400HB1302sam002- 33 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1            (B) If the victim has asserted the right to 2        restitution and the amount of restitution is not known 3        at the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall, 4        within 5 days after sentencing, notify the victim what 5        information and documentation related to restitution 6        is needed and that the information and documentation 7        must be provided to the prosecutor within 45 days 8        after sentencing. Failure to timely provide 9        information and documentation related to restitution 10        shall be deemed a waiver of the right to restitution. 11        The prosecutor shall file and serve within 60 days 12        after sentencing a proposed judgment for restitution 13        and a notice that includes information concerning the 14        identity of any victims or other persons seeking 15        restitution, whether any victim or other person 16        expressly declines restitution, the nature and amount 17        of any damages together with any supporting 18        documentation, a restitution amount recommendation, 19        and the names of any co-defendants and their case 20        numbers. Within 30 days after receipt of the proposed 21        judgment for restitution, the defendant shall file any 22        objection to the proposed judgment, a statement of 23        grounds for the objection, and a financial statement. 24        If the defendant does not file an objection, the court 25        may enter the judgment for restitution without further 26        proceedings. If the defendant files an objection and   10400HB1302sam002- 34 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        either party requests a hearing, the court shall 2        schedule a hearing. 3        (13) Access to presentence reports.4            (A) The victim may request a copy of the 5        presentence report prepared under the Unified Code of 6        Corrections from the State's Attorney. The State's 7        Attorney shall redact the following information before 8        providing a copy of the report:9                (i) the defendant's mental history and 10            condition;11                (ii) any evaluation prepared under subsection 12            (b) or (b-5) of Section 5-3-2; and13                (iii) the name, address, phone number, and 14            other personal information about any other victim.15            (B) The State's Attorney or the defendant may 16        request the court redact other information in the 17        report that may endanger the safety of any person.18            (C) The State's Attorney may orally disclose to 19        the victim any of the information that has been 20        redacted if there is a reasonable likelihood that the 21        information will be stated in court at the sentencing.22            (D) The State's Attorney must advise the victim 23        that the victim must maintain the confidentiality of 24        the report and other information. Any dissemination of 25        the report or information that was not stated at a 26        court proceeding constitutes indirect criminal   10400HB1302sam002- 35 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        contempt of court. 2        (14) Appellate relief. If the trial court denies the 3    relief requested, the victim, the victim's attorney, or 4    the prosecuting attorney may file an appeal within 30 days 5    of the trial court's ruling. The trial or appellate court 6    may stay the court proceedings if the court finds that a 7    stay would not violate a constitutional right of the 8    defendant. If the appellate court denies the relief 9    sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated 10    in a written opinion. In any appeal in a criminal case, the 11    State may assert as error the court's denial of any crime 12    victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal 13    relates.14        (15) Limitation on appellate relief. In no case shall 15    an appellate court provide a new trial to remedy the 16    violation of a victim's right. 17        (16) The right to be reasonably protected from the 18    accused throughout the criminal justice process and the 19    right to have the safety of the victim and the victim's 20    family considered in determining whether to release the 21    defendant, and setting conditions of release after arrest 22    and conviction. A victim of domestic violence, a sexual 23    offense, or stalking may request the entry of a protective 24    order under Article 112A of the Code of Criminal Procedure 25    of 1963. 26    (d) Procedures after the imposition of sentence.  10400HB1302sam002- 36 -LRB104 05519 RLC 26830 a1        (1) The Prisoner Review Board shall inform a victim or 2    any other concerned citizen, upon written request, of the 3    prisoner's release on parole, mandatory supervised 4    release, electronic detention, work release, international 5    transfer or exchange, or by the custodian, other than the 6    Department of Juvenile Justice, of the discharge of any 7    individual who was adjudicated a delinquent for a crime 8    from State custody and by the sheriff of the appropriate 9    county of any such person's final discharge from county 10    custody.
