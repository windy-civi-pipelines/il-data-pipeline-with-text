The employer shall notify the employee that 18the employee is still responsible for paying the employee's 19share of the cost of the health care coverage, if any. 20    (n) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to interfere with, 21impede, or in any way diminish the right of employees to 22bargain collectively with their employers through 23representatives of their own choosing in order to establish 24wages or other conditions of work in excess of the applicable 25minimum standards established in this Act.

Exception for first responders.7    (a) A public safety agency may, in lieu of the paid leave 8provided for in Section 15, pay a first responder that is 9employed by the public safety agency the equivalent of the 10first responder's hourly rate of pay multiplied by the number 11of hours of paid leave that the first responder is entitled to 12under Section 15. A first responder is eligible for this 13payment if the first responder has been continuously employed 14by the public safety agency for at least 60 days. A payment 15under this subsection shall be paid to a first responder in its 16entirety once per calendar year.17    (b) Upon hiring a first responder, a public safety agency 18shall provide notice to the first responder of the public 19safety agency's payment-in-lieu-of-leave policy. A public 20safety agency shall provide all currently employed first 21responders with notice at least 30 days before the public 22safety agency makes a change to its payment-in-lieu-of-leave 23policy, after which the first responder shall stop accruing 24paid leave time and be entitled to the payment described in 25subsection (a). For any paid leave that a first responder has   SB2069- 13 -LRB104 10276 SPS 20350 b1accrued prior to a public safety agency's decision to change 2its payment-in-lieu-of-leave policy, the first responder shall 3have the option to either use that paid leave or convert it to 4an hourly benefit payment to be paid in addition to the base 5payment described in subsection (a).6    (c) The provisions of this Section do not affect an 7employee's eligibility for any other leave provided by State 8or federal law.
