Any 11information provided by the person in accordance with this 12subsection is exempt under the Freedom of Information Act and 13shall not be disclosed to the public by the Attorney General. 14Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, if it 15appears to the Attorney General that the person has engaged in 16or is engaging in any practice declared to be in violation of 17this Section and that legal proceedings would be in the public 18interest, the Attorney General may disclose any information 19provided under this subsection in support of the filing of an 20action in the circuit court.21    (f) Whether a price is unconscionably high is a question 22of law for the court. In any proceeding commenced under this 23Section, prima facie proof that a violation of this Section 24has occurred shall include evidence that: (i) the amount 25charged represents a gross disparity between the price of the 26goods or services which were the subject of the transaction   SB1932- 15 -LRB104 10202 SPS 20276 b1and their value measured by the price at which the goods or 2services were sold or offered for sale by the defendant in the 3usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the 4declared disaster; or (ii) the amount charged grossly exceeded 5the price at which the same or similar goods or services were 6readily obtainable in the trade area. A defendant may rebut a 7prima facie case with evidence that: (i) the increase in the 8amount charged preserves the margin of profit that the 9defendant received for the same goods or services prior to the 10declared disaster; or (ii) additional costs not within the 11control of the defendant were imposed on the defendant for the 12goods or services.

The Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business 3Practices Act is amended by adding Section 2HHHH as follows: 4    (815 ILCS 505/2HHHH new)5    Sec. 2HHHH. Price gouging during a disaster.6    (a) As used in this Section:7    "Building materials" means lumber, construction tools, 8windows, and anything else used in the building or rebuilding 9of property.10    "Consumer food item or good" means any article that is 11used or intended for use as food, drink, confection, or 12condiment by a person or animal.13    "Emergency supplies" includes, but are not limited to, 14water, flashlights, radios, batteries, candles, blankets, 15soaps, diapers, temporary shelters, tape, toiletries, plywood, 16nails, and hammers.17    "Goods" means tangible chattels bought for use primarily 18for personal, family, or household purposes.19    "Medical supplies" includes, but are not limited to, 20prescription and nonprescription medications, bandages, gauze, 21isopropyl alcohol, and antibacterial products.22    "Repair or reconstruction services" means services 23performed by any person for repairs to residential or 24commercial property of any type that is damaged as a result of   SB1932- 12 -LRB104 10202 SPS 20276 b1a disaster.2    "Transportation, freight, or storage services" means 3services performed by any company that contracts to move, 4store, or transport personal or business property or that 5rents equipment for those purposes, including towing services. 6    (b) It is an unlawful practice within the meaning of this 7Act, for a period of 45 days after a disaster is declared by 8the President of the United States or the Governor, for any 9person to sell or offer to sell to a consumer in the designated 10disaster area any consumer food items or goods, goods or 11services used for emergency cleanup or response, emergency 12supplies, medical supplies, home heating oil, building 13materials, housing, lodging, transportation, freight, or 14storage services, fuel, gasoline, or other motor fuels, repair 15or reconstruction services, or any other necessity for an 16unconscionably high price.17    (c) For purposes of this Section, a price is 18unconscionably high if:19        (1) the amount charged represents a gross disparity 20    between the price of the good or service; and21            (A) the price at which the same good or service was 22        sold or offered for sale by the person in the usual 23        course of business immediately before the disaster 24        declaration;25            (B) if the person did not sell or offer for sale 26        the goods or services immediately before the disaster   SB1932- 13 -LRB104 10202 SPS 20276 b1        declaration, the price at which similar goods or 2        services were offered for sale or sold by a similarly 3        situated person in the usual course of business 4        immediately before the disaster declaration; or 5            (C) the price at which the same similar good or 6        service is readily obtainable by other buyers in the 7        disaster area; and8        (2) the disparity is not directly attributable to 9    increased prices charged by the related business 10    suppliers, additional costs for labor or materials to 11    provide the good or service, or other increased costs not 12    within the control of the person.13    (d) For purposes of this Section, a price is not 14unconscionably high if: 15        (1) the increase in price was directly attributable to 16    additional costs imposed on the person by the supplier of 17    the goods or directly attributable to additional costs for 18    labor or materials used to provide the services during the 19    declared disaster; or20        (2) if a good or service was offered at a reduced price 21    by the person before the declared disaster, the price is 22    the same as the price the person normally charges for the 23    good or service.24    (e) If the Attorney General has reason to believe that a 25person has violated this Section, the Attorney General may 26send a notice to that person requesting a statement that   SB1932- 14 -LRB104 10202 SPS 20276 b1includes:2        (1) an itemized list of the components and costs of 3    producing the good or service;4        (2) the specified circumstances and timing of any 5    additional costs for labor or materials to provide the 6    good or service that caused the price to increase; and7        (3) any other information the Attorney General deems 8    relevant with respect to its investigation.9    No later than 45 days after receiving the notice, the 10person shall submit a response to the Attorney General. Any 11information provided by the person in accordance with this 12subsection is exempt under the Freedom of Information Act and 13shall not be disclosed to the public by the Attorney General. 14Notwithstanding the other provisions of this subsection, if it 15appears to the Attorney General that the person has engaged in 16or is engaging in any practice declared to be in violation of 17this Section and that legal proceedings would be in the public 18interest, the Attorney General may disclose any information 19provided under this subsection in support of the filing of an 20action in the circuit court.21    (f) Whether a price is unconscionably high is a question 22of law for the court. In any proceeding commenced under this 23Section, prima facie proof that a violation of this Section 24has occurred shall include evidence that: (i) the amount 25charged represents a gross disparity between the price of the 26goods or services which were the subject of the transaction   SB1932- 15 -LRB104 10202 SPS 20276 b1and their value measured by the price at which the goods or 2services were sold or offered for sale by the defendant in the 3usual course of business immediately prior to the onset of the 4declared disaster; or (ii) the amount charged grossly exceeded 5the price at which the same or similar goods or services were 6readily obtainable in the trade area. A defendant may rebut a 7prima facie case with evidence that: (i) the increase in the 8amount charged preserves the margin of profit that the 9defendant received for the same goods or services prior to the 10declared disaster; or (ii) additional costs not within the 11control of the defendant were imposed on the defendant for the 12goods or services.
