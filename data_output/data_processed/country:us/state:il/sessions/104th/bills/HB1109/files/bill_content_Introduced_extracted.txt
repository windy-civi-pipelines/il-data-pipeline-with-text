The General Assembly also believes 16that it is the responsibility of families to share in the costs 17of child care. It is also the preference of the General 18Assembly that all working families with limited access to 19economic resources should be treated equally, regardless of 20their welfare status.21    (b) To the extent resources permit, the Illinois 22Department shall provide child care services to parents or 23other relatives as defined by rule who are working or   HB1109- 2 -LRB104 03847 KTG 13871 b1participating in employment or Department approved education 2or training programs.
