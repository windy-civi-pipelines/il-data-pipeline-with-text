Short title. This Act may be cited as the Health 5Care Transparency Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that:7        (1) The right of every patient to receive basic 8    information necessary to give full and informed consent is 9    a fundamental tenet of good public health policy and has 10    long been the established law of this State.11        (2) Every person having ultimate responsibility for 12    decisions respecting their own health care also possesses 13    a concomitant right of access to complete information 14    respecting their condition and care provided.15        (3) For nonmedical reasons, some health care 16    facilities do not provide a full range of health care 17    services and may prohibit, significantly restrict, or 18    otherwise refuse to provide services such as 19    sterilization, infertility treatments, abortion, or 20    contraceptive services, including emergency 21    contraception.22        (4) Health care facilities may also deny or 23    selectively restrict care relating to stigmatized   HB2904- 2 -LRB104 05596 BAB 15626 b1    populations, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, 2    transgender, and queer individuals, for nonmedical reasons 3    even if equivalent procedures are provided for other 4    patients.5        (5) Persons seeking health care frequently lack 6    information about which facilities refuse to provide 7    various health care services for nonmedical reasons and 8    what services they restrict or refuse to provide.9        (6) Patients are not well-positioned to understand 10    what treatment options are available to them when health 11    facilities do not disclose treatment options that they 12    refuse to provide for nonmedical reasons.13        (7) Consequently, when health care facilities do not 14    disclose that they restrict or refuse to provide various 15    health care services for nonmedical reasons, they can 16    deprive patients of a knowledgeable choice as to 17    alternative treatments, which is inconsistent with the 18    underlying principle of informed consent.19        (8) Refusals to provide health care services for 20    nonmedical reasons may:21            (A) have long-term negative consequences, 22        resulting in injury, disability, and death;23            (B) cause trauma to patients;24            (C) impact quality of life;25            (D) result in greater health care expenses for 26        patient and payers; and  HB2904- 3 -LRB104 05596 BAB 15626 b1            (E) some denials of care violate State and federal 2        law.3        (9) It is the intent of the General Assembly to ensure 4    that patients are given full information about available 5    health care services frequently subject to denial of care 6    for nonmedical reasons to allow them to make well-informed 7    health care decisions. 8    Section 10.
