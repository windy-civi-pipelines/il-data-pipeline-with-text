After the roll call is taken, the Senator requesting 2the verification may withdraw his or her request. If the 3question fails to receive the required affirmative votes, the 4verification will be deemed withdrawn. The verification rules 5of this subsection (a) apply only while the Senate is 6convening outside of the State Capitol building.  7    (b) In verifying a roll call vote, the Presiding Officer 8shall instruct the Secretary to call the names of those 9Senators whose votes are to be verified. The Senator 10requesting the verification may thereafter identify those 11members he or she wishes to verify. If a member does not 12answer, his or her vote shall be stricken; however, the 13member's vote shall be restored to the roll if his or her 14presence is recognized before the verification is completed. 15The Presiding Officer shall determine the presence or absence 16of each member whose name is called, and shall then announce 17the results of the verification. 18    (c) While the results of any roll call are being verified, 19it is in order for any Senator to announce his or her presence 20on the floor and thereby have his or her vote verified. 21    (d) A request for a verification of the affirmative and 22negative results of a roll call may be made only once on each 23roll call.   SR0004- 86 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1    (e) No Senator shall be permitted to vote or to change his 2or her vote on verification.3(Source: S.R. 8, 103rd G.A.) 4    (Senate Rule 7-7)5    7-7. Appealing a Ruling. 6    (a) If any appeal is taken from a ruling of the Presiding 7Officer, the Presiding Officer shall be sustained unless 8three-fifths of the members elected vote to overrule the 9Presiding Officer.

Division of Question. If the question in debate 22contains several points, any Senator may have the same 23divided. On a motion to strike out and insert, it is not in   SR0004- 91 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1order to move for a division of the question. The rejection of 2a motion to strike out and insert one proposition does not 3prevent a motion to strike out and insert a different 4proposition.5(Source: S.R. 8, 103rd G.A.) 6    (Senate Rule 7-15)7    7-15. Reconsideration. 8    (a) A member who voted on the prevailing side of a record 9vote on a legislative measure that failed and that is still 10within the control of the Senate may on the same or following 11day move to reconsider the vote.

The appearance of the nominee may be 15waived by the Chair of the committee without objection by the 16other members of the committee. If a member of the committee 17objects to the waiver of the nominee's appearance by the 18Chair, the committee by a vote of a majority of those appointed 19may waive such appearance. 20    (b) The Executive Appointments Committee or another 21committee in accordance with these Senate Rules shall, six 22days prior to any of its meetings, post a notice on the Senate 23bulletin board or make the notice electronically available   SR0004- 109 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1indicating the nominees to be considered at its next meeting 2and the time, date, and place of the meeting.

The Chair of the Executive 15Appointments Committee may, by a motion in writing approved by 16a majority of the members present and voting compile a list of 17individual Appointment Messages to be acted on together by a 18single vote. Whenever a list of Appointment Messages has been 19so compiled, five or more members may request the question be 20put and the vote separately taken upon each of the Appointment 21Messages on that list. The Senate may determine, by a majority 22vote of those elected, after having voted upon the question of 23one or more of the Appointment Messages individually, to act 24upon the question of the remaining Appointment Messages on 25that list as a unit.   SR0004- 110 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1    (c-5) After a committee has reported to the Senate any 2Appointment Message "do not recommend consent" pursuant to 3subsection (a) of Rule 3-11, the Chair of the Executive 4Appointments Committee shall move that the Appointment Message 5(or Appointment Messages) be placed on the Denial of 6Appointment Calendar under the order of Executive 7Appointments. A motion to place an Appointment Message on the 8Denial of Appointment Calendar is neither debatable, subject 9to division under Rule 7-14, nor subject to a motion to 10reconsider under Rule 7-15. The Presiding Officer shall put 11the following question: "Shall the Senate place Appointment 12Message (or Messages) (insert number or numbers) on the Denial 13of Appointment Calendar which shall constitute the Senate's 14rejection of that Message (or those Messages) on its 60th 15session day under our Rules?" Upon adoption of the motion by a 16majority vote, the Secretary shall place an Appointment 17Message on the Denial of Appointment Calendar under the order 18of Executive Appointments.19    After a committee has reported to the Senate any 20Appointment Message "without recommendation" pursuant to 21subsection (a) of Rule 3-11, the Chair of the Executive 22Appointments Committee may move that the Appointment Message 23(or Appointment Messages) be placed on the Denial of 24Appointment Calendar under the order of Executive 25Appointments. A motion to place an Appointment Message on the   SR0004- 111 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1Denial of Appointment Calendar is neither debatable, subject 2to division under Rule 7-14, nor subject to a motion to 3reconsider under Rule 7-15. The Presiding Officer shall put 4the following question: "Shall the Senate place the 5Appointment Message (or Messages) (insert number or numbers) 6on the Denial of Appointment Calendar which shall constitute 7the Senate's rejection of that Message (or those Messages) on 8its 60th session day under our Rules?" Upon adoption of the 9motion by majority vote, the Secretary shall place an 10Appointment Message on the Denial of Appointment Calendar 11under the order of Executive Appointments.12    The Secretary shall set forth for each applicable 13Appointment Message on the Denial of Appointment Calendar the 14number, name of the nominee, and the title of the office, 15agency or other body to which nomination is being made. The 16Denial of Appointment Calendar shall also state the number of 17session days that have elapsed since each Appointment Message 18was received by the Senate. The Secretary shall distribute the 19Denial of Appointment Calendar to each member of the Senate as 20a component of the Senate Calendar for each session day other 21than a perfunctory session day. The Secretary shall make the 22Denial of Appointment Calendar available to the public. 23    An Appointment Message shall be removed from the Denial of 24Appointment Calendar if a written objection stating the number 25of the Appointment Message to be removed is filed with the 26Secretary on or before the 59th session day after the day the   SR0004- 112 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1Appointment Message was received by the Senate, and the 2objection contains the signature of a majority of the members 3elected. Upon the filing of a proper written objection, the 4Secretary shall remove the relevant Appointment Message from 5the Denial of Appointment Calendar and automatically place the 6Appointment Message on the Senate Calendar under the order of 7Executive Appointments. 8    An Appointment Message shall be removed from the Denial of 9Appointment Calendar if, upon concurrence of a majority of 10those appointed, the Committee on Assignments adopts a motion 11to remove that Appointment Message on or before the 59th 12session day after the day the Appointment Message was received 13by the Senate. Upon this action of the Committee on 14Assignments, the Secretary shall remove the relevant 15Appointment Message from the Denial of Appointment Calendar 16and automatically place the Appointment Message on the Senate 17Calendar under the order of Executive Appointments, unless the 18Committee on Assignments has referred the Appointment Message 19to a committee for further action.20    If neither the Committee on Assignments takes action to 21remove an Appointment Message from the Denial of Appointment 22Calendar, nor a proper written objection to an Appointment 23Message on the Denial of Appointment Calendar is filed with 24the Secretary as required under this Rule, then that 25Appointment Message shall remain on the Denial of Appointment 26Calendar. A motion to place an Appointment Message (or   SR0004- 113 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1Appointment Messages) on the Denial of Appointment Calendar 2adopted by the Senate shall constitute the Senate's rejection 3of each Appointment Message on the Denial of Appointment 4Calendar on the 60th session day after the day the Appointment 5Message was received by the Senate. Each Appointment Message 6remaining on the Denial of Appointment Calendar on the 60th 7session day after the day the Appointment Message was received 8by the Senate shall be deemed to have not received the advice 9and consent of the Senate and thereby rejected by the Senate 10pursuant to Article V, Section 9 of the Illinois Constitution.11    On the 60th session day for each Appointment Message on 12the Denial of Appointment Calendar, the Presiding Officer 13shall make the following inquiry of the Secretary: "Please 14identify each Appointment Message on the Denial of Appointment 15Calendar that is on its 60th session day." After the Secretary 16identifies the relevant Appointment Message or Appointment 17Messages, the Presiding Officer shall make the following 18declaration: "Each Appointment Message just read is on its 1960th session day and remains on the Denial of Appointment 20Calendar; therefore each such Message, pursuant to our Rules, 21is deemed to have not received the advice and consent of the 22Senate and is hereby rejected by the Senate pursuant to 23Article V, Section 9 of the Illinois Constitution.

Unless 7otherwise provided by these Senate Rules, a motion to postpone 8consideration shall be made prior to intervening business and 9shall be granted as a matter of privilege. However, no motion 10to postpone consideration is in order if the involved 11legislative measure (1) initially received a vote of fewer 12than two-fifths of the members elected or (2) is an 13Appointment Message.14(Source: S.R. 8, 103rd G.A.) 15    (Senate Rule 7-13)16    7-13.

Reconsideration. 8    (a) A member who voted on the prevailing side of a record 9vote on a legislative measure that failed and that is still 10within the control of the Senate may on the same or following 11day move to reconsider the vote.

The Chair of the Executive 15Appointments Committee may, by a motion in writing approved by 16a majority of the members present and voting compile a list of 17individual Appointment Messages to be acted on together by a 18single vote. Whenever a list of Appointment Messages has been 19so compiled, five or more members may request the question be 20put and the vote separately taken upon each of the Appointment 21Messages on that list. The Senate may determine, by a majority 22vote of those elected, after having voted upon the question of 23one or more of the Appointment Messages individually, to act 24upon the question of the remaining Appointment Messages on 25that list as a unit.   SR0004- 110 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1    (c-5) After a committee has reported to the Senate any 2Appointment Message "do not recommend consent" pursuant to 3subsection (a) of Rule 3-11, the Chair of the Executive 4Appointments Committee shall move that the Appointment Message 5(or Appointment Messages) be placed on the Denial of 6Appointment Calendar under the order of Executive 7Appointments. A motion to place an Appointment Message on the 8Denial of Appointment Calendar is neither debatable, subject 9to division under Rule 7-14, nor subject to a motion to 10reconsider under Rule 7-15. The Presiding Officer shall put 11the following question: "Shall the Senate place Appointment 12Message (or Messages) (insert number or numbers) on the Denial 13of Appointment Calendar which shall constitute the Senate's 14rejection of that Message (or those Messages) on its 60th 15session day under our Rules?" Upon adoption of the motion by a 16majority vote, the Secretary shall place an Appointment 17Message on the Denial of Appointment Calendar under the order 18of Executive Appointments.19    After a committee has reported to the Senate any 20Appointment Message "without recommendation" pursuant to 21subsection (a) of Rule 3-11, the Chair of the Executive 22Appointments Committee may move that the Appointment Message 23(or Appointment Messages) be placed on the Denial of 24Appointment Calendar under the order of Executive 25Appointments. A motion to place an Appointment Message on the   SR0004- 111 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1Denial of Appointment Calendar is neither debatable, subject 2to division under Rule 7-14, nor subject to a motion to 3reconsider under Rule 7-15. The Presiding Officer shall put 4the following question: "Shall the Senate place the 5Appointment Message (or Messages) (insert number or numbers) 6on the Denial of Appointment Calendar which shall constitute 7the Senate's rejection of that Message (or those Messages) on 8its 60th session day under our Rules?" Upon adoption of the 9motion by majority vote, the Secretary shall place an 10Appointment Message on the Denial of Appointment Calendar 11under the order of Executive Appointments.12    The Secretary shall set forth for each applicable 13Appointment Message on the Denial of Appointment Calendar the 14number, name of the nominee, and the title of the office, 15agency or other body to which nomination is being made. The 16Denial of Appointment Calendar shall also state the number of 17session days that have elapsed since each Appointment Message 18was received by the Senate. The Secretary shall distribute the 19Denial of Appointment Calendar to each member of the Senate as 20a component of the Senate Calendar for each session day other 21than a perfunctory session day. The Secretary shall make the 22Denial of Appointment Calendar available to the public. 23    An Appointment Message shall be removed from the Denial of 24Appointment Calendar if a written objection stating the number 25of the Appointment Message to be removed is filed with the 26Secretary on or before the 59th session day after the day the   SR0004- 112 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1Appointment Message was received by the Senate, and the 2objection contains the signature of a majority of the members 3elected. Upon the filing of a proper written objection, the 4Secretary shall remove the relevant Appointment Message from 5the Denial of Appointment Calendar and automatically place the 6Appointment Message on the Senate Calendar under the order of 7Executive Appointments. 8    An Appointment Message shall be removed from the Denial of 9Appointment Calendar if, upon concurrence of a majority of 10those appointed, the Committee on Assignments adopts a motion 11to remove that Appointment Message on or before the 59th 12session day after the day the Appointment Message was received 13by the Senate. Upon this action of the Committee on 14Assignments, the Secretary shall remove the relevant 15Appointment Message from the Denial of Appointment Calendar 16and automatically place the Appointment Message on the Senate 17Calendar under the order of Executive Appointments, unless the 18Committee on Assignments has referred the Appointment Message 19to a committee for further action.20    If neither the Committee on Assignments takes action to 21remove an Appointment Message from the Denial of Appointment 22Calendar, nor a proper written objection to an Appointment 23Message on the Denial of Appointment Calendar is filed with 24the Secretary as required under this Rule, then that 25Appointment Message shall remain on the Denial of Appointment 26Calendar. A motion to place an Appointment Message (or   SR0004- 113 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1Appointment Messages) on the Denial of Appointment Calendar 2adopted by the Senate shall constitute the Senate's rejection 3of each Appointment Message on the Denial of Appointment 4Calendar on the 60th session day after the day the Appointment 5Message was received by the Senate. Each Appointment Message 6remaining on the Denial of Appointment Calendar on the 60th 7session day after the day the Appointment Message was received 8by the Senate shall be deemed to have not received the advice 9and consent of the Senate and thereby rejected by the Senate 10pursuant to Article V, Section 9 of the Illinois Constitution.11    On the 60th session day for each Appointment Message on 12the Denial of Appointment Calendar, the Presiding Officer 13shall make the following inquiry of the Secretary: "Please 14identify each Appointment Message on the Denial of Appointment 15Calendar that is on its 60th session day." After the Secretary 16identifies the relevant Appointment Message or Appointment 17Messages, the Presiding Officer shall make the following 18declaration: "Each Appointment Message just read is on its 1960th session day and remains on the Denial of Appointment 20Calendar; therefore each such Message, pursuant to our Rules, 21is deemed to have not received the advice and consent of the 22Senate and is hereby rejected by the Senate pursuant to 23Article V, Section 9 of the Illinois Constitution. The Journal 24shall reflect that the Senate has rejected each such 25nomination and the Secretary shall inform the relevant 26appointing authority of the Senate's action in rejecting that   SR0004- 114 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1authority's nomination."  2    (d) Except as otherwise provided for in this Rule, while 3any nomination remains with the Senate, it is in order to 4reconsider any vote taken thereon, subject to the provisions 5of Rule 7-15 not related to the time for making such a motion.6(Source: S.R. 8, 103rd G.A.; S.R. 26, 103rd G.A) 7    (Senate Rule 10-2)8    10-2.

An Appointment Message is received by 2the Senate when it is read into the Senate record and assigned 3a sequential number. A perfunctory session day shall not be 4deemed to be a session day for the purpose of Article V, 5Section 9, subsection (a) of the Illinois Constitution. 6    (d) An Appointment Message that does not conform to the 7requirements of this Rule shall, at the direction of the 8President of the Senate, (i) be ruled non-compliant and of no 9legal effect and (ii) be returned by the Secretary of the 10Senate to the appointing officer or authority that filed it.  11    (e) The appointing officer or authority may file in 12accordance with this Rule an Appointment Message that 13supersedes a previously filed Appointment Message. A 14superseding Appointment Message shall identify by sequential 15number the Appointment Message that it supersedes. The filing 16of a superseding Appointment Message shall automatically table 17the Appointment Message that it supersedes, and that 18superseded Appointment Message shall have no further legal 19effect. The filing of a superseding Appointment Message shall 20not have the effect of restarting the 60 session day period 21within which the Senate must confirm or reject the appointee 22under Article V, Section 9, subsection (a) of the Illinois 23Constitution, Senate Rule 10-1, or any applicable law.   SR0004- 116 -LRB104 07609 JDS 17653 r1    (f) Nothing in this Rule shall be construed to prohibit an 2appointing officer or authority from withdrawing in writing an 3Appointment Message that was previously submitted to or 4received by the Senate. An Appointment Message that has been 5withdrawn shall have no further legal effect. The filing of an 6Appointment Message appointing the same person to the same 7office and for a term ending on the same date as that of an 8Appointment Message that was previously filed and later 9withdrawn shall have the effect of restarting the 60 session 10day period within which the Senate must confirm or reject the 11appointee under Article V, Section 9, subsection (a) of the 12Illinois Constitution, Senate Rule 10-1, or any applicable 13law. 14    (g) An Appointment Message (i) shall be a 15committee-sponsored legislative measure that is unamendable 16and (ii) shall be controlled by the Chair of the Executive 17Appointments Committee, who for purposes of these Senate Rules 18shall be deemed the principal sponsor.
