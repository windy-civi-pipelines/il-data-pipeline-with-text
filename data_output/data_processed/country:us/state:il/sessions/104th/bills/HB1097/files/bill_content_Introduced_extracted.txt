Parents or guardians may use 13audio recording devices during meetings with their child's IEP 14team regarding the child's placement or progress in an 15individualized education program. 16    If the child is deaf, hard of hearing, blind, or visually 17impaired or has an orthopedic impairment or physical 18disability and he or she might be eligible to receive services 19from the Illinois School for the Deaf, the Illinois School for 20the Visually Impaired, or the Illinois Center for 21Rehabilitation and Education-Roosevelt, the school district 22shall notify the parents, in writing, of the existence of 23these schools and the services they provide and shall make a 24reasonable effort to inform the parents of the existence of 25other, local schools that provide similar services and the 26services that these other schools provide.

Students who are not currently identified   HB1097- 9 -LRB104 04490 LNS 14517 b1as functionally blind who are also entitled to Braille 2instruction include: (i) those whose vision loss is so severe 3that they are unable to read and write at a level comparable to 4their peers solely through the use of vision, and (ii) those 5who show evidence of progressive vision loss that may result 6in functional blindness. Each student who is functionally 7blind shall be entitled to Braille reading and writing 8instruction that is sufficient to enable the student to 9communicate with the same level of proficiency as other 10students of comparable ability. Instruction should be provided 11to the extent that the student is physically and cognitively 12able to use Braille. Braille instruction may be used in 13combination with other special education services appropriate 14to the student's educational needs. The assessment of each 15student who is functionally blind for the purpose of 16developing the student's individualized education program 17shall include documentation of the student's strengths and 18weaknesses in Braille skills. Each person assisting in the 19development of the individualized education program for a 20student who is functionally blind shall receive information 21describing the benefits of Braille instruction. The 22individualized education program for each student who is 23functionally blind shall specify the appropriate learning 24medium or media based on the assessment report.25    (d) To the maximum extent appropriate, the placement shall 26provide the child with the opportunity to be educated with   HB1097- 10 -LRB104 04490 LNS 14517 b1children who do not have a disability; provided that children 2with disabilities who are recommended to be placed into 3regular education classrooms are provided with supplementary 4services to assist the children with disabilities to benefit 5from the regular classroom instruction and are included on the 6teacher's regular education class register. Subject to the 7limitation of the preceding sentence, placement in special 8classes, separate schools or other removal of the child with a 9disability from the regular educational environment shall 10occur only when the nature of the severity of the disability is 11such that education in the regular classes with the use of 12supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved 13satisfactorily. The placement of English learners with 14disabilities shall be in non-restrictive environments which 15provide for integration with peers who do not have 16disabilities in bilingual classrooms. Annually, each January, 17school districts shall report data on students from 18non-English speaking backgrounds receiving special education 19and related services in public and private facilities as 20prescribed in Section 2-3.30. If there is a disagreement 21between parties involved regarding the special education 22placement of any child, either in-state or out-of-state, the 23placement is subject to impartial due process procedures 24described in Article 10 of the Rules and Regulations to Govern 25the Administration and Operation of Special Education.26    (e) No child who comes from a home in which a language   HB1097- 11 -LRB104 04490 LNS 14517 b1other than English is the principal language used may be 2assigned to any class or program under this Article until he 3has been given, in the principal language used by the child and 4used in his home, tests reasonably related to his cultural 5environment. All testing and evaluation materials and 6procedures utilized for evaluation and placement shall not be 7linguistically, racially or culturally discriminatory.8    (f) Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require 9any child to undergo any physical examination or medical 10treatment whose parents object thereto on the grounds that 11such examination or treatment conflicts with his religious 12beliefs.13    (g) School boards or their designee shall provide to the 14parents of a child or, if applicable, the Department of 15Children and Family Services' Office of Education and 16Transition Services prior written notice of any decision (a) 17proposing to initiate or change, or (b) refusing to initiate 18or change, the identification, evaluation, or educational 19placement of the child or the provision of a free appropriate 20public education to their child, and the reasons therefor. For 21a parent, such written notification shall also inform the 22parent of the opportunity to present complaints with respect 23to any matter relating to the educational placement of the 24student, or the provision of a free appropriate public 25education and to have an impartial due process hearing on the 26complaint. The notice shall inform the parents in the parents'   HB1097- 12 -LRB104 04490 LNS 14517 b1native language, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so, of 2their rights and all procedures available pursuant to this Act 3and the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education 4Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-446); it shall be the 5responsibility of the State Superintendent to develop uniform 6notices setting forth the procedures available under this Act 7and the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education 8Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-446) to be used by all 9school boards.
