Monthly payment affordability.4    (a) Each EISA shall specify the EISA payment calculation 5method applicable to the EISA. An EISA shall not require 6payments from the consumer toward that EISA that exceed 8% of 7the consumer's income. An EISA provider shall not enter into 8an EISA with a consumer if the consumer would be committing to 9pay more than 15% of the consumer's income at any time during 10the EISA duration, based on information available to the EISA 11provider at the time of the projection, inclusive of any 12payment obligations that the EISA provider knows will arise in 13the future for other EISAs and education loans upon which the 14consumer is obligated at the time of the projection. The EISA 15provider must confirm a consumer's EISA and education loan 16liabilities through a verifiable third-party source. At a 17minimum, the EISA provider must confirm such liabilities using 18information maintained by a nationwide consumer reporting 19agency, as defined by 15 U.S.C. 1681a(f), and doing so is 20sufficient for meeting the requirement in this subsection. 21However, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit an EISA 22provider from using other sources to provide additional 23verification. For the purposes of calculating the portion of a 24student's future income that would be consumed by the EISA for 25which the student has applied and other EISAs and education   SB1537- 15 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1loans known at the time, the EISA provider shall calculate the 2aggregate future burden of all such obligations, including the 3EISA for which the student is applying, at the hypothetical 4future income levels described in subdivision (a)(15)(iii) of 5Section 7-75, ranging from the income threshold of the EISA 6for which the student has applied up to the maximum income 7described in subdivision (a)(15)(iii) of Section 7-75. The 8terms of the EISA for which the student has applied cannot 9cause the student's aggregate future burden to exceed the 10percentage limits in this subsection at any of the income 11increments stated in this Section. For the purpose of 12calculating the percentage burden of an EISA at a given future 13income level, the EISA provider shall use the EISA payment 14amount that would be applicable for the EISA at such income 15level. For the purpose of calculating the percentage burden of 16an educational loan at a given future income level, the EISA 17provider shall divide the annual payment obligation by income 18level using the most affordable payment plan or option which 19would yield the lowest monthly payments that would be 20available to the student at such income level under such loan. 21For students enrolled in a program eligible to receive federal 22student loans under Title IV of the federal Higher Education 23Act of 1965, as part of this analysis the EISA provider shall 24assume a federal loan balance equal to the larger of (1) the 25student's existing federal loan balance and (2) the aggregate 26maximum amount the student is eligible to borrow under Federal   SB1537- 16 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1Direct Stafford Loans for the student's status, dependent or 2independent.3    (b) The EISA must state that when a consumer has income 4that is equal to or below the income threshold set forth in the 5EISA that the consumer's payment obligation is zero dollars. 6The income threshold must be equal to or greater than $47,000; 7however, that amount shall be increased on January 1, 2026, 8and every other January 1 thereafter, by the annual unadjusted 9percentage increase (but not less than zero) in the index for 10the 12 months ending with the preceding September, including 11all previous adjustments.12    (c) An EISA must offer at least 3 months of voluntary 13payment relief pauses for every 30 income-determined payments 14required under the EISA. 15    (d) During the payment process for the EISA, the consumer 16may request that the income threshold on the EISA be adjusted 17upward to ensure the consumer's income, less any payments 18required by the EISA, would be greater than or equal to the 19minimum essential income based on the consumer's current place 20of residence. 21    As used in this subsection (d), the consumer's minimum 22essential income is equal to 275% of the federal poverty 23guidelines for a single person (for the year in which the 24calculation is performed), multiplied by a cost-of-living 25adjustment factor equal to the ratio of (i) the current 26locality payment percentage issued by the U.S. Office of   SB1537- 17 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1Personnel Management for the locality pay area in which the 2consumer resides, divided by (ii) the current locality payment 3percentage issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management 4for the "Rest of U.S." locality pay area. The locality pay 5areas described in this subsection (d) are the locality pay 6areas described in 5 CFR 531.603. 7    An EISA provider must notify consumers of this option on 8each monthly billing statement. Nothing in this provision 9shall prevent an EISA provider from taking reasonable steps to 10confirm a consumer's place of residence (such as requiring a 11copy of a utility bill or a driver's license) for the purpose 12of establishing the consumer's minimum essential income, 13including if the EISA provider believes a consumer's place of 14residence has changed. Furthermore, an EISA provider may 15require that a consumer has resided at a location for at least 1690 days before adjusting the consumer's minimum essential 17income.  18    (110 ILCS 992/7-15 new)19    Sec. 7-15. Maximum effective annual percentage rate. An 20EISA must specify that the maximum amount that a consumer 21could be required to pay under the EISA will not result in a 22consumer ever being required to pay an effective annual 23percentage rate that is greater than 9% or the high yield of 24the 10-year United States Constant Maturity Treasury Notes 25auctioned at the final auction held before the current   SB1537- 18 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1calendar year in which the EISA is originated plus 6%, 2whichever is greater. If at any time the EISA provider accepts 3a payment of an amount that would cause the limit in this 4Section to apply, the EISA provider shall, within 20 calendar 5days, refund any amounts necessary to ensure that the 6consumer's payments do not result in an effective annual 7percentage rate that is greater than the limit specified in 8this Section. 9    (110 ILCS 992/7-20 new)10    Sec. 7-20. Limits on duration of EISAs.11    (a) The EISA maximum number of payments shall not exceed 12180 monthly payments.13    (b) The EISA duration shall not exceed 240 months, 14excluding any months in which a consumer has requested and 15received a payment relief pause.  16    (110 ILCS 992/7-25 new)17    Sec. 7-25. Risk sharing.18    (a) An EISA provider may not contract for EISA terms that 19would result in a consumer having income that is less than or 20equal to 450% of the federal poverty guidelines for a single 21person for the EISA duration being required to make a stream of 22EISA payments that would yield an effective APR greater than 238.5%, or the high yield of the 10-year United States Constant 24Maturity Treasury Notes auctioned at the final auction held   SB1537- 19 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1before the current calendar year in which an EISA offering is 2made plus 4.5%, whichever is greater.3    (b) An EISA provider shall calculate the effective APR in 4subsection (a) by determining the federal poverty guidelines 5at the time the consumer's EISA is originated and assuming 6such amount is fixed through the EISA duration.7    (c) For the purposes of determining EISA duration in this 8Section, an EISA provider shall assume the EISA duration 9started after a period equal to the expected length of the 10program for which a consumer is enrolling.11    (d) If there is a discrepancy between the effective annual 12percentage rate as calculated in this Section and the maximum 13effective annual percentage rate as calculated in Section 147-15, the lower effective annual percentage rate shall apply 15in this Section 7-25.  16    (110 ILCS 992/7-30 new)17    Sec. 7-30. Limits on covered income. An EISA must specify 18the definition of income to be used for the purposes of 19calculating a consumer's payment obligation under the EISA.

Limitation on acceleration.3    (a) EISA providers shall not attempt to accelerate or 4otherwise liquidate a future payment stream under an EISA.5    (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), nothing in this 6Section shall prevent an EISA provider from collecting or 7pursuing any other remedy available to the EISA provider for 8the collection of amounts that were due from the consumer 9under an EISA that were not paid or properly remitted to the 10EISA provider. Nothing in this Section shall prevent an EISA 11provider from calculating a projected future income for a 12consumer and calculating a consumer's payment obligation using 13that projection if the consumer does not provide contractually 14obligated documentation of income.15    (c) Notwithstanding subsection (a), an EISA may contain a 16provision that allows a consumer to terminate the consumer's 17EISA before the events terminating further obligations under 18the EISA. The early termination mechanisms, such as total caps 19on payments due to the EISA provider or other rights to 20partially or fully terminate further obligations under the 21EISA, must be optional to the consumer and within the 22consumer's control. In such circumstances, such mechanisms 23shall not be deemed a form of acceleration.  24    (110 ILCS 992/7-60 new)  SB1537- 24 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    Sec. 7-60. No assignment of wages.2    (a) An EISA provider may not take an assignment of 3earnings or wages of the consumer for payment or as security 4for payment of a debt arising out of an EISA. An assignment of 5earnings in violation of this Section is unenforceable by the 6assignee of the earnings and revocable by the consumer. This 7Section does not limit the ability of the consumer to 8voluntarily elect to use a revocable payroll deduction 9mechanism, such as one offered by an employer or payroll 10provider, provided that the consumer is not assigning the 11consumer's earnings or wages.12    (b) A sale of unpaid earnings made in consideration of the 13payment of money to or for the account of the seller of the 14earnings is deemed to be a loan to the seller secured by an 15assignment of earnings.  16    (110 ILCS 992/7-65 new)17    Sec. 7-65. Limitations on garnishment. Before entry of 18judgment in an action against a consumer for a payment arising 19from an EISA, a licensee may not attach unpaid earnings of the 20consumer by garnishment or like proceedings. 21    (110 ILCS 992/7-70 new)22    Sec. 7-70.

This table assumes you have the 13    same income over the entire term of your educational 14    income share agreement. It does not take into account 15    changes in income. Your income will likely change over 16    time. This table does not represent the income or range of 17    incomes that you are likely to earn in the future.". In 18    computing the APR, the EISA provider shall use the amount 19    financed and may assume that the EISA will be disbursed in 20    the amount and with the disbursement schedule that it 21    reasonably expects to follow for such EISA and that 22    payments would commence on the date set forth in the EISA. 23    The income used in this disclosure shall include, at 24    minimum, the obligations at the following incomes:25            (i) no income;26            (ii) income equal to the annual equivalent of the   SB1537- 28 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1        income threshold;2            (iii) various income scenarios with at least 3        calculations at annual incomes of $40,000, $60,000, 4        $80,000, $100,000, $125,000, $150,000, $175,000, and 5        $200,000; and6            (iv) if known by the EISA provider, the consumer's 7        current income;8        (16) a statement that the EISA is not a fixed payment 9    installment loan and that the amount the consumer will be 10    required to pay under the EISA:11            (i) may be more or less than the amount financed by 12        the EISA provider; and13            (ii) will vary in proportion with the consumer's 14        income; and15        (17) a statement relating to the bankruptcy treatment 16    of the EISA consistent with the requirements set forth in 17    12 CFR 1026.47(a)(3)(iv), as it may be amended or 18    interpreted. 19    (b) The disclosures required by this Section shall be 20grouped together and segregated from all other information.21    (c) The disclosures required by this Section may be 22provided to a consumer in electronic form, subject to 23compliance with the consumer's consent and other applicable 24provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National 25Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq., and applicable State 26law.  SB1537- 29 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    (d) If model documents are established pursuant to any 2federal law covering income share agreements, compliance with 3those forms shall be considered compliance with this Act with 4respect to the disclosure requirements contained in this Act.  5    (110 ILCS 992/7-80 new)6    Sec. 7-80. Early completion. An EISA shall specify the 7terms and conditions by which the consumer may extinguish the 8consumer's obligations under the EISA before the end of the 9EISA's duration. An EISA must not include a prepayment penalty 10that violates the prohibition found in 15 U.S.C. 1650(e), as 11it may be amended or interpreted. A consumer may always cancel 12an EISA by making aggregate payments, excluding payments to 13fees, equal to the EISA payment cap. The consumer is entitled 14to this early completion regardless of whether the consumer 15makes this early completion payment by making regularly 16scheduled payments or by making a single lump-sum payment in 17the amount of the early completion payment.18    This Section shall create an early completion mechanism 19for EISAs that is in lieu of other State laws regarding 20prepayment penalties. 21    (110 ILCS 992/7-85 new)22    Sec. 7-85. Assumption of increase in future income.23    (a) If a consumer fails to provide income documentation as 24reasonably required by an EISA, an EISA provider may assign an   SB1537- 30 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1amount of income to the consumer and compute the consumer's 2monthly payment amount by any of the following methods, to the 3extent disclosed in the EISA:4        (1) assigning an income amount obtained from a 5    reasonably reliable third party or a credit reporting 6    agency;7        (2) if the consumer previously provided income 8    documentation or has had an income assigned in the prior 9    12-month period that has increased by an amount not to 10    exceed 10%, but such increase may not be applied more than 11    once per 12-month period;12        (3) contacting the Department of Revenue or the 13    Internal Revenue Service to obtain the most recent 14    information available about the student's income; or15        (4) assigning a reasonable qualified income based on 16    the incomes of the nearest reasonably relevant quantile of 17    income of consumers who attended the same or a reasonably 18    comparable covered educational program or course of study, 19    as determined by information published by the Bureau of 20    Labor Statistics or other reasonably reliable publicly 21    available data sources.22    (b) If an EISA provider assigns an income to a consumer's 23EISA, then it shall notify the consumer in the monthly billing 24statement, and in each billing statement thereafter while the 25assigned income remains applicable to the consumer's EISA, 26that income has been assigned and of the consumer's rights   SB1537- 31 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1under this Section.2    (c) If the consumer does provide income information as 3reasonably required by the EISA within one year of the date on 4which the EISA provider notified the consumer that assigned 5income will be applied to the EISA, then, within 15 days after 6the EISA provider's receipt of such information, the EISA 7provider shall update each prior instance in which assigned 8income was applied using the income information provided by 9the consumer; if the consumer provides income information more 10than one year after the EISA provider first assigned income to 11the consumer's EISA, then the EISA provider may, but is not 12obligated to, update each prior instance in which assigned 13income was applied using the income information provided by 14the consumer.15    (d) An EISA provider that assigns income to an EISA shall 16retain all applicable records relating to the method and data 17sources used to make such estimation for 3 years after the end 18of that EISA.  19    (110 ILCS 992/7-90 new)20    Sec. 7-90. Receipts; statements of account; evidence of 21payment.22    (a) The EISA provider shall deliver or mail to the 23consumer, without request, a written receipt for each payment 24made pursuant to an EISA.

Adjustment of dollar amounts.12    (a) From time to time, the dollar amounts in this Act 13designated as subject to change shall change, as provided in 14this Section, according to and to the extent of changes in the 15index.16    (b) The index for December of the year preceding the year 17in which this Act becomes effective is the reference base 18index.19    (c) The designated dollar amounts shall change on July 1 20of each even-numbered year if the percentage of change, 21calculated to the nearest whole percentage point, between the 22index and the end of the preceding year and the reference base 23index is 10% or more, but:24        (1) the portion of the percentage change in the index 25    in excess of a multiple of 10% shall be disregarded and the   SB1537- 33 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    dollar amounts shall change only in multiples of 10% of 2    the amounts provided in this Act on the date of enactment; 3    and4        (2) the dollar amounts shall not change if the amounts 5    required by this Section are those currently in effect 6    pursuant to this Act as a result of earlier application of 7    this Section.8    (d) If the index is revised, the percentage of change 9pursuant to this Section shall be calculated on the basis of 10the revised index. If a revision of the index changes the 11reference base index, a revised reference base index shall be 12determined by multiplying the reference base index then 13applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by the Bureau of 14Labor Statistics. If the index is superseded, the index 15referred to in this Section is the one represented by the 16Bureau of Labor Statistics as reflecting most accurately 17changes in the purchasing power of the dollar for consumers.18    (e) The Department shall adopt a rule setting forth, on or 19before April 30 of each year in which dollar amounts are to 20change, the changes in dollar amounts required by this 21Section. As soon as practical after the changes occur, the 22Department shall adopt a rule setting forth the changes in the 23index required by subsection (d), including, if applicable, 24the numerical equivalent of the reference base index under a 25revised reference base index and the designation or title of 26any index superseding the index.  SB1537- 34 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    (f) A person does not violate this Act with respect to a 2transaction otherwise complying with this Act if the person 3relies on dollar amounts either determined according to 4subsection (c) or appearing in the last rule of the Department 5announcing the then-current dollar amounts.  6    (110 ILCS 992/7-100 new)7    Sec. 7-100.

The "annual percentage rate" 6is determined in accordance with either the actuarial method 7or the United States rule method.8    "Cash price" has the meaning given in 12 CFR 1026.2(a)(9).9    "Consumer" means a natural person who enters into an EISA.10    "Educational income share agreement" or "EISA" means an 11agreement between a consumer and an EISA provider under which: 12        (1) the EISA provider credits or advances a sum of 13    money to the consumer or to a third party on the consumer's 14    behalf or, if the EISA provider is a seller of goods or 15    services to the consumer, the EISA provider credits or 16    advances toward the purchase of such goods or services;17        (2) the consumer is obligated to make periodic 18    payments, if any become due, to the EISA provider 19    calculated, based upon, or determined by the consumer's 20    income;21        (3) the consumer incurs an obligation in each payment 22    period only if the individual's income in that period is 23    above an income threshold specified in the EISA;24        (4) there is an EISA duration after which the 25    obligation is complete, regardless of how much has been 26    paid, as long as the consumer has paid any prior amounts   SB1537- 10 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    due;2        (5) each of these elements is available at the time 3    the agreement is executed;4        (6) the agreement is not made, insured, or guaranteed 5    under Title IV of the federal Higher Education Act of 1965 6    or another federally subsidized educational finance 7    program; and8        (7) the agreement is extended to a consumer expressly, 9    in whole or in part, for postsecondary educational 10    expenses, tuition, or other obligations of, or pay amounts 11    to or on behalf of such an individual, for the costs 12    associated with a postsecondary training program or any 13    other program designed to increase the individual's human 14    capital, employability, or earning potential, including, 15    but not limited to, a program eligible to participate as a 16    program under Title IV of the federal Higher Education Act 17    of 1965, as well as any personal expenses, such as books, 18    supplies, transportation, and living costs, incurred by 19    the individual while enrolled in such a program and any 20    other costs or expenses included in the definition of 21    "qualified higher education expenses" under 26 U.S.C. 22    529(e)(3)(A), including the refinancing of loans or 23    agreements used for the purposes described in this 24    paragraph (7) and regardless of whether the agreement is 25    provided by the educational institution that the consumer 26    attends.   SB1537- 11 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1        For purposes of this definition, an EISA shall be 2    treated as a credit, within the meaning of that term under 3    15 U.S.C. 1602(f), and as a "private education loan", 4    within the meaning of that term under 15 U.S.C. 5    1650(a)(8), to the extent the proceeds of the EISA are 6    used for postsecondary educational expenses in a manner 7    consistent with the definition of that term. 8    "EISA duration" means the maximum time during which a 9consumer could remain obligated on the EISA, other than 10periods when an EISA provider is attempting to collect 11past-due amounts and absent periods of payment relief pauses, 12forbearance, military service suspension, or other suspension 13of obligations at the request of the consumer, regardless of 14whether the consumer's income is greater than the minimum 15income. 16    "EISA maximum number of payments" means the maximum number 17of EISA payments during EISA payment periods in which the 18consumer's income is equal to or greater than the income 19threshold that a consumer could be required to make under the 20terms of the EISA. "EISA maximum number of payments" does not 21include periods of payment relief pause. 22    "EISA payment" means a calculated monthly payment in 23excess of $0.00 that counts toward the maximum income-based 24payments under the EISA. An "EISA payment" is required only 25for income earned during an EISA payment period in which the 26consumer's income was equal to or greater than the income   SB1537- 12 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1threshold. 2    "EISA payment calculation method" means the mechanism, 3formula, percentage, dollar figure, or other means of 4calculating a student's payment obligation, based on the 5student's income, under the terms of the EISA. 6    "EISA payment cap" means the maximum amount of money a 7consumer must pay to satisfy the terms of an EISA, which may be 8expressed as a dollar value, a multiple of the amount funded to 9the student or on the student's behalf, or as a maximum 10effective annual percentage rate. 11    "EISA payment cap" does not include charges that would be 12excluded from the definition of the term "finance charge" 13under 12 CFR 1026. 14    "EISA provider" means: 15        (1) a person or entity that provides money, payments, 16    or credits to or on behalf of a consumer pursuant to the 17    terms of an EISA;18        (2) any person or entity engaged in the business of 19    soliciting, making, funding, or extending EISAs; or20        (3) any person or entity that is providing educational 21    services to the consumer and receiving compensation from 22    an EISA provider (separate from proceeds of the EISA to 23    cover educational expenses of the consumer) for 24    advertising, marketing, or recommending EISAs, on behalf 25    of an EISA provider, for those educational services.26    This definition does not apply to an entity that either   SB1537- 13 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1(i) has no direct interactions with the consumer and is not 2responsible for making credit decisions regarding the consumer 3or (ii) is the provider of the educational services to the 4consumer, unless the entity qualifies under paragraph (1), 5(2), or (3). 6    "Federal poverty guidelines" means the poverty guidelines 7updated periodically in the Federal Register by the U.S. 8Department of Health and Human Services under the authority of 942 U.S.C. 9902(2).10    "Garnishment" means any legal or equitable procedure 11through which earnings of an individual are required to be 12withheld for payment of obligations to an EISA provider as set 13forth in the Code of Civil Procedure.14    "Income threshold" means a fixed dollar amount that is the 15minimum income per payment period that an EISA recipient is 16required to earn before the EISA recipient is required to make 17a payment on an EISA for such payment period.18    "Index" means the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage 19Earners and Clerical Workers: U.S. City Average, All Items, 201967=100, compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United 21States Department of Labor. 22    "Payment relief pause" means a period of time that is 23requested by the consumer during which the consumer is not 24required to make payments despite the consumer's income 25exceeding the income threshold. 26    "Sales price" means the "total sale price" as set forth in   SB1537- 14 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b112 CFR 1026.18(j).  2    (110 ILCS 992/7-10 new)3    Sec. 7-10. Monthly payment affordability.4    (a) Each EISA shall specify the EISA payment calculation 5method applicable to the EISA. An EISA shall not require 6payments from the consumer toward that EISA that exceed 8% of 7the consumer's income. An EISA provider shall not enter into 8an EISA with a consumer if the consumer would be committing to 9pay more than 15% of the consumer's income at any time during 10the EISA duration, based on information available to the EISA 11provider at the time of the projection, inclusive of any 12payment obligations that the EISA provider knows will arise in 13the future for other EISAs and education loans upon which the 14consumer is obligated at the time of the projection. The EISA 15provider must confirm a consumer's EISA and education loan 16liabilities through a verifiable third-party source. At a 17minimum, the EISA provider must confirm such liabilities using 18information maintained by a nationwide consumer reporting 19agency, as defined by 15 U.S.C. 1681a(f), and doing so is 20sufficient for meeting the requirement in this subsection. 21However, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit an EISA 22provider from using other sources to provide additional 23verification. For the purposes of calculating the portion of a 24student's future income that would be consumed by the EISA for 25which the student has applied and other EISAs and education   SB1537- 15 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1loans known at the time, the EISA provider shall calculate the 2aggregate future burden of all such obligations, including the 3EISA for which the student is applying, at the hypothetical 4future income levels described in subdivision (a)(15)(iii) of 5Section 7-75, ranging from the income threshold of the EISA 6for which the student has applied up to the maximum income 7described in subdivision (a)(15)(iii) of Section 7-75. The 8terms of the EISA for which the student has applied cannot 9cause the student's aggregate future burden to exceed the 10percentage limits in this subsection at any of the income 11increments stated in this Section. For the purpose of 12calculating the percentage burden of an EISA at a given future 13income level, the EISA provider shall use the EISA payment 14amount that would be applicable for the EISA at such income 15level. For the purpose of calculating the percentage burden of 16an educational loan at a given future income level, the EISA 17provider shall divide the annual payment obligation by income 18level using the most affordable payment plan or option which 19would yield the lowest monthly payments that would be 20available to the student at such income level under such loan. 21For students enrolled in a program eligible to receive federal 22student loans under Title IV of the federal Higher Education 23Act of 1965, as part of this analysis the EISA provider shall 24assume a federal loan balance equal to the larger of (1) the 25student's existing federal loan balance and (2) the aggregate 26maximum amount the student is eligible to borrow under Federal   SB1537- 16 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1Direct Stafford Loans for the student's status, dependent or 2independent.3    (b) The EISA must state that when a consumer has income 4that is equal to or below the income threshold set forth in the 5EISA that the consumer's payment obligation is zero dollars. 6The income threshold must be equal to or greater than $47,000; 7however, that amount shall be increased on January 1, 2026, 8and every other January 1 thereafter, by the annual unadjusted 9percentage increase (but not less than zero) in the index for 10the 12 months ending with the preceding September, including 11all previous adjustments.12    (c) An EISA must offer at least 3 months of voluntary 13payment relief pauses for every 30 income-determined payments 14required under the EISA. 15    (d) During the payment process for the EISA, the consumer 16may request that the income threshold on the EISA be adjusted 17upward to ensure the consumer's income, less any payments 18required by the EISA, would be greater than or equal to the 19minimum essential income based on the consumer's current place 20of residence. 21    As used in this subsection (d), the consumer's minimum 22essential income is equal to 275% of the federal poverty 23guidelines for a single person (for the year in which the 24calculation is performed), multiplied by a cost-of-living 25adjustment factor equal to the ratio of (i) the current 26locality payment percentage issued by the U.S. Office of   SB1537- 17 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1Personnel Management for the locality pay area in which the 2consumer resides, divided by (ii) the current locality payment 3percentage issued by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management 4for the "Rest of U.S." locality pay area. The locality pay 5areas described in this subsection (d) are the locality pay 6areas described in 5 CFR 531.603. 7    An EISA provider must notify consumers of this option on 8each monthly billing statement. Nothing in this provision 9shall prevent an EISA provider from taking reasonable steps to 10confirm a consumer's place of residence (such as requiring a 11copy of a utility bill or a driver's license) for the purpose 12of establishing the consumer's minimum essential income, 13including if the EISA provider believes a consumer's place of 14residence has changed. Furthermore, an EISA provider may 15require that a consumer has resided at a location for at least 1690 days before adjusting the consumer's minimum essential 17income.  18    (110 ILCS 992/7-15 new)19    Sec. 7-15. Maximum effective annual percentage rate. An 20EISA must specify that the maximum amount that a consumer 21could be required to pay under the EISA will not result in a 22consumer ever being required to pay an effective annual 23percentage rate that is greater than 9% or the high yield of 24the 10-year United States Constant Maturity Treasury Notes 25auctioned at the final auction held before the current   SB1537- 18 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1calendar year in which the EISA is originated plus 6%, 2whichever is greater. If at any time the EISA provider accepts 3a payment of an amount that would cause the limit in this 4Section to apply, the EISA provider shall, within 20 calendar 5days, refund any amounts necessary to ensure that the 6consumer's payments do not result in an effective annual 7percentage rate that is greater than the limit specified in 8this Section. 9    (110 ILCS 992/7-20 new)10    Sec. 7-20. Limits on duration of EISAs.11    (a) The EISA maximum number of payments shall not exceed 12180 monthly payments.13    (b) The EISA duration shall not exceed 240 months, 14excluding any months in which a consumer has requested and 15received a payment relief pause.  16    (110 ILCS 992/7-25 new)17    Sec. 7-25. Risk sharing.18    (a) An EISA provider may not contract for EISA terms that 19would result in a consumer having income that is less than or 20equal to 450% of the federal poverty guidelines for a single 21person for the EISA duration being required to make a stream of 22EISA payments that would yield an effective APR greater than 238.5%, or the high yield of the 10-year United States Constant 24Maturity Treasury Notes auctioned at the final auction held   SB1537- 19 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1before the current calendar year in which an EISA offering is 2made plus 4.5%, whichever is greater.3    (b) An EISA provider shall calculate the effective APR in 4subsection (a) by determining the federal poverty guidelines 5at the time the consumer's EISA is originated and assuming 6such amount is fixed through the EISA duration.7    (c) For the purposes of determining EISA duration in this 8Section, an EISA provider shall assume the EISA duration 9started after a period equal to the expected length of the 10program for which a consumer is enrolling.11    (d) If there is a discrepancy between the effective annual 12percentage rate as calculated in this Section and the maximum 13effective annual percentage rate as calculated in Section 147-15, the lower effective annual percentage rate shall apply 15in this Section 7-25.  16    (110 ILCS 992/7-30 new)17    Sec. 7-30. Limits on covered income. An EISA must specify 18the definition of income to be used for the purposes of 19calculating a consumer's payment obligation under the EISA. No 20EISA shall include any of the following in its definition of 21income:22        (1) the income of the consumer's spouse, children, or 23    dependents or a party to a civil union with the consumer 24    under the Illinois Religious Freedom and Civil Union Act; 25    or  SB1537- 20 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1        (2) any amount paid by the consumer under Title II or 2    XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 401 et seq. or 42 3    U.S.C. 1381 et seq., or under a State program funded by 4    Title IV of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 601 et seq;5        (3) individual retirement account distributions;6        (4) pensions and annuities;7        (5) social security benefits;8        (6) any sources of government aid provided to 9    individuals, including, but not limited to:10            (A) unemployment programs;11            (B) disaster relief programs;12            (C) Medicare or Medicaid benefits;13            (D) benefits received through the Supplemental 14        Nutrition Assistance Program;15            (E) economic impact payments;16            (F) the earned income tax credit or child tax 17        credit;18            (G) other income excluded from the definition of 19        taxable income set forth by the Internal Revenue 20        Service; or21            (H) passive income that is not derived as a result 22        of a consumer's active participation in any trade or 23        business. 24    (110 ILCS 992/7-35 new)25    Sec. 7-35. Fees permitted.     (a) In addition to the EISA   SB1537- 21 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1obligation permitted by this Act, an EISA provider may 2contract for and receive the following additional charges:3        (1) government fees and taxes;4        (2) a fee, which shall not exceed the sum of $25, for a 5    failure to provide documentation to the EISA provider for 6    the confirmation and reconciliation of the consumer's 7    income within 30 days after the date on which such 8    documentation is due, as reflected in the written notice 9    to the consumer;10        (3) a fee for processing any forms to confirm the 11    consumer's income with the United States Internal Revenue 12    Service or a state department of revenue or taxation on a 13    dollar-for-dollar, pass-through basis of the expenses 14    incurred by the EISA provider;15        (4) a late payment fee in the amount of $15 or 5% of 16    the late payment, whichever is less, for any payment that 17    is more than 15 days past due; no late payment fee may be 18    charged more than once per late payment;19        (5) an amount not exceeding $25, plus any actual 20    expenses incurred in connection with a check or draft that 21    is not honored because of insufficient or uncollected 22    funds or because no such account exists; and23        (6) other fees authorized by the Secretary.24    In determining whether to authorize a charge, the 25Secretary shall consider whether the charge benefits the 26consumer and is reasonable.  SB1537- 22 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    (b) Before or after default in payment of a scheduled 2payment of an EISA, the parties to the EISA may agree in 3writing to a deferral of all or part of one or more unpaid 4payments and the EISA provider may make, at the time of 5deferral and receive at that time or at any time thereafter, a 6deferral charge not exceeding an amount equal to 5% of the 7missed payment, except that this paragraph (7) shall not apply 8to voluntary payment relief pauses. 9    (110 ILCS 992/7-40 new)10    Sec. 7-40. Restriction on security interest. Under no 11circumstances shall an EISA provider take a security interest 12in any collateral in connection with an EISA. 13    (110 ILCS 992/7-45 new)14    Sec. 7-45. Discharge of obligations.15    (a) All obligations under an EISA shall terminate if the 16consumer is deemed totally and permanently disabled by the 17applicable governmental agency.18    (b) All obligations under an EISA shall terminate upon the 19death of the consumer.  20    (110 ILCS 992/7-50 new)21    Sec. 7-50.

Limitation on acceleration.3    (a) EISA providers shall not attempt to accelerate or 4otherwise liquidate a future payment stream under an EISA.5    (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), nothing in this 6Section shall prevent an EISA provider from collecting or 7pursuing any other remedy available to the EISA provider for 8the collection of amounts that were due from the consumer 9under an EISA that were not paid or properly remitted to the 10EISA provider. Nothing in this Section shall prevent an EISA 11provider from calculating a projected future income for a 12consumer and calculating a consumer's payment obligation using 13that projection if the consumer does not provide contractually 14obligated documentation of income.15    (c) Notwithstanding subsection (a), an EISA may contain a 16provision that allows a consumer to terminate the consumer's 17EISA before the events terminating further obligations under 18the EISA. The early termination mechanisms, such as total caps 19on payments due to the EISA provider or other rights to 20partially or fully terminate further obligations under the 21EISA, must be optional to the consumer and within the 22consumer's control. In such circumstances, such mechanisms 23shall not be deemed a form of acceleration.  24    (110 ILCS 992/7-60 new)  SB1537- 24 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    Sec. 7-60. No assignment of wages.2    (a) An EISA provider may not take an assignment of 3earnings or wages of the consumer for payment or as security 4for payment of a debt arising out of an EISA. An assignment of 5earnings in violation of this Section is unenforceable by the 6assignee of the earnings and revocable by the consumer. This 7Section does not limit the ability of the consumer to 8voluntarily elect to use a revocable payroll deduction 9mechanism, such as one offered by an employer or payroll 10provider, provided that the consumer is not assigning the 11consumer's earnings or wages.12    (b) A sale of unpaid earnings made in consideration of the 13payment of money to or for the account of the seller of the 14earnings is deemed to be a loan to the seller secured by an 15assignment of earnings.  16    (110 ILCS 992/7-65 new)17    Sec. 7-65. Limitations on garnishment. Before entry of 18judgment in an action against a consumer for a payment arising 19from an EISA, a licensee may not attach unpaid earnings of the 20consumer by garnishment or like proceedings. 21    (110 ILCS 992/7-70 new)22    Sec. 7-70.

Your income will likely change over 16    time. This table does not represent the income or range of 17    incomes that you are likely to earn in the future.". In 18    computing the APR, the EISA provider shall use the amount 19    financed and may assume that the EISA will be disbursed in 20    the amount and with the disbursement schedule that it 21    reasonably expects to follow for such EISA and that 22    payments would commence on the date set forth in the EISA. 23    The income used in this disclosure shall include, at 24    minimum, the obligations at the following incomes:25            (i) no income;26            (ii) income equal to the annual equivalent of the   SB1537- 28 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1        income threshold;2            (iii) various income scenarios with at least 3        calculations at annual incomes of $40,000, $60,000, 4        $80,000, $100,000, $125,000, $150,000, $175,000, and 5        $200,000; and6            (iv) if known by the EISA provider, the consumer's 7        current income;8        (16) a statement that the EISA is not a fixed payment 9    installment loan and that the amount the consumer will be 10    required to pay under the EISA:11            (i) may be more or less than the amount financed by 12        the EISA provider; and13            (ii) will vary in proportion with the consumer's 14        income; and15        (17) a statement relating to the bankruptcy treatment 16    of the EISA consistent with the requirements set forth in 17    12 CFR 1026.47(a)(3)(iv), as it may be amended or 18    interpreted. 19    (b) The disclosures required by this Section shall be 20grouped together and segregated from all other information.21    (c) The disclosures required by this Section may be 22provided to a consumer in electronic form, subject to 23compliance with the consumer's consent and other applicable 24provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National 25Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq., and applicable State 26law.  SB1537- 29 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    (d) If model documents are established pursuant to any 2federal law covering income share agreements, compliance with 3those forms shall be considered compliance with this Act with 4respect to the disclosure requirements contained in this Act.  5    (110 ILCS 992/7-80 new)6    Sec. 7-80. Early completion. An EISA shall specify the 7terms and conditions by which the consumer may extinguish the 8consumer's obligations under the EISA before the end of the 9EISA's duration. An EISA must not include a prepayment penalty 10that violates the prohibition found in 15 U.S.C. 1650(e), as 11it may be amended or interpreted. A consumer may always cancel 12an EISA by making aggregate payments, excluding payments to 13fees, equal to the EISA payment cap. The consumer is entitled 14to this early completion regardless of whether the consumer 15makes this early completion payment by making regularly 16scheduled payments or by making a single lump-sum payment in 17the amount of the early completion payment.18    This Section shall create an early completion mechanism 19for EISAs that is in lieu of other State laws regarding 20prepayment penalties. 21    (110 ILCS 992/7-85 new)22    Sec. 7-85. Assumption of increase in future income.23    (a) If a consumer fails to provide income documentation as 24reasonably required by an EISA, an EISA provider may assign an   SB1537- 30 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1amount of income to the consumer and compute the consumer's 2monthly payment amount by any of the following methods, to the 3extent disclosed in the EISA:4        (1) assigning an income amount obtained from a 5    reasonably reliable third party or a credit reporting 6    agency;7        (2) if the consumer previously provided income 8    documentation or has had an income assigned in the prior 9    12-month period that has increased by an amount not to 10    exceed 10%, but such increase may not be applied more than 11    once per 12-month period;12        (3) contacting the Department of Revenue or the 13    Internal Revenue Service to obtain the most recent 14    information available about the student's income; or15        (4) assigning a reasonable qualified income based on 16    the incomes of the nearest reasonably relevant quantile of 17    income of consumers who attended the same or a reasonably 18    comparable covered educational program or course of study, 19    as determined by information published by the Bureau of 20    Labor Statistics or other reasonably reliable publicly 21    available data sources.22    (b) If an EISA provider assigns an income to a consumer's 23EISA, then it shall notify the consumer in the monthly billing 24statement, and in each billing statement thereafter while the 25assigned income remains applicable to the consumer's EISA, 26that income has been assigned and of the consumer's rights   SB1537- 31 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1under this Section.2    (c) If the consumer does provide income information as 3reasonably required by the EISA within one year of the date on 4which the EISA provider notified the consumer that assigned 5income will be applied to the EISA, then, within 15 days after 6the EISA provider's receipt of such information, the EISA 7provider shall update each prior instance in which assigned 8income was applied using the income information provided by 9the consumer; if the consumer provides income information more 10than one year after the EISA provider first assigned income to 11the consumer's EISA, then the EISA provider may, but is not 12obligated to, update each prior instance in which assigned 13income was applied using the income information provided by 14the consumer.15    (d) An EISA provider that assigns income to an EISA shall 16retain all applicable records relating to the method and data 17sources used to make such estimation for 3 years after the end 18of that EISA.  19    (110 ILCS 992/7-90 new)20    Sec. 7-90. Receipts; statements of account; evidence of 21payment.22    (a) The EISA provider shall deliver or mail to the 23consumer, without request, a written receipt for each payment 24made pursuant to an EISA.

Adjustment of dollar amounts.12    (a) From time to time, the dollar amounts in this Act 13designated as subject to change shall change, as provided in 14this Section, according to and to the extent of changes in the 15index.16    (b) The index for December of the year preceding the year 17in which this Act becomes effective is the reference base 18index.19    (c) The designated dollar amounts shall change on July 1 20of each even-numbered year if the percentage of change, 21calculated to the nearest whole percentage point, between the 22index and the end of the preceding year and the reference base 23index is 10% or more, but:24        (1) the portion of the percentage change in the index 25    in excess of a multiple of 10% shall be disregarded and the   SB1537- 33 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    dollar amounts shall change only in multiples of 10% of 2    the amounts provided in this Act on the date of enactment; 3    and4        (2) the dollar amounts shall not change if the amounts 5    required by this Section are those currently in effect 6    pursuant to this Act as a result of earlier application of 7    this Section.8    (d) If the index is revised, the percentage of change 9pursuant to this Section shall be calculated on the basis of 10the revised index. If a revision of the index changes the 11reference base index, a revised reference base index shall be 12determined by multiplying the reference base index then 13applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by the Bureau of 14Labor Statistics. If the index is superseded, the index 15referred to in this Section is the one represented by the 16Bureau of Labor Statistics as reflecting most accurately 17changes in the purchasing power of the dollar for consumers.18    (e) The Department shall adopt a rule setting forth, on or 19before April 30 of each year in which dollar amounts are to 20change, the changes in dollar amounts required by this 21Section.
