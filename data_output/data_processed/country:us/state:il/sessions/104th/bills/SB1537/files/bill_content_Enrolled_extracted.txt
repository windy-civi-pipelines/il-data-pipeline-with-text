Monthly payment affordability.4    (a) Each EISA shall specify the EISA payment calculation 5method applicable to the EISA. An EISA shall not require 6payments from the consumer toward that EISA that exceed 8% of 7the consumer's income. An EISA provider shall not enter into 8an EISA with a consumer if the consumer would be committing to 9pay more than 15% of the consumer's income at any time during 10the EISA duration, based on information available to the EISA 11provider at the time of the projection, inclusive of any 12payment obligations that the EISA provider knows will arise in 13the future for other EISAs and education loans upon which the 14consumer is obligated at the time of the projection. The EISA 15provider must confirm a consumer's EISA and education loan 16liabilities through a verifiable third-party source. At a 17minimum, the EISA provider must confirm such liabilities using 18information maintained by a nationwide consumer reporting 19agency, as defined by 15 U.S.C. 1681a(f), and doing so is 20sufficient for meeting the requirement in this subsection. 21However, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit an EISA 22provider from using other sources to provide additional 23verification. For the purposes of calculating the portion of a 24student's future income that would be consumed by the EISA for 25which the student has applied and other EISAs and education   SB1537 Enrolled- 15 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1loans known at the time, the EISA provider shall calculate the 2aggregate future burden of all such obligations, including the 3EISA for which the student is applying, at the hypothetical 4future income levels described in subdivision (a)(15)(iii) of 5Section 7-75, ranging from the income threshold of the EISA 6for which the student has applied up to the maximum income 7described in subdivision (a)(15)(iii) of Section 7-75. The 8terms of the EISA for which the student has applied cannot 9cause the student's aggregate future burden to exceed the 10percentage limits in this subsection at any of the income 11increments stated in this Section. For the purpose of 12calculating the percentage burden of an EISA at a given future 13income level, the EISA provider shall use the EISA payment 14amount that would be applicable for the EISA at such income 15level. For the purpose of calculating the percentage burden of 16an educational loan at a given future income level, the EISA 17provider shall divide the annual payment obligation by income 18level using the most affordable payment plan or option which 19would yield the lowest monthly payments that would be 20available to the student at such income level under such loan. 21For students enrolled in a program eligible to receive federal 22student loans under Title IV of the federal Higher Education 23Act of 1965, as part of this analysis the EISA provider shall 24assume a federal loan balance equal to the larger of (1) the 25student's existing federal loan balance and (2) the aggregate 26maximum amount the student is eligible to borrow under Federal   SB1537 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1Direct Stafford Loans for the student's status, dependent or 2independent.3    (b) The EISA must state that when a consumer has income 4that is equal to or below the income threshold set forth in the 5EISA that the consumer's payment obligation is zero dollars. 6The income threshold must be equal to or greater than $47,000; 7however, that amount shall be increased on January 1, 2026, 8and every other January 1 thereafter, by the annual unadjusted 9percentage increase (but not less than zero) in the index for 10the 12 months ending with the preceding September, including 11all previous adjustments.12    (c) An EISA must offer at least 3 months of voluntary 13payment relief pauses for every 30 income-determined payments 14required under the EISA. 15    (d) During the payment process for the EISA, the consumer 16may request that the income threshold on the EISA be adjusted 17upward to ensure the consumer's income, less any payments 18required by the EISA, would be greater than or equal to the 19minimum essential income based on the consumer's current place 20of residence. 21    As used in this subsection (d), the consumer's minimum 22essential income is equal to 275% of the federal poverty 23guidelines for a single person (for the year in which the 24calculation is performed), multiplied by a cost-of-living 25adjustment factor equal to the ratio of (i) one plus the 26current locality payment percentage issued by the U.S. Office   SB1537 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1of Personnel Management for the locality pay area in which the 2consumer resides, divided by (ii) one plus the current 3locality payment percentage issued by the U.S. Office of 4Personnel Management for the "Rest of U.S." locality pay area. 5The locality pay areas described in this subsection (d) are 6the locality pay areas described in 5 CFR 531.603. 7    An EISA provider must notify consumers of this option on 8each monthly billing statement. Nothing in this provision 9shall prevent an EISA provider from taking reasonable steps to 10confirm a consumer's place of residence (such as requiring a 11copy of a utility bill or a driver's license) for the purpose 12of establishing the consumer's minimum essential income, 13including if the EISA provider believes a consumer's place of 14residence has changed. Furthermore, an EISA provider may 15require that a consumer has resided at a location for at least 1690 days before adjusting the consumer's minimum essential 17income. 18    The requirements for repayment options in subsection (k) 19of Section 5-30 apply to this Section.  20    (110 ILCS 992/7-15 new)21    Sec. 7-15. Maximum effective annual percentage rate. An 22EISA must specify that the maximum amount that a consumer 23could be required to pay under the EISA will not result in a 24consumer ever being required to pay an effective annual 25percentage rate that is greater than 9% or the high yield of   SB1537 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1the 10-year United States Constant Maturity Treasury Notes 2auctioned at the final auction held before the current 3calendar year in which the EISA is originated plus 6%, 4whichever is greater. If at any time the EISA provider accepts 5a payment of an amount that would cause the limit in this 6Section to apply, the EISA provider shall, within 20 calendar 7days, refund any amounts necessary to ensure that the 8consumer's payments do not result in an effective annual 9percentage rate that is greater than the limit specified in 10this Section. 11    (110 ILCS 992/7-20 new)12    Sec. 7-20. Limits on duration of EISAs.13    (a) The EISA maximum number of payments shall not exceed 14180 monthly payments.15    (b) The EISA duration shall not exceed 240 months, 16excluding any months in which a consumer has requested and 17received a payment relief pause.  18    (110 ILCS 992/7-25 new)19    Sec. 7-25. Risk sharing.20    (a) An EISA provider may not contract for EISA terms that 21would result in a consumer having income that is less than or 22equal to 450% of the federal poverty guidelines for a single 23person for the EISA duration being required to make a stream of 24EISA payments that would yield an effective APR greater than   SB1537 Enrolled- 19 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b18.5%, or the high yield of the 10-year United States Constant 2Maturity Treasury Notes auctioned at the final auction held 3before the current calendar year in which an EISA offering is 4made plus 4.5%, whichever is greater.5    (b) An EISA provider shall calculate the effective APR in 6subsection (a) by determining the federal poverty guidelines 7at the time the consumer's EISA is originated and assuming 8such amount is fixed through the EISA duration.9    (c) For the purposes of determining EISA duration in this 10Section, an EISA provider shall assume the EISA duration 11started after a period equal to the expected length of the 12program for which a consumer is enrolling.13    (d) If there is a discrepancy between the effective annual 14percentage rate as calculated in this Section and the maximum 15effective annual percentage rate as calculated in Section 167-15, the lower effective annual percentage rate shall apply 17in this Section 7-25.  18    (110 ILCS 992/7-30 new)19    Sec. 7-30. Limits on covered income. An EISA must specify 20the definition of income to be used for the purposes of 21calculating a consumer's payment obligation under the EISA.

Restriction on security interest. Under no 13circumstances shall an EISA provider take a security interest 14in any collateral in connection with an EISA. 15    (110 ILCS 992/7-41 new)16    Sec. 7-41. Refinancing. Before offering a person an EISA 17that is being used to refinance an existing loan, an EISA 18provider shall provide the person with a disclosure explaining 19that the benefits and protections applicable to the existing 20loan may be lost due to the refinancing.

The early termination mechanisms, such as total caps 9on payments due to the EISA provider or other rights to 10partially or fully terminate further obligations under the 11EISA, must be optional to the consumer and within the 12consumer's control. In such circumstances, such mechanisms 13shall not be deemed a form of acceleration.  14    (110 ILCS 992/7-60 new)15    Sec. 7-60. No assignment of wages.16    (a) An EISA provider may not take an assignment of 17earnings or wages of the consumer for payment or as security 18for payment of a debt arising out of an EISA. An assignment of 19earnings in violation of this Section is unenforceable by the 20assignee of the earnings and revocable by the consumer. This 21Section does not limit the ability of the consumer to 22voluntarily elect to use a revocable payroll deduction 23mechanism, such as one offered by an employer or payroll 24provider, provided that the consumer is not assigning the 25consumer's earnings or wages.  SB1537 Enrolled- 25 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    (b) A sale of unpaid earnings made in consideration of the 2payment of money to or for the account of the seller of the 3earnings is deemed to be a loan to the seller secured by an 4assignment of earnings.  5    (110 ILCS 992/7-65 new)6    Sec. 7-65. Limitations on garnishment. Before entry of 7judgment in an action against a consumer for a payment arising 8from an EISA, a licensee may not attach unpaid earnings of the 9consumer by garnishment or like proceedings. 10    (110 ILCS 992/7-70 new)11    Sec. 7-70.

This table assumes you have the 2    same income over the entire term of your educational 3    income share agreement. It does not take into account 4    changes in income. Your income will likely change over 5    time. This table does not represent the income or range of 6    incomes that you are likely to earn in the future.". In 7    computing the APR, the EISA provider shall use the amount 8    financed and may assume that the EISA will be disbursed in 9    the amount and with the disbursement schedule that it 10    reasonably expects to follow for such EISA and that 11    payments would commence on the date set forth in the EISA. 12    The income used in this disclosure shall include, at 13    minimum, the obligations at the following incomes:14            (i) no income;15            (ii) income equal to the annual equivalent of the 16        income threshold;17            (iii) various income scenarios with at least 18        calculations at annual incomes of $40,000, $60,000, 19        $80,000, $100,000, $125,000, $150,000, $175,000, and 20        $200,000; and21            (iv) if known by the EISA provider, the consumer's 22        current income;23        (16) a statement that the EISA is not a fixed payment 24    installment loan and that the amount the consumer will be 25    required to pay under the EISA:26            (i) may be more or less than the amount financed by   SB1537 Enrolled- 29 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1        the EISA provider; and2            (ii) will vary in proportion with the consumer's 3        income; and4        (17) a statement relating to the bankruptcy treatment 5    of the EISA consistent with the requirements set forth in 6    12 CFR 1026.47(a)(3)(iv), as it may be amended or 7    interpreted. 8    (b) The disclosures required by this Section shall be 9grouped together and segregated from all other information.10    (c) The disclosures required by this Section may be 11provided to a consumer in electronic form, subject to 12compliance with the consumer's consent and other applicable 13provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National 14Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq., and applicable State 15law.16    (d) If model documents are established pursuant to any 17federal law covering income share agreements, compliance with 18those forms shall be considered compliance with this Act with 19respect to the disclosure requirements contained in this Act.  20    (110 ILCS 992/7-80 new)21    Sec. 7-80. Early completion. An EISA shall specify the 22terms and conditions by which the consumer may extinguish the 23consumer's obligations under the EISA before the end of the 24EISA's duration. An EISA must not include a prepayment penalty 25that violates the prohibition found in 15 U.S.C. 1650(e), as   SB1537 Enrolled- 30 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1it may be amended or interpreted. A consumer may always cancel 2an EISA by making aggregate payments, excluding payments to 3fees, equal to the EISA payment cap. The consumer is entitled 4to this early completion regardless of whether the consumer 5makes this early completion payment by making regularly 6scheduled payments or by making a single lump-sum payment in 7the amount of the early completion payment.8    This Section shall create an early completion mechanism 9for EISAs that is in lieu of other State laws regarding 10prepayment penalties. 11    (110 ILCS 992/7-85 new)12    Sec. 7-85. Assumption of increase in future income.13    (a) If a consumer fails to provide income documentation as 14reasonably required by an EISA, an EISA provider may assign an 15amount of income to the consumer and compute the consumer's 16monthly payment amount by any of the following methods, to the 17extent disclosed in the EISA:18        (1) assigning an income amount obtained from a 19    reasonably reliable third party or a credit reporting 20    agency;21        (2) if the consumer previously provided income 22    documentation or has had an income assigned in the prior 23    12-month period that has increased by an amount not to 24    exceed 10%, but such increase may not be applied more than 25    once per 12-month period;  SB1537 Enrolled- 31 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1        (3) contacting the Department of Revenue or the 2    Internal Revenue Service to obtain the most recent 3    information available about the student's income; or4        (4) assigning a reasonable qualified income based on 5    the incomes of the nearest reasonably relevant quantile of 6    income of consumers who attended the same or a reasonably 7    comparable covered educational program or course of study, 8    as determined by information published by the Bureau of 9    Labor Statistics or other reasonably reliable publicly 10    available data sources.11    (b) If an EISA provider assigns an income to a consumer's 12EISA, then it shall notify the consumer in the monthly billing 13statement, and in each billing statement thereafter while the 14assigned income remains applicable to the consumer's EISA, 15that income has been assigned and of the consumer's rights 16under this Section.17    (c) If the consumer does provide income information as 18reasonably required by the EISA within one year of the date on 19which the EISA provider notified the consumer that assigned 20income will be applied to the EISA, then, within 15 days after 21the EISA provider's receipt of such information, the EISA 22provider shall update each prior instance in which assigned 23income was applied using the income information provided by 24the consumer; if the consumer provides income information more 25than one year after the EISA provider first assigned income to 26the consumer's EISA, then the EISA provider may, but is not   SB1537 Enrolled- 32 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1obligated to, update each prior instance in which assigned 2income was applied using the income information provided by 3the consumer.4    (d) An EISA provider that assigns income to an EISA shall 5retain all applicable records relating to the method and data 6sources used to make such estimation for 3 years after the end 7of that EISA.  8    (110 ILCS 992/7-90 new)9    Sec. 7-90. Receipts; statements of account; evidence of 10payment.11    (a) The EISA provider shall deliver or mail to the 12consumer, without request, a written receipt for each payment 13made pursuant to an EISA. A periodic statement showing a 14payment received by mail complies with this subsection (a).15    (b) An EISA provider shall provide a written payment 16history to a borrower upon request at no cost within 21 17calendar days of receiving the request.18    (c) An EISA provider shall indicate on its website that a 19borrower may request a payoff statement. An EISA provider 20shall provide the payoff statement within 10 days, including 21information the requester needs to pay off the loan.

Adjustment of dollar amounts.2    (a) From time to time, the dollar amounts in this Act 3designated as subject to change shall change, as provided in 4this Section, according to and to the extent of changes in the 5index.6    (b) The index for December of the year preceding the year 7in which this Act becomes effective is the reference base 8index.9    (c) The designated dollar amounts shall change on July 1 10of each even-numbered year if the percentage of change, 11calculated to the nearest whole percentage point, between the 12index and the end of the preceding year and the reference base 13index is 10% or more, but:14        (1) the portion of the percentage change in the index 15    in excess of a multiple of 10% shall be disregarded and the 16    dollar amounts shall change only in multiples of 10% of 17    the amounts provided in this Act on the date of enactment; 18    and19        (2) the dollar amounts shall not change if the amounts 20    required by this Section are those currently in effect 21    pursuant to this Act as a result of earlier application of 22    this Section.23    (d) If the index is revised, the percentage of change 24pursuant to this Section shall be calculated on the basis of 25the revised index. If a revision of the index changes the 26reference base index, a revised reference base index shall be   SB1537 Enrolled- 34 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1determined by multiplying the reference base index then 2applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by the Bureau of 3Labor Statistics. If the index is superseded, the index 4referred to in this Section is the one represented by the 5Bureau of Labor Statistics as reflecting most accurately 6changes in the purchasing power of the dollar for consumers.7    (e) The Department shall adopt a rule setting forth, on or 8before April 30 of each year in which dollar amounts are to 9change, the changes in dollar amounts required by this 10Section. As soon as practical after the changes occur, the 11Department shall adopt a rule setting forth the changes in the 12index required by subsection (d), including, if applicable, 13the numerical equivalent of the reference base index under a 14revised reference base index and the designation or title of 15any index superseding the index.16    (f) A person does not violate this Act with respect to a 17transaction otherwise complying with this Act if the person 18relies on dollar amounts either determined according to 19subsection (c) or appearing in the last rule of the Department 20announcing the then-current dollar amounts.  21    (110 ILCS 992/7-100 new)22    Sec. 7-100. Construction against implicit authority. This 23Act is a general Act intended as a unified coverage of its 24subject matter. No part of this Act shall be construed to be 25impliedly repealed by subsequent law if that construction can   SB1537 Enrolled- 35 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1reasonably be avoided. 2    (110 ILCS 992/7-105 new)3    Sec. 7-105. Application of other Acts. EISAs and EISA 4providers are subject to other Articles of this Act, the Know 5Before You Owe Private Education Loan Act, and the Predatory 6Loan Prevention Act and shall comply with their requirements 7and any rules adopted by the Department of Financial and 8Professional Regulation pursuant to those Acts. Nothing in 9this Section is intended to imply that: (i) an EISA is not a 10credit transaction or (ii) an EISA does not create a debt upon 11the accrual of an obligation under the EISA. 12    (110 ILCS 992/7-110 new)13    Sec. 7-110. Rulemaking. Notwithstanding any other 14provision of this Act, the Secretary may adopt rules for the 15regulation of any EISA provider that does not engage in the 16servicing of student loans, including, but not limited to, 17EISAs. The Secretary's authority to adopt rules shall include, 18but is not limited to, licensure, examination, supervision, 19investigation, confidentiality, and enforcement.

Monthly payment affordability.4    (a) Each EISA shall specify the EISA payment calculation 5method applicable to the EISA. An EISA shall not require 6payments from the consumer toward that EISA that exceed 8% of 7the consumer's income. An EISA provider shall not enter into 8an EISA with a consumer if the consumer would be committing to 9pay more than 15% of the consumer's income at any time during 10the EISA duration, based on information available to the EISA 11provider at the time of the projection, inclusive of any 12payment obligations that the EISA provider knows will arise in 13the future for other EISAs and education loans upon which the 14consumer is obligated at the time of the projection. The EISA 15provider must confirm a consumer's EISA and education loan 16liabilities through a verifiable third-party source. At a 17minimum, the EISA provider must confirm such liabilities using 18information maintained by a nationwide consumer reporting 19agency, as defined by 15 U.S.C. 1681a(f), and doing so is 20sufficient for meeting the requirement in this subsection. 21However, nothing in this subsection shall prohibit an EISA 22provider from using other sources to provide additional 23verification. For the purposes of calculating the portion of a 24student's future income that would be consumed by the EISA for 25which the student has applied and other EISAs and education   SB1537 Enrolled- 15 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1loans known at the time, the EISA provider shall calculate the 2aggregate future burden of all such obligations, including the 3EISA for which the student is applying, at the hypothetical 4future income levels described in subdivision (a)(15)(iii) of 5Section 7-75, ranging from the income threshold of the EISA 6for which the student has applied up to the maximum income 7described in subdivision (a)(15)(iii) of Section 7-75. The 8terms of the EISA for which the student has applied cannot 9cause the student's aggregate future burden to exceed the 10percentage limits in this subsection at any of the income 11increments stated in this Section. For the purpose of 12calculating the percentage burden of an EISA at a given future 13income level, the EISA provider shall use the EISA payment 14amount that would be applicable for the EISA at such income 15level. For the purpose of calculating the percentage burden of 16an educational loan at a given future income level, the EISA 17provider shall divide the annual payment obligation by income 18level using the most affordable payment plan or option which 19would yield the lowest monthly payments that would be 20available to the student at such income level under such loan. 21For students enrolled in a program eligible to receive federal 22student loans under Title IV of the federal Higher Education 23Act of 1965, as part of this analysis the EISA provider shall 24assume a federal loan balance equal to the larger of (1) the 25student's existing federal loan balance and (2) the aggregate 26maximum amount the student is eligible to borrow under Federal   SB1537 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1Direct Stafford Loans for the student's status, dependent or 2independent.3    (b) The EISA must state that when a consumer has income 4that is equal to or below the income threshold set forth in the 5EISA that the consumer's payment obligation is zero dollars. 6The income threshold must be equal to or greater than $47,000; 7however, that amount shall be increased on January 1, 2026, 8and every other January 1 thereafter, by the annual unadjusted 9percentage increase (but not less than zero) in the index for 10the 12 months ending with the preceding September, including 11all previous adjustments.12    (c) An EISA must offer at least 3 months of voluntary 13payment relief pauses for every 30 income-determined payments 14required under the EISA. 15    (d) During the payment process for the EISA, the consumer 16may request that the income threshold on the EISA be adjusted 17upward to ensure the consumer's income, less any payments 18required by the EISA, would be greater than or equal to the 19minimum essential income based on the consumer's current place 20of residence. 21    As used in this subsection (d), the consumer's minimum 22essential income is equal to 275% of the federal poverty 23guidelines for a single person (for the year in which the 24calculation is performed), multiplied by a cost-of-living 25adjustment factor equal to the ratio of (i) one plus the 26current locality payment percentage issued by the U.S. Office   SB1537 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1of Personnel Management for the locality pay area in which the 2consumer resides, divided by (ii) one plus the current 3locality payment percentage issued by the U.S. Office of 4Personnel Management for the "Rest of U.S." locality pay area. 5The locality pay areas described in this subsection (d) are 6the locality pay areas described in 5 CFR 531.603. 7    An EISA provider must notify consumers of this option on 8each monthly billing statement. Nothing in this provision 9shall prevent an EISA provider from taking reasonable steps to 10confirm a consumer's place of residence (such as requiring a 11copy of a utility bill or a driver's license) for the purpose 12of establishing the consumer's minimum essential income, 13including if the EISA provider believes a consumer's place of 14residence has changed. Furthermore, an EISA provider may 15require that a consumer has resided at a location for at least 1690 days before adjusting the consumer's minimum essential 17income. 18    The requirements for repayment options in subsection (k) 19of Section 5-30 apply to this Section.  20    (110 ILCS 992/7-15 new)21    Sec. 7-15. Maximum effective annual percentage rate. An 22EISA must specify that the maximum amount that a consumer 23could be required to pay under the EISA will not result in a 24consumer ever being required to pay an effective annual 25percentage rate that is greater than 9% or the high yield of   SB1537 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1the 10-year United States Constant Maturity Treasury Notes 2auctioned at the final auction held before the current 3calendar year in which the EISA is originated plus 6%, 4whichever is greater. If at any time the EISA provider accepts 5a payment of an amount that would cause the limit in this 6Section to apply, the EISA provider shall, within 20 calendar 7days, refund any amounts necessary to ensure that the 8consumer's payments do not result in an effective annual 9percentage rate that is greater than the limit specified in 10this Section. 11    (110 ILCS 992/7-20 new)12    Sec. 7-20. Limits on duration of EISAs.13    (a) The EISA maximum number of payments shall not exceed 14180 monthly payments.15    (b) The EISA duration shall not exceed 240 months, 16excluding any months in which a consumer has requested and 17received a payment relief pause.  18    (110 ILCS 992/7-25 new)19    Sec. 7-25. Risk sharing.20    (a) An EISA provider may not contract for EISA terms that 21would result in a consumer having income that is less than or 22equal to 450% of the federal poverty guidelines for a single 23person for the EISA duration being required to make a stream of 24EISA payments that would yield an effective APR greater than   SB1537 Enrolled- 19 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b18.5%, or the high yield of the 10-year United States Constant 2Maturity Treasury Notes auctioned at the final auction held 3before the current calendar year in which an EISA offering is 4made plus 4.5%, whichever is greater.5    (b) An EISA provider shall calculate the effective APR in 6subsection (a) by determining the federal poverty guidelines 7at the time the consumer's EISA is originated and assuming 8such amount is fixed through the EISA duration.9    (c) For the purposes of determining EISA duration in this 10Section, an EISA provider shall assume the EISA duration 11started after a period equal to the expected length of the 12program for which a consumer is enrolling.13    (d) If there is a discrepancy between the effective annual 14percentage rate as calculated in this Section and the maximum 15effective annual percentage rate as calculated in Section 167-15, the lower effective annual percentage rate shall apply 17in this Section 7-25.  18    (110 ILCS 992/7-30 new)19    Sec. 7-30. Limits on covered income. An EISA must specify 20the definition of income to be used for the purposes of 21calculating a consumer's payment obligation under the EISA. No 22EISA shall include any of the following in its definition of 23income:24        (1) the income of the consumer's spouse, children, or 25    dependents or a party to a civil union with the consumer   SB1537 Enrolled- 20 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    under the Illinois Religious Freedom and Civil Union Act; 2    or3        (2) any amount paid by the consumer under Title II or 4    XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 401 et seq. or 42 5    U.S.C. 1381 et seq., or under a State program funded by 6    Title IV of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 601 et seq;7        (3) individual retirement account distributions;8        (4) pensions and annuities;9        (5) social security benefits;10        (6) any sources of government aid provided to 11    individuals, including, but not limited to:12            (A) unemployment programs;13            (B) disaster relief programs;14            (C) Medicare or Medicaid benefits;15            (D) benefits received through the Supplemental 16        Nutrition Assistance Program;17            (E) economic impact payments;18            (F) the earned income tax credit or child tax 19        credit;20            (G) other income excluded from the definition of 21        taxable income set forth by the Internal Revenue 22        Service; or23            (H) passive income that is not derived as a result 24        of a consumer's active participation in any trade or 25        business.   SB1537 Enrolled- 21 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1    (110 ILCS 992/7-35 new)2    Sec. 7-35.

The early termination mechanisms, such as total caps 9on payments due to the EISA provider or other rights to 10partially or fully terminate further obligations under the 11EISA, must be optional to the consumer and within the 12consumer's control. In such circumstances, such mechanisms 13shall not be deemed a form of acceleration.  14    (110 ILCS 992/7-60 new)15    Sec. 7-60.

In 7    computing the APR, the EISA provider shall use the amount 8    financed and may assume that the EISA will be disbursed in 9    the amount and with the disbursement schedule that it 10    reasonably expects to follow for such EISA and that 11    payments would commence on the date set forth in the EISA. 12    The income used in this disclosure shall include, at 13    minimum, the obligations at the following incomes:14            (i) no income;15            (ii) income equal to the annual equivalent of the 16        income threshold;17            (iii) various income scenarios with at least 18        calculations at annual incomes of $40,000, $60,000, 19        $80,000, $100,000, $125,000, $150,000, $175,000, and 20        $200,000; and21            (iv) if known by the EISA provider, the consumer's 22        current income;23        (16) a statement that the EISA is not a fixed payment 24    installment loan and that the amount the consumer will be 25    required to pay under the EISA:26            (i) may be more or less than the amount financed by   SB1537 Enrolled- 29 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1        the EISA provider; and2            (ii) will vary in proportion with the consumer's 3        income; and4        (17) a statement relating to the bankruptcy treatment 5    of the EISA consistent with the requirements set forth in 6    12 CFR 1026.47(a)(3)(iv), as it may be amended or 7    interpreted. 8    (b) The disclosures required by this Section shall be 9grouped together and segregated from all other information.10    (c) The disclosures required by this Section may be 11provided to a consumer in electronic form, subject to 12compliance with the consumer's consent and other applicable 13provisions of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National 14Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq., and applicable State 15law.16    (d) If model documents are established pursuant to any 17federal law covering income share agreements, compliance with 18those forms shall be considered compliance with this Act with 19respect to the disclosure requirements contained in this Act.  20    (110 ILCS 992/7-80 new)21    Sec. 7-80. Early completion. An EISA shall specify the 22terms and conditions by which the consumer may extinguish the 23consumer's obligations under the EISA before the end of the 24EISA's duration. An EISA must not include a prepayment penalty 25that violates the prohibition found in 15 U.S.C. 1650(e), as   SB1537 Enrolled- 30 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1it may be amended or interpreted. A consumer may always cancel 2an EISA by making aggregate payments, excluding payments to 3fees, equal to the EISA payment cap. The consumer is entitled 4to this early completion regardless of whether the consumer 5makes this early completion payment by making regularly 6scheduled payments or by making a single lump-sum payment in 7the amount of the early completion payment.8    This Section shall create an early completion mechanism 9for EISAs that is in lieu of other State laws regarding 10prepayment penalties. 11    (110 ILCS 992/7-85 new)12    Sec. 7-85. Assumption of increase in future income.13    (a) If a consumer fails to provide income documentation as 14reasonably required by an EISA, an EISA provider may assign an 15amount of income to the consumer and compute the consumer's 16monthly payment amount by any of the following methods, to the 17extent disclosed in the EISA:18        (1) assigning an income amount obtained from a 19    reasonably reliable third party or a credit reporting 20    agency;21        (2) if the consumer previously provided income 22    documentation or has had an income assigned in the prior 23    12-month period that has increased by an amount not to 24    exceed 10%, but such increase may not be applied more than 25    once per 12-month period;  SB1537 Enrolled- 31 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1        (3) contacting the Department of Revenue or the 2    Internal Revenue Service to obtain the most recent 3    information available about the student's income; or4        (4) assigning a reasonable qualified income based on 5    the incomes of the nearest reasonably relevant quantile of 6    income of consumers who attended the same or a reasonably 7    comparable covered educational program or course of study, 8    as determined by information published by the Bureau of 9    Labor Statistics or other reasonably reliable publicly 10    available data sources.11    (b) If an EISA provider assigns an income to a consumer's 12EISA, then it shall notify the consumer in the monthly billing 13statement, and in each billing statement thereafter while the 14assigned income remains applicable to the consumer's EISA, 15that income has been assigned and of the consumer's rights 16under this Section.17    (c) If the consumer does provide income information as 18reasonably required by the EISA within one year of the date on 19which the EISA provider notified the consumer that assigned 20income will be applied to the EISA, then, within 15 days after 21the EISA provider's receipt of such information, the EISA 22provider shall update each prior instance in which assigned 23income was applied using the income information provided by 24the consumer; if the consumer provides income information more 25than one year after the EISA provider first assigned income to 26the consumer's EISA, then the EISA provider may, but is not   SB1537 Enrolled- 32 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1obligated to, update each prior instance in which assigned 2income was applied using the income information provided by 3the consumer.4    (d) An EISA provider that assigns income to an EISA shall 5retain all applicable records relating to the method and data 6sources used to make such estimation for 3 years after the end 7of that EISA.  8    (110 ILCS 992/7-90 new)9    Sec. 7-90.

Adjustment of dollar amounts.2    (a) From time to time, the dollar amounts in this Act 3designated as subject to change shall change, as provided in 4this Section, according to and to the extent of changes in the 5index.6    (b) The index for December of the year preceding the year 7in which this Act becomes effective is the reference base 8index.9    (c) The designated dollar amounts shall change on July 1 10of each even-numbered year if the percentage of change, 11calculated to the nearest whole percentage point, between the 12index and the end of the preceding year and the reference base 13index is 10% or more, but:14        (1) the portion of the percentage change in the index 15    in excess of a multiple of 10% shall be disregarded and the 16    dollar amounts shall change only in multiples of 10% of 17    the amounts provided in this Act on the date of enactment; 18    and19        (2) the dollar amounts shall not change if the amounts 20    required by this Section are those currently in effect 21    pursuant to this Act as a result of earlier application of 22    this Section.23    (d) If the index is revised, the percentage of change 24pursuant to this Section shall be calculated on the basis of 25the revised index. If a revision of the index changes the 26reference base index, a revised reference base index shall be   SB1537 Enrolled- 34 -LRB104 08584 JDS 18636 b1determined by multiplying the reference base index then 2applicable by the rebasing factor furnished by the Bureau of 3Labor Statistics. If the index is superseded, the index 4referred to in this Section is the one represented by the 5Bureau of Labor Statistics as reflecting most accurately 6changes in the purchasing power of the dollar for consumers.7    (e) The Department shall adopt a rule setting forth, on or 8before April 30 of each year in which dollar amounts are to 9change, the changes in dollar amounts required by this 10Section. As soon as practical after the changes occur, the 11Department shall adopt a rule setting forth the changes in the 12index required by subsection (d), including, if applicable, 13the numerical equivalent of the reference base index under a 14revised reference base index and the designation or title of 15any index superseding the index.16    (f) A person does not violate this Act with respect to a 17transaction otherwise complying with this Act if the person 18relies on dollar amounts either determined according to 19subsection (c) or appearing in the last rule of the Department 20announcing the then-current dollar amounts.  21    (110 ILCS 992/7-100 new)22    Sec. 7-100.
