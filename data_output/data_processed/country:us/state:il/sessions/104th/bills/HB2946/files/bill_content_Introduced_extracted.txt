Effective January 1, 2027.LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b  A BILL FOR HB2946LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b1    AN ACT concerning employment. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the Family 5and Medical Leave Insurance Act. 6    Section 5. Declaration of policy and intent. Many workers 7do not have access to family and medical leave programs, those 8who do may not be in a financial position to take family or 9medical leave that is unpaid, and employer-paid benefits meet 10only a relatively small part of this need. It is the public 11policy of this State to protect working individuals and their 12families against the economic hardship caused by the need to 13take time off from work to care for themselves or family 14members who are suffering from a serious illness, for a 15newborn or a newly adopted or foster child, for pregnancy and 16related conditions, for the health and caregiving needs of 17military families, or to cope with domestic and sexual 18violence.19    The disparities for access to and the need for leave cut 20across income and other demographics. Higher income workers 21have greater access to paid leave than lower income workers; 22women workers have higher rates of unmet need for leave than 23men; Black, Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Native   HB2946- 2 -LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b1American workers have higher rates of unmet need for leave 2than white workers; and Hispanic workers are less likely than 3non-Hispanic workers to have access to paid leave in the first 4place.5    Moreover, in 73% of all Illinois households with children, 6more than 2,000,000 homes, all parents have paying jobs. 7Illinois mothers are key family breadwinners in 84% of black 8families, 49% of Latinx families, and 48% of white families. 9While women make up half of the workforce, they are 10responsible for the majority of unpaid family household and 11care work, which has a significant impact on their health and 12well-being. Maintaining an attachment to the workforce is 13vital to women's economic stability; an employment gap of just 14one year leads to a 39% decrease in annual earnings, and that 15disparity increases over time. With the demographic shift 16toward an aging population, the need for family caregiving 17continues to grow. In less than 15 years, the share of the 18State's population of individuals aged 65 and over will grow 19by one-third. If any of these women take unpaid leave, her 20whole family, and Illinois, suffers.21    The United States is the only industrialized nation in the 22world that does not have a mandatory workplace-based program 23for such income support. The negative economic impact on 24families and our economy is real. A U.S. Department of Labor 25report indicates if women participated in the labor force at 26the same rate as women in countries with paid leave, our   HB2946- 3 -LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b1economy would benefit from more than $500 billion in 2additional economic activity.3    Providing parents and caregivers with paid leave from work 4to care for their infants and young children is critical to the 5healthy development of children and families. Attentive and 6consistent relationships between very young children and their 7families help children develop the ability to learn, to form 8positive relationships, and to exercise self-control. Without 9paid family and medical leave, most families are forced to 10choose between caring for their children and their economic 11security.12    The majority of Illinois small business owners and 13entrepreneurs support a State-administered paid family and 14medical leave program as it ensures economic security, 15strengthens business recruitment and retention of employees, 16and mitigates the loss of income for small business owners, 17which comprise over 90% of businesses in the United States, 18including the self-employed and businesses with under 10 19employees.20    It is therefore desirable and necessary to develop systems 21that help individuals and families adapt to the competing 22interests of work and home, which not only benefit workers, 23but also benefit employers by reducing employee turnover and 24increasing worker productivity.25    It is the intent of the General Assembly to create a family 26and medical leave program to relieve the serious menace to   HB2946- 4 -LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b1health, morals, and welfare of Illinois families, to increase 2workplace productivity, and to alleviate the enormous and 3growing stress on working families of balancing the demands of 4work and family needs. It is the intent of the General Assembly 5that this Act shall be liberally construed in favor of 6providing workers with the greatest amount of paid family and 7medical leave coverage, benefits, and employment security. 8    Section 10.

For leave under paragraphs (F) and (G) of item (19) 4of Section 10, a statement signed by the covered individual is 5acceptable documentation for certification.6    (b) The eligibility for benefits of an employee, an 7individual who contracts with a covered business entity, or a 8domestic worker is not affected by a strike or lockout at the 9factory, establishment, or other premises at which the 10employee is or was last employed.11    (c) An employee, individual who contracts for services 12with a covered business entity, or domestic worker who has 13received benefits under this Act may not lose any other 14employment benefits, including seniority or pension rights, 15accrued before the date that family and medical leave 16commenced. The employer or covered business entity shall 17maintain during any period of family and medical leave taken 18the health benefits of the employee and, if applicable, the 19dependents of the employee, the individual who contracts for 20services with a covered business entity, or the domestic 21worker in force at the time a request for family and medical 22leave was made, for the duration of such leave as if the 23employee, individual who contracts for services with a covered 24business entity, or domestic worker had continued to work from 25the date the employee, individual who contracts for services 26with a covered business entity, or domestic worker commenced   HB2946- 24 -LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b1the family and medical leave until the date the employee, 2individual who contracts for services with a covered business 3entity, or domestic worker returns to work.

The   HB2946- 29 -LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b1Department shall set rates for premiums in a manner that 2minimizes the volatility of the rates assessed and so that at 3the end of the period for which the rates are effective, the 4cash balance shall be an amount approximating 125% of 12 5months of projected expenditures from the Fund, considering 6the functions and duties of the Department under this Act.7    (f) An employer or covered business entity required to pay 8premium contributions under this Section shall make and file a 9report of amounts due under this Section upon a combined 10report form prescribed by the Department. The report shall be 11filed with the Department at the times and in the manner 12prescribed by the Department.13    (g) If the employer or covered business entity is a 14temporary employment agency that provides employees or 15individuals who contract for services with a covered business 16entity on a temporary basis to its customers, the temporary 17employment agency is considered a joint employer with its 18customers for purposes of this Act.19    (h) When an employer or covered business entity goes out 20of business or sells out, exchanges, or otherwise disposes of 21the business or stock of goods, any premiums payable under 22this Section are immediately due and payable, and the employer 23or covered business entity shall, within 10 days thereafter, 24pay the premiums due.

Harper SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act30 ILCS 105/5.1030 new    Creates the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Program Act.

Amends the State Finance Act. Creates the Family and Medical Leave Insurance Account Fund. Provides phase-in periods for the collection of money and making of claims for benefits under the Act. Effective January 1, 2027.LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b  A BILL FOR HB2946LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b1    AN ACT concerning employment. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the Family 5and Medical Leave Insurance Act. 6    Section 5. Declaration of policy and intent. Many workers 7do not have access to family and medical leave programs, those 8who do may not be in a financial position to take family or 9medical leave that is unpaid, and employer-paid benefits meet 10only a relatively small part of this need. It is the public 11policy of this State to protect working individuals and their 12families against the economic hardship caused by the need to 13take time off from work to care for themselves or family 14members who are suffering from a serious illness, for a 15newborn or a newly adopted or foster child, for pregnancy and 16related conditions, for the health and caregiving needs of 17military families, or to cope with domestic and sexual 18violence.19    The disparities for access to and the need for leave cut 20across income and other demographics. Higher income workers 21have greater access to paid leave than lower income workers; 22women workers have higher rates of unmet need for leave than 23men; Black, Asian American, Pacific Islander, and Native   HB2946- 2 -LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b1American workers have higher rates of unmet need for leave 2than white workers; and Hispanic workers are less likely than 3non-Hispanic workers to have access to paid leave in the first 4place.5    Moreover, in 73% of all Illinois households with children, 6more than 2,000,000 homes, all parents have paying jobs. 7Illinois mothers are key family breadwinners in 84% of black 8families, 49% of Latinx families, and 48% of white families. 9While women make up half of the workforce, they are 10responsible for the majority of unpaid family household and 11care work, which has a significant impact on their health and 12well-being. Maintaining an attachment to the workforce is 13vital to women's economic stability; an employment gap of just 14one year leads to a 39% decrease in annual earnings, and that 15disparity increases over time. With the demographic shift 16toward an aging population, the need for family caregiving 17continues to grow. In less than 15 years, the share of the 18State's population of individuals aged 65 and over will grow 19by one-third. If any of these women take unpaid leave, her 20whole family, and Illinois, suffers.21    The United States is the only industrialized nation in the 22world that does not have a mandatory workplace-based program 23for such income support. The negative economic impact on 24families and our economy is real. A U.S. Department of Labor 25report indicates if women participated in the labor force at 26the same rate as women in countries with paid leave, our   HB2946- 3 -LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b1economy would benefit from more than $500 billion in 2additional economic activity.3    Providing parents and caregivers with paid leave from work 4to care for their infants and young children is critical to the 5healthy development of children and families. Attentive and 6consistent relationships between very young children and their 7families help children develop the ability to learn, to form 8positive relationships, and to exercise self-control. Without 9paid family and medical leave, most families are forced to 10choose between caring for their children and their economic 11security.12    The majority of Illinois small business owners and 13entrepreneurs support a State-administered paid family and 14medical leave program as it ensures economic security, 15strengthens business recruitment and retention of employees, 16and mitigates the loss of income for small business owners, 17which comprise over 90% of businesses in the United States, 18including the self-employed and businesses with under 10 19employees.20    It is therefore desirable and necessary to develop systems 21that help individuals and families adapt to the competing 22interests of work and home, which not only benefit workers, 23but also benefit employers by reducing employee turnover and 24increasing worker productivity.25    It is the intent of the General Assembly to create a family 26and medical leave program to relieve the serious menace to   HB2946- 4 -LRB104 08291 SPS 18342 b1health, morals, and welfare of Illinois families, to increase 2workplace productivity, and to alleviate the enormous and 3growing stress on working families of balancing the demands of 4work and family needs. It is the intent of the General Assembly 5that this Act shall be liberally construed in favor of 6providing workers with the greatest amount of paid family and 7medical leave coverage, benefits, and employment security. 8    Section 10.
