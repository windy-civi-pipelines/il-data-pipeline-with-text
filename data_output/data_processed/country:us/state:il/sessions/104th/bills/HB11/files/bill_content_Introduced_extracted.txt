If the board acts to expel a student, 3the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 4reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 5is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 6shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 7the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 8transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 9in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 10denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 11which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 12of students or staff in the alternative program. 13    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 14superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 15principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 16students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 17suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 18the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 19subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 20shall lie against them for such suspension.

For the purposes of this Section, 25    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 26    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code,   HB0011- 8 -LRB104 03326 LNS 13348 b1    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 2    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 3    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012.

As a matter of public policy, the General 13Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 14privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 15left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 16the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 17conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 18lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 19controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 20illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 21searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 22If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 23evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 24the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 25such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 26disciplinary action may be taken.

A school district that 14adopts a policy under this subsection (g) must include a 15provision allowing for consideration of any mitigating 16factors, including, but not limited to, a student's status as 17a parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 18violence, as defined in Article 26A. 19    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 20students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 21difficulties.22    (i) A student may not be issued a monetary fine or fee as a 23disciplinary consequence, though this shall not preclude 24requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, stolen, 25or damaged property.26    (j) Subsections (a) through (i) of this Section shall   HB0011- 23 -LRB104 03326 LNS 13348 b1apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter schools, 2special charter districts, and school districts organized 3under Article 34 of this Code. 4    (k) Through June 30, 2026, the expulsion of students 5enrolled in programs funded under Section 1C-2 of this Code is 6subject to the requirements under paragraph (7) of subsection 7(a) of Section 2-3.71 of this Code.8    (k-5) On and after July 1, 2026, the expulsion of children 9enrolled in programs funded under Section 15-25 of the 10Department of Early Childhood Act is subject to the 11requirements of paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 1215-30 of the Department of Early Childhood Act. 13    (l) An in-school suspension program provided by a school 14district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may 15focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and 16positive interaction with other students and school personnel. 17A school district may employ a school social worker or a 18licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school 19suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12. 20(Source: P.A. 102-466, eff. 7-1-25; 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 21102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-594, eff. 6-25-24; 103-896, eff. 228-9-24; revised 9-25-24.) 23    Section 95.
