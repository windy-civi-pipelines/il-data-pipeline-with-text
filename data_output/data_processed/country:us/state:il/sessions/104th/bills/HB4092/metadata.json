Provides that any party seeking a waiver of fees, costs, or charges or seeking to use a previously ordered waiver of fees, costs, or charges shall provide proper notice to all other parties and attorneys of record prior to presenting the application for the waiver of fees, costs, or charges to the court and the court shall not enter an order for a waiver of fees, costs, or charges unless the applicant shows proof of proper notice. Provides that the waiver of fees, costs, or charges shall not automatically apply to fees, costs, or charges ordered or required to be paid for specified fees and costs under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act but shall instead be considered by the court in each individual case. Effective immediately."
