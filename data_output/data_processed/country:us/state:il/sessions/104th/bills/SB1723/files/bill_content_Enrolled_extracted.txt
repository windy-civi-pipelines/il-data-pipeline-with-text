Full Text of SB1723 ILGA.GOV SB1723 - 104th General Assembly SB1723 EnrolledLRB104 10079 BDA 20151 b1    AN ACT concerning safety. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Findings and intent. The General Assembly finds 5that:6    (1) The Underground Injection Control (UIC) program is 7authorized by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to develop 8requirements and provisions for the injection of fluids into 9the subsurface for the purposes of storage or disposal. The 10main goal of the UIC Program is the protection of Underground 11Sources of Drinking Water (USDWs). USDWs are aquifers or parts 12of aquifers that supply a public water system or contain a 13sufficient quantity of groundwater to supply a public water 14system now or in the future.15    (2) The General Assembly finds that the Mahomet Aquifer is 16unique in that it is the sole source of drinking water for 17central Illinois residents.18    (3) The General Assembly further finds that, although 19carbon sequestration undergoes rigorous federal and State 20permitting, the uniqueness of the Mahomet Aquifer being the 21sole source of drinking water for central Illinois residents 22warrants additional protections.23    (4) The General Assembly further finds that, although 24additional review of carbon sequestration activity in the   SB1723 Enrolled- 2 -LRB104 10079 BDA 20151 b1Mahomet Aquifer area is warranted because it is a sole source 2aquifer, carbon sequestration activities are allowed in areas 3outside of the aquifer, and carbon sequestration technologies 4are useful and reliable tools in addressing climate change and 5allowing the State to meet its decarbonization goals. 6    Section 5. The Environmental Protection Act is amended by 7changing Sections 59 and 59.5 and by adding Section 59.18 as 8follows: 9    (415 ILCS 5/59)10    Sec. 59. Definitions. As used in this Title:11    "Carbon dioxide capture project" mean a project or 12facility that:13        (1) uses equipment to capture a significant quantity 14    of carbon dioxide directly from the ambient air or uses a 15    process to separate carbon dioxide from industrial or 16    energy-related sources, other than oil or gas production 17    from a well; and18        (2) produces a concentrated fluid of carbon dioxide. 19    "Carbon dioxide stream" means carbon dioxide, any 20incidental associated substances derived from the source 21materials and process of producing or capturing carbon 22dioxide, and any substance added to the stream to enable or 23improve the injection process or the detection of a leak or 24rupture.  SB1723 Enrolled- 3 -LRB104 10079 BDA 20151 b1    "Carbon sequestration activity" means the injection of one 2or more carbon dioxide streams into underground geologic 3formations under at least one Class VI well permit for 4long-term sequestration.5    "Criteria pollutants" means the 6 pollutants for which the 6United States Environmental Protection Agency has set National 7Ambient Air Quality Standards under Section 109 of the Clean 8Air Act, together with recognized precursors to those 9pollutants. 10    "Injection" means the placement of materials into the 11subsurface from a well. 12    "Project labor agreement" means a prehire collective 13bargaining agreement that covers all terms and conditions of 14employment on a specific construction project and must include 15the following:16        (1) provisions establishing the minimum hourly wage 17    for each class of labor organization employee;18        (2) provisions establishing the benefits and other 19    compensation for each class of labor organization 20    employee;21        (3) provisions establishing that no strike or disputes 22    will be engaged in by the labor organization employees;23        (4) provisions establishing that no lockout or 24    disputes will be engaged in by the general contractor 25    building the project; and26        (5) provisions for minorities and women, as defined   SB1723 Enrolled- 4 -LRB104 10079 BDA 20151 b1    under the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and 2    Persons with Disabilities Act, setting forth goals for 3    apprenticeship hours to be performed by minorities and 4    women and setting forth goals for total hours to be 5    performed by underrepresented minorities and women.6"Project labor agreement" includes other terms and conditions 7a labor organization or general contractor building the 8project deems necessary. 9    "Sequestration facility" means the carbon dioxide 10sequestration reservoir, underground equipment, including, but 11not limited to, well penetrations, and surface facilities and 12equipment used or proposed to be used in a carbon 13sequestration activity. "Sequestration facility" includes each 14injection well and equipment used to connect surface 15activities to the carbon dioxide sequestration reservoir and 16underground equipment. "Sequestration facility" does not 17include pipelines used to transport carbon dioxide to a 18sequestration facility. 19    "Sole source aquifer" means an aquifer designated as a 20sole source or principal aquifer by the United States 21Environmental Protection Agency under the Safe Drinking Water 22Act, which, for purposes of this definition, consists of the 23Sole Source Aquifer Area, as designated by the United States 24Environmental Protection Agency on March 19, 2015. 25(Source: P.A. 103-651, eff. 7-18-24.)   SB1723 Enrolled- 5 -LRB104 10079 BDA 20151 b1    (415 ILCS 5/59.5)2    Sec. 59.5.
