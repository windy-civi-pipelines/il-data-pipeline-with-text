Amend Senate Bill 1723, AS AMENDED, 3by replacing everything after the enacting clause with the 4following: 5    "Section 1. Findings and intent. The General Assembly 6finds that:7    (1) The Underground Injection Control (UIC) program is 8authorized by the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to develop 9requirements and provisions for the injection of fluids into 10the subsurface for the purposes of storage or disposal. The 11main goal of the UIC Program is the protection of Underground 12Sources of Drinking Water (USDWs). USDWs are aquifers or parts 13of aquifers that supply a public water system or contain a 14sufficient quantity of groundwater to supply a public water 15system now or in the future.16    (2) The General Assembly finds that the Mahomet Aquifer is 17unique in that it is the sole source of drinking water for   10400SB1723sam002- 2 -LRB104 10079 JDS 25219 a1central Illinois residents.2    (3) The General Assembly further finds that, although 3carbon sequestration undergoes rigorous federal and State 4permitting, the uniqueness of the Mahomet Aquifer being the 5sole source of drinking water for central Illinois residents 6warrants additional protections.7    (4) The General Assembly further finds that, although 8additional review of carbon sequestration activity in the 9Mahomet Aquifer area is warranted because it is a sole source 10aquifer, carbon sequestration activities are allowed in areas 11outside of the aquifer, and carbon sequestration technologies 12are useful and reliable tools in addressing climate change and 13allowing the State to meet its decarbonization goals. 14    Section 5. The Environmental Protection Act is amended by 15changing Sections 59 and 59.5 and by adding Section 59.18 as 16follows: 17    (415 ILCS 5/59)18    Sec. 59. Definitions.
