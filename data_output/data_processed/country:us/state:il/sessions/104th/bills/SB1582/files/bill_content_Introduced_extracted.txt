Laura Fine SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act    Creates the Appliance Standards Act. Directs the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency to adopt minimum efficiency standards for covered products. Provides for testing, certification, and labeling of covered products. Contains provisions concerning enforcement of the Act's requirements. Provides for administrative rulemaking by the Agency. Makes findings. Defines terms.LRB104 02948 BDA 12964 b  A BILL FOR SB1582LRB104 02948 BDA 12964 b1    AN ACT concerning safety. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Appliance Standards Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that:7        (1) Efficiency standards for certain products sold or 8    installed in the State assure consumers and businesses 9    that the products meet minimum efficiency performance 10    levels, thus reducing energy and water waste and saving 11    consumers and businesses money on utility bills.12        (2) Efficiency standards save energy and reduce 13    climate-changing emissions and other environmental impacts 14    associated with the production, distribution, and use of 15    electricity, natural gas, and related fuels.16        (3) Efficiency standards also save water, mitigating 17    the effects of short-term and long-term droughts and 18    helping to conserve fresh water supplies.19        (4) Utility savings resulting from more efficient 20    products benefit all consumers but are especially 21    important to low-income families, who spend a 22    disproportionate share of their income on utilities. 23    Efficiency standards also help the State and local   SB1582- 2 -LRB104 02948 BDA 12964 b1    economies because utility savings can be spent on local 2    goods and services.3        (5) Energy and water savings help reduce or delay the 4    need for expensive investments in new power plants, 5    transmission lines, and distribution system upgrades, new 6    and expanded gas pipelines, and water and sewer 7    infrastructure improvements. 8    Section 10.

Any person who commits a violation 10after the issuance of such warning may, following notice and 11an opportunity to be heard, be subject to a civil penalty, 12issued by the Agency, of up to one hundred dollars for each 13offense. Any further violations committed by such person after 14this second violation may be subject to a civil penalty of not 15more than $500 for each offense. Each product offered, sold, 16or distributed in violation of this Act may constitute a 17separate violation, each violation may constitute a separate 18offense, and each day that such violation occurs may 19constitute a separate offense. Penalties assessed under this 20subsection are in addition to costs assessed under subsection 21(d) of this Section.22    (g) If the Agency finds repeated violations have occurred, 23it may refer the matter to the Attorney General. The Attorney 24General may institute proceedings to seek an injunction in 25circuit court to enforce the provisions of this Act, in 26addition to any other remedies under this Act or in law or   SB1582- 18 -LRB104 02948 BDA 12964 b1equity.2    (h) The Agency may adopt any rules necessary to ensure the 3proper implementation, administration, and enforcement of the 4provisions of this Act. 5    Section 97.
