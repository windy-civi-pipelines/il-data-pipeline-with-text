The presiding   HB3672- 2 -LRB104 11447 HLH 21535 b1officer of the county board, with the advice and consent of the 2board, may appoint on its behalf some officer, person, or 3entity to attend such sales, bid on tax liens or certificates, 4and act on behalf of the county when exercising its authority 5under this Section. The county shall apply on the bid or 6purchase the unpaid taxes and special assessments due upon the 7property.
