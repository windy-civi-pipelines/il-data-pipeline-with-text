The Workers' Compensation Act is amended by 5changing Section 8 as follows: 6    (820 ILCS 305/8)  (from Ch. 48, par. 138.8)7    Sec. 8. The amount of compensation which shall be paid to 8the employee for an accidental injury not resulting in death 9is:10    (a) The employer shall provide and pay the negotiated 11rate, if applicable, or the lesser of the health care 12provider's actual charges or according to a fee schedule, 13subject to Section 8.2, in effect at the time the service was 14rendered for all the necessary first aid, medical and surgical 15services, and all necessary medical, surgical and hospital 16services thereafter incurred, limited, however, to that which 17is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of 18the accidental injury, even if a health care provider sells, 19transfers, or otherwise assigns an account receivable for 20procedures, treatments, or services covered under this Act. If 21the employer does not dispute payment of first aid, medical, 22surgical, and hospital services, the employer shall make such 23payment to the provider on behalf of the employee. The   HB1259- 2 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1employer shall also pay for treatment, instruction and 2training necessary for the physical, mental and vocational 3rehabilitation of the employee, including all maintenance 4costs and expenses incidental thereto. If as a result of the 5injury the employee is unable to be self-sufficient the 6employer shall further pay for such maintenance or 7institutional care as shall be required.8    The employee may at any time elect to secure his own 9physician, surgeon and hospital services at the employer's 10expense, or, 11    Upon agreement between the employer and the employees, or 12the employees' exclusive representative, and subject to the 13approval of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the 14employer shall maintain a list of physicians, to be known as a 15Panel of Physicians, who are accessible to the employees. The 16employer shall post this list in a place or places easily 17accessible to his employees. The employee shall have the right 18to make an alternative choice of physician from such Panel if 19he is not satisfied with the physician first selected. If, due 20to the nature of the injury or its occurrence away from the 21employer's place of business, the employee is unable to make a 22selection from the Panel, the selection process from the Panel 23shall not apply. The physician selected from the Panel may 24arrange for any consultation, referral or other specialized 25medical services outside the Panel at the employer's expense. 26Provided that, in the event the Commission shall find that a   HB1259- 3 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1doctor selected by the employee is rendering improper or 2inadequate care, the Commission may order the employee to 3select another doctor certified or qualified in the medical 4field for which treatment is required. If the employee refuses 5to make such change the Commission may relieve the employer of 6his obligation to pay the doctor's charges from the date of 7refusal to the date of compliance.8    Any vocational rehabilitation counselors who provide 9service under this Act shall have appropriate certifications 10which designate the counselor as qualified to render opinions 11relating to vocational rehabilitation. Vocational 12rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, counseling 13for job searches, supervising a job search program, and 14vocational retraining including education at an accredited 15learning institution. The employee or employer may petition to 16the Commission to decide disputes relating to vocational 17rehabilitation and the Commission shall resolve any such 18dispute, including payment of the vocational rehabilitation 19program by the employer.20    The maintenance benefit shall not be less than the 21temporary total disability rate determined for the employee. 22In addition, maintenance shall include costs and expenses 23incidental to the vocational rehabilitation program.24    When the employee is working light duty on a part-time 25basis or full-time basis and earns less than he or she would be 26earning if employed in the full capacity of the job or jobs,   HB1259- 4 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1then the employee shall be entitled to temporary partial 2disability benefits. Temporary partial disability benefits 3shall be equal to two-thirds of the difference between the 4average amount that the employee would be able to earn in the 5full performance of his or her duties in the occupation in 6which he or she was engaged at the time of accident and the 7gross amount which he or she is earning in the modified job 8provided to the employee by the employer or in any other job 9that the employee is working.10    Every hospital, physician, surgeon or other person 11rendering treatment or services in accordance with the 12provisions of this Section shall upon written request furnish 13full and complete reports thereof to, and permit their records 14to be copied by, the employer, the employee or his dependents, 15as the case may be, or any other party to any proceeding for 16compensation before the Commission, or their attorneys.17    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer's liability to 18pay for such medical services selected by the employee shall 19be limited to:20        (1) all first aid and emergency treatment; plus21        (2) all medical, surgical and hospital services 22    provided by the physician, surgeon or hospital initially 23    chosen by the employee or by any other physician, 24    consultant, expert, institution or other provider of 25    services recommended by said initial service provider or 26    any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain   HB1259- 5 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1    of referrals from said initial service provider; plus2        (3) all medical, surgical and hospital services 3    provided by any second physician, surgeon or hospital 4    subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other 5    physician, consultant, expert, institution or other 6    provider of services recommended by said second service 7    provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in 8    the chain of referrals from said second service provider. 9    Thereafter the employer shall select and pay for all 10    necessary medical, surgical and hospital treatment and the 11    employee may not select a provider of medical services at 12    the employer's expense unless the employer agrees to such 13    selection. At any time the employee may obtain any medical 14    treatment he desires at his own expense. This paragraph 15    shall not affect the duty to pay for rehabilitation 16    referred to above.17        (4) The following shall apply for injuries occurring 18    on or after June 28, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 19    97-18) and only when an employer has an approved preferred 20    provider program pursuant to Section 8.1a on the date the 21    employee sustained his or her accidental injuries:22            (A) The employer shall, in writing, on a form 23        promulgated by the Commission, inform the employee of 24        the preferred provider program;25            (B) Subsequent to the report of an injury by an 26        employee, the employee may choose in writing at any   HB1259- 6 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1        time to decline the preferred provider program, in 2        which case that would constitute one of the two 3        choices of medical providers to which the employee is 4        entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3); and5            (C) Prior to the report of an injury by an 6        employee, when an employee chooses non-emergency 7        treatment from a provider not within the preferred 8        provider program, that would constitute the employee's 9        one choice of medical providers to which the employee 10        is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3). 11    When an employer and employee so agree in writing, nothing 12in this Act prevents an employee whose injury or disability 13has been established under this Act, from relying in good 14faith, on treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone, in 15accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church 16or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner 17thereof, and having nursing services appropriate therewith, 18without suffering loss or diminution of the compensation 19benefits under this Act. However, the employee shall submit to 20all physical examinations required by this Act. The cost of 21such treatment and nursing care shall be paid by the employee 22unless the employer agrees to make such payment.23    Where the accidental injury results in the amputation of 24an arm, hand, leg or foot, or the enucleation of an eye, or the 25loss of any of the natural teeth, the employer shall furnish an 26artificial of any such members lost or damaged in accidental   HB1259- 7 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and 2shall also furnish the necessary braces in all proper and 3necessary cases.

Where the accidental injury 7accompanied by physical injury results in damage to a denture, 8eye glasses or contact eye lenses, or where the accidental 9injury results in damage to an artificial member, the employer 10shall replace or repair such denture, glasses, lenses, or 11artificial member.12    The furnishing by the employer of any such services or 13appliances is not an admission of liability on the part of the 14employer to pay compensation.15    The furnishing of any such services or appliances or the 16servicing thereof by the employer is not the payment of 17compensation.18    (b) If the period of temporary total incapacity for work 19lasts more than 3 working days, weekly compensation as 20hereinafter provided shall be paid beginning on the 4th day of 21such temporary total incapacity and continuing as long as the 22total temporary incapacity lasts.

For the permanent partial loss of use of a member 8    or sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, compensation 9    during that proportion of the number of weeks in the 10    foregoing schedule provided for the loss of such member or 11    sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, which the partial 12    loss of use thereof bears to the total loss of use of such 13    member, or sight of eye, or hearing of an ear.14            (a) Loss of hearing for compensation purposes 15        shall be confined to the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 16        and 3,000 cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability 17        for frequency tones above 3,000 cycles per second are 18        not to be considered as constituting disability for 19        hearing.20            (b) The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of 21        the determination of compensation claims for 22        occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the 23        average in decibels for the thresholds of hearing for 24        the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 cycles per 25        second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric 26        instruments, approved by nationally recognized   HB1259- 24 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1        authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring 2        hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 30 3        decibels or less in the 3 frequencies, such losses of 4        hearing shall not then constitute any compensable 5        hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 6        85 decibels or more in the 3 frequencies, then the same 7        shall constitute and be total or 100% compensable 8        hearing loss.9            (c) In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest 10        measured losses in each of the 3 frequencies shall be 11        added together and divided by 3 to determine the 12        average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss 13        exceeding 30 decibels an allowance of 1.82% shall be 14        made up to the maximum of 100% which is reached at 85 15        decibels.16            (d) If a hearing loss is established to have 17        existed on July 1, 1975 by audiometric testing the 18        employer shall not be liable for the previous loss so 19        established nor shall he be liable for any loss for 20        which compensation has been paid or awarded.21            (e) No consideration shall be given to the 22        question of whether or not the ability of an employee 23        to understand speech is improved by the use of a 24        hearing aid.25            (f) No claim for loss of hearing due to industrial 26        noise shall be brought against an employer or allowed   HB1259- 25 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1        unless the employee has been exposed for a period of 2        time sufficient to cause permanent impairment to noise 3        levels in excess of the following: 4Sound Level DBA5Slow ResponseHours Per Day6908792689549973101002111021-1/2121051131101/2141151/415        This subparagraph (f) shall not be applied in cases of 16    hearing loss resulting from trauma or explosion.17        17. In computing the compensation to be paid to any 18    employee who, before the accident for which he claims 19    compensation, had before that time sustained an injury 20    resulting in the loss by amputation or partial loss by 21    amputation of any member, including hand, arm, thumb or 22    fingers, leg, foot, or any toes or the loss described in 23    subparagraph 2 of paragraph (d) due to accidental injuries 24    to the same part of the spine, such loss or partial loss of 25    any such member or the loss described in subparagraph 2 of 26    paragraph (d) due to accidental injuries to the same part   HB1259- 26 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1    of the spine shall be deducted from any award made for the 2    subsequent injury. For the permanent loss of use or the 3    permanent partial loss of use of any such member or the 4    partial loss of sight of an eye or the loss described in 5    subparagraph 2 of paragraph (d) due to accidental injuries 6    to the same part of the spine, for which compensation has 7    been paid, then such loss shall be taken into 8    consideration and deducted from any award for the 9    subsequent injury. As used in this subparagraph, "same 10    part of the spine" means the cervical and thoracic spine 11    from vertebra C1 through T12 and the lumbar and sacral 12    spine and coccyx from vertebra L1 through S5. 13        18. The specific case of loss of both hands, both 14    arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any 15    two thereof, or the permanent and complete loss of the use 16    thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be 17    compensated according to the compensation fixed by 18    paragraph (f) of this Section. These specific cases of 19    total and permanent disability do not exclude other cases.20        Any employee who has previously suffered the loss or 21    permanent and complete loss of the use of any of such 22    members, and in a subsequent independent accident loses 23    another or suffers the permanent and complete loss of the 24    use of any one of such members the employer for whom the 25    injured employee is working at the time of the last 26    independent accident is liable to pay compensation only   HB1259- 27 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1    for the loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of 2    the member occasioned by the last independent accident.3        19. In a case of specific loss and the subsequent 4    death of such injured employee from other causes than such 5    injury leaving a widow, widower, or dependents surviving 6    before payment or payment in full for such injury, then 7    the amount due for such injury is payable to the widow or 8    widower and, if there be no widow or widower, then to such 9    dependents, in the proportion which such dependency bears 10    to total dependency.11    Beginning July 1, 1980, and every 6 months thereafter, the 12Commission shall examine the Second Injury Fund and when, 13after deducting all advances or loans made to such Fund, the 14amount therein is $500,000 then the amount required to be paid 15by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 16reduced by one-half. When the Second Injury Fund reaches the 17sum of $600,000 then the payments shall cease entirely. 18However, when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to 19$400,000, payment of one-half of the amounts required by 20paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 21herein provided, and when the Second Injury Fund has been 22reduced to $300,000, payment of the full amounts required by 23paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 24herein provided. The Commission shall make the changes in 25payment effective by general order, and the changes in payment 26become immediately effective for all cases coming before the   HB1259- 28 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1Commission thereafter either by settlement agreement or final 2order, irrespective of the date of the accidental injury.3    On August 1, 1996 and on February 1 and August 1 of each 4subsequent year, the Commission shall examine the special fund 5designated as the "Rate Adjustment Fund" and when, after 6deducting all advances or loans made to said fund, the amount 7therein is $4,000,000, the amount required to be paid by 8employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 9reduced by one-half. When the Rate Adjustment Fund reaches the 10sum of $5,000,000 the payment therein shall cease entirely. 11However, when said Rate Adjustment Fund has been reduced to 12$3,000,000 the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 13shall be resumed in the manner herein provided.14    (f) In case of complete disability, which renders the 15employee wholly and permanently incapable of work, or in the 16specific case of total and permanent disability as provided in 17subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section, compensation 18shall be payable at the rate provided in subparagraph 2 of 19paragraph (b) of this Section for life.20    An employee entitled to benefits under paragraph (f) of 21this Section shall also be entitled to receive from the Rate 22Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of the 23supplementary benefits provided in paragraph (g) of this 24Section 8.25    If any employee who receives an award under this paragraph 26afterwards returns to work or is able to do so, and earns or is   HB1259- 29 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1able to earn as much as before the accident, payments under 2such award shall cease. If such employee returns to work, or is 3able to do so, and earns or is able to earn part but not as 4much as before the accident, such award shall be modified so as 5to conform to an award under paragraph (d) of this Section. If 6such award is terminated or reduced under the provisions of 7this paragraph, such employees have the right at any time 8within 30 months after the date of such termination or 9reduction to file petition with the Commission for the purpose 10of determining whether any disability exists as a result of 11the original accidental injury and the extent thereof.12    Disability as enumerated in subdivision 18, paragraph (e) 13of this Section is considered complete disability.14    If an employee who had previously incurred loss or the 15permanent and complete loss of use of one member, through the 16loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one hand, 17one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent and 18complete disability through the loss or the permanent and 19complete loss of the use of another member, he shall receive, 20in addition to the compensation payable by the employer and 21after such payments have ceased, an amount from the Second 22Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7, which, 23together with the compensation payable from the employer in 24whose employ he was when the last accidental injury was 25incurred, will equal the amount payable for permanent and 26complete disability as provided in this paragraph of this   HB1259- 30 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1Section.2    The custodian of the Second Injury Fund provided for in 3paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be joined with the employer as 4a party respondent in the application for adjustment of claim. 5The application for adjustment of claim shall state briefly 6and in general terms the approximate time and place and manner 7of the loss of the first member.8    In its award the Commission or the Arbitrator shall 9specifically find the amount the injured employee shall be 10weekly paid, the number of weeks compensation which shall be 11paid by the employer, the date upon which payments begin out of 12the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of 13Section 7 of this Act, the length of time the weekly payments 14continue, the date upon which the pension payments commence 15and the monthly amount of the payments. The Commission shall 1630 days after the date upon which payments out of the Second 17Injury Fund have begun as provided in the award, and every 18month thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Comptroller 19a voucher for payment for all compensation accrued to that 20date at the rate fixed by the Commission. The State 21Comptroller shall draw a warrant to the injured employee along 22with a receipt to be executed by the injured employee and 23returned to the Commission. The endorsed warrant and receipt 24is a full and complete acquittance to the Commission for the 25payment out of the Second Injury Fund. No other appropriation 26or warrant is necessary for payment out of the Second Injury   HB1259- 31 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1Fund. The Second Injury Fund is appropriated for the purpose 2of making payments according to the terms of the awards.3    As of July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1982, all claims against and 4obligations of the Second Injury Fund shall become claims 5against and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund to the 6extent there is insufficient money in the Second Injury Fund 7to pay such claims and obligations. In that case, all 8references to "Second Injury Fund" in this Section shall also 9include the Rate Adjustment Fund.10    (g) Every award for permanent total disability entered by 11the Commission on and after July 1, 1965 under which 12compensation payments shall become due and payable after the 13effective date of this amendatory Act, and every award for 14death benefits or permanent total disability entered by the 15Commission on and after the effective date of this amendatory 16Act shall be subject to annual adjustments as to the amount of 17the compensation rate therein provided. Such adjustments shall 18first be made on July 15, 1977, and all awards made and entered 19prior to July 1, 1975 and on July 15 of each year thereafter. 20In all other cases such adjustment shall be made on July 15 of 21the second year next following the date of the entry of the 22award and shall further be made on July 15 annually 23thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of 24the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there 25shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage 26in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act,   HB1259- 32 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately 2increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase 3in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under 4the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the 5compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring 6the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the 7prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment 8is made. Such increase shall be paid in the same manner as 9herein provided for payments under the Second Injury Fund to 10the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, 11out of the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of 12Section 7 of this Act. Payments shall be made at the same 13intervals as provided in the award or, at the option of the 14Commission, may be made in quarterly payment on the 15th day of 15January, April, July and October of each year. In the event of 16a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change 17in the then existing compensation rate. The within paragraph 18shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and 19in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer 20and the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may 21be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' 22Compensation Commission.23    Provided, that in cases of awards entered by the 24Commission for injuries occurring before July 1, 1975, the 25increases in the compensation rate adjusted under the 26foregoing provision of this paragraph (g) shall be limited to   HB1259- 33 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1increases in the State's average weekly wage in covered 2industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act occurring 3after July 1, 1975.4    For every accident occurring on or after July 20, 2005 but 5before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 6General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General 7Assembly), the annual adjustments to the compensation rate in 8awards for death benefits or permanent total disability, as 9provided in this Act, shall be paid by the employer. The 10adjustment shall be made by the employer on July 15 of the 11second year next following the date of the entry of the award 12and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If 13during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the 14award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been 15an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 16industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the employer 17shall increase the weekly compensation rate proportionately by 18the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the 19State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the 20Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation 21rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total 22compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing 23maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. In 24the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall 25be no change in the then existing compensation rate. Such 26increase shall be paid by the employer in the same manner and   HB1259- 34 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1at the same intervals as the payment of compensation in the 2award. This paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is 3disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum 4settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or 5his or her dependents, as the case may be, has been duly 6approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.7    The annual adjustments for every award of death benefits 8or permanent total disability involving accidents occurring 9before July 20, 2005 and accidents occurring on or after the 10effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General 11Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly) shall 12continue to be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund pursuant to 13this paragraph and Section 7(f) of this Act. 14    (h) In case death occurs from any cause before the total 15compensation to which the employee would have been entitled 16has been paid, then in case the employee leaves any widow, 17widower, child, parent (or any grandchild, grandparent or 18other lineal heir or any collateral heir dependent at the time 19of the accident upon the earnings of the employee to the extent 20of 50% or more of total dependency) such compensation shall be 21paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased employee and 22distributed as provided in paragraph (g) of Section 7.23    (h-1) In case an injured employee is under legal 24disability at the time when any right or privilege accrues to 25him or her under this Act, a guardian may be appointed pursuant 26to law, and may, on behalf of such person under legal   HB1259- 35 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1disability, claim and exercise any such right or privilege 2with the same effect as if the employee himself or herself had 3claimed or exercised the right or privilege. No limitations of 4time provided by this Act run so long as the employee who is 5under legal disability is without a conservator or guardian.6    (i) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age 7at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the 8amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 9(e) and (f) of this Section is increased 50%.10    However, where an employer has on file an employment 11certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law of 2024 or 12work permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor 13Standards Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and 14duly issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is 15conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor 16employee for the purposes of this Section.17    Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions 18of the Child Labor Law of 2024 relating to the employment of 19minors under the age of 16 years.20    (j) 1. In the event the injured employee receives 21benefits, including medical, surgical or hospital benefits 22under any group plan covering non-occupational disabilities 23contributed to wholly or partially by the employer, which 24benefits should not have been payable if any rights of 25recovery existed under this Act, then such amounts so paid to 26the employee from any such group plan as shall be consistent   HB1259- 36 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1with, and limited to, the provisions of paragraph 2 hereof, 2shall be credited to or against any compensation payment for 3temporary total incapacity for work or any medical, surgical 4or hospital benefits made or to be made under this Act. In such 5event, the period of time for giving notice of accidental 6injury and filing application for adjustment of claim does not 7commence to run until the termination of such payments. This 8paragraph does not apply to payments made under any group plan 9which would have been payable irrespective of an accidental 10injury under this Act. Any employer receiving such credit 11shall keep such employee safe and harmless from any and all 12claims or liabilities that may be made against him by reason of 13having received such payments only to the extent of such 14credit.15    Any excess benefits paid to or on behalf of a State 16employee by the State Employees' Retirement System under 17Article 14 of the Illinois Pension Code on a death claim or 18disputed disability claim shall be credited against any 19payments made or to be made by the State of Illinois to or on 20behalf of such employee under this Act, except for payments 21for medical expenses which have already been incurred at the 22time of the award. The State of Illinois shall directly 23reimburse the State Employees' Retirement System to the extent 24of such credit.25    2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to 26give the employer or the insurance carrier the right to credit   HB1259- 37 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1for any benefits or payments received by the employee other 2than compensation payments provided by this Act, and where the 3employee receives payments other than compensation payments, 4whether as full or partial salary, group insurance benefits, 5bonuses, annuities or any other payments, the employer or 6insurance carrier shall receive credit for each such payment 7only to the extent of the compensation that would have been 8payable during the period covered by such payment.9    3. The extension of time for the filing of an Application 10for Adjustment of Claim as provided in paragraph 1 above shall 11not apply to those cases where the time for such filing had 12expired prior to the date on which payments or benefits 13enumerated herein have been initiated or resumed. Provided 14however that this paragraph 3 shall apply only to cases 15wherein the payments or benefits hereinabove enumerated shall 16be received after July 1, 1969.17(Source: P.A. 103-721, eff. 1-1-25.) 18    Section 99.

The Workers' Compensation Act is amended by 5changing Section 8 as follows: 6    (820 ILCS 305/8)  (from Ch. 48, par. 138.8)7    Sec. 8. The amount of compensation which shall be paid to 8the employee for an accidental injury not resulting in death 9is:10    (a) The employer shall provide and pay the negotiated 11rate, if applicable, or the lesser of the health care 12provider's actual charges or according to a fee schedule, 13subject to Section 8.2, in effect at the time the service was 14rendered for all the necessary first aid, medical and surgical 15services, and all necessary medical, surgical and hospital 16services thereafter incurred, limited, however, to that which 17is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of 18the accidental injury, even if a health care provider sells, 19transfers, or otherwise assigns an account receivable for 20procedures, treatments, or services covered under this Act. If 21the employer does not dispute payment of first aid, medical, 22surgical, and hospital services, the employer shall make such 23payment to the provider on behalf of the employee. The   HB1259- 2 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1employer shall also pay for treatment, instruction and 2training necessary for the physical, mental and vocational 3rehabilitation of the employee, including all maintenance 4costs and expenses incidental thereto. If as a result of the 5injury the employee is unable to be self-sufficient the 6employer shall further pay for such maintenance or 7institutional care as shall be required.8    The employee may at any time elect to secure his own 9physician, surgeon and hospital services at the employer's 10expense, or, 11    Upon agreement between the employer and the employees, or 12the employees' exclusive representative, and subject to the 13approval of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the 14employer shall maintain a list of physicians, to be known as a 15Panel of Physicians, who are accessible to the employees. The 16employer shall post this list in a place or places easily 17accessible to his employees. The employee shall have the right 18to make an alternative choice of physician from such Panel if 19he is not satisfied with the physician first selected. If, due 20to the nature of the injury or its occurrence away from the 21employer's place of business, the employee is unable to make a 22selection from the Panel, the selection process from the Panel 23shall not apply. The physician selected from the Panel may 24arrange for any consultation, referral or other specialized 25medical services outside the Panel at the employer's expense. 26Provided that, in the event the Commission shall find that a   HB1259- 3 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1doctor selected by the employee is rendering improper or 2inadequate care, the Commission may order the employee to 3select another doctor certified or qualified in the medical 4field for which treatment is required. If the employee refuses 5to make such change the Commission may relieve the employer of 6his obligation to pay the doctor's charges from the date of 7refusal to the date of compliance.8    Any vocational rehabilitation counselors who provide 9service under this Act shall have appropriate certifications 10which designate the counselor as qualified to render opinions 11relating to vocational rehabilitation. Vocational 12rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, counseling 13for job searches, supervising a job search program, and 14vocational retraining including education at an accredited 15learning institution. The employee or employer may petition to 16the Commission to decide disputes relating to vocational 17rehabilitation and the Commission shall resolve any such 18dispute, including payment of the vocational rehabilitation 19program by the employer.20    The maintenance benefit shall not be less than the 21temporary total disability rate determined for the employee. 22In addition, maintenance shall include costs and expenses 23incidental to the vocational rehabilitation program.24    When the employee is working light duty on a part-time 25basis or full-time basis and earns less than he or she would be 26earning if employed in the full capacity of the job or jobs,   HB1259- 4 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1then the employee shall be entitled to temporary partial 2disability benefits. Temporary partial disability benefits 3shall be equal to two-thirds of the difference between the 4average amount that the employee would be able to earn in the 5full performance of his or her duties in the occupation in 6which he or she was engaged at the time of accident and the 7gross amount which he or she is earning in the modified job 8provided to the employee by the employer or in any other job 9that the employee is working.10    Every hospital, physician, surgeon or other person 11rendering treatment or services in accordance with the 12provisions of this Section shall upon written request furnish 13full and complete reports thereof to, and permit their records 14to be copied by, the employer, the employee or his dependents, 15as the case may be, or any other party to any proceeding for 16compensation before the Commission, or their attorneys.17    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer's liability to 18pay for such medical services selected by the employee shall 19be limited to:20        (1) all first aid and emergency treatment; plus21        (2) all medical, surgical and hospital services 22    provided by the physician, surgeon or hospital initially 23    chosen by the employee or by any other physician, 24    consultant, expert, institution or other provider of 25    services recommended by said initial service provider or 26    any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain   HB1259- 5 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1    of referrals from said initial service provider; plus2        (3) all medical, surgical and hospital services 3    provided by any second physician, surgeon or hospital 4    subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other 5    physician, consultant, expert, institution or other 6    provider of services recommended by said second service 7    provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in 8    the chain of referrals from said second service provider. 9    Thereafter the employer shall select and pay for all 10    necessary medical, surgical and hospital treatment and the 11    employee may not select a provider of medical services at 12    the employer's expense unless the employer agrees to such 13    selection. At any time the employee may obtain any medical 14    treatment he desires at his own expense. This paragraph 15    shall not affect the duty to pay for rehabilitation 16    referred to above.17        (4) The following shall apply for injuries occurring 18    on or after June 28, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 19    97-18) and only when an employer has an approved preferred 20    provider program pursuant to Section 8.1a on the date the 21    employee sustained his or her accidental injuries:22            (A) The employer shall, in writing, on a form 23        promulgated by the Commission, inform the employee of 24        the preferred provider program;25            (B) Subsequent to the report of an injury by an 26        employee, the employee may choose in writing at any   HB1259- 6 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1        time to decline the preferred provider program, in 2        which case that would constitute one of the two 3        choices of medical providers to which the employee is 4        entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3); and5            (C) Prior to the report of an injury by an 6        employee, when an employee chooses non-emergency 7        treatment from a provider not within the preferred 8        provider program, that would constitute the employee's 9        one choice of medical providers to which the employee 10        is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3). 11    When an employer and employee so agree in writing, nothing 12in this Act prevents an employee whose injury or disability 13has been established under this Act, from relying in good 14faith, on treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone, in 15accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church 16or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner 17thereof, and having nursing services appropriate therewith, 18without suffering loss or diminution of the compensation 19benefits under this Act. However, the employee shall submit to 20all physical examinations required by this Act. The cost of 21such treatment and nursing care shall be paid by the employee 22unless the employer agrees to make such payment.23    Where the accidental injury results in the amputation of 24an arm, hand, leg or foot, or the enucleation of an eye, or the 25loss of any of the natural teeth, the employer shall furnish an 26artificial of any such members lost or damaged in accidental   HB1259- 7 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and 2shall also furnish the necessary braces in all proper and 3necessary cases. In cases of the loss of a member or members by 4amputation, the employer shall, whenever necessary, maintain 5in good repair, refit or replace the artificial limbs during 6the lifetime of the employee. Where the accidental injury 7accompanied by physical injury results in damage to a denture, 8eye glasses or contact eye lenses, or where the accidental 9injury results in damage to an artificial member, the employer 10shall replace or repair such denture, glasses, lenses, or 11artificial member.12    The furnishing by the employer of any such services or 13appliances is not an admission of liability on the part of the 14employer to pay compensation.15    The furnishing of any such services or appliances or the 16servicing thereof by the employer is not the payment of 17compensation.18    (b) If the period of temporary total incapacity for work 19lasts more than 3 working days, weekly compensation as 20hereinafter provided shall be paid beginning on the 4th day of 21such temporary total incapacity and continuing as long as the 22total temporary incapacity lasts. In cases where the temporary 23total incapacity for work continues for a period of 14 days or 24more from the day of the accident compensation shall commence 25on the day after the accident.26        1.

This percentage 25    rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse and child, 26    not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage calculation,   HB1259- 9 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1    nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage computed in 2    accordance with the provisions of Section 10, whichever is 3    less.4        2.1.

For the permanent partial loss of use of a member 8    or sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, compensation 9    during that proportion of the number of weeks in the 10    foregoing schedule provided for the loss of such member or 11    sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, which the partial 12    loss of use thereof bears to the total loss of use of such 13    member, or sight of eye, or hearing of an ear.14            (a) Loss of hearing for compensation purposes 15        shall be confined to the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 16        and 3,000 cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability 17        for frequency tones above 3,000 cycles per second are 18        not to be considered as constituting disability for 19        hearing.20            (b) The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of 21        the determination of compensation claims for 22        occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the 23        average in decibels for the thresholds of hearing for 24        the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 cycles per 25        second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric 26        instruments, approved by nationally recognized   HB1259- 24 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1        authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring 2        hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 30 3        decibels or less in the 3 frequencies, such losses of 4        hearing shall not then constitute any compensable 5        hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 6        85 decibels or more in the 3 frequencies, then the same 7        shall constitute and be total or 100% compensable 8        hearing loss.9            (c) In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest 10        measured losses in each of the 3 frequencies shall be 11        added together and divided by 3 to determine the 12        average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss 13        exceeding 30 decibels an allowance of 1.82% shall be 14        made up to the maximum of 100% which is reached at 85 15        decibels.16            (d) If a hearing loss is established to have 17        existed on July 1, 1975 by audiometric testing the 18        employer shall not be liable for the previous loss so 19        established nor shall he be liable for any loss for 20        which compensation has been paid or awarded.21            (e) No consideration shall be given to the 22        question of whether or not the ability of an employee 23        to understand speech is improved by the use of a 24        hearing aid.25            (f) No claim for loss of hearing due to industrial 26        noise shall be brought against an employer or allowed   HB1259- 25 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1        unless the employee has been exposed for a period of 2        time sufficient to cause permanent impairment to noise 3        levels in excess of the following: 4Sound Level DBA5Slow ResponseHours Per Day6908792689549973101002111021-1/2121051131101/2141151/415        This subparagraph (f) shall not be applied in cases of 16    hearing loss resulting from trauma or explosion.17        17. In computing the compensation to be paid to any 18    employee who, before the accident for which he claims 19    compensation, had before that time sustained an injury 20    resulting in the loss by amputation or partial loss by 21    amputation of any member, including hand, arm, thumb or 22    fingers, leg, foot, or any toes or the loss described in 23    subparagraph 2 of paragraph (d) due to accidental injuries 24    to the same part of the spine, such loss or partial loss of 25    any such member or the loss described in subparagraph 2 of 26    paragraph (d) due to accidental injuries to the same part   HB1259- 26 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1    of the spine shall be deducted from any award made for the 2    subsequent injury. For the permanent loss of use or the 3    permanent partial loss of use of any such member or the 4    partial loss of sight of an eye or the loss described in 5    subparagraph 2 of paragraph (d) due to accidental injuries 6    to the same part of the spine, for which compensation has 7    been paid, then such loss shall be taken into 8    consideration and deducted from any award for the 9    subsequent injury. As used in this subparagraph, "same 10    part of the spine" means the cervical and thoracic spine 11    from vertebra C1 through T12 and the lumbar and sacral 12    spine and coccyx from vertebra L1 through S5. 13        18. The specific case of loss of both hands, both 14    arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any 15    two thereof, or the permanent and complete loss of the use 16    thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be 17    compensated according to the compensation fixed by 18    paragraph (f) of this Section. These specific cases of 19    total and permanent disability do not exclude other cases.20        Any employee who has previously suffered the loss or 21    permanent and complete loss of the use of any of such 22    members, and in a subsequent independent accident loses 23    another or suffers the permanent and complete loss of the 24    use of any one of such members the employer for whom the 25    injured employee is working at the time of the last 26    independent accident is liable to pay compensation only   HB1259- 27 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1    for the loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of 2    the member occasioned by the last independent accident.3        19. In a case of specific loss and the subsequent 4    death of such injured employee from other causes than such 5    injury leaving a widow, widower, or dependents surviving 6    before payment or payment in full for such injury, then 7    the amount due for such injury is payable to the widow or 8    widower and, if there be no widow or widower, then to such 9    dependents, in the proportion which such dependency bears 10    to total dependency.11    Beginning July 1, 1980, and every 6 months thereafter, the 12Commission shall examine the Second Injury Fund and when, 13after deducting all advances or loans made to such Fund, the 14amount therein is $500,000 then the amount required to be paid 15by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 16reduced by one-half. When the Second Injury Fund reaches the 17sum of $600,000 then the payments shall cease entirely. 18However, when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to 19$400,000, payment of one-half of the amounts required by 20paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 21herein provided, and when the Second Injury Fund has been 22reduced to $300,000, payment of the full amounts required by 23paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 24herein provided. The Commission shall make the changes in 25payment effective by general order, and the changes in payment 26become immediately effective for all cases coming before the   HB1259- 28 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1Commission thereafter either by settlement agreement or final 2order, irrespective of the date of the accidental injury.3    On August 1, 1996 and on February 1 and August 1 of each 4subsequent year, the Commission shall examine the special fund 5designated as the "Rate Adjustment Fund" and when, after 6deducting all advances or loans made to said fund, the amount 7therein is $4,000,000, the amount required to be paid by 8employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 9reduced by one-half. When the Rate Adjustment Fund reaches the 10sum of $5,000,000 the payment therein shall cease entirely. 11However, when said Rate Adjustment Fund has been reduced to 12$3,000,000 the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 13shall be resumed in the manner herein provided.14    (f) In case of complete disability, which renders the 15employee wholly and permanently incapable of work, or in the 16specific case of total and permanent disability as provided in 17subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section, compensation 18shall be payable at the rate provided in subparagraph 2 of 19paragraph (b) of this Section for life.20    An employee entitled to benefits under paragraph (f) of 21this Section shall also be entitled to receive from the Rate 22Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of the 23supplementary benefits provided in paragraph (g) of this 24Section 8.25    If any employee who receives an award under this paragraph 26afterwards returns to work or is able to do so, and earns or is   HB1259- 29 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1able to earn as much as before the accident, payments under 2such award shall cease. If such employee returns to work, or is 3able to do so, and earns or is able to earn part but not as 4much as before the accident, such award shall be modified so as 5to conform to an award under paragraph (d) of this Section. If 6such award is terminated or reduced under the provisions of 7this paragraph, such employees have the right at any time 8within 30 months after the date of such termination or 9reduction to file petition with the Commission for the purpose 10of determining whether any disability exists as a result of 11the original accidental injury and the extent thereof.12    Disability as enumerated in subdivision 18, paragraph (e) 13of this Section is considered complete disability.14    If an employee who had previously incurred loss or the 15permanent and complete loss of use of one member, through the 16loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one hand, 17one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent and 18complete disability through the loss or the permanent and 19complete loss of the use of another member, he shall receive, 20in addition to the compensation payable by the employer and 21after such payments have ceased, an amount from the Second 22Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7, which, 23together with the compensation payable from the employer in 24whose employ he was when the last accidental injury was 25incurred, will equal the amount payable for permanent and 26complete disability as provided in this paragraph of this   HB1259- 30 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1Section.2    The custodian of the Second Injury Fund provided for in 3paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be joined with the employer as 4a party respondent in the application for adjustment of claim. 5The application for adjustment of claim shall state briefly 6and in general terms the approximate time and place and manner 7of the loss of the first member.8    In its award the Commission or the Arbitrator shall 9specifically find the amount the injured employee shall be 10weekly paid, the number of weeks compensation which shall be 11paid by the employer, the date upon which payments begin out of 12the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of 13Section 7 of this Act, the length of time the weekly payments 14continue, the date upon which the pension payments commence 15and the monthly amount of the payments. The Commission shall 1630 days after the date upon which payments out of the Second 17Injury Fund have begun as provided in the award, and every 18month thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Comptroller 19a voucher for payment for all compensation accrued to that 20date at the rate fixed by the Commission. The State 21Comptroller shall draw a warrant to the injured employee along 22with a receipt to be executed by the injured employee and 23returned to the Commission. The endorsed warrant and receipt 24is a full and complete acquittance to the Commission for the 25payment out of the Second Injury Fund. No other appropriation 26or warrant is necessary for payment out of the Second Injury   HB1259- 31 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1Fund. The Second Injury Fund is appropriated for the purpose 2of making payments according to the terms of the awards.3    As of July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1982, all claims against and 4obligations of the Second Injury Fund shall become claims 5against and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund to the 6extent there is insufficient money in the Second Injury Fund 7to pay such claims and obligations. In that case, all 8references to "Second Injury Fund" in this Section shall also 9include the Rate Adjustment Fund.10    (g) Every award for permanent total disability entered by 11the Commission on and after July 1, 1965 under which 12compensation payments shall become due and payable after the 13effective date of this amendatory Act, and every award for 14death benefits or permanent total disability entered by the 15Commission on and after the effective date of this amendatory 16Act shall be subject to annual adjustments as to the amount of 17the compensation rate therein provided. Such adjustments shall 18first be made on July 15, 1977, and all awards made and entered 19prior to July 1, 1975 and on July 15 of each year thereafter. 20In all other cases such adjustment shall be made on July 15 of 21the second year next following the date of the entry of the 22award and shall further be made on July 15 annually 23thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of 24the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there 25shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage 26in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act,   HB1259- 32 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately 2increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase 3in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under 4the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the 5compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring 6the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the 7prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment 8is made. Such increase shall be paid in the same manner as 9herein provided for payments under the Second Injury Fund to 10the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, 11out of the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of 12Section 7 of this Act. Payments shall be made at the same 13intervals as provided in the award or, at the option of the 14Commission, may be made in quarterly payment on the 15th day of 15January, April, July and October of each year. In the event of 16a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change 17in the then existing compensation rate. The within paragraph 18shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and 19in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer 20and the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may 21be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' 22Compensation Commission.23    Provided, that in cases of awards entered by the 24Commission for injuries occurring before July 1, 1975, the 25increases in the compensation rate adjusted under the 26foregoing provision of this paragraph (g) shall be limited to   HB1259- 33 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1increases in the State's average weekly wage in covered 2industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act occurring 3after July 1, 1975.4    For every accident occurring on or after July 20, 2005 but 5before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 6General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General 7Assembly), the annual adjustments to the compensation rate in 8awards for death benefits or permanent total disability, as 9provided in this Act, shall be paid by the employer. The 10adjustment shall be made by the employer on July 15 of the 11second year next following the date of the entry of the award 12and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If 13during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the 14award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been 15an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 16industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the employer 17shall increase the weekly compensation rate proportionately by 18the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the 19State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the 20Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation 21rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total 22compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing 23maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. In 24the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall 25be no change in the then existing compensation rate. Such 26increase shall be paid by the employer in the same manner and   HB1259- 34 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1at the same intervals as the payment of compensation in the 2award. This paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is 3disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum 4settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or 5his or her dependents, as the case may be, has been duly 6approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.7    The annual adjustments for every award of death benefits 8or permanent total disability involving accidents occurring 9before July 20, 2005 and accidents occurring on or after the 10effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General 11Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly) shall 12continue to be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund pursuant to 13this paragraph and Section 7(f) of this Act. 14    (h) In case death occurs from any cause before the total 15compensation to which the employee would have been entitled 16has been paid, then in case the employee leaves any widow, 17widower, child, parent (or any grandchild, grandparent or 18other lineal heir or any collateral heir dependent at the time 19of the accident upon the earnings of the employee to the extent 20of 50% or more of total dependency) such compensation shall be 21paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased employee and 22distributed as provided in paragraph (g) of Section 7.23    (h-1) In case an injured employee is under legal 24disability at the time when any right or privilege accrues to 25him or her under this Act, a guardian may be appointed pursuant 26to law, and may, on behalf of such person under legal   HB1259- 35 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1disability, claim and exercise any such right or privilege 2with the same effect as if the employee himself or herself had 3claimed or exercised the right or privilege. No limitations of 4time provided by this Act run so long as the employee who is 5under legal disability is without a conservator or guardian.6    (i) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age 7at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the 8amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 9(e) and (f) of this Section is increased 50%.10    However, where an employer has on file an employment 11certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law of 2024 or 12work permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor 13Standards Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and 14duly issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is 15conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor 16employee for the purposes of this Section.17    Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions 18of the Child Labor Law of 2024 relating to the employment of 19minors under the age of 16 years.20    (j) 1. In the event the injured employee receives 21benefits, including medical, surgical or hospital benefits 22under any group plan covering non-occupational disabilities 23contributed to wholly or partially by the employer, which 24benefits should not have been payable if any rights of 25recovery existed under this Act, then such amounts so paid to 26the employee from any such group plan as shall be consistent   HB1259- 36 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1with, and limited to, the provisions of paragraph 2 hereof, 2shall be credited to or against any compensation payment for 3temporary total incapacity for work or any medical, surgical 4or hospital benefits made or to be made under this Act. In such 5event, the period of time for giving notice of accidental 6injury and filing application for adjustment of claim does not 7commence to run until the termination of such payments. This 8paragraph does not apply to payments made under any group plan 9which would have been payable irrespective of an accidental 10injury under this Act. Any employer receiving such credit 11shall keep such employee safe and harmless from any and all 12claims or liabilities that may be made against him by reason of 13having received such payments only to the extent of such 14credit.15    Any excess benefits paid to or on behalf of a State 16employee by the State Employees' Retirement System under 17Article 14 of the Illinois Pension Code on a death claim or 18disputed disability claim shall be credited against any 19payments made or to be made by the State of Illinois to or on 20behalf of such employee under this Act, except for payments 21for medical expenses which have already been incurred at the 22time of the award. The State of Illinois shall directly 23reimburse the State Employees' Retirement System to the extent 24of such credit.25    2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to 26give the employer or the insurance carrier the right to credit   HB1259- 37 -LRB104 03229 SPS 13251 b1for any benefits or payments received by the employee other 2than compensation payments provided by this Act, and where the 3employee receives payments other than compensation payments, 4whether as full or partial salary, group insurance benefits, 5bonuses, annuities or any other payments, the employer or 6insurance carrier shall receive credit for each such payment 7only to the extent of the compensation that would have been 8payable during the period covered by such payment.9    3. The extension of time for the filing of an Application 10for Adjustment of Claim as provided in paragraph 1 above shall 11not apply to those cases where the time for such filing had 12expired prior to the date on which payments or benefits 13enumerated herein have been initiated or resumed. Provided 14however that this paragraph 3 shall apply only to cases 15wherein the payments or benefits hereinabove enumerated shall 16be received after July 1, 1969.17(Source: P.A. 103-721, eff. 1-1-25.) 18    Section 99.
