Wheel and axle loads and gross weights. 8    (a) No vehicle or combination of vehicles with pneumatic 9tires may be operated, unladen or with load, when the total 10weight on the road surface exceeds the following: 20,000 11pounds on a single axle; 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle with no 12axle within the tandem exceeding 20,000 pounds; 80,000 pounds 13gross weight for vehicle combinations of 5 or more axles; or a 14total weight on a group of 2 or more consecutive axles in 15excess of that weight produced by the application of the 16following formula: W = 500 times the sum of (LN divided by N-1) 17+ 12N + 36, where "W" equals overall total weight on any group 18of 2 or more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds, "L" 19equals the distance measured to the nearest foot between 20extremes of any group of 2 or more consecutive axles, and "N" 21equals the number of axles in the group under consideration.22    The above formula when expressed in tabular form results 23in

Any 2        additional movement of the vehicles may occur only 3        upon issuance of authorization for that movement under 4        the provisions of Sections 15-301 through 15-318 of 5        this Code. The towing vehicle, however, may tow any 6        disabled vehicle to a point where repairs are actually 7        to occur. This movement shall be valid only on State 8        routes. The tower must abide by posted bridge weight 9        limits.10        (12.5) The vehicle weight limitations in this Section 11    do not apply to a covered heavy duty tow and recovery 12    vehicle. The covered heavy duty tow and recovery vehicle 13    license plate must cover the operating empty weight of the 14    covered heavy duty tow and recovery vehicle only. 15        (13) Upon and during a declaration of an emergency 16    propane supply disaster by the Governor under Section 7 of 17    the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act:18            (i) a truck not in combination, equipped with a 19        cargo tank, used exclusively for the transportation of 20        propane or liquefied petroleum gas may, when laden, 21        transmit upon the road surface, except when on part of 22        the National System of Interstate and Defense 23        Highways, the following maximum weights: 22,000 pounds 24        on a single axle; 40,000 pounds on a tandem axle; 25        40,000 pounds gross weight on a 2-axle vehicle; 54,000 26        pounds gross weight on a 3-axle vehicle; and  SB1948- 12 -LRB104 11990 LNS 22084 b1            (ii) a truck when in combination with a trailer 2        equipped with a cargo tank used exclusively for the 3        transportation of propane or liquefied petroleum gas 4        may, when laden, transmit upon the road surface, 5        except when on part of the National System of 6        Interstate and Defense Highways, the following maximum 7        weights: 22,000 pounds on a single axle; 40,000 pounds 8        on a tandem axle; 90,000 pounds gross weight on a 9        5-axle or 6-axle vehicle.10        Vehicles operating under this paragraph (13) are not 11    subject to the bridge formula. 12        (14) A vehicle or combination of vehicles that uses 13    either natural gas or propane gas as a motor fuel or is 14    operated by an engine fueled wholly or partially by an 15    electric battery or hydrogen fuel cell electric fueling 16    system may exceed the above weight limitations by up to 17    2,000 pounds, the total allowance is calculated by an 18    amount that is equal to the difference between the weight 19    of the vehicle attributable to the natural gas or propane 20    gas tank and fueling system carried by the vehicle, and 21    the weight of a comparable diesel tank and fueling system. 22    This paragraph (14) shall not allow a vehicle to exceed 23    any posted weight limit on a highway or structure. 24        (15) An emergency vehicle or fire apparatus that is a 25    vehicle designed to be used under emergency conditions to 26    transport personnel and equipment, and used to support the   SB1948- 13 -LRB104 11990 LNS 22084 b1    suppression of fires and mitigation of other hazardous 2    situations on a Class I highway, may not exceed 86,000 3    pounds gross weight, or any of the following weight 4    allowances:5            (i) 24,000 pounds on a single steering axle;6            (ii) 33,500 pounds on a single drive axle;7            (iii) 62,000 pounds on a tandem axle; or8            (iv) 52,000 pounds on a tandem rear drive steer 9        axle. 10        (16) A bus, motor coach, or recreational vehicle may 11    carry a total weight of 24,000 pounds on a single axle, but 12    may not exceed other weight provisions of this Section. 13    Gross weight limits shall not apply to the combination of 14the tow truck and vehicles being towed. The tow truck license 15plate must cover the operating empty weight of the tow truck 16only. The weight of each vehicle being towed shall be covered 17by a valid license plate issued to the owner or operator of the 18vehicle being towed and displayed on that vehicle. If no valid 19plate issued to the owner or operator of that vehicle is 20displayed on that vehicle, or the plate displayed on that 21vehicle does not cover the weight of the vehicle, the weight of 22the vehicle shall be covered by the third tow truck plate 23issued to the owner or operator of the tow truck and 24temporarily affixed to the vehicle being towed. If a roll-back 25carrier is registered and being used as a tow truck, however, 26the license plate or plates for the tow truck must cover the   SB1948- 14 -LRB104 11990 LNS 22084 b1gross vehicle weight, including any load carried on the bed of 2the roll-back carrier.3    The Department may by rule or regulation prescribe 4additional requirements. However, nothing in this Code shall 5prohibit a tow truck under instructions of a police officer 6from legally clearing a disabled vehicle, that may be in 7violation of weight limitations of this Chapter, from the 8roadway to the berm or shoulder of the highway. If in the 9opinion of the police officer that location is unsafe, the 10officer is authorized to have the disabled vehicle towed to 11the nearest place of safety.12    For the purpose of this subsection, gross vehicle weight 13rating, or GVWR, means the value specified by the manufacturer 14as the loaded weight of the tow truck.15    (b) As used in this Section, "recycling haul" or 16"recycling operation" means the hauling of non-hazardous, 17non-special, non-putrescible materials, such as paper, glass, 18cans, or plastic, for subsequent use in the secondary 19materials market.20    (c) No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with 21pneumatic tires shall be operated, unladen or with load, upon 22the highways of this State in violation of the provisions of 23any permit issued under the provisions of Sections 15-301 24through 15-318 of this Chapter.25    (d) No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with 26other than pneumatic tires may be operated, unladen or with   SB1948- 15 -LRB104 11990 LNS 22084 b1load, upon the highways of this State when the gross weight on 2the road surface through any wheel exceeds 800 pounds per inch 3width of tire tread or when the gross weight on the road 4surface through any axle exceeds 16,000 pounds.5    (e) No person shall operate a vehicle or combination of 6vehicles over a bridge or other elevated structure 7constituting part of a highway with a gross weight that is 8greater than the maximum weight permitted by the Department, 9when the structure is sign posted as provided in this Section.10    (f) The Department upon request from any local authority 11shall, or upon its own initiative may, conduct an 12investigation of any bridge or other elevated structure 13constituting a part of a highway, and if it finds that the 14structure cannot with safety to itself withstand the weight of 15vehicles otherwise permissible under this Code the Department 16shall determine and declare the maximum weight of vehicles 17that the structures can withstand, and shall cause or permit 18suitable signs stating maximum weight to be erected and 19maintained before each end of the structure. No person shall 20operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles over any 21structure with a gross weight that is greater than the posted 22maximum weight.23    (g) Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation 24of subsection (e) or (f) of this Section, proof of the 25determination of the maximum allowable weight by the 26Department and the existence of the signs, constitutes   SB1948- 16 -LRB104 11990 LNS 22084 b1conclusive evidence of the maximum weight that can be 2maintained with safety to the bridge or structure.3(Source: P.A. 102-124, eff. 7-23-21.)
