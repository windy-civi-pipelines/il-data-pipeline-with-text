In 23    addition to immediate health issues, such as sexually 24    transmitted infections, physical injuries, and 25    psychological trauma, child sexual abuse victims are at   SB1602 Engrossed- 38 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1    greater risk for a plethora of adverse psychological and 2    somatic problems into adulthood in contrast to those who 3    were not sexually abused.4        (2) Sexual abuse against the pediatric population is 5    distinct, particularly due to their dependence on their 6    caregivers and the ability of perpetrators to manipulate 7    and silence them (especially when the perpetrators are 8    family members or other adults trusted by, or with power 9    over, children). Sexual abuse is often hidden by 10    perpetrators, unwitnessed by others, and may leave no 11    obvious physical signs on child victims.12        (3) Pediatric sexual assault survivors throughout the 13    State should have access to qualified medical providers 14    who have received specialized training regarding the care 15    of pediatric sexual assault survivors within a reasonable 16    distance from their home.17        (4) There is a need in Illinois to increase the number 18    of qualified medical providers available to provide 19    medical forensic services to pediatric sexual assault 20    survivors. 21    (b) If a medically stable pediatric acute sexual assault 22survivor presents at a transfer hospital or treatment hospital 23with approved pediatric transfer that has a plan approved by 24the Department requesting medical forensic services, then the 25hospital emergency department staff shall contact an approved 26pediatric health care facility, if one is designated in the   SB1602 Engrossed- 39 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1hospital's plan, then the patient and non-offending parent or 2legal guardian shall be given the option to transfer to the 3approved pediatric health care facility during posted hours of 4operation or a treatment hospital. 5    If the transferring hospital confirms that medical 6forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes of the 7patient's arrival at the approved pediatric health care 8facility following an immediate transfer, then the hospital 9emergency department staff shall notify the patient and 10non-offending parent or legal guardian that the patient will 11be transferred for medical forensic services and shall provide 12the patient and non-offending parent or legal guardian the 13option of being transferred to the approved pediatric health 14care facility or the treatment hospital designated in the 15hospital's plan. The pediatric sexual assault survivor may be 16transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 17vehicle.18    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90 19minutes of the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 20health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 21care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 22patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses to 23be transferred to a treatment hospital, the hospital emergency 24department staff shall contact a treatment hospital designated 25in the hospital's plan to arrange for the transfer of the 26patient to the treatment hospital for medical forensic   SB1602 Engrossed- 40 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1services, which are to be initiated within 90 minutes of the 2patient's arrival at the treatment hospital. The treatment 3hospital shall provide medical forensic services and may not 4transfer the patient to another facility. The pediatric sexual 5assault survivor may be transported by ambulance, law 6enforcement, or personal vehicle. 7    (c) A treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer 8may offer medical forensic services to pediatric acute sexual 9assault survivors in lieu of transfer when a qualified medical 10provider who is qualified to treat pediatric survivors of 11sexual assault is available, subject to prior approval from 12the Department. Prior to granting approval, the Department 13shall (i) confirm the treatment hospital with approved 14pediatric transfer is working towards becoming a treatment 15hospital and (ii) consult with the treatment hospital that 16receives acute pediatric sexual assault survivors from the 17treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer pursuant 18to the plan approved by the Department. Department approval 19under this Section is valid for one year and may be renewed. If 20a medically stable pediatric sexual assault survivor presents 21at a treatment hospital that has a plan approved by the 22Department requesting medical forensic services, then the 23hospital emergency department staff shall contact an approved 24pediatric health care facility, if one is designated in the 25treatment hospital's areawide treatment plan. 26    If medical forensic services can be initiated within 90   SB1602 Engrossed- 41 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1minutes after the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 2health care facility following an immediate transfer, the 3hospital emergency department staff shall provide the patient 4and non-offending parent or legal guardian the option of 5having medical forensic services performed at the treatment 6hospital or at the approved pediatric health care facility.

Pediatric sexual assault care.20    (a) The General Assembly finds: 21        (1) Pediatric sexual assault survivors can suffer from 22    a wide range of health problems across their life span. In 23    addition to immediate health issues, such as sexually 24    transmitted infections, physical injuries, and 25    psychological trauma, child sexual abuse victims are at   SB1602 Engrossed- 38 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1    greater risk for a plethora of adverse psychological and 2    somatic problems into adulthood in contrast to those who 3    were not sexually abused.4        (2) Sexual abuse against the pediatric population is 5    distinct, particularly due to their dependence on their 6    caregivers and the ability of perpetrators to manipulate 7    and silence them (especially when the perpetrators are 8    family members or other adults trusted by, or with power 9    over, children). Sexual abuse is often hidden by 10    perpetrators, unwitnessed by others, and may leave no 11    obvious physical signs on child victims.12        (3) Pediatric sexual assault survivors throughout the 13    State should have access to qualified medical providers 14    who have received specialized training regarding the care 15    of pediatric sexual assault survivors within a reasonable 16    distance from their home.17        (4) There is a need in Illinois to increase the number 18    of qualified medical providers available to provide 19    medical forensic services to pediatric sexual assault 20    survivors. 21    (b) If a medically stable pediatric acute sexual assault 22survivor presents at a transfer hospital or treatment hospital 23with approved pediatric transfer that has a plan approved by 24the Department requesting medical forensic services, then the 25hospital emergency department staff shall contact an approved 26pediatric health care facility, if one is designated in the   SB1602 Engrossed- 39 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1hospital's plan, then the patient and non-offending parent or 2legal guardian shall be given the option to transfer to the 3approved pediatric health care facility during posted hours of 4operation or a treatment hospital. 5    If the transferring hospital confirms that medical 6forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes of the 7patient's arrival at the approved pediatric health care 8facility following an immediate transfer, then the hospital 9emergency department staff shall notify the patient and 10non-offending parent or legal guardian that the patient will 11be transferred for medical forensic services and shall provide 12the patient and non-offending parent or legal guardian the 13option of being transferred to the approved pediatric health 14care facility or the treatment hospital designated in the 15hospital's plan. The pediatric sexual assault survivor may be 16transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 17vehicle.18    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90 19minutes of the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 20health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 21care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 22patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses to 23be transferred to a treatment hospital, the hospital emergency 24department staff shall contact a treatment hospital designated 25in the hospital's plan to arrange for the transfer of the 26patient to the treatment hospital for medical forensic   SB1602 Engrossed- 40 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1services, which are to be initiated within 90 minutes of the 2patient's arrival at the treatment hospital. The treatment 3hospital shall provide medical forensic services and may not 4transfer the patient to another facility. The pediatric sexual 5assault survivor may be transported by ambulance, law 6enforcement, or personal vehicle. 7    (c) A treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer 8may offer medical forensic services to pediatric acute sexual 9assault survivors in lieu of transfer when a qualified medical 10provider who is qualified to treat pediatric survivors of 11sexual assault is available, subject to prior approval from 12the Department. Prior to granting approval, the Department 13shall (i) confirm the treatment hospital with approved 14pediatric transfer is working towards becoming a treatment 15hospital and (ii) consult with the treatment hospital that 16receives acute pediatric sexual assault survivors from the 17treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer pursuant 18to the plan approved by the Department. Department approval 19under this Section is valid for one year and may be renewed. If 20a medically stable pediatric sexual assault survivor presents 21at a treatment hospital that has a plan approved by the 22Department requesting medical forensic services, then the 23hospital emergency department staff shall contact an approved 24pediatric health care facility, if one is designated in the 25treatment hospital's areawide treatment plan. 26    If medical forensic services can be initiated within 90   SB1602 Engrossed- 41 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1minutes after the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 2health care facility following an immediate transfer, the 3hospital emergency department staff shall provide the patient 4and non-offending parent or legal guardian the option of 5having medical forensic services performed at the treatment 6hospital or at the approved pediatric health care facility.
