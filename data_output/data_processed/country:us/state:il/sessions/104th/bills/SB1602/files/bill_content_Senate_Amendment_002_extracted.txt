Pediatric sexual assault care.3    (a) The General Assembly finds: 4        (1) Pediatric sexual assault survivors can suffer from 5    a wide range of health problems across their life span. In 6    addition to immediate health issues, such as sexually 7    transmitted infections, physical injuries, and 8    psychological trauma, child sexual abuse victims are at 9    greater risk for a plethora of adverse psychological and 10    somatic problems into adulthood in contrast to those who 11    were not sexually abused.12        (2) Sexual abuse against the pediatric population is 13    distinct, particularly due to their dependence on their 14    caregivers and the ability of perpetrators to manipulate 15    and silence them (especially when the perpetrators are 16    family members or other adults trusted by, or with power 17    over, children). Sexual abuse is often hidden by 18    perpetrators, unwitnessed by others, and may leave no 19    obvious physical signs on child victims.20        (3) Pediatric sexual assault survivors throughout the 21    State should have access to qualified medical providers 22    who have received specialized training regarding the care 23    of pediatric sexual assault survivors within a reasonable 24    distance from their home.25        (4) There is a need in Illinois to increase the number 26    of qualified medical providers available to provide   10400SB1602sam002- 39 -LRB104 10007 BDA 24822 a1    medical forensic services to pediatric sexual assault 2    survivors. 3    (b) If a medically stable pediatric acute sexual assault 4survivor presents at a transfer hospital or treatment hospital 5with approved pediatric transfer that has a plan approved by 6the Department requesting medical forensic services, then the 7hospital emergency department staff shall contact an approved 8pediatric health care facility, if one is designated in the 9hospital's plan, then the patient and non-offending parent or 10legal guardian shall be given the option to transfer to the 11approved pediatric health care facility during posted hours of 12operation or a treatment hospital. 13    If the transferring hospital confirms that medical 14forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes of the 15patient's arrival at the approved pediatric health care 16facility following an immediate transfer, then the hospital 17emergency department staff shall notify the patient and 18non-offending parent or legal guardian that the patient will 19be transferred for medical forensic services and shall provide 20the patient and non-offending parent or legal guardian the 21option of being transferred to the approved pediatric health 22care facility or the treatment hospital designated in the 23hospital's plan. The pediatric sexual assault survivor may be 24transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 25vehicle.26    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90   10400SB1602sam002- 40 -LRB104 10007 BDA 24822 a1minutes of the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 2health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 3care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 4patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses to 5be transferred to a treatment hospital, the hospital emergency 6department staff shall contact a treatment hospital designated 7in the hospital's plan to arrange for the transfer of the 8patient to the treatment hospital for medical forensic 9services, which are to be initiated within 90 minutes of the 10patient's arrival at the treatment hospital. The treatment 11hospital shall provide medical forensic services and may not 12transfer the patient to another facility. The pediatric sexual 13assault survivor may be transported by ambulance, law 14enforcement, or personal vehicle. 15    (c) A treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer 16may offer medical forensic services to pediatric acute sexual 17assault survivors in lieu of transfer when a qualified medical 18provider who is qualified to treat pediatric survivors of 19sexual assault is available, subject to prior approval from 20the Department. Prior to granting approval, the Department 21shall (i) confirm the treatment hospital with approved 22pediatric transfer is working towards becoming a treatment 23hospital and (ii) consult with the treatment hospital that 24receives acute pediatric sexual assault survivors from the 25treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer pursuant 26to the plan approved by the Department.

Pediatric sexual assault care.3    (a) The General Assembly finds: 4        (1) Pediatric sexual assault survivors can suffer from 5    a wide range of health problems across their life span. In 6    addition to immediate health issues, such as sexually 7    transmitted infections, physical injuries, and 8    psychological trauma, child sexual abuse victims are at 9    greater risk for a plethora of adverse psychological and 10    somatic problems into adulthood in contrast to those who 11    were not sexually abused.12        (2) Sexual abuse against the pediatric population is 13    distinct, particularly due to their dependence on their 14    caregivers and the ability of perpetrators to manipulate 15    and silence them (especially when the perpetrators are 16    family members or other adults trusted by, or with power 17    over, children). Sexual abuse is often hidden by 18    perpetrators, unwitnessed by others, and may leave no 19    obvious physical signs on child victims.20        (3) Pediatric sexual assault survivors throughout the 21    State should have access to qualified medical providers 22    who have received specialized training regarding the care 23    of pediatric sexual assault survivors within a reasonable 24    distance from their home.25        (4) There is a need in Illinois to increase the number 26    of qualified medical providers available to provide   10400SB1602sam002- 39 -LRB104 10007 BDA 24822 a1    medical forensic services to pediatric sexual assault 2    survivors. 3    (b) If a medically stable pediatric acute sexual assault 4survivor presents at a transfer hospital or treatment hospital 5with approved pediatric transfer that has a plan approved by 6the Department requesting medical forensic services, then the 7hospital emergency department staff shall contact an approved 8pediatric health care facility, if one is designated in the 9hospital's plan, then the patient and non-offending parent or 10legal guardian shall be given the option to transfer to the 11approved pediatric health care facility during posted hours of 12operation or a treatment hospital. 13    If the transferring hospital confirms that medical 14forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes of the 15patient's arrival at the approved pediatric health care 16facility following an immediate transfer, then the hospital 17emergency department staff shall notify the patient and 18non-offending parent or legal guardian that the patient will 19be transferred for medical forensic services and shall provide 20the patient and non-offending parent or legal guardian the 21option of being transferred to the approved pediatric health 22care facility or the treatment hospital designated in the 23hospital's plan. The pediatric sexual assault survivor may be 24transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 25vehicle.26    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90   10400SB1602sam002- 40 -LRB104 10007 BDA 24822 a1minutes of the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 2health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 3care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 4patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses to 5be transferred to a treatment hospital, the hospital emergency 6department staff shall contact a treatment hospital designated 7in the hospital's plan to arrange for the transfer of the 8patient to the treatment hospital for medical forensic 9services, which are to be initiated within 90 minutes of the 10patient's arrival at the treatment hospital. The treatment 11hospital shall provide medical forensic services and may not 12transfer the patient to another facility. The pediatric sexual 13assault survivor may be transported by ambulance, law 14enforcement, or personal vehicle. 15    (c) A treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer 16may offer medical forensic services to pediatric acute sexual 17assault survivors in lieu of transfer when a qualified medical 18provider who is qualified to treat pediatric survivors of 19sexual assault is available, subject to prior approval from 20the Department. Prior to granting approval, the Department 21shall (i) confirm the treatment hospital with approved 22pediatric transfer is working towards becoming a treatment 23hospital and (ii) consult with the treatment hospital that 24receives acute pediatric sexual assault survivors from the 25treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer pursuant 26to the plan approved by the Department. Department approval   10400SB1602sam002- 41 -LRB104 10007 BDA 24822 a1under this Section is valid for one year and may be renewed. If 2a medically stable pediatric sexual assault survivor presents 3at a treatment hospital that has a plan approved by the 4Department requesting medical forensic services, then the 5hospital emergency department staff shall contact an approved 6pediatric health care facility, if one is designated in the 7treatment hospital's areawide treatment plan. 8    If medical forensic services can be initiated within 90 9minutes after the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 10health care facility following an immediate transfer, the 11hospital emergency department staff shall provide the patient 12and non-offending parent or legal guardian the option of 13having medical forensic services performed at the treatment 14hospital or at the approved pediatric health care facility. If 15the patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses 16to be transferred, the pediatric sexual assault survivor may 17be transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 18vehicle.19    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90 20minutes after the patient's arrival to the approved pediatric 21health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 22care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 23patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses not 24to be transferred, the hospital shall provide medical forensic 25services to the patient. 26    (d) If the patient or non-offending parent or legal   10400SB1602sam002- 42 -LRB104 10007 BDA 24822 a1guardian chooses to be transferred to an approved pediatric 2health care facility pursuant to subsection (b) or (c), then 3the hospital emergency department staff shall contact the 4approved pediatric health care facility to arrange the 5transfer.
