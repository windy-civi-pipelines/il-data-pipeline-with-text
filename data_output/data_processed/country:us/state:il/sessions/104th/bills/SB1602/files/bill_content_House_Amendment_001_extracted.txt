Pediatric sexual assault care.17    (a) The General Assembly finds: 18        (1) Pediatric sexual assault survivors can suffer from 19    a wide range of health problems across their life span. In 20    addition to immediate health issues, such as sexually 21    transmitted infections, physical injuries, and 22    psychological trauma, child sexual abuse victims are at 23    greater risk for a plethora of adverse psychological and 24    somatic problems into adulthood in contrast to those who 25    were not sexually abused.  10400SB1602ham001- 41 -LRB104 10007 JDS 26622 a1        (2) Sexual abuse against the pediatric population is 2    distinct, particularly due to their dependence on their 3    caregivers and the ability of perpetrators to manipulate 4    and silence them (especially when the perpetrators are 5    family members or other adults trusted by, or with power 6    over, children). Sexual abuse is often hidden by 7    perpetrators, unwitnessed by others, and may leave no 8    obvious physical signs on child victims.9        (3) Pediatric sexual assault survivors throughout the 10    State should have access to qualified medical providers 11    who have received specialized training regarding the care 12    of pediatric sexual assault survivors within a reasonable 13    distance from their home.14        (4) There is a need in Illinois to increase the number 15    of qualified medical providers available to provide 16    medical forensic examinations services to pediatric sexual 17    assault survivors. 18    (b) If a medically stable pediatric acute sexual assault 19survivor presents at a transfer hospital or treatment hospital 20with approved pediatric transfer that has a plan approved by 21the Department requesting a medical forensic examination 22services, then the hospital emergency department staff shall 23contact an approved pediatric health care facility, if one is 24designated in the hospital's plan, then the patient and 25non-offending parent or legal guardian shall be given the 26option to transfer to the approved pediatric health care   10400SB1602ham001- 42 -LRB104 10007 JDS 26622 a1facility during posted hours of operation or a treatment 2hospital. 3    If the transferring hospital confirms that medical 4forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes of the 5patient's arrival at the approved pediatric health care 6facility following an immediate transfer, then the hospital 7emergency department staff shall notify the patient and 8non-offending parent or legal guardian that the patient will 9be transferred for medical forensic services and shall provide 10the patient and non-offending parent or legal guardian the 11option of being transferred to the approved pediatric health 12care facility or the treatment hospital designated in the 13hospital's plan. The pediatric sexual assault survivor may be 14transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 15vehicle.16    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90 17minutes of the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 18health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 19care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 20patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses to 21be transferred to a treatment hospital, the hospital emergency 22department staff shall contact a treatment hospital designated 23in the hospital's plan to arrange for the transfer of the 24patient to the treatment hospital for medical forensic 25services, which are to be initiated within 90 minutes of the 26patient's arrival at the treatment hospital. The treatment   10400SB1602ham001- 43 -LRB104 10007 JDS 26622 a1hospital shall provide medical forensic services and may not 2transfer the patient to another facility. The pediatric sexual 3assault survivor may be transported by ambulance, law 4enforcement, or personal vehicle. 5    (c) When a qualified medical provider who is qualified to 6treat pediatric survivors of sexual assault is available, a 7treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer may offer 8medical forensic examinations to pediatric acute sexual 9assault survivors subject to prior approval from the 10Department. Prior to granting approval, the Department shall 11(i) confirm the treatment hospital with approved pediatric 12transfer is working toward becoming a treatment hospital and 13(ii) consult with the treatment hospital that receives acute 14pediatric sexual assault survivors from the treatment hospital 15with approved pediatric transfer pursuant to the plan approved 16by the Department. Department approval under this Section is 17valid for one year and may be renewed. If a medically stable 18pediatric sexual assault survivor presents at a treatment 19hospital that has a plan approved by the Department requesting 20medical forensic services, then the hospital emergency 21department staff shall contact an approved pediatric health 22care facility, if one is designated in the treatment 23hospital's areawide treatment plan. 24    If medical forensic services can be initiated within 90 25minutes after the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 26health care facility following an immediate transfer, the   10400SB1602ham001- 44 -LRB104 10007 JDS 26622 a1hospital emergency department staff shall provide the patient 2and non-offending parent or legal guardian the option of 3having medical forensic services performed at the treatment 4hospital or at the approved pediatric health care facility. If 5the patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses 6to be transferred, the pediatric sexual assault survivor may 7be transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 8vehicle.9    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90 10minutes after the patient's arrival to the approved pediatric 11health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 12care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 13patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses not 14to be transferred, the hospital shall provide medical forensic 15services to the patient. 16    (d) If the patient or non-offending parent or legal 17guardian chooses to be transferred to an approved pediatric 18health care facility pursuant to subsection (b) or (c), then 19the hospital emergency department staff shall contact the 20approved pediatric health care facility to arrange the 21transfer. The pediatric sexual assault survivor and 22non-offending parent or legal guardian may be transported by 23ambulance, law enforcement, or personal vehicle. A medical 24forensic examination shall be initiated within 90 minutes of 25the acute sexual assault survivor's arrival at the approved 26pediatric health care facility following an immediate transfer   10400SB1602ham001- 45 -LRB104 10007 JDS 26622 a1during posted hours of operation.2    (e) (d) If a pediatric acute sexual assault survivor 3presents at an approved pediatric health care facility 4requesting medical forensic services or the facility is 5contacted by law enforcement or the Department of Children and 6Family Services requesting a medical forensic examination 7services for a pediatric acute sexual assault survivor during 8posted hours of operation, then the medical forensic 9examination services shall be provided at the facility if the 10medical forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes 11after the patient's arrival at the facility.

Pediatric sexual assault care.17    (a) The General Assembly finds: 18        (1) Pediatric sexual assault survivors can suffer from 19    a wide range of health problems across their life span. In 20    addition to immediate health issues, such as sexually 21    transmitted infections, physical injuries, and 22    psychological trauma, child sexual abuse victims are at 23    greater risk for a plethora of adverse psychological and 24    somatic problems into adulthood in contrast to those who 25    were not sexually abused.  10400SB1602ham001- 41 -LRB104 10007 JDS 26622 a1        (2) Sexual abuse against the pediatric population is 2    distinct, particularly due to their dependence on their 3    caregivers and the ability of perpetrators to manipulate 4    and silence them (especially when the perpetrators are 5    family members or other adults trusted by, or with power 6    over, children). Sexual abuse is often hidden by 7    perpetrators, unwitnessed by others, and may leave no 8    obvious physical signs on child victims.9        (3) Pediatric sexual assault survivors throughout the 10    State should have access to qualified medical providers 11    who have received specialized training regarding the care 12    of pediatric sexual assault survivors within a reasonable 13    distance from their home.14        (4) There is a need in Illinois to increase the number 15    of qualified medical providers available to provide 16    medical forensic examinations services to pediatric sexual 17    assault survivors. 18    (b) If a medically stable pediatric acute sexual assault 19survivor presents at a transfer hospital or treatment hospital 20with approved pediatric transfer that has a plan approved by 21the Department requesting a medical forensic examination 22services, then the hospital emergency department staff shall 23contact an approved pediatric health care facility, if one is 24designated in the hospital's plan, then the patient and 25non-offending parent or legal guardian shall be given the 26option to transfer to the approved pediatric health care   10400SB1602ham001- 42 -LRB104 10007 JDS 26622 a1facility during posted hours of operation or a treatment 2hospital. 3    If the transferring hospital confirms that medical 4forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes of the 5patient's arrival at the approved pediatric health care 6facility following an immediate transfer, then the hospital 7emergency department staff shall notify the patient and 8non-offending parent or legal guardian that the patient will 9be transferred for medical forensic services and shall provide 10the patient and non-offending parent or legal guardian the 11option of being transferred to the approved pediatric health 12care facility or the treatment hospital designated in the 13hospital's plan. The pediatric sexual assault survivor may be 14transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 15vehicle.16    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90 17minutes of the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 18health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 19care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 20patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses to 21be transferred to a treatment hospital, the hospital emergency 22department staff shall contact a treatment hospital designated 23in the hospital's plan to arrange for the transfer of the 24patient to the treatment hospital for medical forensic 25services, which are to be initiated within 90 minutes of the 26patient's arrival at the treatment hospital. The treatment   10400SB1602ham001- 43 -LRB104 10007 JDS 26622 a1hospital shall provide medical forensic services and may not 2transfer the patient to another facility. The pediatric sexual 3assault survivor may be transported by ambulance, law 4enforcement, or personal vehicle. 5    (c) When a qualified medical provider who is qualified to 6treat pediatric survivors of sexual assault is available, a 7treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer may offer 8medical forensic examinations to pediatric acute sexual 9assault survivors subject to prior approval from the 10Department. Prior to granting approval, the Department shall 11(i) confirm the treatment hospital with approved pediatric 12transfer is working toward becoming a treatment hospital and 13(ii) consult with the treatment hospital that receives acute 14pediatric sexual assault survivors from the treatment hospital 15with approved pediatric transfer pursuant to the plan approved 16by the Department. Department approval under this Section is 17valid for one year and may be renewed. If a medically stable 18pediatric sexual assault survivor presents at a treatment 19hospital that has a plan approved by the Department requesting 20medical forensic services, then the hospital emergency 21department staff shall contact an approved pediatric health 22care facility, if one is designated in the treatment 23hospital's areawide treatment plan. 24    If medical forensic services can be initiated within 90 25minutes after the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 26health care facility following an immediate transfer, the   10400SB1602ham001- 44 -LRB104 10007 JDS 26622 a1hospital emergency department staff shall provide the patient 2and non-offending parent or legal guardian the option of 3having medical forensic services performed at the treatment 4hospital or at the approved pediatric health care facility. If 5the patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses 6to be transferred, the pediatric sexual assault survivor may 7be transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 8vehicle.9    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90 10minutes after the patient's arrival to the approved pediatric 11health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 12care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 13patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses not 14to be transferred, the hospital shall provide medical forensic 15services to the patient. 16    (d) If the patient or non-offending parent or legal 17guardian chooses to be transferred to an approved pediatric 18health care facility pursuant to subsection (b) or (c), then 19the hospital emergency department staff shall contact the 20approved pediatric health care facility to arrange the 21transfer. The pediatric sexual assault survivor and 22non-offending parent or legal guardian may be transported by 23ambulance, law enforcement, or personal vehicle. A medical 24forensic examination shall be initiated within 90 minutes of 25the acute sexual assault survivor's arrival at the approved 26pediatric health care facility following an immediate transfer   10400SB1602ham001- 45 -LRB104 10007 JDS 26622 a1during posted hours of operation.2    (e) (d) If a pediatric acute sexual assault survivor 3presents at an approved pediatric health care facility 4requesting medical forensic services or the facility is 5contacted by law enforcement or the Department of Children and 6Family Services requesting a medical forensic examination 7services for a pediatric acute sexual assault survivor during 8posted hours of operation, then the medical forensic 9examination services shall be provided at the facility if the 10medical forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes 11after the patient's arrival at the facility.
