Pediatric sexual assault care.10    (a) The General Assembly finds: 11        (1) Pediatric sexual assault survivors can suffer from 12    a wide range of health problems across their life span. In 13    addition to immediate health issues, such as sexually 14    transmitted infections, physical injuries, and 15    psychological trauma, child sexual abuse victims are at 16    greater risk for a plethora of adverse psychological and 17    somatic problems into adulthood in contrast to those who 18    were not sexually abused.19        (2) Sexual abuse against the pediatric population is 20    distinct, particularly due to their dependence on their 21    caregivers and the ability of perpetrators to manipulate 22    and silence them (especially when the perpetrators are 23    family members or other adults trusted by, or with power 24    over, children). Sexual abuse is often hidden by 25    perpetrators, unwitnessed by others, and may leave no   SB1602 Enrolled- 41 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1    obvious physical signs on child victims.2        (3) Pediatric sexual assault survivors throughout the 3    State should have access to qualified medical providers 4    who have received specialized training regarding the care 5    of pediatric sexual assault survivors within a reasonable 6    distance from their home.7        (4) There is a need in Illinois to increase the number 8    of qualified medical providers available to provide 9    medical forensic examinations services to pediatric sexual 10    assault survivors. 11    (b) If a medically stable pediatric acute sexual assault 12survivor presents at a transfer hospital or treatment hospital 13with approved pediatric transfer that has a plan approved by 14the Department requesting a medical forensic examination 15services, then the hospital emergency department staff shall 16contact an approved pediatric health care facility, if one is 17designated in the hospital's plan, then the patient and 18non-offending parent or legal guardian shall be given the 19option to transfer to the approved pediatric health care 20facility during posted hours of operation or a treatment 21hospital. 22    If the transferring hospital confirms that medical 23forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes of the 24patient's arrival at the approved pediatric health care 25facility following an immediate transfer, then the hospital 26emergency department staff shall notify the patient and   SB1602 Enrolled- 42 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1non-offending parent or legal guardian that the patient will 2be transferred for medical forensic services and shall provide 3the patient and non-offending parent or legal guardian the 4option of being transferred to the approved pediatric health 5care facility or the treatment hospital designated in the 6hospital's plan. The pediatric sexual assault survivor may be 7transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 8vehicle.9    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90 10minutes of the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 11health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 12care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 13patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses to 14be transferred to a treatment hospital, the hospital emergency 15department staff shall contact a treatment hospital designated 16in the hospital's plan to arrange for the transfer of the 17patient to the treatment hospital for medical forensic 18services, which are to be initiated within 90 minutes of the 19patient's arrival at the treatment hospital. The treatment 20hospital shall provide medical forensic services and may not 21transfer the patient to another facility. The pediatric sexual 22assault survivor may be transported by ambulance, law 23enforcement, or personal vehicle. 24    (c) When a qualified medical provider who is qualified to 25treat pediatric survivors of sexual assault is available, a 26treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer may offer   SB1602 Enrolled- 43 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1medical forensic examinations to pediatric acute sexual 2assault survivors subject to prior approval from the 3Department. Prior to granting approval, the Department shall 4(i) confirm the treatment hospital with approved pediatric 5transfer is working toward becoming a treatment hospital and 6(ii) consult with the treatment hospital that receives acute 7pediatric sexual assault survivors from the treatment hospital 8with approved pediatric transfer pursuant to the plan approved 9by the Department. Department approval under this Section is 10valid for one year and may be renewed. If a medically stable 11pediatric sexual assault survivor presents at a treatment 12hospital that has a plan approved by the Department requesting 13medical forensic services, then the hospital emergency 14department staff shall contact an approved pediatric health 15care facility, if one is designated in the treatment 16hospital's areawide treatment plan. 17    If medical forensic services can be initiated within 90 18minutes after the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 19health care facility following an immediate transfer, the 20hospital emergency department staff shall provide the patient 21and non-offending parent or legal guardian the option of 22having medical forensic services performed at the treatment 23hospital or at the approved pediatric health care facility.

The pediatric sexual assault survivor and 15non-offending parent or legal guardian may be transported by 16ambulance, law enforcement, or personal vehicle. A medical 17forensic examination shall be initiated within 90 minutes of 18the acute sexual assault survivor's arrival at the approved 19pediatric health care facility following an immediate transfer 20during posted hours of operation.21    (e) (d) If a pediatric acute sexual assault survivor 22presents at an approved pediatric health care facility 23requesting medical forensic services or the facility is 24contacted by law enforcement or the Department of Children and 25Family Services requesting a medical forensic examination 26services for a pediatric acute sexual assault survivor during   SB1602 Enrolled- 45 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1posted hours of operation, then the medical forensic 2examination services shall be provided at the facility if the 3medical forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes 4after the patient's arrival at the facility.

Pediatric sexual assault care.10    (a) The General Assembly finds: 11        (1) Pediatric sexual assault survivors can suffer from 12    a wide range of health problems across their life span. In 13    addition to immediate health issues, such as sexually 14    transmitted infections, physical injuries, and 15    psychological trauma, child sexual abuse victims are at 16    greater risk for a plethora of adverse psychological and 17    somatic problems into adulthood in contrast to those who 18    were not sexually abused.19        (2) Sexual abuse against the pediatric population is 20    distinct, particularly due to their dependence on their 21    caregivers and the ability of perpetrators to manipulate 22    and silence them (especially when the perpetrators are 23    family members or other adults trusted by, or with power 24    over, children). Sexual abuse is often hidden by 25    perpetrators, unwitnessed by others, and may leave no   SB1602 Enrolled- 41 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1    obvious physical signs on child victims.2        (3) Pediatric sexual assault survivors throughout the 3    State should have access to qualified medical providers 4    who have received specialized training regarding the care 5    of pediatric sexual assault survivors within a reasonable 6    distance from their home.7        (4) There is a need in Illinois to increase the number 8    of qualified medical providers available to provide 9    medical forensic examinations services to pediatric sexual 10    assault survivors. 11    (b) If a medically stable pediatric acute sexual assault 12survivor presents at a transfer hospital or treatment hospital 13with approved pediatric transfer that has a plan approved by 14the Department requesting a medical forensic examination 15services, then the hospital emergency department staff shall 16contact an approved pediatric health care facility, if one is 17designated in the hospital's plan, then the patient and 18non-offending parent or legal guardian shall be given the 19option to transfer to the approved pediatric health care 20facility during posted hours of operation or a treatment 21hospital. 22    If the transferring hospital confirms that medical 23forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes of the 24patient's arrival at the approved pediatric health care 25facility following an immediate transfer, then the hospital 26emergency department staff shall notify the patient and   SB1602 Enrolled- 42 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1non-offending parent or legal guardian that the patient will 2be transferred for medical forensic services and shall provide 3the patient and non-offending parent or legal guardian the 4option of being transferred to the approved pediatric health 5care facility or the treatment hospital designated in the 6hospital's plan. The pediatric sexual assault survivor may be 7transported by ambulance, law enforcement, or personal 8vehicle.9    If medical forensic services cannot be initiated within 90 10minutes of the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 11health care facility, there is no approved pediatric health 12care facility designated in the hospital's plan, or the 13patient or non-offending parent or legal guardian chooses to 14be transferred to a treatment hospital, the hospital emergency 15department staff shall contact a treatment hospital designated 16in the hospital's plan to arrange for the transfer of the 17patient to the treatment hospital for medical forensic 18services, which are to be initiated within 90 minutes of the 19patient's arrival at the treatment hospital. The treatment 20hospital shall provide medical forensic services and may not 21transfer the patient to another facility. The pediatric sexual 22assault survivor may be transported by ambulance, law 23enforcement, or personal vehicle. 24    (c) When a qualified medical provider who is qualified to 25treat pediatric survivors of sexual assault is available, a 26treatment hospital with approved pediatric transfer may offer   SB1602 Enrolled- 43 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1medical forensic examinations to pediatric acute sexual 2assault survivors subject to prior approval from the 3Department. Prior to granting approval, the Department shall 4(i) confirm the treatment hospital with approved pediatric 5transfer is working toward becoming a treatment hospital and 6(ii) consult with the treatment hospital that receives acute 7pediatric sexual assault survivors from the treatment hospital 8with approved pediatric transfer pursuant to the plan approved 9by the Department. Department approval under this Section is 10valid for one year and may be renewed. If a medically stable 11pediatric sexual assault survivor presents at a treatment 12hospital that has a plan approved by the Department requesting 13medical forensic services, then the hospital emergency 14department staff shall contact an approved pediatric health 15care facility, if one is designated in the treatment 16hospital's areawide treatment plan. 17    If medical forensic services can be initiated within 90 18minutes after the patient's arrival at the approved pediatric 19health care facility following an immediate transfer, the 20hospital emergency department staff shall provide the patient 21and non-offending parent or legal guardian the option of 22having medical forensic services performed at the treatment 23hospital or at the approved pediatric health care facility.

The pediatric sexual assault survivor and 15non-offending parent or legal guardian may be transported by 16ambulance, law enforcement, or personal vehicle. A medical 17forensic examination shall be initiated within 90 minutes of 18the acute sexual assault survivor's arrival at the approved 19pediatric health care facility following an immediate transfer 20during posted hours of operation.21    (e) (d) If a pediatric acute sexual assault survivor 22presents at an approved pediatric health care facility 23requesting medical forensic services or the facility is 24contacted by law enforcement or the Department of Children and 25Family Services requesting a medical forensic examination 26services for a pediatric acute sexual assault survivor during   SB1602 Enrolled- 45 -LRB104 10007 BDA 20077 b1posted hours of operation, then the medical forensic 2examination services shall be provided at the facility if the 3medical forensic services can be initiated within 90 minutes 4after the patient's arrival at the facility.
