However, if any 24portion of a roadway is within either one-eighth mile radius, 25the safety zone also shall include the roadway extended to the 26furthest portion of the next furthest intersection. The term   SB1507 Engrossed- 3 -LRB104 06239 LNS 16274 b1"safety zone" does not include any portion of the roadway 2known as Lake Shore Drive or any controlled access highway 3with 8 or more lanes of traffic. 4    (a-5) The automated speed enforcement system shall be 5operational and violations shall be recorded only at the 6following times: 7        (i) if the safety zone is based upon the property line 8    of any facility, area, or land owned by a school district, 9    only on school days and no earlier than 6 a.m. and no later 10    than 8:30 p.m. if the school day is during the period of 11    Monday through Thursday, or 9 p.m. if the school day is a 12    Friday; and13        (ii) if the safety zone is based upon the property 14    line of any facility, area, or land owned by a park 15    district, no earlier than one hour prior to the time that 16    the facility, area, or land is open to the public or other 17    patrons, and no later than one hour after the facility, 18    area, or land is closed to the public or other patrons. 19    (b) A municipality that produces a recorded image of a 20motor vehicle's violation of a provision of this Code or a 21local ordinance must make the recorded images of a violation 22accessible to the alleged violator by providing the alleged 23violator with a website address, accessible through the 24Internet. 25    (c) Notwithstanding any penalties for any other violations 26of this Code, the owner of a motor vehicle used in a traffic   SB1507 Engrossed- 4 -LRB104 06239 LNS 16274 b1violation recorded by an automated speed enforcement system 2shall be subject to the following penalties: 3        (1) if the recorded speed is no less than 6 miles per 4    hour and no more than 10 miles per hour over the legal 5    speed limit, a civil penalty not exceeding $50, plus an 6    additional penalty of not more than $50 for failure to pay 7    the original penalty in a timely manner; or8        (2) if the recorded speed is more than 10 miles per 9    hour over the legal speed limit, a civil penalty not 10    exceeding $100, plus an additional penalty of not more 11    than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty in a 12    timely manner.13    A penalty may not be imposed under this Section if the 14driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic 15Citation from a police officer for a speeding violation 16occurring within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the 17violation that was recorded by the system.
