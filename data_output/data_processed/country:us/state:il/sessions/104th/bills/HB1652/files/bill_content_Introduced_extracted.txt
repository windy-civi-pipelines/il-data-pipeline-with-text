Facilitate the exchange of information between 22    party states in the areas of nurse regulation, 23    investigation and adverse actions;24        4. Promote compliance with the laws governing the 25    practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;26        5. Invest all party states with the authority to hold   HB1652- 16 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1    a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in 2    the state in which the patient is located at the time care 3    is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state 4    licenses; 5        6.

If a 16party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the 17administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. 18The administrator of the coordinated licensure information 19system shall promptly notify the home state of any such 20actions by remote states.21    e. A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the 22state practice laws of the state in which the client is located 23at the time service is provided. The practice of nursing is not 24limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing 25practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party 26state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing   HB1652- 22 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will 2subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, 3the courts and the laws of the party state in which the client 4is located at the time service is provided.5    f. Individuals not residing in a party state shall 6continue to be able to apply for a party state's single-state 7license as provided under the laws of each party state. 8However, the single-state license granted to these individuals 9will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice 10nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this Compact 11shall affect the requirements established by a party state for 12the issuance of a single-state license.13    g. Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on 14the effective date of this Compact, may retain and renew the 15multistate license issued by the nurse's then-current home 16state, provided that:17        1. A nurse, who changes primary state of residence 18    after this Compact's effective date, must meet all 19    applicable Article III.c. requirements to obtain a 20    multistate license from a new home state.21        2. A nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate 22    licensure requirements in Article III.c. due to a 23    disqualifying event occurring after this Compact's 24    effective date shall be ineligible to retain or renew a 25    multistate license, and the nurse's multistate license 26    shall be revoked or deactivated in accordance with   HB1652- 23 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1    applicable rules adopted by the Interstate Commission of 2    Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators ("Commission").  3ARTICLE IV 4Applications for Licensure in a Party State 5    a. Upon application for a multistate license, the 6licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, 7through the coordinated licensure information system, whether 8the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license 9issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances 10on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the 11applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against 12any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the 13applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating 14in an alternative program.15    b. A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the 16home state, in only one party state at a time.17    c. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving 18between two party states, the nurse must apply for licensure 19in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the 20prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with 21applicable rules adopted by the Commission.22        1. The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a 23    change in primary state of residence.24        2. A multistate license shall not be issued by the new   HB1652- 24 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1    home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence 2    of a change in primary state of residence to the new home 3    state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain 4    a multistate license from the new home state.5    d. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving 6from a party state to a non-party state, the multistate 7license issued by the prior home state will convert to a 8single-state license, valid only in the former home state.  9ARTICLE V 10Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing 11Boards 12    a. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, 13a licensing board shall have the authority to: 14        1. Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate 15    licensure privilege to practice within that party state.16            i. Only the home state shall have the power to take 17        adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the 18        home state.19            ii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the 20        home state licensing board shall give the same 21        priority and effect to reported conduct received from 22        a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred 23        within the home state. In so doing, the home state 24        shall apply its own state laws to determine   HB1652- 25 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1        appropriate action.2        2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an 3    encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that 4    party state.5        3. Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who 6    changes primary state of residence during the course of 7    such investigations. The licensing board shall also have 8    the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall 9    promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to 10    the administrator of the coordinated licensure information 11    system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure 12    information system shall promptly notify the new home 13    state of any such actions.14        4. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and 15    investigations that require the attendance and testimony 16    of witnesses, as well as, the production of evidence. 17    Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for 18    the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the 19    production of evidence from another party state shall be 20    enforced in the latter state by any court of competent 21    jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of 22    that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings 23    pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any 24    witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees 25    required by the service statutes of the state in which the 26    witnesses or evidence are located.  HB1652- 26 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1        5. Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure 2    applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based 3    information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 4    criminal background checks, receive the results of the 5    Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal 6    background checks and use the results in making licensure 7    decisions.8        6. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from 9    the affected nurse the costs of investigations and 10    disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action 11    taken against that nurse.12        7. Take adverse action based on the factual findings 13    of the remote state, provided that the licensing board 14    follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.15    b. If adverse action is taken by the home state against a 16nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure 17privilege to practice in all other party states shall be 18deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the 19multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that 20impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license 21shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate 22licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during 23the pendency of the order.24    c. Nothing in this Compact shall override a party state's 25decision that participation in an alternative program may be 26used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board   HB1652- 27 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the 2multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the 3nurse's participation in an alternative program.  4ARTICLE VI 5Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of 6Information 7    a. All party states shall participate in a coordinated 8licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses 9(RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs). 10This system will include information on the licensure and 11disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party 12states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and 13enforcement efforts.14    b. The Commission, in consultation with the administrator 15of the coordinated licensure information system, shall 16formulate necessary and proper procedures for the 17identification, collection and exchange of information under 18this Compact.19    c. All licensing boards shall promptly report to the 20coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, 21any current significant investigative information, denials of 22applications (with the reasons for such denials) and nurse 23participation in alternative programs known to the licensing 24board regardless of whether such participation is deemed   HB1652- 28 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1nonpublic or confidential under state law.2    d. Current significant investigative information and 3participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative 4programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated 5licensure information system only to party state licensing 6boards.7    e. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party 8state licensing boards contributing information to the 9coordinated licensure information system may designate 10information that may not be shared with non-party states or 11disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express 12permission of the contributing state.13    f. Any personally identifiable information obtained from 14the coordinated licensure information system by a party state 15licensing board shall not be shared with non-party states or 16disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the 17extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing 18the information.19    g. Any information contributed to the coordinated 20licensure information system that is subsequently required to 21be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that 22information shall also be expunged from the coordinated 23licensure information system.24    h. The Compact administrator of each party state shall 25furnish a uniform data set to the Compact administrator of 26each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:  HB1652- 29 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1        1. Identifying information;2        2. Licensure data;3        3. Information related to alternative program 4    participation; and5        4. Other information that may facilitate the 6    administration of this Compact, as determined by 7    Commission rules.8    i. The Compact administrator of a party state shall 9provide all investigative documents and information requested 10by another party state.  11ARTICLE VII 12Establishment of the Interstate Commission of Nurse Licensure 13Compact Administrators 14    a. The party states hereby create and establish a joint 15public entity known as the Interstate Commission of Nurse 16Licensure Compact Administrators.17        1. The Commission is an instrumentality of the party 18    states.19        2. Venue is proper, and judicial proceedings by or 20    against the Commission shall be brought solely and 21    exclusively, in a court of competent jurisdiction where 22    the principal office of the Commission is located. The 23    Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to 24    the extent it adopts or consents to participate in   HB1652- 30 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1    alternative dispute resolution proceedings.2        3.

Each party state shall enforce this Compact and 12    take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate 13    this Compact's purposes and intent.14        2. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 15    of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, 16    responsibilities or actions of the Commission, and shall 17    have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all 18    purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such 19    proceeding to the Commission shall render a judgment or 20    order void as to the Commission, this Compact or 21    promulgated rules.22    b. Default, Technical Assistance and Termination23        1. If the Commission determines that a party state has 24    defaulted in the performance of its obligations or   HB1652- 43 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1    responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated 2    rules, the Commission shall:3            i.

NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT 11    (225 ILCS 65/85-5 new)12    Sec. 85-5. Nurse Licensure Compact. The State of Illinois 13ratifies and approves the following Compact: 14ARTICLE I 15Findings and Declaration of Purpose 16    a. The party states find that:17        1.

The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of 3    advanced communication technologies as part of our 4    nation's health care delivery system require greater 5    coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of 6    nurse licensure and regulation;7        4. New practice modalities and technology make 8    compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws 9    difficult and complex;10        5. The current system of duplicative licensure for 11    nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and 12    redundant for both nurses and states; and13        6. Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements 14    throughout the states promotes public safety and public 15    health benefits. 16    b. The general purposes of this Compact are to: 17        1. Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect 18    the public's health and safety;19        2. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party 20    states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;21        3. Facilitate the exchange of information between 22    party states in the areas of nurse regulation, 23    investigation and adverse actions;24        4. Promote compliance with the laws governing the 25    practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;26        5. Invest all party states with the authority to hold   HB1652- 16 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1    a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in 2    the state in which the patient is located at the time care 3    is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state 4    licenses; 5        6. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and 6    issuance of nurse licenses; and7        7. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by 8    nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.  9ARTICLE II 10Definitions 11    As used in this Compact:12        a.

If a 16party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the 17administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. 18The administrator of the coordinated licensure information 19system shall promptly notify the home state of any such 20actions by remote states.21    e. A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the 22state practice laws of the state in which the client is located 23at the time service is provided. The practice of nursing is not 24limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing 25practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party 26state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing   HB1652- 22 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will 2subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, 3the courts and the laws of the party state in which the client 4is located at the time service is provided.5    f.

Nothing in this Compact 11shall affect the requirements established by a party state for 12the issuance of a single-state license.13    g. Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on 14the effective date of this Compact, may retain and renew the 15multistate license issued by the nurse's then-current home 16state, provided that:17        1. A nurse, who changes primary state of residence 18    after this Compact's effective date, must meet all 19    applicable Article III.c. requirements to obtain a 20    multistate license from a new home state.21        2. A nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate 22    licensure requirements in Article III.c. due to a 23    disqualifying event occurring after this Compact's 24    effective date shall be ineligible to retain or renew a 25    multistate license, and the nurse's multistate license 26    shall be revoked or deactivated in accordance with   HB1652- 23 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1    applicable rules adopted by the Interstate Commission of 2    Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators ("Commission").  3ARTICLE IV 4Applications for Licensure in a Party State 5    a. Upon application for a multistate license, the 6licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, 7through the coordinated licensure information system, whether 8the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license 9issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances 10on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the 11applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against 12any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the 13applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating 14in an alternative program.15    b. A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the 16home state, in only one party state at a time.17    c. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving 18between two party states, the nurse must apply for licensure 19in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the 20prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with 21applicable rules adopted by the Commission.22        1. The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a 23    change in primary state of residence.24        2. A multistate license shall not be issued by the new   HB1652- 24 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1    home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence 2    of a change in primary state of residence to the new home 3    state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain 4    a multistate license from the new home state.5    d. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving 6from a party state to a non-party state, the multistate 7license issued by the prior home state will convert to a 8single-state license, valid only in the former home state.  9ARTICLE V 10Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing 11Boards 12    a. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, 13a licensing board shall have the authority to: 14        1. Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate 15    licensure privilege to practice within that party state.16            i. Only the home state shall have the power to take 17        adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the 18        home state.19            ii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the 20        home state licensing board shall give the same 21        priority and effect to reported conduct received from 22        a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred 23        within the home state. In so doing, the home state 24        shall apply its own state laws to determine   HB1652- 25 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1        appropriate action.2        2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an 3    encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that 4    party state.5        3. Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who 6    changes primary state of residence during the course of 7    such investigations. The licensing board shall also have 8    the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall 9    promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to 10    the administrator of the coordinated licensure information 11    system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure 12    information system shall promptly notify the new home 13    state of any such actions.14        4. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and 15    investigations that require the attendance and testimony 16    of witnesses, as well as, the production of evidence. 17    Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for 18    the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the 19    production of evidence from another party state shall be 20    enforced in the latter state by any court of competent 21    jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of 22    that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings 23    pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any 24    witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees 25    required by the service statutes of the state in which the 26    witnesses or evidence are located.  HB1652- 26 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1        5. Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure 2    applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based 3    information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 4    criminal background checks, receive the results of the 5    Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal 6    background checks and use the results in making licensure 7    decisions.8        6. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from 9    the affected nurse the costs of investigations and 10    disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action 11    taken against that nurse.12        7. Take adverse action based on the factual findings 13    of the remote state, provided that the licensing board 14    follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.15    b. If adverse action is taken by the home state against a 16nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure 17privilege to practice in all other party states shall be 18deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the 19multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that 20impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license 21shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate 22licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during 23the pendency of the order.24    c. Nothing in this Compact shall override a party state's 25decision that participation in an alternative program may be 26used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board   HB1652- 27 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the 2multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the 3nurse's participation in an alternative program.  4ARTICLE VI 5Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of 6Information 7    a. All party states shall participate in a coordinated 8licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses 9(RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs). 10This system will include information on the licensure and 11disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party 12states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and 13enforcement efforts.14    b. The Commission, in consultation with the administrator 15of the coordinated licensure information system, shall 16formulate necessary and proper procedures for the 17identification, collection and exchange of information under 18this Compact.19    c. All licensing boards shall promptly report to the 20coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, 21any current significant investigative information, denials of 22applications (with the reasons for such denials) and nurse 23participation in alternative programs known to the licensing 24board regardless of whether such participation is deemed   HB1652- 28 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1nonpublic or confidential under state law.2    d. Current significant investigative information and 3participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative 4programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated 5licensure information system only to party state licensing 6boards.7    e. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party 8state licensing boards contributing information to the 9coordinated licensure information system may designate 10information that may not be shared with non-party states or 11disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express 12permission of the contributing state.13    f. Any personally identifiable information obtained from 14the coordinated licensure information system by a party state 15licensing board shall not be shared with non-party states or 16disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the 17extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing 18the information.19    g. Any information contributed to the coordinated 20licensure information system that is subsequently required to 21be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that 22information shall also be expunged from the coordinated 23licensure information system.24    h. The Compact administrator of each party state shall 25furnish a uniform data set to the Compact administrator of 26each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:  HB1652- 29 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1        1.

Each party state shall enforce this Compact and 12    take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate 13    this Compact's purposes and intent.14        2. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 15    of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, 16    responsibilities or actions of the Commission, and shall 17    have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all 18    purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such 19    proceeding to the Commission shall render a judgment or 20    order void as to the Commission, this Compact or 21    promulgated rules.22    b. Default, Technical Assistance and Termination23        1. If the Commission determines that a party state has 24    defaulted in the performance of its obligations or   HB1652- 43 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1    responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated 2    rules, the Commission shall:3            i. Provide written notice to the defaulting state 4        and other party states of the nature of the default, 5        the proposed means of curing the default or any other 6        action to be taken by the Commission; and7            ii. Provide remedial training and specific 8        technical assistance regarding the default.9        2.

A cure of the default does 15    not relieve the offending state of obligations or 16    liabilities incurred during the period of default.17        3. Termination of membership in this Compact shall be 18    imposed only after all other means of securing compliance 19    have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or 20    terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor 21    of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of 22    the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the 23    party states.24        4. A state whose membership in this Compact has been 25    terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations 26    and liabilities incurred through the effective date of   HB1652- 44 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1    termination, including obligations that extend beyond the 2    effective date of termination.3        5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to 4    a state that is found to be in default or whose membership 5    in this Compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in 6    writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.7        6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the 8    Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the 9    District of Columbia or the federal district in which the 10    Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party 11    shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 12    reasonable attorneys' fees.13    c. Dispute Resolution14        1. Upon request by a party state, the Commission shall 15    attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that 16    arise among party states and between party and non-party 17    states.18        2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing 19    for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for 20    disputes, as appropriate.21        3. In the event the Commission cannot resolve disputes 22    among party states arising under this Compact:23            i. The party states may submit the issues in 24        dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be 25        comprised of individuals appointed by the Compact 26        administrator in each of the affected party states and   HB1652- 45 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1        an individual mutually agreed upon by the Compact 2        administrators of all the party states involved in the 3        dispute.4            ii. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators 5        shall be final and binding.6    d. Enforcement7        1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its 8    discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this 9    Compact.10        2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal 11    action in the U.S. District Court for the District of 12    Columbia or the federal district in which the Commission 13    has its principal offices against a party state that is in 14    default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this 15    Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief 16    sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In 17    the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the 18    prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 19    litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.20        3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive 21    remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any 22    other remedies available under federal or state law.  23ARTICLE X 24Effective Date, Withdrawal and Amendment HB1652- 46 -LRB104 07661 AAS 17705 b1    a.
