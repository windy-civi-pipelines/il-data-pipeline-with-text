In 2    determining that a family assessment is appropriate, the 3    Department may consider issues, including, but not limited 4    to, child safety, parental cooperation, and the need for 5    an immediate response.6        (4) Shall promulgate criteria, standards, and 7    procedures that shall be applied in making this 8    determination, taking into consideration the Safety-Based 9    Child Welfare Intervention System of the Department.10        (5) May conduct a family assessment on a report that 11    was initially screened and assigned for an investigation.12    In determining that a complete investigation is not 13required, the Department must document the reason for 14terminating the investigation and notify the local law 15enforcement agency or the Illinois State Police if the local 16law enforcement agency or Illinois State Police is conducting 17a joint investigation.18    Once it is determined that a "family assessment" will be 19implemented, the case shall not be reported to the central 20register of abuse and neglect reports.21    During a family assessment, the Department shall collect 22any available and relevant information to determine child 23safety, risk of subsequent abuse or neglect, and family 24strengths.25    Information collected includes, but is not limited to, 26when relevant: information with regard to the person reporting   HB3169- 4 -LRB104 10634 KTG 20711 b1the alleged abuse or neglect, including the nature of the 2reporter's relationship to the child and to the alleged 3offender, and the basis of the reporter's knowledge for the 4report; the child allegedly being abused or neglected; the 5alleged offender; the child's caretaker; and other collateral 6sources having relevant information related to the alleged 7abuse or neglect. Information relevant to the assessment must 8be asked for, and may include:9        (A) The child's sex and age, prior reports of abuse or 10    neglect, information relating to developmental 11    functioning, credibility of the child's statement, and 12    whether the information provided under this paragraph (A) 13    is consistent with other information collected during the 14    course of the assessment or investigation.15        (B) The alleged offender's age, a record check for 16    prior reports of abuse or neglect, and criminal charges 17    and convictions. The alleged offender may submit 18    supporting documentation relevant to the assessment.19        (C) Collateral source information regarding the 20    alleged abuse or neglect and care of the child. Collateral 21    information includes, when relevant: (i) a medical 22    examination of the child; (ii) prior medical records 23    relating to the alleged maltreatment or care of the child 24    maintained by any facility, clinic, or health care 25    professional, and an interview with the treating 26    professionals; and (iii) interviews with the child's   HB3169- 5 -LRB104 10634 KTG 20711 b1    caretakers, including the child's parent, guardian, foster 2    parent, child care provider, teachers, counselors, family 3    members, relatives, and other persons who may have 4    knowledge regarding the alleged maltreatment and the care 5    of the child.6        (D) Information on the existence of domestic abuse and 7    violence in the home of the child, and substance abuse.8    Nothing in this subsection (a-5) precludes the Department 9from collecting other relevant information necessary to 10conduct the assessment or investigation. Nothing in this 11subsection (a-5) shall be construed to allow the name or 12identity of a reporter to be disclosed in violation of the 13protections afforded under Section 7.19 of this Act.14    After conducting the family assessment, the Department 15shall determine whether services are needed to address the 16safety of the child and other family members and the risk of 17subsequent abuse or neglect.18    Upon completion of the family assessment, if the 19Department concludes that no services shall be offered, then 20the case shall be closed. If the Department concludes that 21services shall be offered, the Department shall develop a 22family preservation plan and offer or refer services to the 23family.24    At any time during a family assessment, if the Department 25believes there is any reason to stop the assessment and 26conduct an investigation based on the information discovered,   HB3169- 6 -LRB104 10634 KTG 20711 b1the Department shall do so.2    The procedures available to the Department in conducting 3investigations under this Act shall be followed as appropriate 4during a family assessment.5    If the Department implements a differential response 6program authorized under this subsection (a-5), the Department 7shall arrange for an independent evaluation of the program for 8at least the first 3 years of implementation to determine 9whether it is meeting the goals in accordance with Section 2 of 10this Act. 11    The Department may adopt administrative rules necessary 12for the execution of this Section, in accordance with Section 134 of the Children and Family Services Act.14    The Department shall submit a report to the General 15Assembly by January 15, 2018 on the implementation progress 16and recommendations for additional needed legislative changes. 17    (b)(1) The following procedures shall be followed in the 18investigation of all reports of suspected abuse or neglect of 19a child, except as provided in subsection (c) of this Section. 20    (2) If, during a family assessment authorized by 21subsection (a-5) or an investigation, it appears that the 22immediate safety or well-being of a child is endangered, that 23the family may flee or the child disappear, or that the facts 24otherwise so warrant, the Child Protective Service Unit shall 25commence an investigation immediately, regardless of the time 26of day or night. All other investigations shall be commenced   HB3169- 7 -LRB104 10634 KTG 20711 b1within 24 hours of receipt of the report. Upon receipt of a 2report, the Child Protective Service Unit shall conduct a 3family assessment authorized by subsection (a-5) or begin an 4initial investigation and make an initial determination 5whether the report is a good faith indication of alleged child 6abuse or neglect. 7    (3) Based on an initial investigation, if the Unit 8determines the report is a good faith indication of alleged 9child abuse or neglect, then a formal investigation shall 10commence and, pursuant to Section 7.12 of this Act, may or may 11not result in an indicated report. The formal investigation 12shall include: direct contact with the subject or subjects of 13the report as soon as possible after the report is received; an 14evaluation of the environment of the child named in the report 15and any other children in the same environment; a 16determination of the risk to such children if they continue to 17remain in the existing environments, as well as a 18determination of the nature, extent and cause of any condition 19enumerated in such report; the name, age and condition of 20other children in the environment; and an evaluation as to 21whether there would be an immediate and urgent necessity to 22remove the child from the environment if appropriate family 23preservation services were provided. After seeing to the 24safety of the child or children, the Department shall 25forthwith notify the subjects of the report in writing, of the 26existence of the report and their rights existing under this   HB3169- 8 -LRB104 10634 KTG 20711 b1Act in regard to amendment or expungement. To fulfill the 2requirements of this Section, the Child Protective Service 3Unit shall have the capability of providing or arranging for 4comprehensive emergency services to children and families at 5all times of the day or night. 6    (4) If (i) at the conclusion of the Unit's initial 7investigation of a report, the Unit determines the report to 8be a good faith indication of alleged child abuse or neglect 9that warrants a formal investigation by the Unit, the 10Department, any law enforcement agency or any other 11responsible agency and (ii) the person who is alleged to have 12caused the abuse or neglect is employed or otherwise engaged 13in an activity resulting in frequent contact with children and 14the alleged abuse or neglect are in the course of such 15employment or activity, then the Department shall, except in 16investigations where the Director determines that such 17notification would be detrimental to the Department's 18investigation, inform the appropriate supervisor or 19administrator of that employment or activity that the Unit has 20commenced a formal investigation pursuant to this Act, which 21may or may not result in an indicated report.
