Any person desiring to vote and whose name is 8found upon the register of voters by the person having charge 9thereof shall (i) present to the judges of election for 10verification of the person's identity an Illinois driver's 11license or an Illinois Identification Card, (ii) , shall then 12be questioned by one of the judges as to his nativity, his term 13of residence at present address, precinct, State and United 14States, his age, whether naturalized and if so the date of 15naturalization papers and court from which secured, and (iii) 16he shall be asked to state his residence when last previously 17registered and the date of the election for which he then 18registered.

If such 13person so registered shall be challenged as disqualified, the 14party challenging shall assign his reasons therefor, and 15thereupon one of the judges shall administer to him an oath to 16answer questions, and if he shall take the oath he shall then 17be questioned by the judge or judges touching such cause of 18challenge, and touching any other cause of disqualification. 19And he may also be questioned by the person challenging him in 20regard to his qualifications and identity. But if a majority 21of the judges are of the opinion that he is the person so 22registered and a qualified voter, his vote shall then be 23received accordingly. But if his vote be rejected by such 24judges, such person may afterward produce and deliver an 25affidavit to such judges, subscribed and sworn to by him 26before one of the judges, in which it shall be stated how long   HB1539- 8 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1he has resided in such precinct, and state; that he is a 2citizen of the United States, and is a duly qualified voter in 3such precinct, and that he is the identical person so 4registered. In addition to such an affidavit, the person so 5challenged shall provide to the judges of election proof of 6residence by producing 2 forms of identification showing the 7person's current residence address, provided that such 8identification may include a lease or contract for a residence 9and not more than one piece of mail addressed to the person at 10his current residence address and postmarked not earlier than 1130 days prior to the date of the election, or the person shall 12procure a witness personally known to the judges of election, 13and resident in the precinct (or district), or who shall be 14proved by some legal voter of such precinct or district, known 15to the judges to be such, who shall take the oath following, 16viz: 17    I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am a resident of 18this election precinct (or district), and entitled to vote at 19this election, and that I have been a resident of this State 20for 30 days last past, and am well acquainted with the person 21whose vote is now offered; that he is an actual and bona fide 22resident of this election precinct (or district), and has 23resided herein 30 days, and as I verily believe, in this State, 2430 days next preceding this election. 25    The oath in each case may be administered by one of the 26judges of election, or by any officer, resident in the   HB1539- 9 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1precinct or district, authorized by law to administer oaths. 2Also supported by an affidavit by a registered voter residing 3in such precinct, stating his own residence, and that he knows 4such person; and that he does reside at the place mentioned and 5has resided in such precinct and state for the length of time 6as stated by such person, which shall be subscribed and sworn 7to in the same way. For purposes of this Section, the 8submission of a photo identification issued by a college or 9university, accompanied by either (i) a copy of the 10applicant's contract or lease for a residence or (ii) one 11piece of mail addressed to the person at his or her current 12residence address and postmarked not earlier than 30 days 13prior to the date of the election, shall be sufficient to 14establish proof of residence. Whereupon the vote of such 15person shall be received, and entered as other votes. But such 16judges, having charge of such registers, shall state in their 17respective books the facts in such case, and the affidavits, 18so delivered to the judges, shall be preserved and returned to 19the office of the commissioners of election. Blank affidavits 20of the character aforesaid shall be sent out to the judges of 21all the precincts, and the judges of election shall furnish 22the same on demand and administer the oaths without criticism. 23Such oaths, if administered by any other officer than such 24judge of election, shall not be received. Whenever a proposal 25for a constitutional amendment or for the calling of a 26constitutional convention is to be voted upon at the election,   HB1539- 10 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1the separate blue ballot or ballots pertaining thereto shall 2be placed on top of the other ballots to be voted at the 3election in such manner that the legend appearing on the back 4thereof, as prescribed in Section 16-6 of this Act, shall be 5plainly visible to the voter, and in this fashion the ballots 6shall be handed to the voter by the judge. 7    Immediately after voting, the voter shall be instructed 8whether the voting equipment, if used, accepted or rejected 9the ballot or identified the ballot as under-voted. A voter 10whose ballot is identified as under-voted for a statewide 11constitutional office may return to the voting booth and 12complete the voting of that ballot. A voter whose ballot is not 13accepted by the voting equipment may, upon surrendering the 14ballot, request and vote another ballot. The voter's 15surrendered ballot shall be initialed by the election judge 16and handled as provided in the appropriate Article governing 17that voting equipment.18    The voter shall, upon quitting the voting booth, deliver 19to one of the judges of election all of the ballots, properly 20folded, which he received. The judge of election to whom the 21voter delivers his ballots shall not accept the same unless 22all of the ballots given to the voter are returned by him. If a 23voter delivers less than all of the ballots given to him, the 24judge to whom the same are offered shall advise him in a voice 25clearly audible to the other judges of election that the voter 26must return the remainder of the ballots. The statement of the   HB1539- 11 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1judge to the voter shall clearly express the fact that the 2voter is not required to vote such remaining ballots but that 3whether or not he votes them he must fold and deliver them to 4the judge. In making such statement the judge of election 5shall not indicate by word, gesture or intonation of voice 6that the unreturned ballots shall be voted in any particular 7manner. No new voter shall be permitted to enter the voting 8booth of a voter who has failed to deliver the total number of 9ballots received by him until such voter has returned to the 10voting booth pursuant to the judge's request and again quit 11the booth with all of the ballots required to be returned by 12him. Upon receipt of all such ballots the judges of election 13shall enter the name of the voter, and his number, as above 14provided in this Section, and the judge to whom the ballots are 15delivered shall immediately put the ballots into the ballot 16box. If any voter who has failed to deliver all the ballots 17received by him refuses to return to the voting booth after 18being advised by the judge of election as herein provided, the 19judge shall inform the other judges of such refusal, and 20thereupon the ballot or ballots returned to the judge shall be 21deposited in the ballot box, the voter shall be permitted to 22depart from the polling place, and a new voter shall be 23permitted to enter the voting booth. 24    The judge of election who receives the ballot or ballots 25from the voter shall announce the residence and name of such 26voter in a loud voice. The judge shall put the ballot or   HB1539- 12 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1ballots received from the voter into the ballot box in the 2presence of the voter and the judges of election, and in plain 3view of the public. The judges having charge of such registers 4shall then, in a column prepared thereon, in the same line of, 5the name of the voter, mark "Voted" or the letter "V". 6    No judge of election shall accept from any voter less than 7the full number of ballots received by such voter without 8first advising the voter in the manner above provided of the 9necessity of returning all of the ballots, nor shall any such 10judge advise such voter in a manner contrary to that which is 11herein permitted, or in any other manner violate the 12provisions of this Section; provided, that the acceptance by a 13judge of election of less than the full number of ballots 14delivered to a voter who refuses to return to the voting booth 15after being properly advised by such judge shall not be a 16violation of this Section. 17(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 18    (10 ILCS 5/18A-15)19    Sec. 18A-15.

The provisional voter's affidavit 10    shall serve as a change of address request by that voter 11    for registration purposes for the next ensuing election if 12    it bears an address different from that in the records of 13    the election authority. Votes for federal and statewide 14    offices on a provisional ballot cast in the incorrect 15    precinct that meet the other requirements of this 16    subsection shall be valid and counted in accordance with 17    this Article. As used in this item, "federal office" is 18    defined as provided in Section 20-1 and "statewide office" 19    means the Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, 20    Comptroller, and Treasurer. Votes for General Assembly, 21    countywide, citywide, or township office on a provisional 22    ballot cast in the incorrect precinct but in the correct 23    legislative district, representative district, county, 24    municipality, or township, as the case may be, shall be 25    valid and counted in accordance with this Article. As used 26    in this item, "citywide office" means an office elected by   HB1539- 14 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1    the electors of an entire municipality. As used in this 2    item, "township office" means an office elected by the 3    electors of an entire township;4        (2) the affidavit executed by the provisional voter 5    pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5 contains, 6    at a minimum, the provisional voter's first and last name, 7    house number and street name, and signature or mark;8        (3) except as permitted by item (5) of subsection (b) 9    of this Section, the provisional voter is a registered 10    voter based on information available to the county clerk 11    or board of election commissioners provided by or obtained 12    from any of the following:13            i. the provisional voter;14            ii. an election judge;15            iii. the statewide voter registration database 16        maintained by the State Board of Elections;17            iv. the records of the county clerk or board of 18        election commissioners' database; or19            v. the records of the Secretary of State; and20        (4) for a provisional ballot cast under item (6) of 21    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter did not vote by 22    mail ballot in the election at which the provisional 23    ballot was cast; or 24        (5) for a provisional ballot cast under item (7) of 25    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter provides the 26    election authority with the necessary documentation within   HB1539- 15 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1    7 days of election day. 2    (c) With respect to subsection (b)(3) of this Section, the 3county clerk or board of election commissioners shall 4investigate and record whether or not the specified 5information is available from each of the 5 identified 6sources. If the information is available from one or more of 7the identified sources, then the county clerk or board of 8election commissioners shall seek to obtain the information 9from each of those sources until satisfied, with information 10from at least one of those sources, that the provisional voter 11is registered and entitled to vote. The county clerk or board 12of election commissioners shall use any information it obtains 13as the basis for determining the voter registration status of 14the provisional voter. If a conflict exists among the 15information available to the county clerk or board of election 16commissioners as to the registration status of the provisional 17voter, then the county clerk or board of election 18commissioners shall make a determination based on the totality 19of the circumstances. In a case where the above information 20equally supports or opposes the registration status of the 21voter, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 22shall decide in favor of the provisional voter as being duly 23registered to vote. If the statewide voter registration 24database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 25that the provisional voter is registered to vote, but the 26county clerk's or board of election commissioners' voter   HB1539- 16 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1registration database indicates that the provisional voter is 2not registered to vote, then the information found in the 3statewide voter registration database shall control the matter 4and the provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to 5vote. If the records of the county clerk or board of election 6commissioners indicates that the provisional voter is 7registered to vote, but the statewide voter registration 8database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 9that the provisional voter is not registered to vote, then the 10information found in the records of the county clerk or board 11of election commissioners shall control the matter and the 12provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to vote. If 13the provisional voter's signature on his or her provisional 14ballot request varies from the signature on an otherwise valid 15registration application solely because of the substitution of 16initials for the first or middle name, the election authority 17may not reject the provisional ballot.18    (d) In validating the registration status of a person 19casting a provisional ballot, the county clerk or board of 20election commissioners shall not require a provisional voter 21to complete any form other than the affidavit executed by the 22provisional voter under subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5. In 23addition, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 24shall not require all provisional voters or any particular 25class or group of provisional voters to appear personally 26before the county clerk or board of election commissioners or   HB1539- 17 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1as a matter of policy require provisional voters to submit 2additional information to verify or otherwise support the 3information already submitted by the provisional voter.

The 13provisional voter may, within 7 calendar days after the 14election, submit additional information to the county clerk or 15board of election commissioners, except that in the case of 16provisional voting under paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of 17Section 18A-5, the provisional voter has 7 days to provide the 18county clerk or board of election commissioners with the 19provisional voter's Illinois driver's license or Illinois 20Identification Card. This information must be received by the 21county clerk or board of election commissioners within the 227-calendar-day period.23    (e) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 24determines that subsection (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) does not 25apply, then the provisional ballot is not valid and may not be 26counted. The provisional ballot envelope containing the ballot   HB1539- 18 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1cast by the provisional voter may not be opened. The county 2clerk or board of election commissioners shall write on the 3provisional ballot envelope the following: "Provisional ballot 4determined invalid.".5    (f) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 6determines that a provisional ballot is valid under this 7Section, then the provisional ballot envelope shall be opened. 8The outside of each provisional ballot envelope shall also be 9marked to identify the precinct and the date of the election.10    (g) Provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be 11counted at the election authority's central ballot counting 12location and shall not be counted in precincts. The 13provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be added to 14the vote totals for the precincts from which they were cast in 15the order in which the ballots were opened. The validation and 16counting of provisional ballots shall be subject to the 17provisions of this Code that apply to pollwatchers. If the 18provisional ballots are a ballot of a punch card voting 19system, then the provisional ballot shall be counted in a 20manner consistent with Article 24A. If the provisional ballots 21are a ballot of optical scan or other type of approved 22electronic voting system, then the provisional ballots shall 23be counted in a manner consistent with Article 24B.24    (h) As soon as the ballots have been counted, the election 25judges or election officials shall, in the presence of the 26county clerk or board of election commissioners, place each of   HB1539- 19 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1the following items in a separate envelope or bag: (1) all 2provisional ballots, voted or spoiled; (2) all provisional 3ballot envelopes of provisional ballots voted or spoiled; and 4(3) all executed affidavits of the provisional ballots voted 5or spoiled.

The election judges or election officials 12shall then securely seal each envelope or bag, initial the 13envelope or bag, and plainly mark on the outside of the 14envelope or bag in ink the precinct in which the provisional 15ballots were cast. The election judges or election officials 16shall then place each sealed envelope or bag into a box, secure 17and seal it in the same manner as described in item (6) of 18subsection (b) of Section 18A-5.

If such 13person so registered shall be challenged as disqualified, the 14party challenging shall assign his reasons therefor, and 15thereupon one of the judges shall administer to him an oath to 16answer questions, and if he shall take the oath he shall then 17be questioned by the judge or judges touching such cause of 18challenge, and touching any other cause of disqualification. 19And he may also be questioned by the person challenging him in 20regard to his qualifications and identity. But if a majority 21of the judges are of the opinion that he is the person so 22registered and a qualified voter, his vote shall then be 23received accordingly.

In addition to such an affidavit, the person so 5challenged shall provide to the judges of election proof of 6residence by producing 2 forms of identification showing the 7person's current residence address, provided that such 8identification may include a lease or contract for a residence 9and not more than one piece of mail addressed to the person at 10his current residence address and postmarked not earlier than 1130 days prior to the date of the election, or the person shall 12procure a witness personally known to the judges of election, 13and resident in the precinct (or district), or who shall be 14proved by some legal voter of such precinct or district, known 15to the judges to be such, who shall take the oath following, 16viz: 17    I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am a resident of 18this election precinct (or district), and entitled to vote at 19this election, and that I have been a resident of this State 20for 30 days last past, and am well acquainted with the person 21whose vote is now offered; that he is an actual and bona fide 22resident of this election precinct (or district), and has 23resided herein 30 days, and as I verily believe, in this State, 2430 days next preceding this election. 25    The oath in each case may be administered by one of the 26judges of election, or by any officer, resident in the   HB1539- 9 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1precinct or district, authorized by law to administer oaths. 2Also supported by an affidavit by a registered voter residing 3in such precinct, stating his own residence, and that he knows 4such person; and that he does reside at the place mentioned and 5has resided in such precinct and state for the length of time 6as stated by such person, which shall be subscribed and sworn 7to in the same way. For purposes of this Section, the 8submission of a photo identification issued by a college or 9university, accompanied by either (i) a copy of the 10applicant's contract or lease for a residence or (ii) one 11piece of mail addressed to the person at his or her current 12residence address and postmarked not earlier than 30 days 13prior to the date of the election, shall be sufficient to 14establish proof of residence. Whereupon the vote of such 15person shall be received, and entered as other votes. But such 16judges, having charge of such registers, shall state in their 17respective books the facts in such case, and the affidavits, 18so delivered to the judges, shall be preserved and returned to 19the office of the commissioners of election. Blank affidavits 20of the character aforesaid shall be sent out to the judges of 21all the precincts, and the judges of election shall furnish 22the same on demand and administer the oaths without criticism. 23Such oaths, if administered by any other officer than such 24judge of election, shall not be received.

A voter 10whose ballot is identified as under-voted for a statewide 11constitutional office may return to the voting booth and 12complete the voting of that ballot. A voter whose ballot is not 13accepted by the voting equipment may, upon surrendering the 14ballot, request and vote another ballot. The voter's 15surrendered ballot shall be initialed by the election judge 16and handled as provided in the appropriate Article governing 17that voting equipment.18    The voter shall, upon quitting the voting booth, deliver 19to one of the judges of election all of the ballots, properly 20folded, which he received. The judge of election to whom the 21voter delivers his ballots shall not accept the same unless 22all of the ballots given to the voter are returned by him. If a 23voter delivers less than all of the ballots given to him, the 24judge to whom the same are offered shall advise him in a voice 25clearly audible to the other judges of election that the voter 26must return the remainder of the ballots. The statement of the   HB1539- 11 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1judge to the voter shall clearly express the fact that the 2voter is not required to vote such remaining ballots but that 3whether or not he votes them he must fold and deliver them to 4the judge. In making such statement the judge of election 5shall not indicate by word, gesture or intonation of voice 6that the unreturned ballots shall be voted in any particular 7manner. No new voter shall be permitted to enter the voting 8booth of a voter who has failed to deliver the total number of 9ballots received by him until such voter has returned to the 10voting booth pursuant to the judge's request and again quit 11the booth with all of the ballots required to be returned by 12him. Upon receipt of all such ballots the judges of election 13shall enter the name of the voter, and his number, as above 14provided in this Section, and the judge to whom the ballots are 15delivered shall immediately put the ballots into the ballot 16box. If any voter who has failed to deliver all the ballots 17received by him refuses to return to the voting booth after 18being advised by the judge of election as herein provided, the 19judge shall inform the other judges of such refusal, and 20thereupon the ballot or ballots returned to the judge shall be 21deposited in the ballot box, the voter shall be permitted to 22depart from the polling place, and a new voter shall be 23permitted to enter the voting booth. 24    The judge of election who receives the ballot or ballots 25from the voter shall announce the residence and name of such 26voter in a loud voice. The judge shall put the ballot or   HB1539- 12 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1ballots received from the voter into the ballot box in the 2presence of the voter and the judges of election, and in plain 3view of the public. The judges having charge of such registers 4shall then, in a column prepared thereon, in the same line of, 5the name of the voter, mark "Voted" or the letter "V". 6    No judge of election shall accept from any voter less than 7the full number of ballots received by such voter without 8first advising the voter in the manner above provided of the 9necessity of returning all of the ballots, nor shall any such 10judge advise such voter in a manner contrary to that which is 11herein permitted, or in any other manner violate the 12provisions of this Section; provided, that the acceptance by a 13judge of election of less than the full number of ballots 14delivered to a voter who refuses to return to the voting booth 15after being properly advised by such judge shall not be a 16violation of this Section. 17(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 18    (10 ILCS 5/18A-15)19    Sec. 18A-15.

The provisional voter's affidavit 10    shall serve as a change of address request by that voter 11    for registration purposes for the next ensuing election if 12    it bears an address different from that in the records of 13    the election authority. Votes for federal and statewide 14    offices on a provisional ballot cast in the incorrect 15    precinct that meet the other requirements of this 16    subsection shall be valid and counted in accordance with 17    this Article. As used in this item, "federal office" is 18    defined as provided in Section 20-1 and "statewide office" 19    means the Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, 20    Comptroller, and Treasurer. Votes for General Assembly, 21    countywide, citywide, or township office on a provisional 22    ballot cast in the incorrect precinct but in the correct 23    legislative district, representative district, county, 24    municipality, or township, as the case may be, shall be 25    valid and counted in accordance with this Article. As used 26    in this item, "citywide office" means an office elected by   HB1539- 14 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1    the electors of an entire municipality. As used in this 2    item, "township office" means an office elected by the 3    electors of an entire township;4        (2) the affidavit executed by the provisional voter 5    pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5 contains, 6    at a minimum, the provisional voter's first and last name, 7    house number and street name, and signature or mark;8        (3) except as permitted by item (5) of subsection (b) 9    of this Section, the provisional voter is a registered 10    voter based on information available to the county clerk 11    or board of election commissioners provided by or obtained 12    from any of the following:13            i. the provisional voter;14            ii. an election judge;15            iii. the statewide voter registration database 16        maintained by the State Board of Elections;17            iv. the records of the county clerk or board of 18        election commissioners' database; or19            v. the records of the Secretary of State; and20        (4) for a provisional ballot cast under item (6) of 21    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter did not vote by 22    mail ballot in the election at which the provisional 23    ballot was cast; or 24        (5) for a provisional ballot cast under item (7) of 25    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter provides the 26    election authority with the necessary documentation within   HB1539- 15 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1    7 days of election day. 2    (c) With respect to subsection (b)(3) of this Section, the 3county clerk or board of election commissioners shall 4investigate and record whether or not the specified 5information is available from each of the 5 identified 6sources. If the information is available from one or more of 7the identified sources, then the county clerk or board of 8election commissioners shall seek to obtain the information 9from each of those sources until satisfied, with information 10from at least one of those sources, that the provisional voter 11is registered and entitled to vote. The county clerk or board 12of election commissioners shall use any information it obtains 13as the basis for determining the voter registration status of 14the provisional voter. If a conflict exists among the 15information available to the county clerk or board of election 16commissioners as to the registration status of the provisional 17voter, then the county clerk or board of election 18commissioners shall make a determination based on the totality 19of the circumstances. In a case where the above information 20equally supports or opposes the registration status of the 21voter, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 22shall decide in favor of the provisional voter as being duly 23registered to vote. If the statewide voter registration 24database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 25that the provisional voter is registered to vote, but the 26county clerk's or board of election commissioners' voter   HB1539- 16 -LRB104 08182 SPS 18232 b1registration database indicates that the provisional voter is 2not registered to vote, then the information found in the 3statewide voter registration database shall control the matter 4and the provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to 5vote. If the records of the county clerk or board of election 6commissioners indicates that the provisional voter is 7registered to vote, but the statewide voter registration 8database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 9that the provisional voter is not registered to vote, then the 10information found in the records of the county clerk or board 11of election commissioners shall control the matter and the 12provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to vote. If 13the provisional voter's signature on his or her provisional 14ballot request varies from the signature on an otherwise valid 15registration application solely because of the substitution of 16initials for the first or middle name, the election authority 17may not reject the provisional ballot.18    (d) In validating the registration status of a person 19casting a provisional ballot, the county clerk or board of 20election commissioners shall not require a provisional voter 21to complete any form other than the affidavit executed by the 22provisional voter under subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5.
