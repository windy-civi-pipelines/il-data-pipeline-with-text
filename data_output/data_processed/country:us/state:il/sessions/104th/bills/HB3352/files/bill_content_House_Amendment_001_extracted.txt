The model third-party verification form shall 15require verification under Section 1-109 of the Code of Civil 16Procedure. The design and publication of the model statement 17of coerced debt and third-party written verification form is a 18prescription of a standardized form and shall not constitute a 19rule subject to the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act.20    (o) Nothing in this Section shall reduce or eliminate any 21other rights or defenses available at law.22    (p) The provisions of this Section are severable under 23Section 1.31 of the Statute on Statutes.".
