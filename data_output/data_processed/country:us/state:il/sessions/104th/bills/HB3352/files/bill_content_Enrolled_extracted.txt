A collection 20    agency may only resume collection activities after 21    providing debtor with a copy of this written statement and 22    supporting evidence at the debtor's preferred email or 23    mailing address from the statement of coerced debt or, if 24    not provided as part of the statement, at their last known 25    mailing address.26        (3) If, after its review of the statement of coerced   HB3352 Enrolled- 10 -LRB104 09840 BAB 19908 b1    debt and accompanying materials, the collection agency 2    makes a good faith determination that the debt qualifies 3    as coerced debt, it shall: (i) refrain from any further 4    collection activities, including the filing of any lawsuit 5    or arbitration, to collect the coerced debt from the 6    debtor who submitted the statement of coerced debt; (ii) 7    notify the debtor through their preferred contact method 8    that it is ceasing all attempts to collect the debt from 9    the debtor based on the debtor's claim of coerced debt; 10    and (iii) contact any consumer reporting agency to which 11    it furnished information about the coerced debt and 12    request they delete such information.13        (4) Upon the collection agency's request, the debtor 14    shall provide the identity of the alleged perpetrator and 15    the individual's contact information to the collection 16    agency, if known.17        (5) A collection agency shall not provide the contact 18    information of debtor or a copy of the statement of 19    coerced debt or supporting information to an alleged 20    perpetrator of coerced debt or another person but may 21    summarize the allegations about how the coerced debt was 22    incurred in order to collect the debt from the 23    perpetrator.24    (f) In any lawsuit or arbitration to collect a debt, it 25shall be an affirmative defense that the debt is or is 26partially coerced debt.
