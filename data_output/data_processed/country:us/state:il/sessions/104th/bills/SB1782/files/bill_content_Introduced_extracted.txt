Child care. 8    (a) The General Assembly recognizes that families with 9children need child care in order to work. Child care is 10expensive and families with limited access to economic 11resources, including those who are transitioning from welfare 12to work, often struggle to pay the costs of day care. The 13General Assembly understands the importance of helping working 14families with limited access to economic resources become and 15remain self-sufficient. The General Assembly also believes 16that it is the responsibility of families to share in the costs 17of child care. It is also the preference of the General 18Assembly that all working families with limited access to 19economic resources should be treated equally, regardless of 20their welfare status.21    (b) To the extent resources permit, the Illinois 22Department shall provide child care services to parents or 23other relatives as defined by rule who are working or   SB1782- 2 -LRB104 10236 KTG 20310 b1participating in employment or Department approved education 2or training programs. At a minimum, the Illinois Department 3shall cover the following categories of families:4        (1) recipients of TANF under Article IV participating 5    in work and training activities as specified in the 6    personal plan for employment and self-sufficiency;7        (2) families transitioning from TANF to work;8        (3) families at risk of becoming recipients of TANF;9        (4) families with special needs as defined by rule;10        (5) working families with very low incomes as defined 11    by rule;12        (6) families that are not recipients of TANF and that 13    need child care assistance to participate in education and 14    training activities; 15        (7) youth in care, as defined in Section 4d of the 16    Children and Family Services Act, who are parents, 17    regardless of income or whether they are working or 18    participating in Department-approved employment or 19    education or training programs. Any family that receives 20    child care assistance in accordance with this paragraph 21    shall receive one additional 12-month child care 22    eligibility period after the parenting youth in care's 23    case with the Department of Children and Family Services 24    is closed, regardless of income or whether the parenting 25    youth in care is working or participating in 26    Department-approved employment or education or training   SB1782- 3 -LRB104 10236 KTG 20310 b1    programs;2        (8) families receiving Extended Family Support Program 3    services from the Department of Children and Family 4    Services, regardless of income or whether they are working 5    or participating in Department-approved employment or 6    education or training programs; and7        (9) families with children under the age of 5 who have 8    an open intact family services case with the Department of 9    Children and Family Services. Any family that receives 10    child care assistance in accordance with this paragraph 11    shall remain eligible for child care assistance 6 months 12    after the child's intact family services case is closed, 13    regardless of whether the child's parents or other 14    relatives as defined by rule are working or participating 15    in Department approved employment or education or training 16    programs. The Department of Early Childhood, in 17    consultation with the Department of Children and Family 18    Services, shall adopt rules to protect the privacy of 19    families who are the subject of an open intact family 20    services case when such families enroll in child care 21    services.

These changes may be accomplished by emergency 11rule under Section 5-45 of the Illinois Administrative 12Procedure Act, except that the limitation on the number of 13emergency rules that may be adopted in a 24-month period shall 14not apply.15    The Illinois Department may contract with other State 16agencies or child care organizations for the administration of 17child care services.18    (c) Payment shall be made for child care that otherwise 19meets the requirements of this Section and applicable 20standards of State and local law and regulation, including any 21requirements the Illinois Department promulgates by rule. 22Through June 30, 2026, the rules of this Section include 23licensure requirements adopted by the Department of Children 24and Family Services.
