Amend House Bill 44 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Emerging Adult Sentencing Act. 6    Section 5. Purpose. The purpose of this Act is to create a 7transformative post-conviction model that reduces reliance on 8traditional incarceration for emerging adults by fostering 9partnerships between adult probation departments and 10nonprofit, community-based residential workforce development 11centers to implement restorative justice practices, workforce 12training, and mental health support. This Act recognizes that 13young adults aged 18 through 25 are more likely to be justice 14involved due to poverty, instability, trauma, and a lack of 15social and emotional services and support. Young adults who 16receive holistic, developmentally appropriate supports and   10400HB0044ham003- 2 -LRB104 03575 RLC 23730 a1services in a community setting continue educational pursuits, 2successfully enter the workforce, and are less likely to 3reoffend, thus increasing the welfare of the young adult and 4the community, rather than those who are incarcerated. This 5Act recognizes that the qualities that distinguish juveniles 6from adults do not disappear when an individual turns 18. They 7remain vulnerable to negative influences and outside peer 8pressures, including from their family and peers, and they 9have limited control over their own environment. Because the 10characters of emerging adults are still being formed, their 11traits are less fixed and their actions are less likely to be 12evidence of a lack of rehabilitative potential. Accordingly, 13emerging adults are worthy of special care, investment, and 14consideration to prevent long-term involvement in the criminal 15justice system and the psychological damage caused by carceral 16settings.
