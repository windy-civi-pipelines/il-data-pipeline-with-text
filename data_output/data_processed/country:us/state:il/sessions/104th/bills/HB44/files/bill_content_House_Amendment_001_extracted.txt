Amend House Bill 44 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Community-Based Corrections Act. 6    Section 5. Purpose. The purpose of this Act is to create a 7transformative post-conviction model that reduces reliance on 8traditional incarceration for emerging adults by fostering 9partnerships between the Department of Corrections, the 10Department of Human Services, and nonprofit, community-based 11providers to implement restorative justice practices, 12workforce training, and mental health support. This Act 13recognizes that young adults aged 18 through 25 are more 14likely to be justice involved due to poverty, instability, 15trauma, and a lack of social and emotional services and 16support. Young adults who receive holistic, developmentally   10400HB0044ham001- 2 -LRB104 03575 RLC 22443 a1appropriate supports and services in a community setting 2continue educational pursuits, successfully enter the 3workforce, and are less likely to reoffend, thus increasing 4the welfare of the young adult and the community, rather than 5those who are incarcerated. This Act recognizes that the 6qualities that distinguish juveniles from adults do not 7disappear when an individual turns 18. They remain vulnerable 8to negative influences and outside peer pressures, including 9from their family and peers, and they have limited control 10over their own environment and lack the ability to extricate 11themselves from horrific, crime-producing settings. Because 12the characters of emerging adults are still being formed, 13their traits are less fixed and their actions are less likely 14to be evidence of a lack of rehabilitative potential. 15Accordingly, emerging adults are worthy of special care, 16investment, and consideration so as to prevent long-term 17involvement in the criminal justice system and the 18psychological damage caused by carceral settings. This policy 19is grounded in balanced restorative justice values and 20practices, that seek to improve community safety by 21considering the welfare of the emerging adult with a focus on 22connecting emerging adults to supports that address underlying 23root causes of behavior instead of punitive measures. 24    Section 10.
