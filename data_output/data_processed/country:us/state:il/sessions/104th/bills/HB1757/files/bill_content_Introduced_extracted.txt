Any 12person who willfully refuses to credit that savings to an 13owner who qualifies for the exemption is guilty of a Class B 14misdemeanor.15    When a homestead exemption has been granted under this 16Section and an applicant then becomes a resident of a facility 17licensed under the Assisted Living and Shared Housing Act, the 18Nursing Home Care Act, the Specialized Mental Health 19Rehabilitation Act of 2013, the ID/DD Community Care Act, or 20the MC/DD Act, the exemption shall be granted in subsequent 21years so long as the residence (i) continues to be occupied by 22the qualified applicant's spouse or (ii) if remaining 23unoccupied, is still owned by the qualified applicant for the 24homestead exemption.25    Beginning January 1, 1997, when an individual dies who 26would have qualified for an exemption under this Section, and   HB1757- 11 -LRB104 04820 HLH 14847 b1the surviving spouse does not independently qualify for this 2exemption because of age, the exemption under this Section 3shall be granted to the surviving spouse for the taxable year 4preceding and the taxable year of the death, provided that, 5except for age, the surviving spouse meets all other 6qualifications for the granting of this exemption for those 7years.8    When married persons maintain separate residences, the 9exemption provided for in this Section may be claimed by only 10one of such persons and for only one residence.11    For taxable year 1994 only, in counties having less than 123,000,000 inhabitants, to receive the exemption, a person 13shall submit an application by February 15, 1995 to the Chief 14County Assessment Officer of the county in which the property 15is located.
