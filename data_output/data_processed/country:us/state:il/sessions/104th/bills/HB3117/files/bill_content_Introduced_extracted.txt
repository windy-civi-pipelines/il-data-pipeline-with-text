For purposes of this subparagraph, 11        the taxpayer's separate taxable income shall be 12        determined as if the election provided by Section 13        243(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code had been in 14        effect for all such years;15            (F) Cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative 16        corporation or association, the taxable income of such 17        organization determined in accordance with the 18        provisions of Section 1381 through 1388 of the 19        Internal Revenue Code, but without regard to the 20        prohibition against offsetting losses from patronage 21        activities against income from nonpatronage 22        activities; except that a cooperative corporation or 23        association may make an election to follow its federal 24        income tax treatment of patronage losses and 25        nonpatronage losses. In the event such election is 26        made, such losses shall be computed and carried over   HB3117- 104 -LRB104 10027 HLH 20098 b1        in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of Section 2        207 of this Act and apportioned by the apportionment 3        factor reported by the cooperative on its Illinois 4        income tax return filed for the taxable year in which 5        the losses are incurred. The election shall be 6        effective for all taxable years with original returns 7        due on or after the date of the election. In addition, 8        the cooperative may file an amended return or returns, 9        as allowed under this Act, to provide that the 10        election shall be effective for losses incurred or 11        carried forward for taxable years occurring prior to 12        the date of the election. Once made, the election may 13        only be revoked upon approval of the Director. The 14        Department shall adopt rules setting forth 15        requirements for documenting the elections and any 16        resulting Illinois net loss and the standards to be 17        used by the Director in evaluating requests to revoke 18        elections. Public Act 96-932 is declaratory of 19        existing law; 20            (G) Subchapter S corporations. In the case of: (i) 21        a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 22        effect an election for the taxable year under Section 23        1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxable income 24        of such corporation determined in accordance with 25        Section 1363(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, except 26        that taxable income shall take into account those   HB3117- 105 -LRB104 10027 HLH 20098 b1        items which are required by Section 1363(b)(1) of the 2        Internal Revenue Code to be separately stated; and 3        (ii) a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 4        effect a federal election to opt out of the provisions 5        of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 and have 6        applied instead the prior federal Subchapter S rules 7        as in effect on July 1, 1982, the taxable income of 8        such corporation determined in accordance with the 9        federal Subchapter S rules as in effect on July 1, 10        1982; and11            (H) Partnerships. In the case of a partnership, 12        taxable income determined in accordance with Section 13        703 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that taxable 14        income shall take into account those items which are 15        required by Section 703(a)(1) to be separately stated 16        but which would be taken into account by an individual 17        in calculating his taxable income.18        (3) Recapture of business expenses on disposition of 19    asset or business. Notwithstanding any other law to the 20    contrary, if in prior years income from an asset or 21    business has been classified as business income and in a 22    later year is demonstrated to be non-business income, then 23    all expenses, without limitation, deducted in such later 24    year and in the 2 immediately preceding taxable years 25    related to that asset or business that generated the 26    non-business income shall be added back and recaptured as   HB3117- 106 -LRB104 10027 HLH 20098 b1    business income in the year of the disposition of the 2    asset or business. Such amount shall be apportioned to 3    Illinois using the greater of the apportionment fraction 4    computed for the business under Section 304 of this Act 5    for the taxable year or the average of the apportionment 6    fractions computed for the business under Section 304 of 7    this Act for the taxable year and for the 2 immediately 8    preceding taxable years.  9    (f) Valuation limitation amount.10        (1) In general. The valuation limitation amount 11    referred to in subsections (a)(2)(G), (c)(2)(I) and 12    (d)(2)(E) is an amount equal to:13            (A) The sum of the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 14        amounts (to the extent consisting of gain reportable 15        under the provisions of Section 1245 or 1250 of the 16        Internal Revenue Code) for all property in respect of 17        which such gain was reported for the taxable year; 18        plus19            (B) The lesser of (i) the sum of the pre-August 1, 20        1969 appreciation amounts (to the extent consisting of 21        capital gain) for all property in respect of which 22        such gain was reported for federal income tax purposes 23        for the taxable year, or (ii) the net capital gain for 24        the taxable year, reduced in either case by any amount 25        of such gain included in the amount determined under   HB3117- 107 -LRB104 10027 HLH 20098 b1        subsection (a)(2)(F) or (c)(2)(H).2        (2) Pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation amount.3            (A) If the fair market value of property referred 4        to in paragraph (1) was readily ascertainable on 5        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 6        amount for such property is the lesser of (i) the 7        excess of such fair market value over the taxpayer's 8        basis (for determining gain) for such property on that 9        date (determined under the Internal Revenue Code as in 10        effect on that date), or (ii) the total gain realized 11        and reportable for federal income tax purposes in 12        respect of the sale, exchange or other disposition of 13        such property.14            (B) If the fair market value of property referred 15        to in paragraph (1) was not readily ascertainable on 16        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 17        amount for such property is that amount which bears 18        the same ratio to the total gain reported in respect of 19        the property for federal income tax purposes for the 20        taxable year, as the number of full calendar months in 21        that part of the taxpayer's holding period for the 22        property ending July 31, 1969 bears to the number of 23        full calendar months in the taxpayer's entire holding 24        period for the property.25            (C) The Department shall prescribe such 26        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the   HB3117- 108 -LRB104 10027 HLH 20098 b1        purposes of this paragraph. 2    (g) Double deductions. Unless specifically provided 3otherwise, nothing in this Section shall permit the same item 4to be deducted more than once. 5    (h) Legislative intention. Except as expressly provided by 6this Section there shall be no modifications or limitations on 7the amounts of income, gain, loss or deduction taken into 8account in determining gross income, adjusted gross income or 9taxable income for federal income tax purposes for the taxable 10year, or in the amount of such items entering into the 11computation of base income and net income under this Act for 12such taxable year, whether in respect of property values as of 13August 1, 1969 or otherwise.14(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 15102-658, eff. 8-27-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-1112, eff. 1612-21-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23; 103-478, eff. 1-1-24; 103-592, 17Article 10, Section 10-900, eff. 6-7-24; 103-592, Article 170, 18Section 170-90, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24; 103-647, 19eff. 7-1-24; revised 8-20-24.) 20    Section 99.

The addition modification required by this 15        subparagraph shall be reduced to the extent that 16        dividends were included in base income of the unitary 17        group for the same taxable year and received by the 18        taxpayer or by a member of the taxpayer's unitary 19        business group (including amounts included in gross 20        income under Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal 21        Revenue Code and amounts included in gross income 22        under Section 78 of the Internal Revenue Code) with 23        respect to the stock of the same person to whom the 24        intangible expenses and costs were directly or 25        indirectly paid, incurred, or accrued.
