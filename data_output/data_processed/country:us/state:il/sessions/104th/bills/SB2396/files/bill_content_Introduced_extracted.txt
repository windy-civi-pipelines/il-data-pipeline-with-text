If the law enforcement officer does not 2    notify the Board within 30 days, the Board may set the 3    matter for hearing. If the matter is set for hearing, the 4    Board shall send the law enforcement officer the notice of 5    the date, time and location of the hearing. If the law 6    enforcement officer or counsel for the officer does 7    appear, at the Board's discretion, the hearing may proceed 8    or may be continued to a date and time agreed upon by all 9    parties. If on the date of the hearing, neither the law 10    enforcement officer nor counsel for the officer appears, 11    the Board may proceed with the hearing for default in 12    their absence. 13        (3) If the law enforcement officer fails to comply 14    with paragraph (2), all of the allegations contained in 15    the complaint shall be deemed admitted and the law 16    enforcement officer shall be decertified if, by a majority 17    vote of the Panel panel, the conduct charged in the 18    complaint is found to constitute sufficient grounds for 19    decertification under this Act.

The Board or 9    the law enforcement officer may request to have the 10    hearing suspended for up to 6 additional months for good 11    cause. This request may be renewed. For purposes of this 12    paragraph (4), "good cause" means an incident or 13    occurrence that is beyond the control of the requester and 14    that prevents the hearing from occurring, or holding the 15    hearing would impose an undue hardship or prejudice on the 16    requester. 17        (5) Surrender of certification or waiver.

The reason for 2    this extension must be documented. A law enforcement 3    officer shall be allowed to be employed as a full-time law 4    enforcement officer while the law enforcement officer 5    reactivation waiver is under review. 6        A law enforcement officer who is refused reactivation 7    or an employing agency of a law enforcement officer who is 8    refused reactivation under this Section may request a 9    hearing in accordance with the hearing procedures as 10    outlined in subsection (h) of Section 6.3 of this Act.11        If the Board seeks to deny reactivation to a law 12    enforcement officer due to issues unrelated to training or 13    employment, it must proceed to discretionary 14    decertification under Section 6.3. 15        The Board may refuse to re-activate the certification 16    of a law enforcement officer who was involuntarily 17    terminated for good cause by an employing agency for 18    conduct subject to decertification under this Act or 19    resigned or retired after receiving notice of a law 20    enforcement agency's investigation.21        (2) A law enforcement agency may place an officer who 22    is currently certified on inactive status by sending a 23    written request to the Board. A law enforcement officer 24    whose certificate has been placed on inactive status shall 25    not function as a law enforcement officer until the 26    officer has completed any requirements for reactivating   SB2396- 59 -LRB104 12152 RTM 22251 b1    the certificate as required by the Board. A request for 2    inactive status in this subsection shall be in writing, 3    accompanied by verifying documentation, and shall be 4    submitted to the Board with a copy to the chief 5    administrator of the law enforcement officer's current or 6    new employing agency.7        (3) Certification that has become inactive under 8    paragraph (2) of this subsection (b) shall be reactivated 9    by written notice from the law enforcement officer's 10    agency upon a showing that the law enforcement officer: 11    (i) is employed in a full-time law enforcement position 12    with the same law enforcement agency, and (ii) is not the 13    subject of a decertification proceeding, and (iii) meets 14    all other criteria for re-activation required by the 15    Board.16        (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3) of this subsection 17    (b), a law enforcement officer whose certification has 18    become inactive under paragraph (2) may have the officer's 19    employing agency submit a request for a waiver of training 20    requirements to the Board in writing and accompanied by 21    any verifying documentation. A grant of a waiver is within 22    the discretion of the Board. Within 7 days of receiving a 23    request for a waiver under this Section, the Board shall 24    notify the law enforcement officer and the chief 25    administrator of the law enforcement officer's employing 26    agency, whether the request has been granted, denied, or   SB2396- 60 -LRB104 12152 RTM 22251 b1    if the Board will take additional time for information. If 2    a A law enforcement agency whose request for a waiver 3    under this subsection is denied the law enforcement 4    officer, law enforcement agency, or both the law 5    enforcement officer and the law enforcement agency are is 6    entitled to request a review of the denial by the Board. 7    The law enforcement agency must request a review within 20 8    days of the waiver being denied. The burden of proof shall 9    be on the law enforcement agency or law enforcement 10    officer to show why the law enforcement officer is 11    entitled to a waiver of the legislatively required 12    training and eligibility requirements. 13    (c) No provision of this Section shall be construed to 14mean that a county corrections officer employed by a 15governmental agency at the time of the effective date of this 16amendatory Act, either as a probationary county corrections 17officer or as a permanent county corrections officer, shall 18require certification under the provisions of this Section. No 19provision of this Section shall be construed to apply to 20certification of elected county sheriffs.21    (d) Within 14 days, a law enforcement officer shall report 22to the Board: (1) any name change; (2) any change in 23employment; or (3) the filing of any criminal indictment or 24charges against the officer alleging that the officer 25committed any offense as enumerated in Section 6.1 of this 26Act.  SB2396- 61 -LRB104 12152 RTM 22251 b1    (e) All law enforcement officers must report the 2completion of the training requirements required in this Act 3in compliance with Section 8.4 of this Act.4    (e-1) Each employing law enforcement agency shall allow 5and provide an opportunity for a law enforcement officer to 6complete the mandated requirements in this Act. All mandated 7training shall be provided at no cost to the employees. 8Employees shall be paid for all time spent attending mandated 9training. 10    (e-2) Each agency, academy, or training provider shall 11maintain proof of a law enforcement officer's completion of 12legislatively required training in a format designated by the 13Board. The report of training shall be submitted to the Board 14within 30 days following completion of the training. A copy of 15the report shall be submitted to the law enforcement officer. 16Upon receipt of a properly completed report of training, the 17Board will make the appropriate entry into the training 18records of the law enforcement officer. 19    (f) This Section does not apply to part-time law 20enforcement officers or probationary part-time law enforcement 21officers.22    (g) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, 23the changes made to this Section by Public Act 101-652, Public 24Act 102-28, and Public Act 102-694 take effect July 1, 2022.25    (h) An individual who is not certified by the Board or 26whose certified status is inactive shall not function as a law   SB2396- 62 -LRB104 12152 RTM 22251 b1enforcement officer, be assigned the duties of a law 2enforcement officer by an employing law enforcement agency, or 3be authorized to carry firearms under the authority of the 4employer, except as otherwise authorized to carry a firearm 5under State or federal law. Sheriffs who are elected as of 6January 1, 2022 (the effective date of Public Act 101-652) are 7exempt from the requirement of certified status. Failure to be 8certified in accordance with this Act shall cause the officer 9to forfeit the officer's position.10    An employing law enforcement agency may not grant a person 11status as a law enforcement officer unless the person has been 12granted an active law enforcement officer certification by the 13Board.14    No provision of this Section shall be construed to mean 15that a county corrections officer employed by a governmental 16agency at the time of the effective date of this amendatory 17Act, either as a probationary county corrections officer or as 18a permanent county corrections officer, shall require 19certification under the provisions of this Section. No 20provision of this Section shall be construed to apply to 21certification of elected county sheriffs who are elected as of 22January 1, 2022 (the effective date of Public Act 101-652.) 23(Source: P.A. 102-28, eff. 6-25-21; 102-694, eff. 1-7-22; 24103-154, eff. 6-30-23; 103-389, eff. 1-1-24.) 25    (50 ILCS 705/8.2)  SB2396- 63 -LRB104 12152 RTM 22251 b1    Sec. 8.2.

If the law enforcement officer does not 2    notify the Board within 30 days, the Board may set the 3    matter for hearing. If the matter is set for hearing, the 4    Board shall send the law enforcement officer the notice of 5    the date, time and location of the hearing. If the law 6    enforcement officer or counsel for the officer does 7    appear, at the Board's discretion, the hearing may proceed 8    or may be continued to a date and time agreed upon by all 9    parties. If on the date of the hearing, neither the law 10    enforcement officer nor counsel for the officer appears, 11    the Board may proceed with the hearing for default in 12    their absence. 13        (3) If the law enforcement officer fails to comply 14    with paragraph (2), all of the allegations contained in 15    the complaint shall be deemed admitted and the law 16    enforcement officer shall be decertified if, by a majority 17    vote of the Panel panel, the conduct charged in the 18    complaint is found to constitute sufficient grounds for 19    decertification under this Act. Notice of the 20    decertification decision may be served by personal 21    delivery, by mail, or, at the discretion of the Board, by 22    electronic means as adopted by rule to the address or 23    email address specified by the law enforcement officer in 24    the officer's last communication with the Board.

The Board or 9    the law enforcement officer may request to have the 10    hearing suspended for up to 6 additional months for good 11    cause. This request may be renewed. For purposes of this 12    paragraph (4), "good cause" means an incident or 13    occurrence that is beyond the control of the requester and 14    that prevents the hearing from occurring, or holding the 15    hearing would impose an undue hardship or prejudice on the 16    requester. 17        (5) Surrender of certification or waiver.

Sheriffs who are elected as of January 1, 2022 25(the effective date of Public Act 101-652) are exempt from the 26requirement of certified status. Failure to be certified in   SB2396- 57 -LRB104 12152 RTM 22251 b1accordance with this Act shall cause the officer to forfeit 2the officer's position.3    An employing agency may not grant a person status as a law 4enforcement officer unless the person has been granted an 5active law enforcement officer certification by the Board.6    (b) Inactive status. A person who has an inactive law 7enforcement officer certification has no law enforcement 8authority.9        (1) A law enforcement officer's certification becomes 10    inactive 60 days after upon termination, resignation, 11    retirement, or separation from the officer's employing law 12    enforcement agency for any reason. The Board shall 13    re-activate a certification upon written application from 14    the law enforcement officer's law enforcement agency that 15    shows the law enforcement officer: (i) has accepted a 16    full-time law enforcement position with that law 17    enforcement agency, and (ii) is not the subject of a 18    decertification proceeding, and (iii) meets all other 19    criteria for re-activation required by the Board. The 20    Board may also establish special training requirements to 21    be completed as a condition for re-activation.22        The Board shall review a notice for reactivation from 23    a law enforcement agency and provide a response within 30 24    days. The Board may extend this review for no more than 25    additional 60 days if there is missing or incomplete 26    information about the law enforcement officer available to   SB2396- 58 -LRB104 12152 RTM 22251 b1    the Board sufficient to make a decision. The reason for 2    this extension must be documented. A law enforcement 3    officer shall be allowed to be employed as a full-time law 4    enforcement officer while the law enforcement officer 5    reactivation waiver is under review. 6        A law enforcement officer who is refused reactivation 7    or an employing agency of a law enforcement officer who is 8    refused reactivation under this Section may request a 9    hearing in accordance with the hearing procedures as 10    outlined in subsection (h) of Section 6.3 of this Act.11        If the Board seeks to deny reactivation to a law 12    enforcement officer due to issues unrelated to training or 13    employment, it must proceed to discretionary 14    decertification under Section 6.3. 15        The Board may refuse to re-activate the certification 16    of a law enforcement officer who was involuntarily 17    terminated for good cause by an employing agency for 18    conduct subject to decertification under this Act or 19    resigned or retired after receiving notice of a law 20    enforcement agency's investigation.21        (2) A law enforcement agency may place an officer who 22    is currently certified on inactive status by sending a 23    written request to the Board. A law enforcement officer 24    whose certificate has been placed on inactive status shall 25    not function as a law enforcement officer until the 26    officer has completed any requirements for reactivating   SB2396- 59 -LRB104 12152 RTM 22251 b1    the certificate as required by the Board. A request for 2    inactive status in this subsection shall be in writing, 3    accompanied by verifying documentation, and shall be 4    submitted to the Board with a copy to the chief 5    administrator of the law enforcement officer's current or 6    new employing agency.7        (3) Certification that has become inactive under 8    paragraph (2) of this subsection (b) shall be reactivated 9    by written notice from the law enforcement officer's 10    agency upon a showing that the law enforcement officer: 11    (i) is employed in a full-time law enforcement position 12    with the same law enforcement agency, and (ii) is not the 13    subject of a decertification proceeding, and (iii) meets 14    all other criteria for re-activation required by the 15    Board.16        (4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3) of this subsection 17    (b), a law enforcement officer whose certification has 18    become inactive under paragraph (2) may have the officer's 19    employing agency submit a request for a waiver of training 20    requirements to the Board in writing and accompanied by 21    any verifying documentation. A grant of a waiver is within 22    the discretion of the Board. Within 7 days of receiving a 23    request for a waiver under this Section, the Board shall 24    notify the law enforcement officer and the chief 25    administrator of the law enforcement officer's employing 26    agency, whether the request has been granted, denied, or   SB2396- 60 -LRB104 12152 RTM 22251 b1    if the Board will take additional time for information. If 2    a A law enforcement agency whose request for a waiver 3    under this subsection is denied the law enforcement 4    officer, law enforcement agency, or both the law 5    enforcement officer and the law enforcement agency are is 6    entitled to request a review of the denial by the Board. 7    The law enforcement agency must request a review within 20 8    days of the waiver being denied. The burden of proof shall 9    be on the law enforcement agency or law enforcement 10    officer to show why the law enforcement officer is 11    entitled to a waiver of the legislatively required 12    training and eligibility requirements. 13    (c) No provision of this Section shall be construed to 14mean that a county corrections officer employed by a 15governmental agency at the time of the effective date of this 16amendatory Act, either as a probationary county corrections 17officer or as a permanent county corrections officer, shall 18require certification under the provisions of this Section. No 19provision of this Section shall be construed to apply to 20certification of elected county sheriffs.21    (d) Within 14 days, a law enforcement officer shall report 22to the Board: (1) any name change; (2) any change in 23employment; or (3) the filing of any criminal indictment or 24charges against the officer alleging that the officer 25committed any offense as enumerated in Section 6.1 of this 26Act.  SB2396- 61 -LRB104 12152 RTM 22251 b1    (e) All law enforcement officers must report the 2completion of the training requirements required in this Act 3in compliance with Section 8.4 of this Act.4    (e-1) Each employing law enforcement agency shall allow 5and provide an opportunity for a law enforcement officer to 6complete the mandated requirements in this Act. All mandated 7training shall be provided at no cost to the employees. 8Employees shall be paid for all time spent attending mandated 9training. 10    (e-2) Each agency, academy, or training provider shall 11maintain proof of a law enforcement officer's completion of 12legislatively required training in a format designated by the 13Board. The report of training shall be submitted to the Board 14within 30 days following completion of the training. A copy of 15the report shall be submitted to the law enforcement officer. 16Upon receipt of a properly completed report of training, the 17Board will make the appropriate entry into the training 18records of the law enforcement officer. 19    (f) This Section does not apply to part-time law 20enforcement officers or probationary part-time law enforcement 21officers.22    (g) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, 23the changes made to this Section by Public Act 101-652, Public 24Act 102-28, and Public Act 102-694 take effect July 1, 2022.25    (h) An individual who is not certified by the Board or 26whose certified status is inactive shall not function as a law   SB2396- 62 -LRB104 12152 RTM 22251 b1enforcement officer, be assigned the duties of a law 2enforcement officer by an employing law enforcement agency, or 3be authorized to carry firearms under the authority of the 4employer, except as otherwise authorized to carry a firearm 5under State or federal law. Sheriffs who are elected as of 6January 1, 2022 (the effective date of Public Act 101-652) are 7exempt from the requirement of certified status. Failure to be 8certified in accordance with this Act shall cause the officer 9to forfeit the officer's position.10    An employing law enforcement agency may not grant a person 11status as a law enforcement officer unless the person has been 12granted an active law enforcement officer certification by the 13Board.14    No provision of this Section shall be construed to mean 15that a county corrections officer employed by a governmental 16agency at the time of the effective date of this amendatory 17Act, either as a probationary county corrections officer or as 18a permanent county corrections officer, shall require 19certification under the provisions of this Section.
