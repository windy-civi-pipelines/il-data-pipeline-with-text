"Child pornography" does not 10    include images or materials in which the creator of the 11    image or materials is the sole subject of the depiction. 12    (g) Re-enactment; findings; purposes.13        (1) The General Assembly finds and declares that:14            (i) Section 50-5 of Public Act 88-680, effective 15        January 1, 1995, contained provisions amending the 16        child pornography statute, Section 11-20.1 of the 17        Criminal Code of 1961. Section 50-5 also contained 18        other provisions.19            (ii) In addition, Public Act 88-680 was entitled 20        "AN ACT to create a Safe Neighborhoods Law". (A) 21        Article 5 was entitled JUVENILE JUSTICE and amended 22        the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. (B) Article 15 was 23        entitled GANGS and amended various provisions of the 24        Criminal Code of 1961 and the Unified Code of 25        Corrections. (C) Article 20 was entitled ALCOHOL ABUSE 26        and amended various provisions of the Illinois Vehicle   SB2361- 49 -LRB104 03861 RLC 13885 b1        Code. (D) Article 25 was entitled DRUG ABUSE and 2        amended the Cannabis Control Act and the Illinois 3        Controlled Substances Act. (E) Article 30 was entitled 4        FIREARMS and amended the Criminal Code of 1961 and the 5        Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. (F) Article 35 6        amended the Criminal Code of 1961, the Rights of Crime 7        Victims and Witnesses Act, and the Unified Code of 8        Corrections.

(I) Article 50 amended the WIC Vendor 16        Management Act, the Firearm Owners Identification Card 17        Act, the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Criminal Code 18        of 1961, the Wrongs to Children Act, and the Unified 19        Code of Corrections.20            (iii) On September 22, 1998, the Third District 21        Appellate Court in People v. Dainty, 701 N.E. 2d 118, 22        ruled that Public Act 88-680 violates the single 23        subject clause of the Illinois Constitution (Article 24        IV, Section 8 (d)) and was unconstitutional in its 25        entirety. As of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 26        was prepared, People v. Dainty was still subject to   SB2361- 50 -LRB104 03861 RLC 13885 b1        appeal.2            (iv) Child pornography is a vital concern to the 3        people of this State and the validity of future 4        prosecutions under the child pornography statute of 5        the Criminal Code of 1961 is in grave doubt.6        (2) It is the purpose of this amendatory Act of 1999 to 7    prevent or minimize any problems relating to prosecutions 8    for child pornography that may result from challenges to 9    the constitutional validity of Public Act 88-680 by 10    re-enacting the Section relating to child pornography that 11    was included in Public Act 88-680.12        (3) This amendatory Act of 1999 re-enacts Section 13    11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961, as it has been 14    amended. This re-enactment is intended to remove any 15    question as to the validity or content of that Section; it 16    is not intended to supersede any other Public Act that 17    amends the text of the Section as set forth in this 18    amendatory Act of 1999. The material is shown as existing 19    text (i.e., without underscoring) because, as of the time 20    this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty 21    was subject to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.22        (4) The re-enactment by this amendatory Act of 1999 of 23    Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 relating to 24    child pornography that was amended by Public Act 88-680 is 25    not intended, and shall not be construed, to imply that 26    Public Act 88-680 is invalid or to limit or impair any   SB2361- 51 -LRB104 03861 RLC 13885 b1    legal argument concerning whether those provisions were 2    substantially re-enacted by other Public Acts.3(Source: P.A. 102-567, eff. 1-1-22; 103-825, eff. 1-1-25.) 4    (720 ILCS 5/11-25)5    Sec. 11-25.

As used in this Section, "child" means a person under 17 20years of age. 21    (a-5) It is not a defense to a violation of this Section 22that the accused reasonably believed the child to be 17 years 23of age or over. 24    (b) Sentence. Grooming is a Class 4 felony. 25(Source: P.A. 102-676, eff. 6-1-22.)   SB2361- 52 -LRB104 03861 RLC 13885 b1    (720 ILCS 5/11-27 new)2    Sec. 11-27.

The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 is 19amended by changing Section 116-2.1 as follows: 20    (725 ILCS 5/116-2.1)21    Sec. 116-2.1.

Evidence of such may 3include, but is not limited to:4        (1) certified records of federal or State court 5    proceedings which demonstrate that the defendant was a 6    victim of a trafficker charged with a trafficking offense 7    under Section 10-9 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 8    Criminal Code of 2012, or under 22 U.S.C.

Dainty, 701 N.E. 2d 118, 22        ruled that Public Act 88-680 violates the single 23        subject clause of the Illinois Constitution (Article 24        IV, Section 8 (d)) and was unconstitutional in its 25        entirety. As of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 26        was prepared, People v. Dainty was still subject to   SB2361- 50 -LRB104 03861 RLC 13885 b1        appeal.2            (iv) Child pornography is a vital concern to the 3        people of this State and the validity of future 4        prosecutions under the child pornography statute of 5        the Criminal Code of 1961 is in grave doubt.6        (2) It is the purpose of this amendatory Act of 1999 to 7    prevent or minimize any problems relating to prosecutions 8    for child pornography that may result from challenges to 9    the constitutional validity of Public Act 88-680 by 10    re-enacting the Section relating to child pornography that 11    was included in Public Act 88-680.12        (3) This amendatory Act of 1999 re-enacts Section 13    11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961, as it has been 14    amended. This re-enactment is intended to remove any 15    question as to the validity or content of that Section; it 16    is not intended to supersede any other Public Act that 17    amends the text of the Section as set forth in this 18    amendatory Act of 1999. The material is shown as existing 19    text (i.e., without underscoring) because, as of the time 20    this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty 21    was subject to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.22        (4) The re-enactment by this amendatory Act of 1999 of 23    Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 relating to 24    child pornography that was amended by Public Act 88-680 is 25    not intended, and shall not be construed, to imply that 26    Public Act 88-680 is invalid or to limit or impair any   SB2361- 51 -LRB104 03861 RLC 13885 b1    legal argument concerning whether those provisions were 2    substantially re-enacted by other Public Acts.3(Source: P.A. 102-567, eff. 1-1-22; 103-825, eff. 1-1-25.) 4    (720 ILCS 5/11-25)5    Sec. 11-25.

Grooming is a Class 4 felony. 25(Source: P.A. 102-676, eff. 6-1-22.)   SB2361- 52 -LRB104 03861 RLC 13885 b1    (720 ILCS 5/11-27 new)2    Sec. 11-27.
