If based on his review the Comptroller has reason 7to believe that such transaction is not in accordance with the 8law, he shall refuse to draw a warrant.9    (f) Where the Comptroller refuses to draw a warrant 10pursuant to this Section, he shall maintain separate records 11of such transactions.12    (g) State agencies shall have the principal responsibility 13for the preaudit of their encumbrances, expenditures, and 14other transactions as otherwise required by law.15(Source: P.A. 103-266, eff. 1-1-24.) 16    (15 ILCS 405/9.03)  (from Ch. 15, par. 209.03)17    Sec. 9.03.

If a State agency pays a vendor more times 7than the allowable limit in a single fiscal year without using 8direct deposit, the Comptroller may charge the vendor a 9processing fee of $2.50 per paper warrant. The processing fee 10may be withheld from the vendor's payment. The amount 11collected from the processing fee shall be deposited into the 12Comptroller's Administrative Fund. The Office of the 13Comptroller shall define "allowable limit" in the 14Comptroller's Statewide Accounting Management System (SAMS) 15manual, except that the allowable limit shall not be less than 1630 paper warrants. The Office of the Comptroller shall also 17provide reasonable notice to all State agencies of the 18allowable limit of paper warrants.19    (c-1) All State payments to an entity from a payroll or 20retirement voluntary deduction must be made through direct 21deposit.

The processing fee may be withheld 25from the entity's payment or billed to the entity at a later 26date.

The 2Comptroller shall provide reasonable notice to all entities 3impacted by this requirement. Any new entities that receive a 4payroll or retirement voluntary deduction must sign up for 5direct deposit during the application process. 6    (c-2) The detail information, such as names, identifiers, 7and amounts, associated with a State payment to an entity from 8a payroll or retirement voluntary deduction must be retrieved 9by the entity from the Comptroller's designated Internet 10website or an electronic alternative approved by the 11Comptroller. If the entity requires the Comptroller to mail 12the detail information, the Comptroller may charge the entity 13a processing fee up to $25.00 per mailing. Any processing fee 14will be billed to the entity at a later date. The amount 15collected from the processing fee shall be deposited into the 16Comptroller's Administrative Fund. The Comptroller shall 17provide reasonable notice to all entities impacted by this 18requirement. 19    (d) State employees covered by provisions in collective 20bargaining agreements that do not require direct deposit of 21paychecks are exempt from this mandate. No later than 60 days 22after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 97th 23General Assembly, all State agencies must provide to the 24Office of the Comptroller a list of employees that are exempt 25under this subsection (d) from the direct deposit mandate. In 26addition, a State employee or vendor may file a hardship   HB2746- 8 -LRB104 10669 HLH 20748 b1petition with the Office of the Comptroller requesting an 2exemption from the direct deposit mandate under this Section. 3A hardship petition shall be made available for download on 4the Comptroller's official Internet website. 5    (e) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, 6the direct deposit of State payments under this Section for an 7employee's payroll, an employee's expense reimbursement, or a 8State vendor's payment does not authorize the State to 9automatically withdraw funds from those accounts.10    (f) For the purposes of this Section, "vendor" means a 11non-governmental entity with a taxpayer identification number 12issued by the Social Security Administration or Internal 13Revenue Service that receives payments through the 14Comptroller's commercial system. The term does not include 15State agencies.16    (g) The requirements of this Section do not apply to the 17legislative or judicial branches of State government. 18(Source: P.A. 97-348, eff. 8-12-11; 97-993, eff. 9-16-12; 1998-463, eff. 8-16-13; 98-1043, eff. 8-25-14.) 20    Section 10.
