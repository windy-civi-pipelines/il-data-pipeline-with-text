Prohibited and voidable transfers and liens.   HB0030- 7 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1    (a)(1) A preference is a transfer of any of the property of 2a company to or for the benefit of a creditor, for or on 3account of an antecedent debt, made or suffered by the company 4within 2 years before the filing of a complaint under this 5Article, the effect of which may be to enable the creditor to 6obtain a greater percentage of this debt than another creditor 7of the same class would receive.8    (2) Any preference may be avoided by the Director as 9rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator if:10        (A) the company was insolvent at the time of the 11    transfer; and12        (B) the transfer was made within 4 months before the 13    filing of the complaint; or the creditor receiving it was 14    (i) an officer, or any employee or attorney or other 15    person who was in fact in a position of comparable 16    influence in the company to an officer whether or not that 17    person held such a position, (ii) any shareholder holding, 18    directly or indirectly, more than 5% of any class of any 19    equity security issued by the company, or (iii) any other 20    person, firm, corporation, association, or aggregation of 21    individuals with whom the company did not deal at arm's 22    length.23    (3) Where the preference is voidable, the Director as 24rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator may recover the 25property or, if it has been converted, its value from any 26person who has received or converted the property; except   HB0030- 8 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1where a bona fide purchaser or lienor has given less than fair 2equivalent value, the purchaser or lienor shall have a lien 3upon the property to the extent of the consideration actually 4given. Where a preference by way of lien or security title is 5voidable, the court may on due notice order the lien or title 6to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, in which event 7the lien or title shall pass to the Director as rehabilitator 8or liquidator.9    (b)(1) A transfer of property other than real property 10shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes so far 11perfected that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or 12equitable proceedings on a simple contract could become 13superior to the rights of the transferee.14    (2) A transfer of real property shall be deemed to be made 15or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no 16subsequent bona fide purchaser from the company could obtain 17rights superior to the rights of the transferee.18    (3) A transfer that creates an equitable lien shall not be 19deemed to be perfected if there are available means by which a 20legal lien could be created.21    (4) A transfer not perfected before the filing of a 22complaint shall be deemed to be made immediately before the 23filing of the complaint.24    (5) The provisions of this subsection apply whether or not 25there are or were creditors who might have obtained liens or 26persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.  HB0030- 9 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1    (c) For purposes of this Section:2        (1) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable 3    proceedings upon a simple contract is one arising in the 4    ordinary course of the proceedings upon the entry or 5    docketing of a judgment or decree, or upon attachment, 6    garnishment, execution, or like process, whether before, 7    upon, or after judgment or decree and whether before or 8    upon levy. It does not include liens that, under 9    applicable law, are given a special priority over other 10    liens that are prior in time.11        (2) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable 12    proceedings could become superior to the rights of a 13    transferee, or a purchaser could obtain rights superior to 14    the rights of a transferee within the meaning of 15    subsection (b) of this Section, if such consequences would 16    follow only from the lien or purchase itself, or from the 17    lien or purchase followed by any step wholly within the 18    control of the respective lienholder or purchaser, with or 19    without the aid of ministerial action by public officials. 20    A lien could not, however, become superior and a purchase 21    could not create superior rights for the purpose of 22    subsection (b) of this Section through any acts subsequent 23    to an obtaining of the lien or subsequent to a purchase 24    that requires the agreement or concurrence of any third 25    party or that requires any further judicial action or 26    ruling.  HB0030- 10 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1    (d) A transfer of property for or on account of a new and 2contemporaneous consideration which is deemed under subsection 3(b) of this Section to be made or suffered after the transfer 4because of delay in perfecting it does not thereby become a 5transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if any acts 6required by the applicable law to be performed in order to 7perfect the transfer as against liens or bona fide purchasers' 8rights are performed within 21 days or any period expressly 9allowed by the law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a 10future loan, if the loan is actually made, or a transfer that 11becomes security for a future loan, shall have the same effect 12as a transfer for or on account of a new and contemporaneous 13consideration.14    (e) If any lien deemed voidable under part (2) of 15subsection (a) of this Section has been dissolved by the 16furnishing of a bond or other obligation, the surety on which 17has been indemnified directly or indirectly by the transfer of 18or the creation of a lien upon any property of a company before 19the filing of a complaint under this Article, the indemnifying 20transfer or lien shall also be deemed voidable.21    (f) The property affected by any lien deemed voidable 22under subsections (a) and (e) of this Section shall be 23discharged from the lien, and that property and any of the 24indemnifying property transferred to or for the benefit of a 25surety shall pass to the Director as rehabilitator or 26liquidator, except that the court may, on due notice, order   HB0030- 11 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1any such lien to be preserved for the benefit of the estate and 2the court may direct that such conveyance be executed as may be 3proper or adequate to evidence the title of the Director as 4rehabilitator or liquidator.5    (g) The court shall have summary jurisdiction over any 6proceeding by the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or 7conservator to hear and determine the rights of any parties 8under this Section. Reasonable notice of any hearings in the 9proceeding shall be given to all parties in interest, 10including the obligee of a releasing bond or other life 11obligation. Where an order is entered for the recovery of 12indemnifying property in kind or for the avoidance of an 13indemnifying lien, the court, upon application of any party in 14interest, shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of 15the property or lien, and if the value is less than the amount 16for which the property is indemnity or than the amount of the 17lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the 18property or lien upon payment of its value, as ascertained by 19the court, to the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or 20conservator, within such reasonable times as the court shall 21fix.22    (h) The liability of the surety under the releasing bond 23or other similar obligation shall be discharged to the extent 24of the value of the indemnifying property recovered or the 25indemnifying lien nullified and avoided by the Director as 26rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator. Where the property   HB0030- 12 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1is retained under subsection (g) of this Section, the 2liability shall be discharged to the extent of the amount paid 3to the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator.4    (i) If a creditor has been preferred and thereafter in 5good faith gives the company further credit without security 6of any kind, for property which becomes a part of the company's 7estate, the amount of the new credit remaining unpaid at the 8time of the petition may be set off against the preference 9which would otherwise be recoverable from the creditor.10    (j) If a company shall, directly or indirectly, within 4 11months before the filing of a complaint under this Article, or 12at any time in contemplation of such a proceeding, pay money or 13transfer property to any attorney for services rendered or to 14be rendered, the transactions may be examined by the court on 15its own motion or shall be examined by the court on petition of 16the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator and 17shall be held valid only to the extent of a reasonable amount 18to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered 19by the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator 20for the benefit of the estate provided that where the attorney 21is in a position of influence in the company or an affiliate 22thereof payment of any money or the transfer of any property to 23the attorney for services rendered or to be rendered shall be 24governed by item (B) of part (2) of subsection (a) of this 25Section.26    (k)(1) An officer, director, manager, employee,   HB0030- 13 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1shareholder, member, subscriber, attorney, or other person 2acting on behalf of the company who knowingly participates in 3giving any preference when that officer, director, manager, 4employee, shareholder, member, subscriber, attorney, or other 5person has reasonable cause to believe the company is or is 6about to become insolvent at the time of the preference shall 7be personally liable to the Director as rehabilitator, 8liquidator, or conservator for the amount of the preference. 9There is a reasonable cause to so believe if the transfer was 10made within 4 months before the date of filing of the 11complaint.12    (2) A person receiving any property from the company or 13the benefit thereof as a preference voidable under subsection 14(a) of this Section shall be personally liable therefor and 15shall be bound to account to the Director as rehabilitator, 16liquidator, or conservator.17    (3) Nothing in this Section shall prejudice any other 18claim by the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or 19conservator against any person.20    (l) For purposes of this Section, the company is presumed 21to have been insolvent on and during the 4 month period 22immediately preceding the date of the filing of the complaint.23    (m) The Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or 24conservator may not avoid a transfer under this Section to the 25extent that the transfer was:26        (A) Intended by the company and the creditor to or for   HB0030- 14 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1    whose benefit the transfer was made to be a 2    contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the 3    company, and was in fact a substantially contemporaneous 4    exchange; or5        (B) In payment of a debt incurred by the company in the 6    ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the 7    company and the transferee; made in the ordinary course of 8    business or financial affairs of the company and the 9    transferee; and made according to ordinary business terms;10        (C) In the case of a transfer by a company where the 11    Director has determined that an event described in Section 12    35A-25 or 35A-30 has occurred, specifically approved by 13    the Director in writing pursuant to this subsection, 14    whether or not the company is in receivership under this 15    Article. Upon approval by the Director, such a transfer 16    cannot later be found to constitute a prohibited or 17    voidable transfer based solely upon a deviation from the 18    statutory payment priorities established by law for any 19    subsequent receivership; or 20        (D) Of money or other property arising under or in 21    connection with any Federal Home Loan Bank security 22    agreement or any pledge, security, collateral or guarantee 23    agreement, or any other similar arrangement or credit 24    enhancement relating to a Federal Home Loan Bank security 25    agreement. 26    (n) The Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or   HB0030- 15 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1conservator may avoid any transfer of or lien upon the 2property of a company that the estate of the company or a 3policyholder, creditor, member, or stockholder of the company 4may have avoided, and the Director as rehabilitator, 5liquidator, or conservator may recover and collect the 6property so transferred or its value from the person to whom it 7was transferred unless the property was transferred to a bona 8fide holder for value before the filing of the complaint.

Prohibited and voidable transfers and liens.   HB0030- 7 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1    (a)(1) A preference is a transfer of any of the property of 2a company to or for the benefit of a creditor, for or on 3account of an antecedent debt, made or suffered by the company 4within 2 years before the filing of a complaint under this 5Article, the effect of which may be to enable the creditor to 6obtain a greater percentage of this debt than another creditor 7of the same class would receive.8    (2) Any preference may be avoided by the Director as 9rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator if:10        (A) the company was insolvent at the time of the 11    transfer; and12        (B) the transfer was made within 4 months before the 13    filing of the complaint; or the creditor receiving it was 14    (i) an officer, or any employee or attorney or other 15    person who was in fact in a position of comparable 16    influence in the company to an officer whether or not that 17    person held such a position, (ii) any shareholder holding, 18    directly or indirectly, more than 5% of any class of any 19    equity security issued by the company, or (iii) any other 20    person, firm, corporation, association, or aggregation of 21    individuals with whom the company did not deal at arm's 22    length.23    (3) Where the preference is voidable, the Director as 24rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator may recover the 25property or, if it has been converted, its value from any 26person who has received or converted the property; except   HB0030- 8 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1where a bona fide purchaser or lienor has given less than fair 2equivalent value, the purchaser or lienor shall have a lien 3upon the property to the extent of the consideration actually 4given. Where a preference by way of lien or security title is 5voidable, the court may on due notice order the lien or title 6to be preserved for the benefit of the estate, in which event 7the lien or title shall pass to the Director as rehabilitator 8or liquidator.9    (b)(1) A transfer of property other than real property 10shall be deemed to be made or suffered when it becomes so far 11perfected that no subsequent lien obtainable by legal or 12equitable proceedings on a simple contract could become 13superior to the rights of the transferee.14    (2) A transfer of real property shall be deemed to be made 15or suffered when it becomes so far perfected that no 16subsequent bona fide purchaser from the company could obtain 17rights superior to the rights of the transferee.18    (3) A transfer that creates an equitable lien shall not be 19deemed to be perfected if there are available means by which a 20legal lien could be created.21    (4) A transfer not perfected before the filing of a 22complaint shall be deemed to be made immediately before the 23filing of the complaint.24    (5) The provisions of this subsection apply whether or not 25there are or were creditors who might have obtained liens or 26persons who might have become bona fide purchasers.  HB0030- 9 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1    (c) For purposes of this Section:2        (1) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable 3    proceedings upon a simple contract is one arising in the 4    ordinary course of the proceedings upon the entry or 5    docketing of a judgment or decree, or upon attachment, 6    garnishment, execution, or like process, whether before, 7    upon, or after judgment or decree and whether before or 8    upon levy. It does not include liens that, under 9    applicable law, are given a special priority over other 10    liens that are prior in time.11        (2) A lien obtainable by legal or equitable 12    proceedings could become superior to the rights of a 13    transferee, or a purchaser could obtain rights superior to 14    the rights of a transferee within the meaning of 15    subsection (b) of this Section, if such consequences would 16    follow only from the lien or purchase itself, or from the 17    lien or purchase followed by any step wholly within the 18    control of the respective lienholder or purchaser, with or 19    without the aid of ministerial action by public officials. 20    A lien could not, however, become superior and a purchase 21    could not create superior rights for the purpose of 22    subsection (b) of this Section through any acts subsequent 23    to an obtaining of the lien or subsequent to a purchase 24    that requires the agreement or concurrence of any third 25    party or that requires any further judicial action or 26    ruling.  HB0030- 10 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1    (d) A transfer of property for or on account of a new and 2contemporaneous consideration which is deemed under subsection 3(b) of this Section to be made or suffered after the transfer 4because of delay in perfecting it does not thereby become a 5transfer for or on account of an antecedent debt if any acts 6required by the applicable law to be performed in order to 7perfect the transfer as against liens or bona fide purchasers' 8rights are performed within 21 days or any period expressly 9allowed by the law, whichever is less. A transfer to secure a 10future loan, if the loan is actually made, or a transfer that 11becomes security for a future loan, shall have the same effect 12as a transfer for or on account of a new and contemporaneous 13consideration.14    (e) If any lien deemed voidable under part (2) of 15subsection (a) of this Section has been dissolved by the 16furnishing of a bond or other obligation, the surety on which 17has been indemnified directly or indirectly by the transfer of 18or the creation of a lien upon any property of a company before 19the filing of a complaint under this Article, the indemnifying 20transfer or lien shall also be deemed voidable.21    (f) The property affected by any lien deemed voidable 22under subsections (a) and (e) of this Section shall be 23discharged from the lien, and that property and any of the 24indemnifying property transferred to or for the benefit of a 25surety shall pass to the Director as rehabilitator or 26liquidator, except that the court may, on due notice, order   HB0030- 11 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1any such lien to be preserved for the benefit of the estate and 2the court may direct that such conveyance be executed as may be 3proper or adequate to evidence the title of the Director as 4rehabilitator or liquidator.5    (g) The court shall have summary jurisdiction over any 6proceeding by the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or 7conservator to hear and determine the rights of any parties 8under this Section. Reasonable notice of any hearings in the 9proceeding shall be given to all parties in interest, 10including the obligee of a releasing bond or other life 11obligation. Where an order is entered for the recovery of 12indemnifying property in kind or for the avoidance of an 13indemnifying lien, the court, upon application of any party in 14interest, shall in the same proceeding ascertain the value of 15the property or lien, and if the value is less than the amount 16for which the property is indemnity or than the amount of the 17lien, the transferee or lienholder may elect to retain the 18property or lien upon payment of its value, as ascertained by 19the court, to the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or 20conservator, within such reasonable times as the court shall 21fix.22    (h) The liability of the surety under the releasing bond 23or other similar obligation shall be discharged to the extent 24of the value of the indemnifying property recovered or the 25indemnifying lien nullified and avoided by the Director as 26rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator. Where the property   HB0030- 12 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1is retained under subsection (g) of this Section, the 2liability shall be discharged to the extent of the amount paid 3to the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator.4    (i) If a creditor has been preferred and thereafter in 5good faith gives the company further credit without security 6of any kind, for property which becomes a part of the company's 7estate, the amount of the new credit remaining unpaid at the 8time of the petition may be set off against the preference 9which would otherwise be recoverable from the creditor.10    (j) If a company shall, directly or indirectly, within 4 11months before the filing of a complaint under this Article, or 12at any time in contemplation of such a proceeding, pay money or 13transfer property to any attorney for services rendered or to 14be rendered, the transactions may be examined by the court on 15its own motion or shall be examined by the court on petition of 16the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator and 17shall be held valid only to the extent of a reasonable amount 18to be determined by the court, and the excess may be recovered 19by the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator 20for the benefit of the estate provided that where the attorney 21is in a position of influence in the company or an affiliate 22thereof payment of any money or the transfer of any property to 23the attorney for services rendered or to be rendered shall be 24governed by item (B) of part (2) of subsection (a) of this 25Section.26    (k)(1) An officer, director, manager, employee,   HB0030- 13 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1shareholder, member, subscriber, attorney, or other person 2acting on behalf of the company who knowingly participates in 3giving any preference when that officer, director, manager, 4employee, shareholder, member, subscriber, attorney, or other 5person has reasonable cause to believe the company is or is 6about to become insolvent at the time of the preference shall 7be personally liable to the Director as rehabilitator, 8liquidator, or conservator for the amount of the preference. 9There is a reasonable cause to so believe if the transfer was 10made within 4 months before the date of filing of the 11complaint.12    (2) A person receiving any property from the company or 13the benefit thereof as a preference voidable under subsection 14(a) of this Section shall be personally liable therefor and 15shall be bound to account to the Director as rehabilitator, 16liquidator, or conservator.17    (3) Nothing in this Section shall prejudice any other 18claim by the Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or 19conservator against any person.20    (l) For purposes of this Section, the company is presumed 21to have been insolvent on and during the 4 month period 22immediately preceding the date of the filing of the complaint.23    (m) The Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or 24conservator may not avoid a transfer under this Section to the 25extent that the transfer was:26        (A) Intended by the company and the creditor to or for   HB0030- 14 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1    whose benefit the transfer was made to be a 2    contemporaneous exchange for new value given to the 3    company, and was in fact a substantially contemporaneous 4    exchange; or5        (B) In payment of a debt incurred by the company in the 6    ordinary course of business or financial affairs of the 7    company and the transferee; made in the ordinary course of 8    business or financial affairs of the company and the 9    transferee; and made according to ordinary business terms;10        (C) In the case of a transfer by a company where the 11    Director has determined that an event described in Section 12    35A-25 or 35A-30 has occurred, specifically approved by 13    the Director in writing pursuant to this subsection, 14    whether or not the company is in receivership under this 15    Article. Upon approval by the Director, such a transfer 16    cannot later be found to constitute a prohibited or 17    voidable transfer based solely upon a deviation from the 18    statutory payment priorities established by law for any 19    subsequent receivership; or 20        (D) Of money or other property arising under or in 21    connection with any Federal Home Loan Bank security 22    agreement or any pledge, security, collateral or guarantee 23    agreement, or any other similar arrangement or credit 24    enhancement relating to a Federal Home Loan Bank security 25    agreement. 26    (n) The Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or   HB0030- 15 -LRB104 02886 LNS 12896 b1conservator may avoid any transfer of or lien upon the 2property of a company that the estate of the company or a 3policyholder, creditor, member, or stockholder of the company 4may have avoided, and the Director as rehabilitator, 5liquidator, or conservator may recover and collect the 6property so transferred or its value from the person to whom it 7was transferred unless the property was transferred to a bona 8fide holder for value before the filing of the complaint. The 9Director as rehabilitator, liquidator, or conservator shall be 10deemed a creditor for purposes of pursuing claims under the 11Uniform Voidable Transactions Fraudulent Transfer Act.12    (o) Notwithstanding any provision of this Article to the 13contrary, a Federal Home Loan Bank shall not be stayed, 14enjoined, or prohibited from exercising or enforcing any right 15or cause of action regarding collateral pledged under any 16security agreement or any pledge, security, collateral or 17guarantee agreement, or any other similar arrangement or 18credit enhancement relating to a Federal Home Loan Bank 19security agreement. 20(Source: P.A. 100-89, eff. 8-11-17.) 21    Section 10.
