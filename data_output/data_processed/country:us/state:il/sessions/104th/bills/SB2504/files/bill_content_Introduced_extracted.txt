The allotment shall be apportioned among the 21several counties in the State in the proportion which the 22total mileage of township or district roads in the respective 23counties bears to the total mileage of all township and 24district roads in the State. Funds allotted to the respective 25counties for the use of road districts therein shall be 26allocated to the several road districts in the county in the   SB2504- 11 -LRB104 12238 RTM 22345 b1proportion which the total mileage of such township or 2district roads in the respective road districts bears to the 3total mileage of all such township or district roads in the 4county. After July 1 of any year prior to 2011, no allocation 5shall be made for any road district unless it levied a tax for 6road and bridge purposes in an amount which will require the 7extension of such tax against the taxable property in any such 8road district at a rate of not less than either .08% of the 9value thereof, based upon the assessment for the year 10immediately prior to the year in which such tax was levied and 11as equalized by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage 12County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of 13road under the jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is 14less. Beginning July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, an 15allocation shall be made for any road district if it levied a 16tax for road and bridge purposes. In counties other than 17DuPage County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the 18extension of the tax against the taxable property in the road 19district at a rate that is less than 0.08% of the value 20thereof, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 21prior to the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 22by the Department of Revenue, then the amount of the 23allocation for that road district shall be a percentage of the 24maximum allocation equal to the percentage obtained by 25dividing the rate extended by the district by 0.08%. In DuPage 26County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the extension of   SB2504- 12 -LRB104 12238 RTM 22345 b1the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 2rate that is less than the lesser of (i) 0.08% of the value of 3the taxable property in the road district, based upon the 4assessment for the year immediately prior to the year in which 5such tax was levied and as equalized by the Department of 6Revenue, or (ii) a rate that will yield an amount equal to 7$12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road 8district, then the amount of the allocation for the road 9district shall be a percentage of the maximum allocation equal 10to the percentage obtained by dividing the rate extended by 11the district by the lesser of (i) 0.08% or (ii) the rate that 12will yield an amount equal to $12,000 per mile of road under 13the jurisdiction of the road district. 14    Prior to 2011, if any road district has levied a special 15tax for road purposes pursuant to Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 166-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and such tax was levied in 17an amount which would require extension at a rate of not less 18than .08% of the value of the taxable property thereof, as 19equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue, or, in 20DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 21mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 22whichever is less, such levy shall, however, be deemed a 23proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 24road district for an allotment under this Section. Beginning 25in 2011 and thereafter, if any road district has levied a 26special tax for road purposes under Sections 6-601, 6-602, and   SB2504- 13 -LRB104 12238 RTM 22345 b16-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and the tax was levied in 2an amount that would require extension at a rate of not less 3than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property of that road 4district, as equalized or assessed by the Department of 5Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater 6than $12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the 7road district, whichever is less, that levy shall be deemed a 8proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 9road district for a full, rather than proportionate, allotment 10under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is less 11than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property, or, in DuPage 12County if the levy for the special tax is less than the lesser 13of (i) 0.08% or (ii) $12,000 per mile of road under the 14jurisdiction of the road district, and if the levy for the 15special tax is more than any other levy for road and bridge 16purposes, then the levy for the special tax qualifies the road 17district for a proportionate, rather than full, allotment 18under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is equal to 19or less than any other levy for road and bridge purposes, then 20any allotment under this Section shall be determined by the 21other levy for road and bridge purposes.22    Prior to 2011, if a township has transferred to the road 23and bridge fund money which, when added to the amount of any 24tax levy of the road district would be the equivalent of a tax 25levy requiring extension at a rate of at least .08%, or, in 26DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per   SB2504- 14 -LRB104 12238 RTM 22345 b1mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 2whichever is less, such transfer, together with any such tax 3levy, shall be deemed a proper compliance with this Section 4and shall qualify the road district for an allotment under 5this Section.6    In counties in which a property tax extension limitation 7is imposed under the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, 8road districts may retain their entitlement to a motor fuel 9tax allotment or, beginning in 2011, their entitlement to a 10full allotment if, at the time the property tax extension 11limitation was imposed, the road district was levying a road 12and bridge tax at a rate sufficient to entitle it to a motor 13fuel tax allotment and continues to levy the maximum allowable 14amount after the imposition of the property tax extension 15limitation. Any road district may in all circumstances retain 16its entitlement to a motor fuel tax allotment or, beginning in 172011, its entitlement to a full allotment if it levied a road 18and bridge tax in an amount that will require the extension of 19the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 20rate of not less than 0.08% of the assessed value of the 21property, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 22preceding the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 23by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount 24equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of road under the 25jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is less.26    As used in this Section, the term "road district" means   SB2504- 15 -LRB104 12238 RTM 22345 b1any road district, including a county unit road district, 2provided for by the Illinois Highway Code; and the term 3"township or district road" means any road in the township and 4district road system as defined in the Illinois Highway Code. 5For the purposes of this Section, "township or district road" 6also includes such roads as are maintained by park districts, 7forest preserve districts and conservation districts. The 8Department of Transportation shall determine the mileage of 9all township and district roads for the purposes of making 10allotments and allocations of motor fuel tax funds for use in 11road districts.12    Payment of motor fuel tax moneys to municipalities and 13counties shall be made as soon as possible after the allotment 14is made. The treasurer of the municipality or county may 15invest these funds until their use is required and the 16interest earned by these investments shall be limited to the 17same uses as the principal funds.18(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 19102-699, eff. 4-19-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23.) 20    Section 15.

Any 23municipal census used in accordance with this Section shall be 24certified to the Department of Transportation by the clerk of 25such municipality, and the accuracy thereof shall be subject 26to approval of the Department which may make such corrections   SB2504- 10 -LRB104 12238 RTM 22345 b1as it ascertains to be necessary.2    As soon as may be after the first day of each month, the 3Department of Transportation shall allot to each county its 4share of the amount apportioned to the several counties of the 5State as herein provided. Each allotment to the several 6counties having less than 1,000,000 inhabitants shall be in 7proportion to the amount of motor vehicle license fees 8received from the residents of such counties, respectively, 9during the preceding calendar year. The Secretary of State 10shall, on or before April 15 of each year, transmit to the 11Department of Transportation a full and complete report 12showing the amount of motor vehicle license fees received from 13the residents of each county, respectively, during the 14preceding calendar year. The Department of Transportation 15shall, each month, use for allotment purposes the last such 16report received from the Secretary of State.17    As soon as may be after the first day of each month, the 18Department of Transportation shall allot to the several 19counties their share of the amount apportioned for the use of 20road districts. The allotment shall be apportioned among the 21several counties in the State in the proportion which the 22total mileage of township or district roads in the respective 23counties bears to the total mileage of all township and 24district roads in the State. Funds allotted to the respective 25counties for the use of road districts therein shall be 26allocated to the several road districts in the county in the   SB2504- 11 -LRB104 12238 RTM 22345 b1proportion which the total mileage of such township or 2district roads in the respective road districts bears to the 3total mileage of all such township or district roads in the 4county. After July 1 of any year prior to 2011, no allocation 5shall be made for any road district unless it levied a tax for 6road and bridge purposes in an amount which will require the 7extension of such tax against the taxable property in any such 8road district at a rate of not less than either .08% of the 9value thereof, based upon the assessment for the year 10immediately prior to the year in which such tax was levied and 11as equalized by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage 12County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of 13road under the jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is 14less. Beginning July 1, 2011 and each July 1 thereafter, an 15allocation shall be made for any road district if it levied a 16tax for road and bridge purposes. In counties other than 17DuPage County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the 18extension of the tax against the taxable property in the road 19district at a rate that is less than 0.08% of the value 20thereof, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 21prior to the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 22by the Department of Revenue, then the amount of the 23allocation for that road district shall be a percentage of the 24maximum allocation equal to the percentage obtained by 25dividing the rate extended by the district by 0.08%. In DuPage 26County, if the amount of the tax levy requires the extension of   SB2504- 12 -LRB104 12238 RTM 22345 b1the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 2rate that is less than the lesser of (i) 0.08% of the value of 3the taxable property in the road district, based upon the 4assessment for the year immediately prior to the year in which 5such tax was levied and as equalized by the Department of 6Revenue, or (ii) a rate that will yield an amount equal to 7$12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road 8district, then the amount of the allocation for the road 9district shall be a percentage of the maximum allocation equal 10to the percentage obtained by dividing the rate extended by 11the district by the lesser of (i) 0.08% or (ii) the rate that 12will yield an amount equal to $12,000 per mile of road under 13the jurisdiction of the road district. 14    Prior to 2011, if any road district has levied a special 15tax for road purposes pursuant to Sections 6-601, 6-602, and 166-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and such tax was levied in 17an amount which would require extension at a rate of not less 18than .08% of the value of the taxable property thereof, as 19equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue, or, in 20DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per 21mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 22whichever is less, such levy shall, however, be deemed a 23proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 24road district for an allotment under this Section. Beginning 25in 2011 and thereafter, if any road district has levied a 26special tax for road purposes under Sections 6-601, 6-602, and   SB2504- 13 -LRB104 12238 RTM 22345 b16-603 of the Illinois Highway Code, and the tax was levied in 2an amount that would require extension at a rate of not less 3than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property of that road 4district, as equalized or assessed by the Department of 5Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater 6than $12,000 per mile of road under the jurisdiction of the 7road district, whichever is less, that levy shall be deemed a 8proper compliance with this Section and shall qualify such 9road district for a full, rather than proportionate, allotment 10under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is less 11than 0.08% of the value of the taxable property, or, in DuPage 12County if the levy for the special tax is less than the lesser 13of (i) 0.08% or (ii) $12,000 per mile of road under the 14jurisdiction of the road district, and if the levy for the 15special tax is more than any other levy for road and bridge 16purposes, then the levy for the special tax qualifies the road 17district for a proportionate, rather than full, allotment 18under this Section. If the levy for the special tax is equal to 19or less than any other levy for road and bridge purposes, then 20any allotment under this Section shall be determined by the 21other levy for road and bridge purposes.22    Prior to 2011, if a township has transferred to the road 23and bridge fund money which, when added to the amount of any 24tax levy of the road district would be the equivalent of a tax 25levy requiring extension at a rate of at least .08%, or, in 26DuPage County, an amount equal to or greater than $12,000 per   SB2504- 14 -LRB104 12238 RTM 22345 b1mile of road under the jurisdiction of the road district, 2whichever is less, such transfer, together with any such tax 3levy, shall be deemed a proper compliance with this Section 4and shall qualify the road district for an allotment under 5this Section.6    In counties in which a property tax extension limitation 7is imposed under the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, 8road districts may retain their entitlement to a motor fuel 9tax allotment or, beginning in 2011, their entitlement to a 10full allotment if, at the time the property tax extension 11limitation was imposed, the road district was levying a road 12and bridge tax at a rate sufficient to entitle it to a motor 13fuel tax allotment and continues to levy the maximum allowable 14amount after the imposition of the property tax extension 15limitation. Any road district may in all circumstances retain 16its entitlement to a motor fuel tax allotment or, beginning in 172011, its entitlement to a full allotment if it levied a road 18and bridge tax in an amount that will require the extension of 19the tax against the taxable property in the road district at a 20rate of not less than 0.08% of the assessed value of the 21property, based upon the assessment for the year immediately 22preceding the year in which the tax was levied and as equalized 23by the Department of Revenue or, in DuPage County, an amount 24equal to or greater than $12,000 per mile of road under the 25jurisdiction of the road district, whichever is less.26    As used in this Section, the term "road district" means   SB2504- 15 -LRB104 12238 RTM 22345 b1any road district, including a county unit road district, 2provided for by the Illinois Highway Code; and the term 3"township or district road" means any road in the township and 4district road system as defined in the Illinois Highway Code. 5For the purposes of this Section, "township or district road" 6also includes such roads as are maintained by park districts, 7forest preserve districts and conservation districts. The 8Department of Transportation shall determine the mileage of 9all township and district roads for the purposes of making 10allotments and allocations of motor fuel tax funds for use in 11road districts.12    Payment of motor fuel tax moneys to municipalities and 13counties shall be made as soon as possible after the allotment 14is made. The treasurer of the municipality or county may 15invest these funds until their use is required and the 16interest earned by these investments shall be limited to the 17same uses as the principal funds.18(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 19102-699, eff. 4-19-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23.) 20    Section 15.
