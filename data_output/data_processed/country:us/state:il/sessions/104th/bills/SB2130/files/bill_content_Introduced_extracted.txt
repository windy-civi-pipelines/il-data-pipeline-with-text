Court appointed trial counsel; compensation 2and expenses. 3    (a) This Section applies only to compensation and expenses 4of trial counsel appointed by the court as set forth in Section 55, other than public defenders, for the period after 6arraignment and so long as the State's Attorney has not, at any 7time, filed a certificate indicating he or she will not seek 8the death penalty or stated on the record in open court that 9the death penalty will not be sought.10    (a-5) Litigation budget.11        (1) In a case in which the State has filed a statement 12    of intent to seek the death penalty, the court shall 13    require appointed counsel, including those appointed in 14    Cook County, after counsel has had adequate time to review 15    the case and prior to engaging trial assistance, to submit 16    a proposed estimated litigation budget for court approval, 17    that will be subject to modification in light of facts and 18    developments that emerge as the case proceeds. Case 19    budgets should be submitted ex parte and filed and 20    maintained under seal in order to protect the defendant's 21    right to effective assistance of counsel, right not to 22    incriminate him or herself and all applicable privileges. 23    Case budgets shall be reviewed and approved by the judge 24    assigned to try the case. As provided under subsection (c) 25    of this Section, petitions for compensation shall be   SB2130- 3 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1    reviewed by both the trial judge and the presiding judge 2    or the presiding judge's designee. 3        (2) The litigation budget shall serve purposes 4    comparable to those of private retainer agreements by 5    confirming both the court's and the attorney's 6    expectations regarding fees and expenses. Consideration 7    should be given to employing an ex parte pretrial 8    conference in order to facilitate reaching agreement on a 9    litigation budget at the earliest opportunity.10        (3) The budget shall be incorporated into a sealed 11    initial pretrial order that reflects the understandings of 12    the court and counsel regarding all matters affecting 13    counsel compensation and reimbursement and payments for 14    investigative, expert and other services, including, but 15    not limited to, the following matters:16            (A) the hourly rate at which counsel will be 17        compensated;18            (B) the hourly rate at which private 19        investigators, other than investigators employed by 20        the Office of the State Appellate Defender, will be 21        compensated; and22            (C) the best preliminary estimate that can be made 23        of the cost of all services, including, but not 24        limited to, counsel, expert, and investigative 25        services that are likely to be needed through the 26        guilt and penalty phases of the trial. The court shall   SB2130- 4 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1        have discretion to require that budgets be prepared 2        for shorter intervals of time.3        (4) Appointed counsel may obtain, subject to later 4    review, investigative, expert, or other services without 5    prior authorization if necessary for an adequate defense. 6    If the services are obtained, the presiding judge or the 7    presiding judge's designee shall consider in an ex parte 8    proceeding that timely procurement of necessary services 9    could not await prior authorization. If an ex parte 10    hearing is requested by defense counsel or deemed 11    necessary by the trial judge prior to modifying a budget, 12    the ex parte hearing shall be before the presiding judge 13    or the presiding judge's designee. The judge may then 14    authorize the services nunc pro tunc. If the presiding 15    judge or the presiding judge's designee finds that the 16    services were not reasonable, payment may be denied.17        (5) An approved budget shall guide counsel's use of 18    time and resources by indicating the services for which 19    compensation is authorized. The case budget shall be 20    re-evaluated when justified by changed or unexpected 21    circumstances and shall be modified by the court when 22    reasonable and necessary for an adequate defense. If an ex 23    parte hearing is requested by defense counsel or deemed 24    necessary by the trial judge prior to modifying a budget, 25    the ex parte hearing shall be before the presiding judge 26    or the presiding judge's designee.  SB2130- 5 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1    (b) Appointed trial counsel shall be compensated upon 2presentment and certification by the circuit court of a claim 3for services detailing the date, activity, and time duration 4for which compensation is sought.

The Unified Code of Corrections is amended by 2changing Section 5-8-1 as follows: 3    (730 ILCS 5/5-8-1)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-8-1)4    Sec. 5-8-1. Natural life imprisonment; enhancements for 5use of a firearm; mandatory supervised release terms. 6    (a) Except as otherwise provided in the statute defining 7the offense or in Article 4.5 of Chapter V, a sentence of 8imprisonment for a felony shall be a determinate sentence set 9by the court under this Section, subject to Section 5-4.5-115 10of this Code, according to the following limitations:11        (1) for first degree murder,12            (a) (blank),13            (a-1) if the defendant had at the time of the 14        commission of the offense attained 18 years of age or 15        more, the court may sentence the defendant to death 16        under the procedures described in subsections (a-2) 17        through (a-11) if:18                (1) the murdered individual was a peace 19            officer, fireman, emergency medical technician - 20            ambulance, emergency medical technician - 21            intermediate, emergency medical technician - 22            paramedic, ambulance driver, or other medical 23            assistance or first aid personnel, employed by a 24            municipality or other governmental unit killed in 25            the course of performing his or her official   SB2130- 41 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1            duties, to prevent the performance of his or her 2            official duties, or in retaliation for performing 3            his or her official duties, and the defendant knew 4            or should have known the status of the murdered 5            individual;6                (2) the murdered individual was an employee of 7            an institution or facility of the Department of 8            Corrections, or any similar local correctional 9            agency, killed in the course of performing his or 10            her official duties, to prevent the performance of 11            his or her official duties, or in retaliation for 12            performing his or her official duties; or13                (3) the murdered individual was an 14            investigator or caseworker with the Adult 15            Protective Services Program or an ombudsman under 16            the State Long Term Care Ombudsman Program of the 17            Department on Aging, an investigator or employee 18            of the Department of Children and Family Services, 19            or a special agent with the Illinois Liquor 20            Control Commission or the Department of Revenue. 21            (a-2) The court shall consider, or shall instruct 22            the jury to consider, any aggravating and any 23            mitigating factors which are relevant to the 24            imposition of the death penalty. Aggravating 25            factors may include, but need not be limited to, 26            those factors set forth in subsections (b) and   SB2130- 42 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1            (b-5). Mitigating factors may include but need not 2            be limited to the following: 3                (1) the defendant has no significant history 4            of prior criminal activity; 5                (2) the murder was committed while the 6            defendant was under the influence of extreme 7            mental or emotional disturbance, although not such 8            as to constitute a defense to prosecution;9                (3) the murdered individual was a participant 10            in the defendant's homicidal conduct or consented 11            to the homicidal act; 12                (4) the defendant acted under the compulsion 13            of threat or menace of the imminent infliction of 14            death or great bodily harm; 15                (5) the defendant was not personally present 16            during commission of the act or acts causing 17            death; 18                (6) the defendant's background includes a 19            history of extreme emotional or physical abuse; 20                (7) the defendant suffers from a reduced 21            mental capacity. Provided, however, that an action 22            that does not otherwise mitigate first degree 23            murder cannot qualify as a mitigating factor for 24            first degree murder because of the discovery, 25            knowledge, or disclosure of the victim's sexual 26            orientation as defined in Section 1-103 of the   SB2130- 43 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1            Illinois Human Rights Act. 2            (a-3) If requested by the State, the court shall 3        conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine 4        the existence of factors set forth in subsections (b) 5        and (b-5) and to consider any aggravating or 6        mitigating factors as indicated in this subsection 7        (a-2). The proceeding shall be conducted: 8                (1) before the jury that determined the 9            defendant's guilt; or 10                (2) before a jury impanelled for the purpose 11            of the proceeding if:12                    (A) the defendant was convicted upon a 13                plea of guilty; or 14                    (B) the defendant was convicted after a 15                trial before the court sitting without a jury; 16                or 17                    (C) the court for good cause shown 18                discharges the jury that determined the 19                defendant's guilt; or 20                (3) before the court alone if the defendant 21            waives a jury for the separate proceeding. 22            (a-4) During the proceeding any information 23        relevant to any of the factors set forth in 24        subsections (b) and (b-5) may be presented by either 25        the State or the defendant under the rules governing 26        the admission of evidence at criminal trials. Any   SB2130- 44 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1        information relevant to any additional aggravating 2        factors or any mitigating factors indicated in 3        subsection (a-2) may be presented by the State or 4        defendant regardless of its admissibility under the 5        rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal 6        trials. The State and the defendant shall be given 7        fair opportunity to rebut any information received at 8        the hearing. 9            (a-5) The burden of proof of establishing the 10        existence of any of the factors set forth in 11        subsections (b) and (b-5) is on the State and shall not 12        be satisfied unless established beyond a reasonable 13        doubt. 14            (a-6) If at the separate sentencing proceeding the 15        jury finds that none of the factors set forth in 16        subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court shall 17        sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under 18        Chapter V. If there is a unanimous finding by the jury 19        that one or more of the factors set forth in 20        subsections (b) and (b-5) exist, the jury shall 21        consider aggravating and mitigating factors as 22        instructed by the court and shall determine whether 23        the sentence of death shall be imposed. If the jury 24        determines unanimously, after weighing the factors in 25        aggravation and mitigation, that death is the 26        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the   SB2130- 45 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1        defendant to death. If the court does not concur with 2        the jury determination that death is the appropriate 3        sentence, the court shall set forth reasons in writing 4        including what facts or circumstances the court relied 5        upon, along with any relevant documents, that 6        compelled the court to non-concur with the sentence. 7        This document and any attachments shall be part of the 8        record for appellate review. The court shall be bound 9        by the jury's sentencing determination. If after 10        weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, 11        one or more jurors determines that death is not the 12        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the 13        defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of 14        the Unified Code of Corrections. 15            (a-7) In a proceeding before the court alone, if 16        the court finds that none of the factors found in 17        subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court shall 18        sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under 19        Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections. If the 20        Court determines that one or more of the factors set 21        forth in subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court 22        shall consider any aggravating and mitigating factors 23        as indicated in subsection (a-2). If the court 24        determines, after weighing the factors in aggravation 25        and mitigation, that death is the appropriate 26        sentence, the Court shall sentence the defendant to   SB2130- 46 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1        death. If the court finds that death is not the 2        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the 3        defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of 4        the Unified Code of Corrections. 5            (a-8) In a case in which the defendant has been 6        found guilty of first degree murder by a judge or jury, 7        or a case on remand for resentencing, and the State 8        seeks the death penalty as an appropriate sentence, on 9        the court's own motion or the written motion of the 10        defendant, the court may decertify the case as a death 11        penalty case if the court finds that the only evidence 12        supporting the defendant's conviction is the 13        uncorroborated testimony of an informant witness, as 14        defined in Section 115-21 of the Code of Criminal 15        Procedure of 1963, concerning the confession or 16        admission of the defendant or that the sole evidence 17        against the defendant is a single eyewitness or single 18        accomplice without any other corroborating evidence. 19        If the court decertifies the case as a capital case 20        under either of the grounds set forth above, the court 21        shall issue a written finding. The State may pursue 22        its right to appeal the decertification pursuant to 23        Supreme Court Rule 604(a)(1). If the court does not 24        decertify the case as a capital case, the matter shall 25        proceed to the eligibility phase of the sentencing 26        hearing.   SB2130- 47 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1            (a-9) The conviction and sentence of death shall 2        be subject to automatic review by the Supreme Court. 3        Such review shall be in accordance with rules 4        promulgated by the Supreme Court. The Illinois Supreme 5        Court may overturn the death sentence, and order the 6        imposition of imprisonment under Chapter V if the 7        court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally 8        unjust as applied to the particular case. If the 9        Illinois Supreme Court finds that the death sentence 10        is fundamentally unjust as applied to the particular 11        case, independent of any procedural grounds for 12        relief, the Illinois Supreme Court shall issue a 13        written opinion explaining this finding. 14            (a-10) If the death penalty in this amendatory Act 15        of the 104th General Assembly is held to be 16        unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United 17        States or of the State of Illinois, any person 18        convicted of first degree murder shall be sentenced by 19        the court to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V. If 20        any death sentence pursuant to the sentencing 21        provisions of this Section is declared 22        unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United 23        States or of the State of Illinois, the court having 24        jurisdiction over a person previously sentenced to 25        death shall cause the defendant to be brought before 26        the court, and the court shall sentence the defendant   SB2130- 48 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1        to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V. 2            (a-11) The Attorney General and State's Attorneys 3        Association shall consult on voluntary guidelines for 4        procedures governing whether or not to seek the death 5        penalty. The guidelines do not have the force of law 6        and are only advisory in nature, or 7            (b) if a trier of fact finds beyond a reasonable 8        doubt that the murder was accompanied by exceptionally 9        brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton 10        cruelty or, except as set forth in subsection 11        (a)(1)(c) of this Section, that any of the aggravating 12        factors listed in subparagraph (b-5) are present, the 13        court may sentence the defendant, subject to Section 14        5-4.5-105, to a term of natural life imprisonment, or15            (b-5) a A defendant who at the time of the 16        commission of the offense has attained the age of 18 or 17        more and who has been found guilty of first degree 18        murder for which the death penalty has not been 19        imposed by the court may be sentenced to a term of 20        natural life imprisonment if: 21                (1) the murdered individual was an inmate at 22            an institution or facility of the Department of 23            Corrections, or any similar local correctional 24            agency and was killed on the grounds thereof, or 25            the murdered individual was otherwise present in 26            such institution or facility with the knowledge   SB2130- 49 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1            and approval of the chief administrative officer 2            thereof; 3                (2) the murdered individual was killed as a 4            result of the hijacking of an airplane, train, 5            ship, bus, or other public conveyance; 6                (3) the defendant committed the murder 7            pursuant to a contract, agreement, or 8            understanding by which he or she was to receive 9            money or anything of value in return for 10            committing the murder or procured another to 11            commit the murder for money or anything of value; 12                (4) the murdered individual was killed in the 13            course of another felony if: 14                    (A) the murdered individual: 15                        (i) was actually killed by the 16                    defendant, or 17                        (ii) received physical injuries 18                    personally inflicted by the defendant 19                    substantially contemporaneously with 20                    physical injuries caused by one or more 21                    persons for whose conduct the defendant is 22                    legally accountable under Section 5-2 of 23                    this Code, and the physical injuries 24                    inflicted by either the defendant or the 25                    other person or persons for whose conduct 26                    he is legally accountable caused the death   SB2130- 50 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1                    of the murdered individual; and (B) in 2                    performing the acts which caused the death 3                    of the murdered individual or which 4                    resulted in physical injuries personally 5                    inflicted by the defendant on the murdered 6                    individual under the circumstances of 7                    subdivision (ii) of clause (A) of this 8                    clause (4), the defendant acted with the 9                    intent to kill the murdered individual or 10                    with the knowledge that his or her acts 11                    created a strong probability of death or 12                    great bodily harm to the murdered 13                    individual or another; and 14                    (B) in performing the acts which caused 15                the death of the murdered individual or which 16                resulted in physical injuries personally 17                inflicted by the defendant on the murdered 18                individual under the circumstances of 19                subdivision (ii) of clause (A) of this clause 20                (4), the defendant acted with the intent to 21                kill the murdered individual or with the 22                knowledge that his or her acts created a 23                strong probability of death or great bodily 24                harm to the murdered individual or another; 25                and 26                    (C) the other felony was an inherently   SB2130- 51 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1                violent crime or the attempt to commit an 2                inherently violent crime.

Court appointed trial counsel; compensation 2and expenses. 3    (a) This Section applies only to compensation and expenses 4of trial counsel appointed by the court as set forth in Section 55, other than public defenders, for the period after 6arraignment and so long as the State's Attorney has not, at any 7time, filed a certificate indicating he or she will not seek 8the death penalty or stated on the record in open court that 9the death penalty will not be sought.10    (a-5) Litigation budget.11        (1) In a case in which the State has filed a statement 12    of intent to seek the death penalty, the court shall 13    require appointed counsel, including those appointed in 14    Cook County, after counsel has had adequate time to review 15    the case and prior to engaging trial assistance, to submit 16    a proposed estimated litigation budget for court approval, 17    that will be subject to modification in light of facts and 18    developments that emerge as the case proceeds. Case 19    budgets should be submitted ex parte and filed and 20    maintained under seal in order to protect the defendant's 21    right to effective assistance of counsel, right not to 22    incriminate him or herself and all applicable privileges. 23    Case budgets shall be reviewed and approved by the judge 24    assigned to try the case. As provided under subsection (c) 25    of this Section, petitions for compensation shall be   SB2130- 3 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1    reviewed by both the trial judge and the presiding judge 2    or the presiding judge's designee. 3        (2) The litigation budget shall serve purposes 4    comparable to those of private retainer agreements by 5    confirming both the court's and the attorney's 6    expectations regarding fees and expenses. Consideration 7    should be given to employing an ex parte pretrial 8    conference in order to facilitate reaching agreement on a 9    litigation budget at the earliest opportunity.10        (3) The budget shall be incorporated into a sealed 11    initial pretrial order that reflects the understandings of 12    the court and counsel regarding all matters affecting 13    counsel compensation and reimbursement and payments for 14    investigative, expert and other services, including, but 15    not limited to, the following matters:16            (A) the hourly rate at which counsel will be 17        compensated;18            (B) the hourly rate at which private 19        investigators, other than investigators employed by 20        the Office of the State Appellate Defender, will be 21        compensated; and22            (C) the best preliminary estimate that can be made 23        of the cost of all services, including, but not 24        limited to, counsel, expert, and investigative 25        services that are likely to be needed through the 26        guilt and penalty phases of the trial. The court shall   SB2130- 4 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1        have discretion to require that budgets be prepared 2        for shorter intervals of time.3        (4) Appointed counsel may obtain, subject to later 4    review, investigative, expert, or other services without 5    prior authorization if necessary for an adequate defense. 6    If the services are obtained, the presiding judge or the 7    presiding judge's designee shall consider in an ex parte 8    proceeding that timely procurement of necessary services 9    could not await prior authorization. If an ex parte 10    hearing is requested by defense counsel or deemed 11    necessary by the trial judge prior to modifying a budget, 12    the ex parte hearing shall be before the presiding judge 13    or the presiding judge's designee. The judge may then 14    authorize the services nunc pro tunc. If the presiding 15    judge or the presiding judge's designee finds that the 16    services were not reasonable, payment may be denied.17        (5) An approved budget shall guide counsel's use of 18    time and resources by indicating the services for which 19    compensation is authorized. The case budget shall be 20    re-evaluated when justified by changed or unexpected 21    circumstances and shall be modified by the court when 22    reasonable and necessary for an adequate defense. If an ex 23    parte hearing is requested by defense counsel or deemed 24    necessary by the trial judge prior to modifying a budget, 25    the ex parte hearing shall be before the presiding judge 26    or the presiding judge's designee.  SB2130- 5 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1    (b) Appointed trial counsel shall be compensated upon 2presentment and certification by the circuit court of a claim 3for services detailing the date, activity, and time duration 4for which compensation is sought.

The Unified Code of Corrections is amended by 2changing Section 5-8-1 as follows: 3    (730 ILCS 5/5-8-1)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-8-1)4    Sec. 5-8-1. Natural life imprisonment; enhancements for 5use of a firearm; mandatory supervised release terms. 6    (a) Except as otherwise provided in the statute defining 7the offense or in Article 4.5 of Chapter V, a sentence of 8imprisonment for a felony shall be a determinate sentence set 9by the court under this Section, subject to Section 5-4.5-115 10of this Code, according to the following limitations:11        (1) for first degree murder,12            (a) (blank),13            (a-1) if the defendant had at the time of the 14        commission of the offense attained 18 years of age or 15        more, the court may sentence the defendant to death 16        under the procedures described in subsections (a-2) 17        through (a-11) if:18                (1) the murdered individual was a peace 19            officer, fireman, emergency medical technician - 20            ambulance, emergency medical technician - 21            intermediate, emergency medical technician - 22            paramedic, ambulance driver, or other medical 23            assistance or first aid personnel, employed by a 24            municipality or other governmental unit killed in 25            the course of performing his or her official   SB2130- 41 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1            duties, to prevent the performance of his or her 2            official duties, or in retaliation for performing 3            his or her official duties, and the defendant knew 4            or should have known the status of the murdered 5            individual;6                (2) the murdered individual was an employee of 7            an institution or facility of the Department of 8            Corrections, or any similar local correctional 9            agency, killed in the course of performing his or 10            her official duties, to prevent the performance of 11            his or her official duties, or in retaliation for 12            performing his or her official duties; or13                (3) the murdered individual was an 14            investigator or caseworker with the Adult 15            Protective Services Program or an ombudsman under 16            the State Long Term Care Ombudsman Program of the 17            Department on Aging, an investigator or employee 18            of the Department of Children and Family Services, 19            or a special agent with the Illinois Liquor 20            Control Commission or the Department of Revenue. 21            (a-2) The court shall consider, or shall instruct 22            the jury to consider, any aggravating and any 23            mitigating factors which are relevant to the 24            imposition of the death penalty. Aggravating 25            factors may include, but need not be limited to, 26            those factors set forth in subsections (b) and   SB2130- 42 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1            (b-5). Mitigating factors may include but need not 2            be limited to the following: 3                (1) the defendant has no significant history 4            of prior criminal activity; 5                (2) the murder was committed while the 6            defendant was under the influence of extreme 7            mental or emotional disturbance, although not such 8            as to constitute a defense to prosecution;9                (3) the murdered individual was a participant 10            in the defendant's homicidal conduct or consented 11            to the homicidal act; 12                (4) the defendant acted under the compulsion 13            of threat or menace of the imminent infliction of 14            death or great bodily harm; 15                (5) the defendant was not personally present 16            during commission of the act or acts causing 17            death; 18                (6) the defendant's background includes a 19            history of extreme emotional or physical abuse; 20                (7) the defendant suffers from a reduced 21            mental capacity. Provided, however, that an action 22            that does not otherwise mitigate first degree 23            murder cannot qualify as a mitigating factor for 24            first degree murder because of the discovery, 25            knowledge, or disclosure of the victim's sexual 26            orientation as defined in Section 1-103 of the   SB2130- 43 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1            Illinois Human Rights Act. 2            (a-3) If requested by the State, the court shall 3        conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine 4        the existence of factors set forth in subsections (b) 5        and (b-5) and to consider any aggravating or 6        mitigating factors as indicated in this subsection 7        (a-2). The proceeding shall be conducted: 8                (1) before the jury that determined the 9            defendant's guilt; or 10                (2) before a jury impanelled for the purpose 11            of the proceeding if:12                    (A) the defendant was convicted upon a 13                plea of guilty; or 14                    (B) the defendant was convicted after a 15                trial before the court sitting without a jury; 16                or 17                    (C) the court for good cause shown 18                discharges the jury that determined the 19                defendant's guilt; or 20                (3) before the court alone if the defendant 21            waives a jury for the separate proceeding. 22            (a-4) During the proceeding any information 23        relevant to any of the factors set forth in 24        subsections (b) and (b-5) may be presented by either 25        the State or the defendant under the rules governing 26        the admission of evidence at criminal trials. Any   SB2130- 44 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1        information relevant to any additional aggravating 2        factors or any mitigating factors indicated in 3        subsection (a-2) may be presented by the State or 4        defendant regardless of its admissibility under the 5        rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal 6        trials. The State and the defendant shall be given 7        fair opportunity to rebut any information received at 8        the hearing. 9            (a-5) The burden of proof of establishing the 10        existence of any of the factors set forth in 11        subsections (b) and (b-5) is on the State and shall not 12        be satisfied unless established beyond a reasonable 13        doubt. 14            (a-6) If at the separate sentencing proceeding the 15        jury finds that none of the factors set forth in 16        subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court shall 17        sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under 18        Chapter V. If there is a unanimous finding by the jury 19        that one or more of the factors set forth in 20        subsections (b) and (b-5) exist, the jury shall 21        consider aggravating and mitigating factors as 22        instructed by the court and shall determine whether 23        the sentence of death shall be imposed. If the jury 24        determines unanimously, after weighing the factors in 25        aggravation and mitigation, that death is the 26        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the   SB2130- 45 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1        defendant to death. If the court does not concur with 2        the jury determination that death is the appropriate 3        sentence, the court shall set forth reasons in writing 4        including what facts or circumstances the court relied 5        upon, along with any relevant documents, that 6        compelled the court to non-concur with the sentence. 7        This document and any attachments shall be part of the 8        record for appellate review. The court shall be bound 9        by the jury's sentencing determination. If after 10        weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, 11        one or more jurors determines that death is not the 12        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the 13        defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of 14        the Unified Code of Corrections. 15            (a-7) In a proceeding before the court alone, if 16        the court finds that none of the factors found in 17        subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court shall 18        sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under 19        Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections. If the 20        Court determines that one or more of the factors set 21        forth in subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court 22        shall consider any aggravating and mitigating factors 23        as indicated in subsection (a-2). If the court 24        determines, after weighing the factors in aggravation 25        and mitigation, that death is the appropriate 26        sentence, the Court shall sentence the defendant to   SB2130- 46 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1        death. If the court finds that death is not the 2        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the 3        defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of 4        the Unified Code of Corrections. 5            (a-8) In a case in which the defendant has been 6        found guilty of first degree murder by a judge or jury, 7        or a case on remand for resentencing, and the State 8        seeks the death penalty as an appropriate sentence, on 9        the court's own motion or the written motion of the 10        defendant, the court may decertify the case as a death 11        penalty case if the court finds that the only evidence 12        supporting the defendant's conviction is the 13        uncorroborated testimony of an informant witness, as 14        defined in Section 115-21 of the Code of Criminal 15        Procedure of 1963, concerning the confession or 16        admission of the defendant or that the sole evidence 17        against the defendant is a single eyewitness or single 18        accomplice without any other corroborating evidence. 19        If the court decertifies the case as a capital case 20        under either of the grounds set forth above, the court 21        shall issue a written finding. The State may pursue 22        its right to appeal the decertification pursuant to 23        Supreme Court Rule 604(a)(1). If the court does not 24        decertify the case as a capital case, the matter shall 25        proceed to the eligibility phase of the sentencing 26        hearing.   SB2130- 47 -LRB104 03906 RLC 13930 b1            (a-9) The conviction and sentence of death shall 2        be subject to automatic review by the Supreme Court. 3        Such review shall be in accordance with rules 4        promulgated by the Supreme Court. The Illinois Supreme 5        Court may overturn the death sentence, and order the 6        imposition of imprisonment under Chapter V if the 7        court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally 8        unjust as applied to the particular case.
