A taxpayer shall be allowed a 14credit against the Personal Property Tax Replacement Income 15Tax for investment in qualified property.16        (1) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit equal to .5% 17    of the basis of qualified property placed in service 18    during the taxable year, provided such property is placed 19    in service on or after July 1, 1984. There shall be allowed 20    an additional credit equal to .5% of the basis of 21    qualified property placed in service during the taxable 22    year, provided such property is placed in service on or 23    after July 1, 1986, and the taxpayer's base employment 24    within Illinois has increased by 1% or more over the 25    preceding year as determined by the taxpayer's employment 26    records filed with the Illinois Department of Employment   SB0252- 11 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    Security. Taxpayers who are new to Illinois shall be 2    deemed to have met the 1% growth in base employment for the 3    first year in which they file employment records with the 4    Illinois Department of Employment Security. The provisions 5    added to this Section by Public Act 85-1200 (and restored 6    by Public Act 87-895) shall be construed as declaratory of 7    existing law and not as a new enactment. If, in any year, 8    the increase in base employment within Illinois over the 9    preceding year is less than 1%, the additional credit 10    shall be limited to that percentage times a fraction, the 11    numerator of which is .5% and the denominator of which is 12    1%, but shall not exceed .5%. The investment credit shall 13    not be allowed to the extent that it would reduce a 14    taxpayer's liability in any tax year below zero, nor may 15    any credit for qualified property be allowed for any year 16    other than the year in which the property was placed in 17    service in Illinois. For tax years ending on or after 18    December 31, 1987, and on or before December 31, 1988, the 19    credit shall be allowed for the tax year in which the 20    property is placed in service, or, if the amount of the 21    credit exceeds the tax liability for that year, whether it 22    exceeds the original liability or the liability as later 23    amended, such excess may be carried forward and applied to 24    the tax liability of the 5 taxable years following the 25    excess credit years if the taxpayer (i) makes investments 26    which cause the creation of a minimum of 2,000 full-time   SB0252- 12 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    equivalent jobs in Illinois, (ii) is located in an 2    enterprise zone established pursuant to the Illinois 3    Enterprise Zone Act and (iii) is certified by the 4    Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (now 5    Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity) as 6    complying with the requirements specified in clause (i) 7    and (ii) by July 1, 1986. The Department of Commerce and 8    Community Affairs (now Department of Commerce and Economic 9    Opportunity) shall notify the Department of Revenue of all 10    such certifications immediately. For tax years ending 11    after December 31, 1988, the credit shall be allowed for 12    the tax year in which the property is placed in service, 13    or, if the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability 14    for that year, whether it exceeds the original liability 15    or the liability as later amended, such excess may be 16    carried forward and applied to the tax liability of the 5 17    taxable years following the excess credit years. The 18    credit shall be applied to the earliest year for which 19    there is a liability. If there is credit from more than one 20    tax year that is available to offset a liability, earlier 21    credit shall be applied first.22        (2) The term "qualified property" means property 23    which:24            (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including 25        buildings and structural components of buildings and 26        signs that are real property, but not including land   SB0252- 13 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1        or improvements to real property that are not a 2        structural component of a building such as 3        landscaping, sewer lines, local access roads, fencing, 4        parking lots, and other appurtenances;5            (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the 6        Internal Revenue Code, except that "3-year property" 7        as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not 8        eligible for the credit provided by this subsection 9        (e);10            (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section 11        179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;12            (D) is used in Illinois by a taxpayer who is 13        primarily engaged in manufacturing, or in mining coal 14        or fluorite, or in retailing, or was placed in service 15        on or after July 1, 2006 in a River Edge Redevelopment 16        Zone established pursuant to the River Edge 17        Redevelopment Zone Act; and18            (E) has not previously been used in Illinois in 19        such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for 20        the credit provided by this subsection (e) or 21        subsection (f).22        (3) For purposes of this subsection (e), 23    "manufacturing" means the material staging and production 24    of tangible personal property by procedures commonly 25    regarded as manufacturing, processing, fabrication, or 26    assembling which changes some existing material into new   SB0252- 14 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    shapes, new qualities, or new combinations. For purposes 2    of this subsection (e) the term "mining" shall have the 3    same meaning as the term "mining" in Section 613(c) of the 4    Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this subsection 5    (e), the term "retailing" means the sale of tangible 6    personal property for use or consumption and not for 7    resale, or services rendered in conjunction with the sale 8    of tangible personal property for use or consumption and 9    not for resale. For purposes of this subsection (e), 10    "tangible personal property" has the same meaning as when 11    that term is used in the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, 12    and, for taxable years ending after December 31, 2008, 13    does not include the generation, transmission, or 14    distribution of electricity.15        (4) The basis of qualified property shall be the basis 16    used to compute the depreciation deduction for federal 17    income tax purposes.18        (5) If the basis of the property for federal income 19    tax depreciation purposes is increased after it has been 20    placed in service in Illinois by the taxpayer, the amount 21    of such increase shall be deemed property placed in 22    service on the date of such increase in basis.23        (6) The term "placed in service" shall have the same 24    meaning as under Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code.25        (7) If during any taxable year, any property ceases to 26    be qualified property in the hands of the taxpayer within   SB0252- 15 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    48 months after being placed in service, or the situs of 2    any qualified property is moved outside Illinois within 48 3    months after being placed in service, the Personal 4    Property Tax Replacement Income Tax for such taxable year 5    shall be increased. Such increase shall be determined by 6    (i) recomputing the investment credit which would have 7    been allowed for the year in which credit for such 8    property was originally allowed by eliminating such 9    property from such computation and, (ii) subtracting such 10    recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously 11    allowed. For the purposes of this paragraph (7), a 12    reduction of the basis of qualified property resulting 13    from a redetermination of the purchase price shall be 14    deemed a disposition of qualified property to the extent 15    of such reduction.16        (8) Unless the investment credit is extended by law, 17    the basis of qualified property shall not include costs 18    incurred after December 31, 2018, except for costs 19    incurred pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or 20    before December 31, 2018.21        (9) Each taxable year ending before December 31, 2000, 22    a partnership may elect to pass through to its partners 23    the credits to which the partnership is entitled under 24    this subsection (e) for the taxable year. A partner may 25    use the credit allocated to him or her under this 26    paragraph only against the tax imposed in subsections (c)   SB0252- 16 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    and (d) of this Section. If the partnership makes that 2    election, those credits shall be allocated among the 3    partners in the partnership in accordance with the rules 4    set forth in Section 704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, 5    and the rules promulgated under that Section, and the 6    allocated amount of the credits shall be allowed to the 7    partners for that taxable year. The partnership shall make 8    this election on its Personal Property Tax Replacement 9    Income Tax return for that taxable year. The election to 10    pass through the credits shall be irrevocable.11        For taxable years ending on or after December 31, 12    2000, a partner that qualifies its partnership for a 13    subtraction under subparagraph (I) of paragraph (2) of 14    subsection (d) of Section 203 or a shareholder that 15    qualifies a Subchapter S corporation for a subtraction 16    under subparagraph (S) of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) 17    of Section 203 shall be allowed a credit under this 18    subsection (e) equal to its share of the credit earned 19    under this subsection (e) during the taxable year by the 20    partnership or Subchapter S corporation, determined in 21    accordance with the determination of income and 22    distributive share of income under Sections 702 and 704 23    and Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. This 24    paragraph is exempt from the provisions of Section 250.25    (f) Investment credit; Enterprise Zone; River Edge 26Redevelopment Zone.  SB0252- 17 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1        (1) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the 2    tax imposed by subsections (a) and (b) of this Section for 3    investment in qualified property which is placed in 4    service in an Enterprise Zone created pursuant to the 5    Illinois Enterprise Zone Act or, for property placed in 6    service on or after July 1, 2006, a River Edge 7    Redevelopment Zone established pursuant to the River Edge 8    Redevelopment Zone Act. For partners, shareholders of 9    Subchapter S corporations, and owners of limited liability 10    companies, if the liability company is treated as a 11    partnership for purposes of federal and State income 12    taxation, for taxable years ending before December 31, 13    2023, there shall be allowed a credit under this 14    subsection (f) to be determined in accordance with the 15    determination of income and distributive share of income 16    under Sections 702 and 704 and Subchapter S of the 17    Internal Revenue Code. For taxable years ending on or 18    after December 31, 2023, for partners and shareholders of 19    Subchapter S corporations, the provisions of Section 251 20    shall apply with respect to the credit under this 21    subsection. The credit shall be .5% of the basis for such 22    property. The credit shall be available only in the 23    taxable year in which the property is placed in service in 24    the Enterprise Zone or River Edge Redevelopment Zone and 25    shall not be allowed to the extent that it would reduce a 26    taxpayer's liability for the tax imposed by subsections   SB0252- 18 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero. For tax years 2    ending on or after December 31, 1985, the credit shall be 3    allowed for the tax year in which the property is placed in 4    service, or, if the amount of the credit exceeds the tax 5    liability for that year, whether it exceeds the original 6    liability or the liability as later amended, such excess 7    may be carried forward and applied to the tax liability of 8    the 5 taxable years following the excess credit year. The 9    credit shall be applied to the earliest year for which 10    there is a liability. If there is credit from more than one 11    tax year that is available to offset a liability, the 12    credit accruing first in time shall be applied first.13        (2) The term qualified property means property which:14            (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including 15        buildings and structural components of buildings;16            (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the 17        Internal Revenue Code, except that "3-year property" 18        as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not 19        eligible for the credit provided by this subsection 20        (f);21            (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section 22        179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;23            (D) is used in the Enterprise Zone or River Edge 24        Redevelopment Zone by the taxpayer; and25            (E) has not been previously used in Illinois in 26        such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for   SB0252- 19 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1        the credit provided by this subsection (f) or 2        subsection (e).3        (3) The basis of qualified property shall be the basis 4    used to compute the depreciation deduction for federal 5    income tax purposes.6        (4) If the basis of the property for federal income 7    tax depreciation purposes is increased after it has been 8    placed in service in the Enterprise Zone or River Edge 9    Redevelopment Zone by the taxpayer, the amount of such 10    increase shall be deemed property placed in service on the 11    date of such increase in basis.12        (5) The term "placed in service" shall have the same 13    meaning as under Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code.14        (6) If during any taxable year, any property ceases to 15    be qualified property in the hands of the taxpayer within 16    48 months after being placed in service, or the situs of 17    any qualified property is moved outside the Enterprise 18    Zone or River Edge Redevelopment Zone within 48 months 19    after being placed in service, the tax imposed under 20    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section for such taxable 21    year shall be increased. Such increase shall be determined 22    by (i) recomputing the investment credit which would have 23    been allowed for the year in which credit for such 24    property was originally allowed by eliminating such 25    property from such computation, and (ii) subtracting such 26    recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously   SB0252- 20 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    allowed. For the purposes of this paragraph (6), a 2    reduction of the basis of qualified property resulting 3    from a redetermination of the purchase price shall be 4    deemed a disposition of qualified property to the extent 5    of such reduction.6        (7) There shall be allowed an additional credit equal 7    to 0.5% of the basis of qualified property placed in 8    service during the taxable year in a River Edge 9    Redevelopment Zone, provided such property is placed in 10    service on or after July 1, 2006, and the taxpayer's base 11    employment within Illinois has increased by 1% or more 12    over the preceding year as determined by the taxpayer's 13    employment records filed with the Illinois Department of 14    Employment Security. Taxpayers who are new to Illinois 15    shall be deemed to have met the 1% growth in base 16    employment for the first year in which they file 17    employment records with the Illinois Department of 18    Employment Security. If, in any year, the increase in base 19    employment within Illinois over the preceding year is less 20    than 1%, the additional credit shall be limited to that 21    percentage times a fraction, the numerator of which is 22    0.5% and the denominator of which is 1%, but shall not 23    exceed 0.5%. 24        (8) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 25    2021, there shall be allowed an Enterprise Zone 26    construction jobs credit against the taxes imposed under   SB0252- 21 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section as provided in 2    Section 13 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act. 3        The credit or credits may not reduce the taxpayer's 4    liability to less than zero. If the amount of the credit or 5    credits exceeds the taxpayer's liability, the excess may 6    be carried forward and applied against the taxpayer's 7    liability in succeeding calendar years in the same manner 8    provided under paragraph (4) of Section 211 of this Act. 9    The credit or credits shall be applied to the earliest 10    year for which there is a tax liability. If there are 11    credits from more than one taxable year that are available 12    to offset a liability, the earlier credit shall be applied 13    first. 14        For partners, shareholders of Subchapter S 15    corporations, and owners of limited liability companies, 16    if the liability company is treated as a partnership for 17    the purposes of federal and State income taxation, for 18    taxable years ending before December 31, 2023, there shall 19    be allowed a credit under this Section to be determined in 20    accordance with the determination of income and 21    distributive share of income under Sections 702 and 704 22    and Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code.

The credit shall not be available (i) until the 16    minimum investments in qualified property set forth in 17    subdivision (a)(3)(A) of Section 5.5 of the Illinois 18    Enterprise Zone Act have been satisfied or (ii) until the 19    time authorized in subsection (b-5) of the Illinois 20    Enterprise Zone Act for entities designated as High Impact 21    Businesses under subdivisions (a)(3)(B), (a)(3)(C), and 22    (a)(3)(D) of Section 5.5 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone 23    Act, and shall not be allowed to the extent that it would 24    reduce a taxpayer's liability for the tax imposed by 25    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero. The 26    credit applicable to such investments shall be taken in   SB0252- 23 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    the taxable year in which such investments have been 2    completed. The credit for additional investments beyond 3    the minimum investment by a designated high impact 4    business authorized under subdivision (a)(3)(A) of Section 5    5.5 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act shall be available 6    only in the taxable year in which the property is placed in 7    service and shall not be allowed to the extent that it 8    would reduce a taxpayer's liability for the tax imposed by 9    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero.

The credit shall be applied to the earliest 18    year for which there is a liability. If there is credit 19    from more than one tax year that is available to offset a 20    liability, the credit accruing first in time shall be 21    applied first.22        Changes made in this subdivision (h)(1) by Public Act 23    88-670 restore changes made by Public Act 85-1182 and 24    reflect existing law.25        (2) The term qualified property means property which:26            (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including   SB0252- 24 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1        buildings and structural components of buildings;2            (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the 3        Internal Revenue Code, except that "3-year property" 4        as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not 5        eligible for the credit provided by this subsection 6        (h);7            (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section 8        179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code; and9            (D) is not eligible for the Enterprise Zone 10        Investment Credit provided by subsection (f) of this 11        Section.12        (3) The basis of qualified property shall be the basis 13    used to compute the depreciation deduction for federal 14    income tax purposes.15        (4) If the basis of the property for federal income 16    tax depreciation purposes is increased after it has been 17    placed in service in a federally designated Foreign Trade 18    Zone or Sub-Zone located in Illinois by the taxpayer, the 19    amount of such increase shall be deemed property placed in 20    service on the date of such increase in basis.21        (5) The term "placed in service" shall have the same 22    meaning as under Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code.23        (6) If during any taxable year ending on or before 24    December 31, 1996, any property ceases to be qualified 25    property in the hands of the taxpayer within 48 months 26    after being placed in service, or the situs of any   SB0252- 25 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    qualified property is moved outside Illinois within 48 2    months after being placed in service, the tax imposed 3    under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section for such 4    taxable year shall be increased. Such increase shall be 5    determined by (i) recomputing the investment credit which 6    would have been allowed for the year in which credit for 7    such property was originally allowed by eliminating such 8    property from such computation, and (ii) subtracting such 9    recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously 10    allowed.

The credit or credits 11shall be applied to the earliest year for which there is a tax 12liability. If there are credits from more than one taxable 13year that are available to offset a liability, the earlier 14credit shall be applied first. 15    For partners, shareholders of Subchapter S corporations, 16and owners of limited liability companies, for taxable years 17ending before December 31, 2023, if the liability company is 18treated as a partnership for the purposes of federal and State 19income taxation, there shall be allowed a credit under this 20Section to be determined in accordance with the determination 21of income and distributive share of income under Sections 702 22and 704 and Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code.

A 20    credit allowed under this subsection may be sold to a 21    buyer as part of a sale of all or part of the remediation 22    site for which the credit was granted. The purchaser of a 23    remediation site and the tax credit shall succeed to the 24    unused credit and remaining carry-forward period of the 25    seller.

Except as provided in this 12    paragraph, a partnership or Subchapter S making the 13    election under paragraph (1) is liable for the 14    entity-level tax imposed under paragraph (2). If the 15    electing partnership or corporation fails to pay the full 16    amount of tax deemed assessed under paragraph (2), the 17    partners or shareholders shall be liable to pay the tax 18    assessed (including penalties and interest). Each partner 19    or shareholder shall be liable for the unpaid assessment 20    based on the ratio of the partner's or shareholder's share 21    of the net income of the partnership over the total net 22    income of the partnership. If the partnership or 23    Subchapter S corporation fails to pay the tax assessed 24    (including penalties and interest) and thereafter an 25    amount of such tax is paid by the partners or 26    shareholders, such amount shall not be collected from the   SB0252- 45 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    partnership or corporation. 2        (7) Foreign tax.

The provisions of 14    Section 709.5 of this Act shall not apply to a partnership 15    or Subchapter S corporation for the taxable year for which 16    an election under paragraph (1) is in effect. 17        (9) Requirement to pay estimated tax. For each taxable 18    year for which an election under paragraph (1) is in 19    effect, a partnership or Subchapter S corporation is 20    required to pay estimated tax for such taxable year under 21    Sections 803 and 804 of this Act if the amount payable as 22    estimated tax can reasonably be expected to exceed $500. 23        (10) The provisions of this subsection shall apply 24    only with respect to taxable years for which the 25    limitation on individual deductions applies under Section 26    164(b)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code.   SB0252- 46 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1(Source: P.A. 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-658, eff. 8-27-21; 2103-9, eff. 6-7-23; 103-396, eff. 1-1-24; 103-595, eff. 36-26-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24.) 4    Section 99.

In the 14case of a foreign insurer, as defined by Section 35A-5 of the 15Illinois Insurance Code, whose state or country of domicile 16imposes on insurers domiciled in Illinois a retaliatory tax 17(excluding any insurer whose premiums from reinsurance assumed 18are 50% or more of its total insurance premiums as determined 19under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of Section 304, except 20that for purposes of this determination premiums from 21reinsurance do not include premiums from inter-affiliate 22reinsurance arrangements), beginning with taxable years ending 23on or after December 31, 1999, the sum of the rates of tax 24imposed by subsections (b) and (d) shall be reduced (but not 25increased) to the rate at which the total amount of tax imposed 26under this Act, net of all credits allowed under this Act,   SB0252- 9 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1shall equal (i) the total amount of tax that would be imposed 2on the foreign insurer's net income allocable to Illinois for 3the taxable year by such foreign insurer's state or country of 4domicile if that net income were subject to all income taxes 5and taxes measured by net income imposed by such foreign 6insurer's state or country of domicile, net of all credits 7allowed or (ii) a rate of zero if no such tax is imposed on 8such income by the foreign insurer's state of domicile. For 9the purposes of this subsection (d-1), an inter-affiliate 10includes a mutual insurer under common management.11        (1) For the purposes of subsection (d-1), in no event 12    shall the sum of the rates of tax imposed by subsections 13    (b) and (d) be reduced below the rate at which the sum of:14            (A) the total amount of tax imposed on such 15        foreign insurer under this Act for a taxable year, net 16        of all credits allowed under this Act, plus17            (B) the privilege tax imposed by Section 409 of 18        the Illinois Insurance Code, the fire insurance 19        company tax imposed by Section 12 of the Fire 20        Investigation Act, and the fire department taxes 21        imposed under Section 11-10-1 of the Illinois 22        Municipal Code,23    equals 1.25% for taxable years ending prior to December 24    31, 2003, or 1.75% for taxable years ending on or after 25    December 31, 2003, of the net taxable premiums written for 26    the taxable year, as described by subsection (1) of   SB0252- 10 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    Section 409 of the Illinois Insurance Code. This paragraph 2    will in no event increase the rates imposed under 3    subsections (b) and (d).4        (2) Any reduction in the rates of tax imposed by this 5    subsection shall be applied first against the rates 6    imposed by subsection (b) and only after the tax imposed 7    by subsection (a) net of all credits allowed under this 8    Section other than the credit allowed under subsection (i) 9    has been reduced to zero, against the rates imposed by 10    subsection (d).11    This subsection (d-1) is exempt from the provisions of 12Section 250.13    (e) Investment credit. A taxpayer shall be allowed a 14credit against the Personal Property Tax Replacement Income 15Tax for investment in qualified property.16        (1) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit equal to .5% 17    of the basis of qualified property placed in service 18    during the taxable year, provided such property is placed 19    in service on or after July 1, 1984. There shall be allowed 20    an additional credit equal to .5% of the basis of 21    qualified property placed in service during the taxable 22    year, provided such property is placed in service on or 23    after July 1, 1986, and the taxpayer's base employment 24    within Illinois has increased by 1% or more over the 25    preceding year as determined by the taxpayer's employment 26    records filed with the Illinois Department of Employment   SB0252- 11 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    Security. Taxpayers who are new to Illinois shall be 2    deemed to have met the 1% growth in base employment for the 3    first year in which they file employment records with the 4    Illinois Department of Employment Security. The provisions 5    added to this Section by Public Act 85-1200 (and restored 6    by Public Act 87-895) shall be construed as declaratory of 7    existing law and not as a new enactment. If, in any year, 8    the increase in base employment within Illinois over the 9    preceding year is less than 1%, the additional credit 10    shall be limited to that percentage times a fraction, the 11    numerator of which is .5% and the denominator of which is 12    1%, but shall not exceed .5%. The investment credit shall 13    not be allowed to the extent that it would reduce a 14    taxpayer's liability in any tax year below zero, nor may 15    any credit for qualified property be allowed for any year 16    other than the year in which the property was placed in 17    service in Illinois. For tax years ending on or after 18    December 31, 1987, and on or before December 31, 1988, the 19    credit shall be allowed for the tax year in which the 20    property is placed in service, or, if the amount of the 21    credit exceeds the tax liability for that year, whether it 22    exceeds the original liability or the liability as later 23    amended, such excess may be carried forward and applied to 24    the tax liability of the 5 taxable years following the 25    excess credit years if the taxpayer (i) makes investments 26    which cause the creation of a minimum of 2,000 full-time   SB0252- 12 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    equivalent jobs in Illinois, (ii) is located in an 2    enterprise zone established pursuant to the Illinois 3    Enterprise Zone Act and (iii) is certified by the 4    Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (now 5    Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity) as 6    complying with the requirements specified in clause (i) 7    and (ii) by July 1, 1986. The Department of Commerce and 8    Community Affairs (now Department of Commerce and Economic 9    Opportunity) shall notify the Department of Revenue of all 10    such certifications immediately. For tax years ending 11    after December 31, 1988, the credit shall be allowed for 12    the tax year in which the property is placed in service, 13    or, if the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability 14    for that year, whether it exceeds the original liability 15    or the liability as later amended, such excess may be 16    carried forward and applied to the tax liability of the 5 17    taxable years following the excess credit years. The 18    credit shall be applied to the earliest year for which 19    there is a liability. If there is credit from more than one 20    tax year that is available to offset a liability, earlier 21    credit shall be applied first.22        (2) The term "qualified property" means property 23    which:24            (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including 25        buildings and structural components of buildings and 26        signs that are real property, but not including land   SB0252- 13 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1        or improvements to real property that are not a 2        structural component of a building such as 3        landscaping, sewer lines, local access roads, fencing, 4        parking lots, and other appurtenances;5            (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the 6        Internal Revenue Code, except that "3-year property" 7        as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not 8        eligible for the credit provided by this subsection 9        (e);10            (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section 11        179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;12            (D) is used in Illinois by a taxpayer who is 13        primarily engaged in manufacturing, or in mining coal 14        or fluorite, or in retailing, or was placed in service 15        on or after July 1, 2006 in a River Edge Redevelopment 16        Zone established pursuant to the River Edge 17        Redevelopment Zone Act; and18            (E) has not previously been used in Illinois in 19        such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for 20        the credit provided by this subsection (e) or 21        subsection (f).22        (3) For purposes of this subsection (e), 23    "manufacturing" means the material staging and production 24    of tangible personal property by procedures commonly 25    regarded as manufacturing, processing, fabrication, or 26    assembling which changes some existing material into new   SB0252- 14 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    shapes, new qualities, or new combinations. For purposes 2    of this subsection (e) the term "mining" shall have the 3    same meaning as the term "mining" in Section 613(c) of the 4    Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this subsection 5    (e), the term "retailing" means the sale of tangible 6    personal property for use or consumption and not for 7    resale, or services rendered in conjunction with the sale 8    of tangible personal property for use or consumption and 9    not for resale.

Such increase shall be determined by 6    (i) recomputing the investment credit which would have 7    been allowed for the year in which credit for such 8    property was originally allowed by eliminating such 9    property from such computation and, (ii) subtracting such 10    recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously 11    allowed. For the purposes of this paragraph (7), a 12    reduction of the basis of qualified property resulting 13    from a redetermination of the purchase price shall be 14    deemed a disposition of qualified property to the extent 15    of such reduction.16        (8) Unless the investment credit is extended by law, 17    the basis of qualified property shall not include costs 18    incurred after December 31, 2018, except for costs 19    incurred pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or 20    before December 31, 2018.21        (9) Each taxable year ending before December 31, 2000, 22    a partnership may elect to pass through to its partners 23    the credits to which the partnership is entitled under 24    this subsection (e) for the taxable year. A partner may 25    use the credit allocated to him or her under this 26    paragraph only against the tax imposed in subsections (c)   SB0252- 16 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    and (d) of this Section. If the partnership makes that 2    election, those credits shall be allocated among the 3    partners in the partnership in accordance with the rules 4    set forth in Section 704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, 5    and the rules promulgated under that Section, and the 6    allocated amount of the credits shall be allowed to the 7    partners for that taxable year. The partnership shall make 8    this election on its Personal Property Tax Replacement 9    Income Tax return for that taxable year. The election to 10    pass through the credits shall be irrevocable.11        For taxable years ending on or after December 31, 12    2000, a partner that qualifies its partnership for a 13    subtraction under subparagraph (I) of paragraph (2) of 14    subsection (d) of Section 203 or a shareholder that 15    qualifies a Subchapter S corporation for a subtraction 16    under subparagraph (S) of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) 17    of Section 203 shall be allowed a credit under this 18    subsection (e) equal to its share of the credit earned 19    under this subsection (e) during the taxable year by the 20    partnership or Subchapter S corporation, determined in 21    accordance with the determination of income and 22    distributive share of income under Sections 702 and 704 23    and Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. This 24    paragraph is exempt from the provisions of Section 250.25    (f) Investment credit; Enterprise Zone; River Edge 26Redevelopment Zone.  SB0252- 17 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1        (1) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the 2    tax imposed by subsections (a) and (b) of this Section for 3    investment in qualified property which is placed in 4    service in an Enterprise Zone created pursuant to the 5    Illinois Enterprise Zone Act or, for property placed in 6    service on or after July 1, 2006, a River Edge 7    Redevelopment Zone established pursuant to the River Edge 8    Redevelopment Zone Act.

For taxable years ending on or 18    after December 31, 2023, for partners and shareholders of 19    Subchapter S corporations, the provisions of Section 251 20    shall apply with respect to the credit under this 21    subsection. The credit shall be .5% of the basis for such 22    property. The credit shall be available only in the 23    taxable year in which the property is placed in service in 24    the Enterprise Zone or River Edge Redevelopment Zone and 25    shall not be allowed to the extent that it would reduce a 26    taxpayer's liability for the tax imposed by subsections   SB0252- 18 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero. For tax years 2    ending on or after December 31, 1985, the credit shall be 3    allowed for the tax year in which the property is placed in 4    service, or, if the amount of the credit exceeds the tax 5    liability for that year, whether it exceeds the original 6    liability or the liability as later amended, such excess 7    may be carried forward and applied to the tax liability of 8    the 5 taxable years following the excess credit year. The 9    credit shall be applied to the earliest year for which 10    there is a liability. If there is credit from more than one 11    tax year that is available to offset a liability, the 12    credit accruing first in time shall be applied first.13        (2) The term qualified property means property which:14            (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including 15        buildings and structural components of buildings;16            (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the 17        Internal Revenue Code, except that "3-year property" 18        as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not 19        eligible for the credit provided by this subsection 20        (f);21            (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section 22        179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;23            (D) is used in the Enterprise Zone or River Edge 24        Redevelopment Zone by the taxpayer; and25            (E) has not been previously used in Illinois in 26        such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for   SB0252- 19 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1        the credit provided by this subsection (f) or 2        subsection (e).3        (3) The basis of qualified property shall be the basis 4    used to compute the depreciation deduction for federal 5    income tax purposes.6        (4) If the basis of the property for federal income 7    tax depreciation purposes is increased after it has been 8    placed in service in the Enterprise Zone or River Edge 9    Redevelopment Zone by the taxpayer, the amount of such 10    increase shall be deemed property placed in service on the 11    date of such increase in basis.12        (5) The term "placed in service" shall have the same 13    meaning as under Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code.14        (6) If during any taxable year, any property ceases to 15    be qualified property in the hands of the taxpayer within 16    48 months after being placed in service, or the situs of 17    any qualified property is moved outside the Enterprise 18    Zone or River Edge Redevelopment Zone within 48 months 19    after being placed in service, the tax imposed under 20    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section for such taxable 21    year shall be increased. Such increase shall be determined 22    by (i) recomputing the investment credit which would have 23    been allowed for the year in which credit for such 24    property was originally allowed by eliminating such 25    property from such computation, and (ii) subtracting such 26    recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously   SB0252- 20 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    allowed. For the purposes of this paragraph (6), a 2    reduction of the basis of qualified property resulting 3    from a redetermination of the purchase price shall be 4    deemed a disposition of qualified property to the extent 5    of such reduction.6        (7) There shall be allowed an additional credit equal 7    to 0.5% of the basis of qualified property placed in 8    service during the taxable year in a River Edge 9    Redevelopment Zone, provided such property is placed in 10    service on or after July 1, 2006, and the taxpayer's base 11    employment within Illinois has increased by 1% or more 12    over the preceding year as determined by the taxpayer's 13    employment records filed with the Illinois Department of 14    Employment Security. Taxpayers who are new to Illinois 15    shall be deemed to have met the 1% growth in base 16    employment for the first year in which they file 17    employment records with the Illinois Department of 18    Employment Security. If, in any year, the increase in base 19    employment within Illinois over the preceding year is less 20    than 1%, the additional credit shall be limited to that 21    percentage times a fraction, the numerator of which is 22    0.5% and the denominator of which is 1%, but shall not 23    exceed 0.5%. 24        (8) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 25    2021, there shall be allowed an Enterprise Zone 26    construction jobs credit against the taxes imposed under   SB0252- 21 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section as provided in 2    Section 13 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act. 3        The credit or credits may not reduce the taxpayer's 4    liability to less than zero. If the amount of the credit or 5    credits exceeds the taxpayer's liability, the excess may 6    be carried forward and applied against the taxpayer's 7    liability in succeeding calendar years in the same manner 8    provided under paragraph (4) of Section 211 of this Act. 9    The credit or credits shall be applied to the earliest 10    year for which there is a tax liability. If there are 11    credits from more than one taxable year that are available 12    to offset a liability, the earlier credit shall be applied 13    first. 14        For partners, shareholders of Subchapter S 15    corporations, and owners of limited liability companies, 16    if the liability company is treated as a partnership for 17    the purposes of federal and State income taxation, for 18    taxable years ending before December 31, 2023, there shall 19    be allowed a credit under this Section to be determined in 20    accordance with the determination of income and 21    distributive share of income under Sections 702 and 704 22    and Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. For taxable 23    years ending on or after December 31, 2023, for partners 24    and shareholders of Subchapter S corporations, the 25    provisions of Section 251 shall apply with respect to the 26    credit under this subsection.  SB0252- 22 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1        The total aggregate amount of credits awarded under 2    the Blue Collar Jobs Act (Article 20 of Public Act 101-9) 3    shall not exceed $20,000,000 in any State fiscal year. 4        This paragraph (8) is exempt from the provisions of 5    Section 250. 6    (g) (Blank).7    (h) Investment credit; High Impact Business.8        (1) Subject to subsections (b) and (b-5) of Section 9    5.5 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act, a taxpayer shall 10    be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by subsections 11    (a) and (b) of this Section for investment in qualified 12    property which is placed in service by a Department of 13    Commerce and Economic Opportunity designated High Impact 14    Business.

The 26    credit applicable to such investments shall be taken in   SB0252- 23 -LRB104 06372 HLH 16408 b1    the taxable year in which such investments have been 2    completed. The credit for additional investments beyond 3    the minimum investment by a designated high impact 4    business authorized under subdivision (a)(3)(A) of Section 5    5.5 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act shall be available 6    only in the taxable year in which the property is placed in 7    service and shall not be allowed to the extent that it 8    would reduce a taxpayer's liability for the tax imposed by 9    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero.
