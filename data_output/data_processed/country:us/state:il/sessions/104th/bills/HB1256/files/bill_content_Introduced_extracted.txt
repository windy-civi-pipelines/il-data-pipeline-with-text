The reminders shall not 19be provided to any credit rating agency. The reminders may 20request that the employee furnish the provider with 21information about the proceeding under this Act, such as the 22file number, names of parties, and status of the case. If an 23employee fails to respond to such request for information or 24fails to furnish the information requested within 90 days of 25the date of the reminder, the provider is entitled to resume 26any and all efforts to collect payment from the employee for   HB1256- 15 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1the services rendered to the employee and the employee shall 2be responsible for payment of any outstanding bills for a 3procedure, treatment, or service rendered by a provider.4    (e-20) Upon a final award or judgment by an Arbitrator or 5the Commission, or a settlement agreed to by the employer and 6the employee, a provider may resume any and all efforts to 7collect payment from the employee for the services rendered to 8the employee and the employee shall be responsible for payment 9of any outstanding bills for a procedure, treatment, or 10service rendered by a provider as well as the interest awarded 11under subsection (d) of this Section.

However, starting on 6    January 1, 2012, these fee schedule amounts shall be 7    grouped into geographic regions in the following manner:8            (A) Four regions for non-hospital fee schedule 9        amounts shall be utilized:10                (i) Cook County;11                (ii) DuPage, Kane, Lake, and Will Counties;12                (iii) Bond, Calhoun, Clinton, Jersey, 13            Macoupin, Madison, Monroe, Montgomery, Randolph, 14            St. Clair, and Washington Counties; and15                (iv) All other counties of the State.16            (B) Fourteen regions for hospital fee schedule 17        amounts shall be utilized:18                (i) Cook, DuPage, Will, Kane, McHenry, DeKalb, 19            Kendall, and Grundy Counties;20                (ii) Kankakee County;21                (iii) Madison, St. Clair, Macoupin, Clinton, 22            Monroe, Jersey, Bond, and Calhoun Counties;23                (iv) Winnebago and Boone Counties;24                (v) Peoria, Tazewell, Woodford, Marshall, and 25            Stark Counties;26                (vi) Champaign, Piatt, and Ford Counties;  HB1256- 5 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1                (vii) Rock Island, Henry, and Mercer Counties;2                (viii) Sangamon and Menard Counties;3                (ix) McLean County;4                (x) Lake County;5                (xi) Macon County;6                (xii) Vermilion County;7                (xiii) Alexander County; and8                (xiv) All other counties of the State.9        (2) If a geozip, as defined in subsection (a) of this 10    Section, overlaps into one or more of the regions set 11    forth in this Section, then the Commission shall average 12    or repeat the charges and fees in a geozip in order to 13    designate charges and fees for each region.14        (3) In cases where the compiled data contains less 15    than 9 charges or fees for a procedure, treatment, 16    product, supply, or service or where the fee schedule 17    amount cannot be determined by the non-discounted charge 18    data, non-Medicare relative values and conversion factors 19    derived from established fee schedule amounts, coding 20    crosswalks, or other data as determined by the Commission, 21    reimbursement shall occur at 76% of charges and fees until 22    September 1, 2011 and 53.2% of charges and fees thereafter 23    as determined by the Commission in a manner consistent 24    with the provisions of this paragraph.25        (4) To establish additional fee schedule amounts, the 26    Commission shall utilize provider non-discounted charge   HB1256- 6 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1    data, non-Medicare relative values and conversion factors 2    derived from established fee schedule amounts, and coding 3    crosswalks. The Commission may establish additional fee 4    schedule amounts based on either the charge or cost of the 5    procedure, treatment, product, supply, or service.6        (5) Implants shall be reimbursed at 25% above the net 7    manufacturer's invoice price less rebates, plus actual 8    reasonable and customary shipping charges whether or not 9    the implant charge is submitted by a provider in 10    conjunction with a bill for all other services associated 11    with the implant, submitted by a provider on a separate 12    claim form, submitted by a distributor, or submitted by 13    the manufacturer of the implant. "Implants" include the 14    following codes or any substantially similar updated code 15    as determined by the Commission: 0274 16    (prosthetics/orthotics); 0275 (pacemaker); 0276 (lens 17    implant); 0278 (implants); 0540 and 0545 (ambulance); 0624 18    (investigational devices); and 0636 (drugs requiring 19    detailed coding). Non-implantable devices or supplies 20    within these codes shall be reimbursed at 65% of actual 21    charge, which is the provider's normal rates under its 22    standard chargemaster. A standard chargemaster is the 23    provider's list of charges for procedures, treatments, 24    products, supplies, or services used to bill payers in a 25    consistent manner.26        (6) The Commission shall automatically update all   HB1256- 7 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1    codes and associated rules with the version of the codes 2    and rules valid on January 1 of that year.3    (a-2) For procedures, treatments, services, or supplies 4covered under this Act and rendered or to be rendered on or 5after September 1, 2011, the maximum allowable payment shall 6be 70% of the fee schedule amounts, which shall be adjusted 7yearly by the Consumer Price Index-U, as described in 8subsection (a) of this Section.9    (a-3) Prescriptions filled and dispensed outside of a 10licensed pharmacy shall be subject to a fee schedule that 11shall not exceed the Average Wholesale Price (AWP) plus a 12dispensing fee of $4.18. AWP or its equivalent as registered 13by the National Drug Code shall be set forth for that drug on 14that date as published in Medi-Span Medispan. 15    (a-4) As used in this Section:16    "Custom compound medication" means a customized medication 17prescribed or ordered by a duly licensed prescriber for a 18specific patient that is prepared in a pharmacy by a licensed 19pharmacist in response to a licensed prescriber's prescription 20or order by combining, mixing, or altering of ingredients, but 21not reconstituting, to meet the unique needs of a specific 22patient. 23    (a-5) A custom compound medication for longer than the 24one-time 7-day supply described in subsection (a-6) shall be 25approved for payment only if the compound meets all of the 26following standards:   HB1256- 8 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1        (1) there is no readily available commercially 2    manufactured equivalent product;3        (2) no other Food and Drug Administration approved 4    alternative drug is appropriate for the patient;5        (3) the active ingredients of the compound each have a 6    National Drug Code number, are components of drugs 7    approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and the 8    active ingredients in the custom compound medication are 9    being used for diagnosis or conditions approved use by the 10    Food and Drug Administration and not being used for 11    off-label use;12        (4) the drug has not been withdrawn or removed from 13    the market for safety reasons; and14        (5) the prescriber is able to demonstrate to the payer 15    that the compound medication is clinically appropriate for 16    the intended use. 17    (a-6) Custom compound medications shall be charged using 18the specific amount of each component drug and its original 19manufacturer's National Drug Code number included in the 20compound. Charges shall be based on a maximum charge of the 21average wholesale price based upon the original manufacturer's 22National Drug Code number, as published by Red Book or 23Medi-Span and prorated for each component amount used. If the 24National Drug Code for the compound ingredient is a repackaged 25drug, the maximum allowable fee for the repackaged drug shall 26be determined by the National Drug Code and the average   HB1256- 9 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1wholesale price of the underlying original manufacturer. 2Components without National Drug Code numbers shall not be 3charged. A single dispensing fee for a custom compound 4medication as determined by the Commission based on the actual 5costs of preparing and dispensing the custom compound 6medication shall be paid. The dispensing fee for a compound 7prescription shall be billed with code WC 700-C. The provider 8may prescribe a one-time 7-day supply. Any custom compound 9medication prescriptions for more than 7 days shall be 10preauthorized by the employer. Under all circumstances, if the 11compound medication meets the requirements in subsection 12(a-5), a 7-day supply shall be covered. 13    (a-7) This Section is subject to the other provisions of 14this Act, including, but not limited to, Section 8.7. 15    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), if 16the Commission finds that there is a significant limitation on 17access to quality health care in either a specific field of 18health care services or a specific geographic limitation on 19access to health care, it may change the Consumer Price 20Index-U increase or decrease for that specific field or 21specific geographic limitation on access to health care to 22address that limitation.23    (c) The Commission shall establish by rule a process to 24review those medical cases or outliers that involve 25extra-ordinary treatment to determine whether to make an 26additional adjustment to the maximum payment within a fee   HB1256- 10 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1schedule for a procedure, treatment, or service.2    (d) When a patient notifies a provider that the treatment, 3procedure, or service being sought is for a work-related 4illness or injury and furnishes the provider the name and 5address of the responsible employer, the provider shall bill 6the employer or its designee directly. The employer or its 7designee shall make payment for treatment in accordance with 8the provisions of this Section directly to the provider, 9except that, if a provider has designated a third-party 10billing entity to bill on its behalf, payment shall be made 11directly to the billing entity. Providers shall submit bills 12and records in accordance with the provisions of this Section. 13        (1) All payments to providers for treatment provided 14    pursuant to this Act shall be made within 30 days of 15    receipt of the bills as long as the bill contains 16    substantially all the required data elements necessary to 17    adjudicate the bill. 18        (2) If the bill does not contain substantially all the 19    required data elements necessary to adjudicate the bill, 20    or the claim is denied for any other reason, in whole or in 21    part, the employer or insurer shall provide written 22    notification to the provider in the form of an explanation 23    of benefits explaining the basis for the denial and 24    describing any additional necessary data elements within 25    30 days of receipt of the bill. The Commission, with 26    assistance from the Medical Fee Advisory Board, shall   HB1256- 11 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1    adopt rules detailing the requirements for the explanation 2    of benefits required under this subsection. 3        (3) In the case (i) of nonpayment to a provider within 4    30 days of receipt of the bill which contained 5    substantially all of the required data elements necessary 6    to adjudicate the bill, (ii) of nonpayment to a provider 7    of a portion of such a bill, or (iii) where the provider 8    has not been issued an explanation of benefits for a bill, 9    the bill, or portion of the bill up to the lesser of the 10    actual charge or the payment level set by the Commission 11    in the fee schedule established in this Section, shall 12    incur interest at a rate of 1% per month payable by the 13    employer to the provider. Any required interest payments 14    shall be made by the employer or its insurer to the 15    provider within 30 days after payment of the bill. 16        (4) If the employer or its insurer fails to pay 17    interest within 30 days after payment of the bill as 18    required pursuant to paragraph (3), the provider may bring 19    an action in circuit court for the sole purpose of seeking 20    payment of interest pursuant to paragraph (3) against the 21    employer or its insurer responsible for insuring the 22    employer's liability pursuant to item (3) of subsection 23    (a) of Section 4. The circuit court's jurisdiction shall 24    be limited to enforcing payment of interest pursuant to 25    paragraph (3). Interest under paragraph (3) is only 26    payable to the provider. An employee is not responsible   HB1256- 12 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1    for the payment of interest under this Section. The right 2    to interest under paragraph (3) shall not delay, diminish, 3    restrict, or alter in any way the benefits to which the 4    employee or his or her dependents are entitled under this 5    Act. 6    The changes made to this subsection (d) by this amendatory 7Act of the 100th General Assembly apply to procedures, 8treatments, and services rendered on and after the effective 9date of this amendatory Act of the 100th General Assembly. 10    (e) Except as provided in subsections (e-5), (e-10), and 11(e-15), a provider shall not hold an employee liable for costs 12related to a non-disputed procedure, treatment, or service 13rendered in connection with a compensable injury. The 14provisions of subsections (e-5), (e-10), (e-15), and (e-20) 15shall not apply if an employee provides information to the 16provider regarding participation in a group health plan. If 17the employee participates in a group health plan, the provider 18may submit a claim for services to the group health plan. If 19the claim for service is covered by the group health plan, the 20employee's responsibility shall be limited to applicable 21deductibles, co-payments, or co-insurance. Except as provided 22under subsections (e-5), (e-10), (e-15), and (e-20), a 23provider shall not bill or otherwise attempt to recover from 24the employee the difference between the provider's charge and 25the amount paid by the employer or the insurer on a compensable 26injury, or for medical services or treatment determined by the   HB1256- 13 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1Commission to be excessive or unnecessary.2    (e-5) If an employer notifies a provider that the employer 3does not consider the illness or injury to be compensable 4under this Act, the provider may seek payment of the 5provider's actual charges from the employee for any procedure, 6treatment, or service rendered. Once an employee informs the 7provider that there is an application filed with the 8Commission to resolve a dispute over payment of such charges, 9the provider shall cease any and all efforts to collect 10payment for the services that are the subject of the dispute. 11Any statute of limitations or statute of repose applicable to 12the provider's efforts to collect payment from the employee 13shall be tolled from the date that the employee files the 14application with the Commission until the date that the 15provider is permitted to resume collection efforts under the 16provisions of this Section.17    (e-10) If an employer notifies a provider that the 18employer will pay only a portion of a bill for any procedure, 19treatment, or service rendered in connection with a 20compensable illness or disease, the provider may seek payment 21from the employee for the remainder of the amount of the bill 22up to the lesser of the actual charge, negotiated rate, if 23applicable, or the payment level set by the Commission in the 24fee schedule established in this Section. Once an employee 25informs the provider that there is an application filed with 26the Commission to resolve a dispute over payment of such   HB1256- 14 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1charges, the provider shall cease any and all efforts to 2collect payment for the services that are the subject of the 3dispute. Any statute of limitations or statute of repose 4applicable to the provider's efforts to collect payment from 5the employee shall be tolled from the date that the employee 6files the application with the Commission until the date that 7the provider is permitted to resume collection efforts under 8the provisions of this Section.9    (e-15) When there is a dispute over the compensability of 10or amount of payment for a procedure, treatment, or service, 11and a case is pending or proceeding before an Arbitrator or the 12Commission, the provider may mail the employee reminders that 13the employee will be responsible for payment of any procedure, 14treatment or service rendered by the provider. The reminders 15must state that they are not bills, to the extent practicable 16include itemized information, and state that the employee need 17not pay until such time as the provider is permitted to resume 18collection efforts under this Section. The reminders shall not 19be provided to any credit rating agency. The reminders may 20request that the employee furnish the provider with 21information about the proceeding under this Act, such as the 22file number, names of parties, and status of the case. If an 23employee fails to respond to such request for information or 24fails to furnish the information requested within 90 days of 25the date of the reminder, the provider is entitled to resume 26any and all efforts to collect payment from the employee for   HB1256- 15 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1the services rendered to the employee and the employee shall 2be responsible for payment of any outstanding bills for a 3procedure, treatment, or service rendered by a provider.4    (e-20) Upon a final award or judgment by an Arbitrator or 5the Commission, or a settlement agreed to by the employer and 6the employee, a provider may resume any and all efforts to 7collect payment from the employee for the services rendered to 8the employee and the employee shall be responsible for payment 9of any outstanding bills for a procedure, treatment, or 10service rendered by a provider as well as the interest awarded 11under subsection (d) of this Section. In the case of a 12procedure, treatment, or service deemed compensable, the 13provider shall not require a payment rate, excluding the 14interest provisions under subsection (d), greater than the 15lesser of the actual charge or the payment level set by the 16Commission in the fee schedule established in this Section. 17Payment for services deemed not covered or not compensable 18under this Act is the responsibility of the employee unless a 19provider and employee have agreed otherwise in writing. 20Services not covered or not compensable under this Act are not 21subject to the fee schedule in this Section.22    (f) Nothing in this Act shall prohibit an employer or 23insurer from contracting with a health care provider or group 24of health care providers for reimbursement levels for benefits 25under this Act different from those provided in this Section.26    (g) On or before January 1, 2010 the Commission shall   HB1256- 16 -LRB104 06147 SPS 16181 b1provide to the Governor and General Assembly a report 2regarding the implementation of the medical fee schedule and 3the index used for annual adjustment to that schedule as 4described in this Section.5(Source: P.A. 100-1117, eff. 11-27-18; 100-1175, eff. 61-11-19.) 7    Section 99.
