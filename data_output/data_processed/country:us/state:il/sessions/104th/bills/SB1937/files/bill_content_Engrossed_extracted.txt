Application and expiration of new benefit 25increases.  SB1937 Engrossed- 81 -LRB104 09509 RPS 19572 b1    (a) As used in this Section, "new benefit increase" means 2an increase in the amount of any benefit provided under this 3Article, or an expansion of the conditions of eligibility for 4any benefit under this Article, that results from an amendment 5to this Code that takes effect after June 1, 2005 (the 6effective date of Public Act 94-4). "New benefit increase", 7however, does not include any benefit increase resulting from 8the changes made to Article 1 or this Article by Public Act 996-37, Public Act 100-23, Public Act 100-587, Public Act 10100-611, Public Act 101-10, Public Act 101-610, Public Act 11102-210, Public Act 102-856, Public Act 102-956, or this 12amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly this amendatory 13Act of the 102nd General Assembly. 14    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code or 15any subsequent amendment to this Code, every new benefit 16increase is subject to this Section and shall be deemed to be 17granted only in conformance with and contingent upon 18compliance with the provisions of this Section. 19    (c) The Public Act enacting a new benefit increase must 20identify and provide for payment to the System of additional 21funding at least sufficient to fund the resulting annual 22increase in cost to the System as it accrues.23    Every new benefit increase is contingent upon the General 24Assembly providing the additional funding required under this 25subsection. The Commission on Government Forecasting and 26Accountability shall analyze whether adequate additional   SB1937 Engrossed- 82 -LRB104 09509 RPS 19572 b1funding has been provided for the new benefit increase and 2shall report its analysis to the Public Pension Division of 3the Department of Insurance. A new benefit increase created by 4a Public Act that does not include the additional funding 5required under this subsection is null and void. If the Public 6Pension Division determines that the additional funding 7provided for a new benefit increase under this subsection is 8or has become inadequate, it may so certify to the Governor and 9the State Comptroller and, in the absence of corrective action 10by the General Assembly, the new benefit increase shall expire 11at the end of the fiscal year in which the certification is 12made. 13    (d) Every new benefit increase shall expire 5 years after 14its effective date or on such earlier date as may be specified 15in the language enacting the new benefit increase or provided 16under subsection (c). This does not prevent the General 17Assembly from extending or re-creating a new benefit increase 18by law.19    (e) Except as otherwise provided in the language creating 20the new benefit increase, a new benefit increase that expires 21under this Section continues to apply to persons who applied 22and qualified for the affected benefit while the new benefit 23increase was in effect and to the affected beneficiaries and 24alternate payees of such persons, but does not apply to any 25other person, including, without limitation, a person who 26continues in service after the expiration date and did not   SB1937 Engrossed- 83 -LRB104 09509 RPS 19572 b1apply and qualify for the affected benefit while the new 2benefit increase was in effect.3(Source: P.A. 101-10, eff. 6-5-19; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 4101-610, eff. 1-1-20; 102-210, eff. 7-30-21; 102-856, eff. 51-1-23; 102-956, eff. 5-27-22.) 6    Section 99.
