However, any such 24conditions imposed pursuant to this Section may be modified by 25agreement between the subsequent owner or operator and the 26appropriate county board or governing body.

In the event that the 16local siting decision has been appealed, such expiration 17period shall be deemed to begin on the date upon which the 18appeal process is concluded.19    Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, upon the 20expiration of a development permit under subsection (k) of 21Section 39, any associated local siting approval granted for 22the facility under this Section shall also expire.23    If a first development permit for a municipal waste 24incineration facility expires under subsection (k) of Section 2539 after September 30, 1989 due to circumstances beyond the 26control of the applicant, any associated local siting approval   HB2419 Engrossed- 10 -LRB104 09346 BDA 19404 b1granted for the facility under this Section may be used to 2fulfill the local siting approval requirement upon application 3for a second development permit for the same site, provided 4that the proposal in the new application is materially the 5same, with respect to the criteria in subsection (a) of this 6Section, as the proposal that received the original siting 7approval, and application for the second development permit is 8made before January 1, 1990.9    (g) The siting approval procedures, criteria and appeal 10procedures provided for in this Act for new pollution control 11facilities shall be the exclusive siting procedures and rules 12and appeal procedures for facilities subject to such 13procedures. Local zoning or other local land use requirements 14shall not be applicable to such siting decisions.15    (h) Nothing in this Section shall apply to any existing or 16new pollution control facility located within the corporate 17limits of a municipality with a population of over 1,000,000.18    (i) (Blank.)19    The Board shall adopt regulations establishing the 20geologic and hydrologic siting criteria necessary to protect 21usable groundwater resources which are to be followed by the 22Agency in its review of permit applications for new pollution 23control facilities. Such regulations, insofar as they apply to 24new pollution control facilities authorized to store, treat or 25dispose of any hazardous waste, shall be at least as stringent 26as the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery   HB2419 Engrossed- 11 -LRB104 09346 BDA 19404 b1Act and any State or federal regulations adopted pursuant 2thereto.3    (j) Any new pollution control facility which has never 4obtained local siting approval under the provisions of this 5Section shall be required to obtain such approval after a 6final decision on an appeal of a permit denial.7    (k) A county board or governing body of a municipality may 8charge applicants for siting review under this Section a 9reasonable fee to cover the reasonable and necessary costs 10incurred by such county or municipality in the siting review 11process.12    (l) The governing Authority as determined by subsection 13(c) of Section 39 of this Act may request the Department of 14Transportation to perform traffic impact studies of proposed 15or potential locations for required pollution control 16facilities, including studies of the emissions associated with 17traffic.18    (m) An applicant may not file a request for local siting 19approval which is substantially the same as a request which 20was disapproved pursuant to a finding against the applicant 21under any of criteria (i) through (ix) of subsection (a) of 22this Section within the preceding 2 years.23    (n) In any review proceeding of a decision of the county 24board or governing body of a municipality made pursuant to the 25local siting review process, the petitioner in the review 26proceeding shall pay to the county or municipality the cost of   HB2419 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 09346 BDA 19404 b1preparing and certifying the record of proceedings. Should the 2petitioner in the review proceeding fail to make payment, the 3provisions of Section 3-109 of the Code of Civil Procedure 4shall apply.5    In the event the petitioner is a citizens' group that 6participated in the siting proceeding and is so located as to 7be affected by the proposed facility, such petitioner shall be 8exempt from paying the costs of preparing and certifying the 9record.10    (o) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a 11transfer station used exclusively for landscape waste, where 12landscape waste is held no longer than 24 hours from the time 13it was received, is not subject to the requirements of local 14siting approval under this Section, but is subject only to 15local zoning approval.16(Source: P.A. 100-382, eff. 8-25-17.)
