The Secretary shall establish by 18    rule the amount and the procedures, terms, and conditions 19    relating to these fees.20        (D) The Secretary may grant an employment exception to 21    If the restricted driving permit is issued for employment 22    purposes, then the prohibition against operating a motor 23    vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock 24    device to a person operating does not apply to the 25    operation of an occupational vehicle owned or leased by 26    that person's employer when used solely for employment   10400HB2658ham001- 41 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1    purposes. For any person who, within a 5-year period, is 2    convicted of a second or subsequent offense under Section 3    11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local 4    ordinance or similar out-of-state offense or a similar 5    offense committed on a military installation, this 6    employment exemption does not apply until either a 7    one-year period has elapsed during which that person had 8    his or her driving privileges revoked or a one-year period 9    has elapsed during which that person had a restricted 10    driving permit which required the use of an ignition 11    interlock device on every motor vehicle owned or operated 12    by that person.13        (E) In each case the Secretary may issue a restricted 14    driving permit for a period deemed appropriate, except 15    that all permits shall expire no later than 2 years from 16    the date of issuance. A restricted driving permit issued 17    under this Section shall be subject to cancellation, 18    revocation, and suspension by the Secretary of State in 19    like manner and for like cause as a driver's license 20    issued under this Code may be cancelled, revoked, or 21    suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more 22    offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the 23    movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for 24    the revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a 25    restricted driving permit. The Secretary of State may, as 26    a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving   10400HB2658ham001- 42 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1    permit, require the applicant to participate in a 2    designated driver remedial or rehabilitative program. The 3    Secretary of State is authorized to cancel a restricted 4    driving permit if the permit holder does not successfully 5    complete the program.6        (F) A person subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 7    of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code may make 8    application for a restricted driving permit at a hearing 9    conducted under Section 2-118 of this Code after the 10    expiration of 5 years from the effective date of the most 11    recent revocation or after 5 years from the date of 12    release from a period of imprisonment resulting from a 13    conviction of the most recent offense, whichever is later, 14    provided the person, in addition to all other requirements 15    of the Secretary, shows by clear and convincing evidence: 16            (i) a minimum of 3 years of uninterrupted 17        abstinence from alcohol and the unlawful use or 18        consumption of cannabis under the Cannabis Control 19        Act, a controlled substance under the Illinois 20        Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound 21        under the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or 22        methamphetamine under the Methamphetamine Control and 23        Community Protection Act; and24            (ii) the successful completion of any 25        rehabilitative treatment and involvement in any 26        ongoing rehabilitative activity that may be   10400HB2658ham001- 43 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1        recommended by a properly licensed service provider 2        according to an assessment of the person's alcohol or 3        drug use under Section 11-501.01 of this Code. 4        In determining whether an applicant is eligible for a 5    restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F), the 6    Secretary may consider any relevant evidence, including, 7    but not limited to, testimony, affidavits, records, and 8    the results of regular alcohol or drug tests. Persons 9    subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of subsection (b) 10    of Section 6-208 of this Code and who have been convicted 11    of more than one violation of paragraph (3), paragraph 12    (4), or paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of Section 11-501 13    of this Code shall not be eligible to apply for a 14    restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F). 15        A restricted driving permit issued under this 16    subparagraph (F) shall provide that the holder may only 17    operate motor vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock 18    device as required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) 19    of Section 6-205 of this Code and subparagraph (A) of 20    paragraph 3 of subsection (c) of this Section. The 21    Secretary may revoke a restricted driving permit or amend 22    the conditions of a restricted driving permit issued under 23    this subparagraph (F) if the holder operates a vehicle 24    that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device, or 25    for any other reason authorized under this Code. 26        A restricted driving permit issued under this   10400HB2658ham001- 44 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1    subparagraph (F) shall be revoked, and the holder barred 2    from applying for or being issued a restricted driving 3    permit in the future, if the holder is convicted of a 4    violation of Section 11-501 of this Code, a similar 5    provision of a local ordinance, or a similar offense in 6    another state or on a military installation. 7    (c-3) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of 8subsection (a), reports received by the Secretary of State 9under this Section shall, except during the actual time the 10suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for use 11only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, 12the driver licensing administrator of any other state, the 13Secretary of State, or the parent or legal guardian of a driver 14under the age of 18. However, beginning January 1, 2008, if the 15person is a CDL holder, the suspension shall also be made 16available to the driver licensing administrator of any other 17state, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the affected 18driver or motor carrier or prospective motor carrier upon 19request. 20    (c-4) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of 21subsection (a), the Secretary of State shall notify the person 22by mail that his or her driving privileges and driver's 23license will be suspended one month after the date of the 24mailing of the notice. 25    (c-5) The Secretary of State may, as a condition of the 26reissuance of a driver's license or permit to an applicant   10400HB2658ham001- 45 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1whose driver's license or permit has been suspended before he 2or she reached the age of 21 years pursuant to any of the 3provisions of this Section, require the applicant to 4participate in a driver remedial education course and be 5retested under Section 6-109 of this Code.6    (d) This Section is subject to the provisions of the 7Driver License Compact.8    (e) The Secretary of State shall not issue a restricted 9driving permit to a person under the age of 16 years whose 10driving privileges have been suspended or revoked under any 11provisions of this Code.12    (f) In accordance with 49 CFR 384, the Secretary of State 13may not issue a restricted driving permit for the operation of 14a commercial motor vehicle to a person holding a CDL whose 15driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, cancelled, or 16disqualified under any provisions of this Code.17(Source: P.A. 102-299, eff. 8-6-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 18102-749, eff. 1-1-23; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-982, eff. 197-1-23; 103-154, eff. 6-30-23; 103-822, eff. 1-1-25.) 20    (625 ILCS 5/6-206.1)  (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 6-206.1)21    Sec. 6-206.1. Monitoring Device Driving Permit. 22Declaration of Policy. It is hereby declared a policy of the 23State of Illinois that the driver who is impaired by alcohol, 24other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds is 25a threat to the public safety and welfare. Therefore, to   10400HB2658ham001- 46 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1provide a deterrent to such practice, a statutory summary 2driver's license suspension or suspension pursuant to Section 311-501.6 of this Code is appropriate. It is also recognized 4that driving is a privilege and therefore, that the granting 5of driving privileges, in a manner consistent with public 6safety, is warranted during the period of suspension in the 7form of a monitoring device driving permit. A person who 8drives and fails to comply with the requirements of the 9monitoring device driving permit commits a violation of 10Section 6-303 of this Code. 11    The following procedures shall apply whenever a first 12offender, as defined in Section 11-500 of this Code, is 13arrested for any offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a 14similar provision of a local ordinance and is subject to the 15provisions of Section 11-501.1 or is suspended pursuant to 16Section 11-501.6 of this Code:17    (a) Upon mailing of the notice of suspension of driving 18privileges as provided in subsection (h) of Section 11-501.1 19or subsection (d) of Section 11-501.6 of this Code, the 20Secretary shall also send written notice informing the person 21that he or she will be issued a monitoring device driving 22permit (MDDP). The notice shall include, at minimum, 23information summarizing the procedure to be followed for 24issuance of the MDDP, installation of the breath alcohol 25ignition installation device (BAIID), as provided in this 26Section, exemption from BAIID installation requirements, and   10400HB2658ham001- 47 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1procedures to be followed by those seeking indigent status, as 2provided in this Section. The notice shall also include 3information summarizing the procedure to be followed if the 4person wishes to decline issuance of the MDDP. A copy of the 5notice shall also be sent to the court of venue together with 6the notice of suspension of driving privileges, as provided in 7subsection (h) of Section 11-501. However, a MDDP shall not be 8issued if the Secretary finds that: 9        (1) the offender's driver's license is otherwise 10    invalid;11        (2) death or great bodily harm to another resulted 12    from the arrest for Section 11-501 or from the crash that 13    resulted in the suspension pursuant to Section 11-501.6;14        (3) the offender has been previously convicted of 15    reckless homicide or aggravated driving under the 16    influence involving death; or17        (4) the offender is less than 18 years of age. 18    Any offender participating in the MDDP program must pay 19the Secretary a MDDP Administration Fee in an amount not to 20exceed $30 per month, to be deposited into the Monitoring 21Device Driving Permit Administration Fee Fund. The Secretary 22shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, 23and conditions relating to these fees. The offender must have 24an ignition interlock device installed within 14 days of the 25date the Secretary issues the MDDP. The ignition interlock 26device provider must notify the Secretary, in a manner and   10400HB2658ham001- 48 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1form prescribed by the Secretary, of the installation. If the 2Secretary does not receive notice of installation, the 3Secretary shall cancel the MDDP. 4    Upon receipt of the notice, as provided in paragraph (a) 5of this Section, the person may file a petition to decline 6issuance of the MDDP with the court of venue. The court shall 7admonish the offender of all consequences of declining 8issuance of the MDDP including, but not limited to, the 9enhanced penalties for driving while suspended. After being so 10admonished, the offender shall be permitted, in writing, to 11execute a notice declining issuance of the MDDP. This notice 12shall be filed with the court and forwarded by the clerk of the 13court to the Secretary. The offender may, at any time 14thereafter, apply to the Secretary for issuance of a MDDP. 15    (a-1) A person issued a MDDP may drive for any purpose and 16at any time, subject to the rules adopted by the Secretary 17under subsection (g). The person must, at his or her own 18expense, drive only vehicles equipped with an ignition 19interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1, but in no 20event shall such person drive a commercial motor vehicle.21    (a-2) Persons who are issued a MDDP and must drive 22employer-owned vehicles in the course of their employment 23duties may seek permission to drive an employer-owned vehicle 24that does not have an ignition interlock device. The employer 25shall provide to the Secretary a form, as prescribed by the 26Secretary, completed by the employer verifying that the   10400HB2658ham001- 49 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1employee must drive an employer-owned vehicle in the course of 2employment. If approved by the Secretary, the form must be in 3the driver's possession while operating an employer-owner 4vehicle not equipped with an ignition interlock device. No 5person may use this exemption to drive a school bus, school 6vehicle, or a vehicle designed to transport more than 15 7passengers. No person may use this exemption to drive an 8employer-owned motor vehicle that is owned by an entity that 9is wholly or partially owned by the person holding the MDDP, or 10by a family member of the person holding the MDDP. No person 11may use this exemption to drive an employer-owned vehicle that 12is made available to the employee for personal use. No person 13may drive the exempted vehicle more than 12 hours per day, 6 14days per week. 15    (a-3) Persons who are issued a MDDP and who must drive a 16farm tractor to and from a farm, within 50 air miles from the 17originating farm are exempt from installation of a BAIID on 18the farm tractor, so long as the farm tractor is being used for 19the exclusive purpose of conducting farm operations. 20    (b) (Blank).21    (c) (Blank). 22    (c-1) If the holder of the MDDP is convicted of or receives 23court supervision for a violation of Section 6-206.2, 6-303, 2411-204, 11-204.1, 11-401, 11-501, 11-503, 11-506 or a similar 25provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state 26offense or is convicted of or receives court supervision for   10400HB2658ham001- 50 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1any offense for which alcohol or drugs is an element of the 2offense and in which a motor vehicle was involved (for an 3arrest other than the one for which the MDDP is issued), or 4de-installs the BAIID without prior authorization from the 5Secretary, the MDDP shall be cancelled.6    (c-5) If the Secretary determines that the person seeking 7the MDDP is indigent, the Secretary shall provide the person 8with a written document as evidence of that determination, and 9the person shall provide that written document to an ignition 10interlock device provider. The provider shall install an 11ignition interlock device on that person's vehicle without 12charge to the person, and seek reimbursement from the Indigent 13BAIID Fund. If the Secretary has deemed an offender indigent, 14the BAIID provider shall also provide the normal monthly 15monitoring services and the de-installation without charge to 16the offender and seek reimbursement from the Indigent BAIID 17Fund. Any other monetary charges, such as a lockout fee or 18reset fee, shall be the responsibility of the MDDP holder. A 19BAIID provider may not seek a security deposit from the 20Indigent BAIID Fund. 21    (d) MDDP information shall be available only to the 22courts, police officers, and the Secretary, except during the 23actual period the MDDP is valid, during which time it shall be 24a public record.25    (e) (Blank).26    (f) (Blank).  10400HB2658ham001- 51 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1    (g) The Secretary shall adopt rules for implementing this 2Section. The rules adopted shall address issues including, but 3not limited to: compliance with the requirements of the MDDP; 4methods for determining compliance with those requirements; 5the consequences of noncompliance with those requirements; 6what constitutes a violation of the MDDP; methods for 7determining indigency; and the duties of a person or entity 8that supplies the ignition interlock device.9    (h) The rules adopted under subsection (g) shall provide, 10at a minimum, that the person is not in compliance with the 11requirements of the MDDP if he or she:12        (1) tampers or attempts to tamper with or circumvent 13    the proper operation of the ignition interlock device;14        (2) provides valid breath samples that register blood 15    alcohol levels in excess of the number of times allowed 16    under the rules;17        (3) fails to provide evidence sufficient to satisfy 18    the Secretary that the ignition interlock device has been 19    installed in the designated vehicle or vehicles; or20        (4) fails to follow any other applicable rules adopted 21    by the Secretary.22    (i) Any person or entity that supplies an ignition 23interlock device as provided under this Section shall, in 24addition to supplying only those devices which fully comply 25with all the rules adopted under subsection (g), provide the 26Secretary, within 7 days of inspection, all monitoring reports   10400HB2658ham001- 52 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1of each person who has had an ignition interlock device 2installed. These reports shall be furnished in a manner or 3form as prescribed by the Secretary.4    (j) Upon making a determination that a violation of the 5requirements of the MDDP has occurred, the Secretary shall 6extend the summary suspension period for an additional 3 7months beyond the originally imposed summary suspension 8period, during which time the person shall only be allowed to 9drive vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device; 10provided further there are no limitations on the total number 11of times the summary suspension may be extended. The Secretary 12may, however, limit the number of extensions imposed for 13violations occurring during any one monitoring period, as set 14forth by rule. Any person whose summary suspension is extended 15pursuant to this Section shall have the right to contest the 16extension through a hearing with the Secretary, pursuant to 17Section 2-118 of this Code. If the summary suspension has 18already terminated prior to the Secretary receiving the 19monitoring report that shows a violation, the Secretary shall 20be authorized to suspend the person's driving privileges for 3 21months, provided that the Secretary may, by rule, limit the 22number of suspensions to be entered pursuant to this paragraph 23for violations occurring during any one monitoring period. Any 24person whose license is suspended pursuant to this paragraph, 25after the summary suspension had already terminated, shall 26have the right to contest the suspension through a hearing   10400HB2658ham001- 53 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1with the Secretary, pursuant to Section 2-118 of this Code. 2The only permit the person shall be eligible for during this 3new suspension period is a MDDP.4    (k) A person who has had his or her summary suspension 5extended for the third time, or has any combination of 3 6extensions and new suspensions, entered as a result of a 7violation that occurred while holding the MDDP, so long as the 8extensions and new suspensions relate to the same summary 9suspension, shall have his or her vehicle impounded for a 10period of 30 days, at the person's own expense. A person who 11has his or her summary suspension extended for the fourth 12time, or has any combination of 4 extensions and new 13suspensions, entered as a result of a violation that occurred 14while holding the MDDP, so long as the extensions and new 15suspensions relate to the same summary suspension, shall have 16his or her vehicle subject to seizure and forfeiture. The 17Secretary shall notify the prosecuting authority of any third 18or fourth extensions or new suspension entered as a result of a 19violation that occurred while the person held a MDDP. Upon 20receipt of the notification, the prosecuting authority shall 21impound or forfeit the vehicle. The impoundment or forfeiture 22of a vehicle shall be conducted pursuant to the procedure 23specified in Article 36 of the Criminal Code of 2012.24    (l) A person whose driving privileges have been suspended 25under Section 11-501.1 or Section26     11-501.6 of this Code and who had a MDDP that was   10400HB2658ham001- 54 -LRB104 08651 LNS 23269 a1cancelled, or would have been cancelled had notification of a 2violation been received prior to expiration of the MDDP, 3pursuant to subsection (c-1) of this Section, shall not be 4eligible for reinstatement when the summary suspension is 5scheduled to terminate. Instead, the person's driving 6privileges shall be suspended for a period of not less than 7twice the original summary suspension period, or for the 8length of any extensions entered under subsection (j), 9whichever is longer. During the period of suspension, the 10person shall be eligible only to apply for a restricted 11driving permit. If a restricted driving permit is granted, the 12offender may only operate vehicles equipped with a BAIID in 13accordance with this Section.14    (m) Any person or entity that supplies an ignition 15interlock device under this Section shall, for each ignition 16interlock device installed, pay 5% of the total gross revenue 17received for the device, including monthly monitoring fees, 18into the Indigent BAIID Fund. This 5% shall be clearly 19indicated as a separate surcharge on each invoice that is 20issued.

It is also recognized 4that driving is a privilege and therefore, that the granting 5of driving privileges, in a manner consistent with public 6safety, is warranted during the period of suspension in the 7form of a monitoring device driving permit. A person who 8drives and fails to comply with the requirements of the 9monitoring device driving permit commits a violation of 10Section 6-303 of this Code. 11    The following procedures shall apply whenever a first 12offender, as defined in Section 11-500 of this Code, is 13arrested for any offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a 14similar provision of a local ordinance and is subject to the 15provisions of Section 11-501.1 or is suspended pursuant to 16Section 11-501.6 of this Code:17    (a) Upon mailing of the notice of suspension of driving 18privileges as provided in subsection (h) of Section 11-501.1 19or subsection (d) of Section 11-501.6 of this Code, the 20Secretary shall also send written notice informing the person 21that he or she will be issued a monitoring device driving 22permit (MDDP).
