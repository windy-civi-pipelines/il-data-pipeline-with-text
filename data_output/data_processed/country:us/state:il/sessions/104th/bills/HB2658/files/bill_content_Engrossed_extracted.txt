If the   HB2658 Engrossed- 36 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1Secretary of State does not rescind the order and the use of 2alcohol or other drugs is not stated as an element of the 3offense, the Secretary may upon application, to relieve undue 4hardship (as defined by the rules of the Secretary of State), 5issue a restricted driving permit granting the privilege of 6driving a motor vehicle between the petitioner's residence and 7petitioner's place of employment or within the scope of the 8petitioner's employment-related duties, or to allow the 9petitioner to transport himself or herself, or a family member 10of the petitioner's household to a medical facility, to 11receive necessary medical care, to allow the petitioner to 12transport himself or herself to and from alcohol or drug 13remedial or rehabilitative activity recommended by a licensed 14service provider, or to allow the petitioner to transport 15himself or herself or a family member of the petitioner's 16household to classes, as a student, at an accredited 17educational institution, or to allow the petitioner to 18transport children, elderly persons, or persons with 19disabilities who do not hold driving privileges and are living 20in the petitioner's household to and from daycare. The 21petitioner must demonstrate that no alternative means of 22transportation is reasonably available and that the petitioner 23will not endanger the public safety or welfare. If a person is 24convicted of any offenses enumerated in this Section and the 25use of alcohol or other drugs is stated as an element of the 26offense, the Secretary may in the Secretary's discretion, upon   HB2658 Engrossed- 37 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1application, issue to the person a restricted driving permit 2granting the privilege of driving a motor vehicle without 3regard to hardship under the parameters set forth by the 4Secretary. The Secretary may adopt administrative rules for 5the issuance of other types of restricted driving permits that 6may be issued prior to and after eligibility date for 7reinstatement in order to protect and further the public 8safety and welfare. 9        (A) If a person's license, or permit, or driving 10    privilege is revoked or suspended due to one 2 or more 11    convictions of violating Section 11-501 of this Code or a 12    similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar 13    out-of-state offense or a similar offense committed on a 14    military installation, or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code 15    of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of 16    alcohol or other drugs is stated recited as an element of 17    the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense, or a 18    similar offense committed on a military installation, or a 19    combination of these offenses, arising out of separate 20    occurrences, that person, if issued a restricted driving 21    permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been 22    equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in 23    Section 1-129.1.24        (B) If a person's license, or permit, or driving 25    privilege is revoked or suspended 2 or more times due to 26    any combination of:  HB2658 Engrossed- 38 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1            (i) a single conviction of violating Section 2        11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local 3        ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense or a 4        similar offense committed on a military installation 5        or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the 6        Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or 7        other drugs is stated recited as an element of the 8        offense, or a similar out-of-state offense or a 9        similar offense committed on a military installation; 10        or11            (ii) a statutory summary suspension or revocation 12        under Section 11-501.1 or a suspension under paragraph 13        (6) of subsection (a) of Section 6-206 where alcohol 14        or other drugs is stated as an element of the offense 15        or a suspension under paragraph (31) of subsection (a) 16        of Section 6-206; or17            (iii) a suspension under Section 6-203.1;18            (iv) a single disposition of court supervision of 19        violating Section 11-501 or a similar provision of a 20        local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense; or 21            (v) a single conviction or disposition of court 22        supervision of violating Section 11-503, a similar 23        provision of a local ordinance or a similar 24        out-of-state offense if the original charge was a 25        violation of Section 11-501 or a similar provision of 26        a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense;   HB2658 Engrossed- 39 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1    arising out of separate occurrences; that person, if 2    issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a 3    vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition 4    interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.5        (B-5) If a person's license, or permit, or driving 6    privilege is revoked or suspended due to a conviction for 7    a violation of subparagraph (C) or (F) of paragraph (1) of 8    subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of this Code, or a 9    similar provision of a local ordinance or similar 10    out-of-state offense or a similar offense committed on a 11    military installation, that person, if issued a restricted 12    driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has 13    been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined 14    in Section 1-129.1. 15        (C) The person issued a permit conditioned upon the 16    use of an ignition interlock device must pay to the 17    Secretary of State DUI Administration Fund an amount not 18    to exceed $30 per month. The Secretary shall establish by 19    rule the amount and the procedures, terms, and conditions 20    relating to these fees.21        (D) The Secretary may grant an employment exception to 22    If the restricted driving permit is issued for employment 23    purposes, then the prohibition against operating a motor 24    vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock 25    device to a person operating does not apply to the 26    operation of an occupational vehicle owned or leased by   HB2658 Engrossed- 40 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1    that person's employer when used solely for employment 2    purposes. For any person who, within a 5-year period, is 3    convicted of a second or subsequent offense under Section 4    11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local 5    ordinance or similar out-of-state offense or a similar 6    offense committed on a military installation, this 7    employment exemption does not apply until either a 8    one-year period has elapsed during which that person had 9    his or her driving privileges revoked or a one-year period 10    has elapsed during which that person had a restricted 11    driving permit which required the use of an ignition 12    interlock device on every motor vehicle owned or operated 13    by that person.14        (E) In each case the Secretary may issue a restricted 15    driving permit for a period deemed appropriate, except 16    that all permits shall expire no later than 2 years from 17    the date of issuance. A restricted driving permit issued 18    under this Section shall be subject to cancellation, 19    revocation, and suspension by the Secretary of State in 20    like manner and for like cause as a driver's license 21    issued under this Code may be cancelled, revoked, or 22    suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more 23    offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the 24    movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for 25    the revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a 26    restricted driving permit. The Secretary of State may, as   HB2658 Engrossed- 41 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1    a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving 2    permit, require the applicant to participate in a 3    designated driver remedial or rehabilitative program. The 4    Secretary of State is authorized to cancel a restricted 5    driving permit if the permit holder does not successfully 6    complete the program.7        (F) A person subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 8    of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code may make 9    application for a restricted driving permit at a hearing 10    conducted under Section 2-118 of this Code after the 11    expiration of 5 years from the effective date of the most 12    recent revocation or after 5 years from the date of 13    release from a period of imprisonment resulting from a 14    conviction of the most recent offense, whichever is later, 15    provided the person, in addition to all other requirements 16    of the Secretary, shows by clear and convincing evidence: 17            (i) a minimum of 3 years of uninterrupted 18        abstinence from alcohol and the unlawful use or 19        consumption of cannabis under the Cannabis Control 20        Act, a controlled substance under the Illinois 21        Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound 22        under the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or 23        methamphetamine under the Methamphetamine Control and 24        Community Protection Act; and25            (ii) the successful completion of any 26        rehabilitative treatment and involvement in any   HB2658 Engrossed- 42 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1        ongoing rehabilitative activity that may be 2        recommended by a properly licensed service provider 3        according to an assessment of the person's alcohol or 4        drug use under Section 11-501.01 of this Code. 5        In determining whether an applicant is eligible for a 6    restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F), the 7    Secretary may consider any relevant evidence, including, 8    but not limited to, testimony, affidavits, records, and 9    the results of regular alcohol or drug tests. Persons 10    subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of subsection (b) 11    of Section 6-208 of this Code and who have been convicted 12    of more than one violation of paragraph (3), paragraph 13    (4), or paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of Section 11-501 14    of this Code shall not be eligible to apply for a 15    restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F). 16        A restricted driving permit issued under this 17    subparagraph (F) shall provide that the holder may only 18    operate motor vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock 19    device as required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) 20    of Section 6-205 of this Code and subparagraph (A) of 21    paragraph 3 of subsection (c) of this Section. The 22    Secretary may revoke a restricted driving permit or amend 23    the conditions of a restricted driving permit issued under 24    this subparagraph (F) if the holder operates a vehicle 25    that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device, or 26    for any other reason authorized under this Code.   HB2658 Engrossed- 43 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1        A restricted driving permit issued under this 2    subparagraph (F) shall be revoked, and the holder barred 3    from applying for or being issued a restricted driving 4    permit in the future, if the holder is convicted of a 5    violation of Section 11-501 of this Code, a similar 6    provision of a local ordinance, or a similar offense in 7    another state or on a military installation. 8    (c-3) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of 9subsection (a), reports received by the Secretary of State 10under this Section shall, except during the actual time the 11suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for use 12only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, 13the driver licensing administrator of any other state, the 14Secretary of State, or the parent or legal guardian of a driver 15under the age of 18. However, beginning January 1, 2008, if the 16person is a CDL holder, the suspension shall also be made 17available to the driver licensing administrator of any other 18state, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the affected 19driver or motor carrier or prospective motor carrier upon 20request. 21    (c-4) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of 22subsection (a), the Secretary of State shall notify the person 23by mail that his or her driving privileges and driver's 24license will be suspended one month after the date of the 25mailing of the notice. 26    (c-5) The Secretary of State may, as a condition of the   HB2658 Engrossed- 44 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1reissuance of a driver's license or permit to an applicant 2whose driver's license or permit has been suspended before he 3or she reached the age of 21 years pursuant to any of the 4provisions of this Section, require the applicant to 5participate in a driver remedial education course and be 6retested under Section 6-109 of this Code.7    (d) This Section is subject to the provisions of the 8Driver License Compact.9    (e) The Secretary of State shall not issue a restricted 10driving permit to a person under the age of 16 years whose 11driving privileges have been suspended or revoked under any 12provisions of this Code.13    (f) In accordance with 49 CFR 384, the Secretary of State 14may not issue a restricted driving permit for the operation of 15a commercial motor vehicle to a person holding a CDL whose 16driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, cancelled, or 17disqualified under any provisions of this Code.18(Source: P.A. 102-299, eff. 8-6-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 19102-749, eff. 1-1-23; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-982, eff. 207-1-23; 103-154, eff. 6-30-23; 103-822, eff. 1-1-25.) 21    (625 ILCS 5/6-206.1)  (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 6-206.1)22    Sec. 6-206.1. Monitoring Device Driving Permit. 23Declaration of Policy. It is hereby declared a policy of the 24State of Illinois that the driver who is impaired by alcohol, 25other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds is   HB2658 Engrossed- 45 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1a threat to the public safety and welfare. Therefore, to 2provide a deterrent to such practice, a statutory summary 3driver's license suspension or suspension pursuant to Section 411-501.6 of this Code is appropriate. It is also recognized 5that driving is a privilege and therefore, that the granting 6of driving privileges, in a manner consistent with public 7safety, is warranted during the period of suspension in the 8form of a monitoring device driving permit. A person who 9drives and fails to comply with the requirements of the 10monitoring device driving permit commits a violation of 11Section 6-303 of this Code. 12    The following procedures shall apply whenever a first 13offender, as defined in Section 11-500 of this Code, is 14arrested for any offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a 15similar provision of a local ordinance and is subject to the 16provisions of Section 11-501.1 or is suspended pursuant to 17Section 11-501.6 of this Code:18    (a) Upon mailing of the notice of suspension of driving 19privileges as provided in subsection (h) of Section 11-501.1 20or subsection (d) of Section 11-501.6 of this Code, the 21Secretary shall also send written notice informing the person 22that he or she will be issued a monitoring device driving 23permit (MDDP). The notice shall include, at minimum, 24information summarizing the procedure to be followed for 25issuance of the MDDP, installation of the breath alcohol 26ignition installation device (BAIID), as provided in this   HB2658 Engrossed- 46 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1Section, exemption from BAIID installation requirements, and 2procedures to be followed by those seeking indigent status, as 3provided in this Section. The notice shall also include 4information summarizing the procedure to be followed if the 5person wishes to decline issuance of the MDDP. A copy of the 6notice shall also be sent to the court of venue together with 7the notice of suspension of driving privileges, as provided in 8subsection (h) of Section 11-501. However, a MDDP shall not be 9issued if the Secretary finds that: 10        (1) the offender's driver's license is otherwise 11    invalid;12        (2) death or great bodily harm to another resulted 13    from the arrest for Section 11-501 or from the crash that 14    resulted in the suspension pursuant to Section 11-501.6;15        (3) the offender has been previously convicted of 16    reckless homicide or aggravated driving under the 17    influence involving death; or18        (4) the offender is less than 18 years of age. 19    Any offender participating in the MDDP program must pay 20the Secretary a MDDP Administration Fee in an amount not to 21exceed $30 per month, to be deposited into the Monitoring 22Device Driving Permit Administration Fee Fund. The Secretary 23shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, 24and conditions relating to these fees. The offender must have 25an ignition interlock device installed within 14 days of the 26date the Secretary issues the MDDP. The ignition interlock   HB2658 Engrossed- 47 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1device provider must notify the Secretary, in a manner and 2form prescribed by the Secretary, of the installation. If the 3Secretary does not receive notice of installation, the 4Secretary shall cancel the MDDP. 5    Upon receipt of the notice, as provided in paragraph (a) 6of this Section, the person may file a petition to decline 7issuance of the MDDP with the court of venue. The court shall 8admonish the offender of all consequences of declining 9issuance of the MDDP including, but not limited to, the 10enhanced penalties for driving while suspended. After being so 11admonished, the offender shall be permitted, in writing, to 12execute a notice declining issuance of the MDDP. This notice 13shall be filed with the court and forwarded by the clerk of the 14court to the Secretary. The offender may, at any time 15thereafter, apply to the Secretary for issuance of a MDDP. 16    (a-1) A person issued a MDDP may drive for any purpose and 17at any time, subject to the rules adopted by the Secretary 18under subsection (g). The person must, at his or her own 19expense, drive only vehicles equipped with an ignition 20interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1, but in no 21event shall such person drive a commercial motor vehicle.22    (a-2) Persons who are issued a MDDP and must drive 23employer-owned vehicles in the course of their employment 24duties may seek permission to drive an employer-owned vehicle 25that does not have an ignition interlock device. The employer 26shall provide to the Secretary a form, as prescribed by the   HB2658 Engrossed- 48 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1Secretary, completed by the employer verifying that the 2employee must drive an employer-owned vehicle in the course of 3employment. If approved by the Secretary, the form must be in 4the driver's possession while operating an employer-owner 5vehicle not equipped with an ignition interlock device. No 6person may use this exemption to drive a school bus, school 7vehicle, or a vehicle designed to transport more than 15 8passengers. No person may use this exemption to drive an 9employer-owned motor vehicle that is owned by an entity that 10is wholly or partially owned by the person holding the MDDP, or 11by a family member of the person holding the MDDP. No person 12may use this exemption to drive an employer-owned vehicle that 13is made available to the employee for personal use. No person 14may drive the exempted vehicle more than 12 hours per day, 6 15days per week. 16    (a-3) Persons who are issued a MDDP and who must drive a 17farm tractor to and from a farm, within 50 air miles from the 18originating farm are exempt from installation of a BAIID on 19the farm tractor, so long as the farm tractor is being used for 20the exclusive purpose of conducting farm operations. 21    (b) (Blank).22    (c) (Blank). 23    (c-1) If the holder of the MDDP is convicted of or receives 24court supervision for a violation of Section 6-206.2, 6-303, 2511-204, 11-204.1, 11-401, 11-501, 11-503, 11-506 or a similar 26provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state   HB2658 Engrossed- 49 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1offense or is convicted of or receives court supervision for 2any offense for which alcohol or drugs is an element of the 3offense and in which a motor vehicle was involved (for an 4arrest other than the one for which the MDDP is issued), or 5de-installs the BAIID without prior authorization from the 6Secretary, the MDDP shall be cancelled.7    (c-5) If the Secretary determines that the person seeking 8the MDDP is indigent, the Secretary shall provide the person 9with a written document as evidence of that determination, and 10the person shall provide that written document to an ignition 11interlock device provider. The provider shall install an 12ignition interlock device on that person's vehicle without 13charge to the person, and seek reimbursement from the Indigent 14BAIID Fund. If the Secretary has deemed an offender indigent, 15the BAIID provider shall also provide the normal monthly 16monitoring services and the de-installation without charge to 17the offender and seek reimbursement from the Indigent BAIID 18Fund. Any other monetary charges, such as a lockout fee or 19reset fee, shall be the responsibility of the MDDP holder. A 20BAIID provider may not seek a security deposit from the 21Indigent BAIID Fund. 22    (d) MDDP information shall be available only to the 23courts, police officers, and the Secretary, except during the 24actual period the MDDP is valid, during which time it shall be 25a public record.26    (e) (Blank).  HB2658 Engrossed- 50 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1    (f) (Blank).2    (g) The Secretary shall adopt rules for implementing this 3Section. The rules adopted shall address issues including, but 4not limited to: compliance with the requirements of the MDDP; 5methods for determining compliance with those requirements; 6the consequences of noncompliance with those requirements; 7what constitutes a violation of the MDDP; methods for 8determining indigency; and the duties of a person or entity 9that supplies the ignition interlock device.10    (h) The rules adopted under subsection (g) shall provide, 11at a minimum, that the person is not in compliance with the 12requirements of the MDDP if he or she:13        (1) tampers or attempts to tamper with or circumvent 14    the proper operation of the ignition interlock device;15        (2) provides valid breath samples that register blood 16    alcohol levels in excess of the number of times allowed 17    under the rules;18        (3) fails to provide evidence sufficient to satisfy 19    the Secretary that the ignition interlock device has been 20    installed in the designated vehicle or vehicles; or21        (4) fails to follow any other applicable rules adopted 22    by the Secretary.23    (i) Any person or entity that supplies an ignition 24interlock device as provided under this Section shall, in 25addition to supplying only those devices which fully comply 26with all the rules adopted under subsection (g), provide the   HB2658 Engrossed- 51 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1Secretary, within 7 days of inspection, all monitoring reports 2of each person who has had an ignition interlock device 3installed. These reports shall be furnished in a manner or 4form as prescribed by the Secretary.5    (j) Upon making a determination that a violation of the 6requirements of the MDDP has occurred, the Secretary shall 7extend the summary suspension period for an additional 3 8months beyond the originally imposed summary suspension 9period, during which time the person shall only be allowed to 10drive vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device; 11provided further there are no limitations on the total number 12of times the summary suspension may be extended. The Secretary 13may, however, limit the number of extensions imposed for 14violations occurring during any one monitoring period, as set 15forth by rule. Any person whose summary suspension is extended 16pursuant to this Section shall have the right to contest the 17extension through a hearing with the Secretary, pursuant to 18Section 2-118 of this Code. If the summary suspension has 19already terminated prior to the Secretary receiving the 20monitoring report that shows a violation, the Secretary shall 21be authorized to suspend the person's driving privileges for 3 22months, provided that the Secretary may, by rule, limit the 23number of suspensions to be entered pursuant to this paragraph 24for violations occurring during any one monitoring period. Any 25person whose license is suspended pursuant to this paragraph, 26after the summary suspension had already terminated, shall   HB2658 Engrossed- 52 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1have the right to contest the suspension through a hearing 2with the Secretary, pursuant to Section 2-118 of this Code. 3The only permit the person shall be eligible for during this 4new suspension period is a MDDP.5    (k) A person who has had his or her summary suspension 6extended for the third time, or has any combination of 3 7extensions and new suspensions, entered as a result of a 8violation that occurred while holding the MDDP, so long as the 9extensions and new suspensions relate to the same summary 10suspension, shall have his or her vehicle impounded for a 11period of 30 days, at the person's own expense. A person who 12has his or her summary suspension extended for the fourth 13time, or has any combination of 4 extensions and new 14suspensions, entered as a result of a violation that occurred 15while holding the MDDP, so long as the extensions and new 16suspensions relate to the same summary suspension, shall have 17his or her vehicle subject to seizure and forfeiture. The 18Secretary shall notify the prosecuting authority of any third 19or fourth extensions or new suspension entered as a result of a 20violation that occurred while the person held a MDDP. Upon 21receipt of the notification, the prosecuting authority shall 22impound or forfeit the vehicle. The impoundment or forfeiture 23of a vehicle shall be conducted pursuant to the procedure 24specified in Article 36 of the Criminal Code of 2012.25    (l) A person whose driving privileges have been suspended 26under Section 11-501.1 or Section 11-501.6 of this Code and   HB2658 Engrossed- 53 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1who had a MDDP that was cancelled, or would have been cancelled 2had notification of a violation been received prior to 3expiration of the MDDP, pursuant to subsection (c-1) of this 4Section, shall not be eligible for reinstatement when the 5summary suspension is scheduled to terminate. Instead, the 6person's driving privileges shall be suspended for a period of 7not less than twice the original summary suspension period, or 8for the length of any extensions entered under subsection (j), 9whichever is longer. During the period of suspension, the 10person shall be eligible only to apply for a restricted 11driving permit. If a restricted driving permit is granted, the 12offender may only operate vehicles equipped with a BAIID in 13accordance with this Section.14    (m) Any person or entity that supplies an ignition 15interlock device under this Section shall, for each ignition 16interlock device installed, pay 5% of the total gross revenue 17received for the device, including monthly monitoring fees, 18into the Indigent BAIID Fund. This 5% shall be clearly 19indicated as a separate surcharge on each invoice that is 20issued. The Secretary shall conduct an annual review of the 21fund to determine whether the surcharge is sufficient to 22provide for indigent users. The Secretary may increase or 23decrease this surcharge requirement as needed.24    (n) Any person or entity that supplies an ignition 25interlock device under this Section that is requested to 26provide an ignition interlock device to a person who presents   HB2658 Engrossed- 54 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1written documentation of indigency from the Secretary, as 2provided in subsection (c-5) of this Section, shall install 3the device on the person's vehicle without charge to the 4person and shall seek reimbursement from the Indigent BAIID 5Fund.6    (o) The Indigent BAIID Fund is created as a special fund in 7the State treasury. The Secretary shall, subject to 8appropriation by the General Assembly, use all money in the 9Indigent BAIID Fund to reimburse ignition interlock device 10providers who have installed devices in vehicles of indigent 11persons.

A restricted driving permit issued 18    under this Section shall be subject to cancellation, 19    revocation, and suspension by the Secretary of State in 20    like manner and for like cause as a driver's license 21    issued under this Code may be cancelled, revoked, or 22    suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more 23    offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the 24    movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for 25    the revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a 26    restricted driving permit.

Monitoring Device Driving Permit. 23Declaration of Policy. It is hereby declared a policy of the 24State of Illinois that the driver who is impaired by alcohol, 25other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds is   HB2658 Engrossed- 45 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1a threat to the public safety and welfare. Therefore, to 2provide a deterrent to such practice, a statutory summary 3driver's license suspension or suspension pursuant to Section 411-501.6 of this Code is appropriate. It is also recognized 5that driving is a privilege and therefore, that the granting 6of driving privileges, in a manner consistent with public 7safety, is warranted during the period of suspension in the 8form of a monitoring device driving permit. A person who 9drives and fails to comply with the requirements of the 10monitoring device driving permit commits a violation of 11Section 6-303 of this Code. 12    The following procedures shall apply whenever a first 13offender, as defined in Section 11-500 of this Code, is 14arrested for any offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a 15similar provision of a local ordinance and is subject to the 16provisions of Section 11-501.1 or is suspended pursuant to 17Section 11-501.6 of this Code:18    (a) Upon mailing of the notice of suspension of driving 19privileges as provided in subsection (h) of Section 11-501.1 20or subsection (d) of Section 11-501.6 of this Code, the 21Secretary shall also send written notice informing the person 22that he or she will be issued a monitoring device driving 23permit (MDDP). The notice shall include, at minimum, 24information summarizing the procedure to be followed for 25issuance of the MDDP, installation of the breath alcohol 26ignition installation device (BAIID), as provided in this   HB2658 Engrossed- 46 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1Section, exemption from BAIID installation requirements, and 2procedures to be followed by those seeking indigent status, as 3provided in this Section. The notice shall also include 4information summarizing the procedure to be followed if the 5person wishes to decline issuance of the MDDP. A copy of the 6notice shall also be sent to the court of venue together with 7the notice of suspension of driving privileges, as provided in 8subsection (h) of Section 11-501. However, a MDDP shall not be 9issued if the Secretary finds that: 10        (1) the offender's driver's license is otherwise 11    invalid;12        (2) death or great bodily harm to another resulted 13    from the arrest for Section 11-501 or from the crash that 14    resulted in the suspension pursuant to Section 11-501.6;15        (3) the offender has been previously convicted of 16    reckless homicide or aggravated driving under the 17    influence involving death; or18        (4) the offender is less than 18 years of age. 19    Any offender participating in the MDDP program must pay 20the Secretary a MDDP Administration Fee in an amount not to 21exceed $30 per month, to be deposited into the Monitoring 22Device Driving Permit Administration Fee Fund. The Secretary 23shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, 24and conditions relating to these fees. The offender must have 25an ignition interlock device installed within 14 days of the 26date the Secretary issues the MDDP. The ignition interlock   HB2658 Engrossed- 47 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1device provider must notify the Secretary, in a manner and 2form prescribed by the Secretary, of the installation. If the 3Secretary does not receive notice of installation, the 4Secretary shall cancel the MDDP. 5    Upon receipt of the notice, as provided in paragraph (a) 6of this Section, the person may file a petition to decline 7issuance of the MDDP with the court of venue. The court shall 8admonish the offender of all consequences of declining 9issuance of the MDDP including, but not limited to, the 10enhanced penalties for driving while suspended. After being so 11admonished, the offender shall be permitted, in writing, to 12execute a notice declining issuance of the MDDP. This notice 13shall be filed with the court and forwarded by the clerk of the 14court to the Secretary. The offender may, at any time 15thereafter, apply to the Secretary for issuance of a MDDP. 16    (a-1) A person issued a MDDP may drive for any purpose and 17at any time, subject to the rules adopted by the Secretary 18under subsection (g).
