The failure of the 7arresting officer to answer a subpoena shall not, in and of 8itself, be considered grounds for the rescission of an implied 9consent suspension. Rather, the hearing shall proceed on the 10basis of the other evidence available, and the hearing officer 11shall assign this evidence whatever probative value is deemed 12appropriate. The decision whether to rescind shall be based 13upon the totality of the evidence. 14    (e) The action of the Secretary of State in suspending, 15revoking or denying any license, permit, registration, or 16certificate of title shall be subject to judicial review in 17the Circuit Court of Sangamon County, in the Circuit Court of 18Jefferson County, or in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and 19the provisions of the Administrative Review Law, and all 20amendments and modifications thereto, and the rules adopted 21pursuant thereto, are hereby adopted and shall apply to and 22govern every action for the judicial review of final acts or 23decisions of the Secretary of State hereunder.24(Source: P.A. 99-697, eff. 7-29-16.) 25    (625 ILCS 5/6-205)  HB2658- 5 -LRB104 08651 LNS 18705 b1    Sec. 6-205.
