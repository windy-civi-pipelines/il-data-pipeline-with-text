The 4plan is to be created by an independent consultant, selected 5by the county, and paid for independently by the facility 6developer and shall include the location of any potentially 7impacted drainage district facilities to the extent this 8information is publicly available from the county or the 9drainage district, plans to repair any subsurface drainage 10affected during construction or deconstruction using 11procedures outlined in the agricultural impact mitigation 12agreement entered into by the commercial wind energy facility 13owner or commercial solar energy facility owner, and 14procedures for the repair and restoration of surface drainage 15affected during construction or deconstruction. All surface 16and subsurface damage shall be repaired as soon as reasonably 17practicable. The county and impacted drainage districts shall 18complete review of the farmland drainage plan within 60 days 19after submission of the plan to the county. Upon completion of 20review, the county and impacted drainage districts shall issue 21a written determination to the facility developer either 22approving the plan or specifically identifying the reason for 23denial of the plan. 24    (j-10) In accordance with the Renewable Energy Facilities 25Agricultural Impact Mitigation Act, a facility owner shall 26provide the county in which a commercial solar energy facility   HB3563- 15 -LRB104 09862 RTM 19930 b1or commercial wind energy facility to be located, a 2deconstruction plan that has been prepared by a professional 3engineer, as defined in Section 10 of the Renewable Energy 4Facilities Agricultural Impact Mitigation Act, who has been 5selected by the facility owner. The deconstruction plan shall 6contain information that satisfies each of the components of 7deconstruction as set forth in the definition of 8"deconstruction" and "deconstruction plan" and in the 9construction and deconstruction standards and policies of the 10Department of Agriculture's standard wind farm agricultural 11impact mitigation agreement, template 81818, or standard solar 12agricultural impact mitigation agreement, version 8.19.19, as 13applicable and in effect on December 31, 2022, or the most 14recent version of the mitigation agreements if any subsequent 15version has been adopted after December 31, 2022. The county 16shall have its own professional engineer review the 17deconstruction plan and either approve or reject the 18deconstruction plan within 60 days after a complete submittal. 19If the deconstruction plan is rejected, the county shall 20provide a written statement of the specific reasons for 21rejection. The facility owner may file a revised 22deconstruction plan that addresses the specific reasons that 23led to the rejection of the deconstruction plan. The county 24shall review and act on any revised deconstruction plan within 2530 days after it is resubmitted. The facility owner shall 26reevaluate the estimated costs of deconstruction of any   HB3563- 16 -LRB104 09862 RTM 19930 b1facility after the fifth anniversary, and every 5 years 2thereafter, of the commercial operation date. The facility 3owner shall file with the county on or before the end of the 4fifth year of commercial operation, and then every fifth year 5thereafter, for approval by the county, an updated 6deconstruction plan prepared by a professional engineer who 7has been selected by the county.

If 12the county is unable to perform, to its satisfaction, the 13investigations of the content of the deconstruction plan 14necessary to approve the deconstruction plan filed by the 15facility owner, then the county and facility may mutually 16agree on the selection of a professional engineer independent 17of the facility owner to conduct any necessary investigations 18of the content of the deconstruction plan necessary to approve 19the deconstruction plan. The facility owner shall be 20responsible for the cost of the preparation of the 21deconstruction plan by its professional engineer or any 22independent professional engineer and the cost of any plan 23reviews by the professional engineer selected by the county. A 24commercial solar energy facility owner or commercial wind 25energy facility owner shall provide the county with an 26appropriate financial assurance mechanism consistent with the   HB3563- 17 -LRB104 09862 RTM 19930 b1financial requirements of this subsection, which shall be set 2forth in the Department of Agriculture's standard wind farm 3agricultural impact mitigation agreement, template 81818, or 4standard solar agricultural impact mitigation agreement, 5version 8.19.19, as applicable and in effect on December 31, 62022, or the most recent version of the mitigation agreements 7if any subsequent version has been adopted after December 31, 82022. The financial assurance shall be sufficient to cover the 9estimated costs of public safety or emergency repairs to the 10facility if damage to the facility caused by natural disaster 11or by operational malfunction, and the estimated costs of 12repairs the deconstruction of the facility in the event of 13abandonment of a commercial wind energy facility or 14abandonment of a commercial solar energy facility, as defined 15in Section 10 of the Renewable Energy Facilities Agricultural 16Impact Mitigation Act. The facility owner shall provide the 17county with the initial financial assurance to cover 100% of 18the estimated deconstruction costs prior to the commercial 19operation date. A county may use the financial assurance 20provided by the facility owner to cover public safety or 21emergency repairs that are not timely addressed by the 22facility owner, as determined by the county's designated 23representative. In the event that a county must use a portion 24of the financial assurance to address any public safety or 25emergency repairs or to deconstruct a portion of the facility, 26the facility owner shall replenish the financial assurance for   HB3563- 18 -LRB104 09862 RTM 19930 b1the amount used within 60 days after the expenditure of the 2financial assurance consistent with the Department's standard 3agricultural impact mitigation agreement. The purpose of the 4financial assurance shall be for and to assure deconstruction 5in the event of an abandonment of a commercial solar energy 6facility or commercial wind energy facility or to cover the 7estimated costs of public safety or emergency repairs to the 8facility in the event of damage to the facility caused by 9natural disaster or operational malfunction. 10    (k) A county may not condition approval of a commercial 11wind energy facility or commercial solar energy facility on a 12property value guarantee and may not require a facility owner 13to pay into a neighboring property devaluation escrow account. 14    (l) A county may require certain vegetative screening 15surrounding a commercial wind energy facility or commercial 16solar energy facility but may not require earthen berms or 17similar structures, except that a county may require earth 18berms for ground-based commercial solar energy projects and 19may adopt regulations governing the construction and 20maintenance of such earth berms. 21    (m) A county may set blade tip height limitations for wind 22towers in commercial wind energy facilities but may not set a 23blade tip height limitation that is more restrictive than the 24height allowed under a Determination of No Hazard to Air 25Navigation by the Federal Aviation Administration under 14 CFR 26Part 77.  HB3563- 19 -LRB104 09862 RTM 19930 b1    (n) A county may require that a commercial wind energy 2facility owner or commercial solar energy facility owner 3provide:4        (1) the results and recommendations from consultation 5    with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources that are 6    obtained through the Ecological Compliance Assessment Tool 7    (EcoCAT) or a comparable successor tool; and8        (2) the results of the United States Fish and Wildlife 9    Service's Information for Planning and Consulting 10    environmental review or a comparable successor tool that 11    is consistent with (i) the "U.S. Fish and Wildlife 12    Service's Land-Based Wind Energy Guidelines" and (ii) any 13    applicable United States Fish and Wildlife Service solar 14    wildlife guidelines that have been subject to public 15    review. 16    (o) A county may require a commercial wind energy facility 17or commercial solar energy facility to adhere to the 18recommendations provided by the Illinois Department of Natural 19Resources in an EcoCAT natural resource review report under 17 20Ill.
