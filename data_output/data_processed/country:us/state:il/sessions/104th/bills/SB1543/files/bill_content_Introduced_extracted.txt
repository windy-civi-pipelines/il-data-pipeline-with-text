For purposes of this subparagraph, 6        the taxpayer's separate taxable income shall be 7        determined as if the election provided by Section 8        243(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code had been in 9        effect for all such years;10            (F) Cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative 11        corporation or association, the taxable income of such 12        organization determined in accordance with the 13        provisions of Section 1381 through 1388 of the 14        Internal Revenue Code, but without regard to the 15        prohibition against offsetting losses from patronage 16        activities against income from nonpatronage 17        activities; except that a cooperative corporation or 18        association may make an election to follow its federal 19        income tax treatment of patronage losses and 20        nonpatronage losses. In the event such election is 21        made, such losses shall be computed and carried over 22        in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of Section 23        207 of this Act and apportioned by the apportionment 24        factor reported by the cooperative on its Illinois 25        income tax return filed for the taxable year in which 26        the losses are incurred. The election shall be   SB1543- 104 -LRB104 10140 HLH 20212 b1        effective for all taxable years with original returns 2        due on or after the date of the election. In addition, 3        the cooperative may file an amended return or returns, 4        as allowed under this Act, to provide that the 5        election shall be effective for losses incurred or 6        carried forward for taxable years occurring prior to 7        the date of the election.

In the case of a partnership, 7        taxable income determined in accordance with Section 8        703 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that taxable 9        income shall take into account those items which are 10        required by Section 703(a)(1) to be separately stated 11        but which would be taken into account by an individual 12        in calculating his taxable income.13        (3) Recapture of business expenses on disposition of 14    asset or business. Notwithstanding any other law to the 15    contrary, if in prior years income from an asset or 16    business has been classified as business income and in a 17    later year is demonstrated to be non-business income, then 18    all expenses, without limitation, deducted in such later 19    year and in the 2 immediately preceding taxable years 20    related to that asset or business that generated the 21    non-business income shall be added back and recaptured as 22    business income in the year of the disposition of the 23    asset or business. Such amount shall be apportioned to 24    Illinois using the greater of the apportionment fraction 25    computed for the business under Section 304 of this Act 26    for the taxable year or the average of the apportionment   SB1543- 106 -LRB104 10140 HLH 20212 b1    fractions computed for the business under Section 304 of 2    this Act for the taxable year and for the 2 immediately 3    preceding taxable years.  4    (f) Valuation limitation amount.5        (1) In general. The valuation limitation amount 6    referred to in subsections (a)(2)(G), (c)(2)(I) and 7    (d)(2)(E) is an amount equal to:8            (A) The sum of the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 9        amounts (to the extent consisting of gain reportable 10        under the provisions of Section 1245 or 1250 of the 11        Internal Revenue Code) for all property in respect of 12        which such gain was reported for the taxable year; 13        plus14            (B) The lesser of (i) the sum of the pre-August 1, 15        1969 appreciation amounts (to the extent consisting of 16        capital gain) for all property in respect of which 17        such gain was reported for federal income tax purposes 18        for the taxable year, or (ii) the net capital gain for 19        the taxable year, reduced in either case by any amount 20        of such gain included in the amount determined under 21        subsection (a)(2)(F) or (c)(2)(H).22        (2) Pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation amount.23            (A) If the fair market value of property referred 24        to in paragraph (1) was readily ascertainable on 25        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation   SB1543- 107 -LRB104 10140 HLH 20212 b1        amount for such property is the lesser of (i) the 2        excess of such fair market value over the taxpayer's 3        basis (for determining gain) for such property on that 4        date (determined under the Internal Revenue Code as in 5        effect on that date), or (ii) the total gain realized 6        and reportable for federal income tax purposes in 7        respect of the sale, exchange or other disposition of 8        such property.9            (B) If the fair market value of property referred 10        to in paragraph (1) was not readily ascertainable on 11        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 12        amount for such property is that amount which bears 13        the same ratio to the total gain reported in respect of 14        the property for federal income tax purposes for the 15        taxable year, as the number of full calendar months in 16        that part of the taxpayer's holding period for the 17        property ending July 31, 1969 bears to the number of 18        full calendar months in the taxpayer's entire holding 19        period for the property.20            (C) The Department shall prescribe such 21        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the 22        purposes of this paragraph. 23    (g) Double deductions. Unless specifically provided 24otherwise, nothing in this Section shall permit the same item 25to be deducted more than once.   SB1543- 108 -LRB104 10140 HLH 20212 b1    (h) Legislative intention. Except as expressly provided by 2this Section there shall be no modifications or limitations on 3the amounts of income, gain, loss or deduction taken into 4account in determining gross income, adjusted gross income or 5taxable income for federal income tax purposes for the taxable 6year, or in the amount of such items entering into the 7computation of base income and net income under this Act for 8such taxable year, whether in respect of property values as of 9August 1, 1969 or otherwise.10(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 11102-658, eff. 8-27-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-1112, eff. 1212-21-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23; 103-478, eff. 1-1-24; 103-592, 13Article 10, Section 10-900, eff. 6-7-24; 103-592, Article 170, 14Section 170-90, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24; 103-647, 15eff. 7-1-24; revised 8-20-24.) 16    Section 99.

The addition modification 20        required by this subparagraph shall be reduced to the 21        extent that dividends were included in base income of 22        the unitary group for the same taxable year and 23        received by the taxpayer or by a member of the 24        taxpayer's unitary business group (including amounts 25        included in gross income under Sections 951 through 26        964 of the Internal Revenue Code and amounts included   SB1543- 5 -LRB104 10140 HLH 20212 b1        in gross income under Section 78 of the Internal 2        Revenue Code) with respect to the stock of the same 3        person to whom the interest was paid, accrued, or 4        incurred.5            This paragraph shall not apply to the following: 6                (i) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 7            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person who 8            is subject in a foreign country or state, other 9            than a state which requires mandatory unitary 10            reporting, to a tax on or measured by net income 11            with respect to such interest; or12                (ii) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 13            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 14            the taxpayer can establish, based on a 15            preponderance of the evidence, both of the 16            following:17                    (a) the person, during the same taxable 18                year, paid, accrued, or incurred, the interest 19                to a person that is not a related member, and20                    (b) the transaction giving rise to the 21                interest expense between the taxpayer and the 22                person did not have as a principal purpose the 23                avoidance of Illinois income tax, and is paid 24                pursuant to a contract or agreement that 25                reflects an arm's-length interest rate and 26                terms; or   SB1543- 6 -LRB104 10140 HLH 20212 b1                (iii) the taxpayer can establish, based on 2            clear and convincing evidence, that the interest 3            paid, accrued, or incurred relates to a contract 4            or agreement entered into at arm's-length rates 5            and terms and the principal purpose for the 6            payment is not federal or Illinois tax avoidance; 7            or 8                (iv) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 9            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 10            the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing 11            evidence that the adjustments are unreasonable; or 12            if the taxpayer and the Director agree in writing 13            to the application or use of an alternative method 14            of apportionment under Section 304(f). 15                Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the 16            Director from making any other adjustment 17            otherwise allowed under Section 404 of this Act 18            for any tax year beginning after the effective 19            date of this amendment provided such adjustment is 20            made pursuant to regulation adopted by the 21            Department and such regulations provide methods 22            and standards by which the Department will utilize 23            its authority under Section 404 of this Act; 24            (D-18) An amount equal to the amount of intangible 25        expenses and costs otherwise allowed as a deduction in 26        computing base income, and that were paid, accrued, or   SB1543- 7 -LRB104 10140 HLH 20212 b1        incurred, directly or indirectly, (i) for taxable 2        years ending on or after December 31, 2004, to a 3        foreign person who would be a member of the same 4        unitary business group but for the fact that the 5        foreign person's business activity outside the United 6        States is 80% or more of that person's total business 7        activity and (ii) for taxable years ending on or after 8        December 31, 2008, to a person who would be a member of 9        the same unitary business group but for the fact that 10        the person is prohibited under Section 1501(a)(27) 11        from being included in the unitary business group 12        because he or she is ordinarily required to apportion 13        business income under different subsections of Section 14        304. The addition modification required by this 15        subparagraph shall be reduced to the extent that 16        dividends were included in base income of the unitary 17        group for the same taxable year and received by the 18        taxpayer or by a member of the taxpayer's unitary 19        business group (including amounts included in gross 20        income under Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal 21        Revenue Code and amounts included in gross income 22        under Section 78 of the Internal Revenue Code) with 23        respect to the stock of the same person to whom the 24        intangible expenses and costs were directly or 25        indirectly paid, incurred, or accrued.
