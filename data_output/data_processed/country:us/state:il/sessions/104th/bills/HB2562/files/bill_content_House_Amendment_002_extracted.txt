The guardian shall assist the ward in 4the development of maximum self-reliance and independence. The 5guardian of the person may petition the court for an order 6directing the guardian of the estate to pay an amount 7periodically for the provision of the services specified by 8the court order. If the ward's estate is insufficient to 9provide for education and the guardian of the ward's person 10fails to provide education, the court may award the custody of 11the ward to some other person for the purpose of providing 12education. If a person makes a settlement upon or provision 13for the support or education of a ward, the court may make an 14order for the visitation of the ward by the person making the 15settlement or provision as the court deems proper. A guardian 16of the person may not admit a ward to a mental health facility 17except at the ward's request as provided in Article IV of the 18Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code and unless 19the ward has the capacity to consent to such admission as 20provided in Article IV of the Mental Health and Developmental 21Disabilities Code. 22    (a-3) If a guardian of an estate has not been appointed, 23the guardian of the person may, without an order of court, 24open, maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on 25behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent 26children as specified under Section 16.6 of the State   10400HB2562ham002- 3 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1Treasurer Act. 2    (a-5) If the ward filed a petition for dissolution of 3marriage under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 4Marriage Act before the ward was adjudicated a person with a 5disability under this Article, the guardian of the ward's 6person and estate may maintain that action for dissolution of 7marriage on behalf of the ward. Upon petition by the guardian 8of the ward's person or estate, the court may authorize and 9direct a guardian of the ward's person or estate to file a 10petition for dissolution of marriage or to file a petition for 11legal separation or declaration of invalidity of marriage 12under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act on 13behalf of the ward if the court finds by clear and convincing 14evidence that the relief sought is in the ward's best 15interests. In making its determination, the court shall 16consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 17Section.18    (a-10) Upon petition by the guardian of the ward's person 19or estate, the court may authorize and direct a guardian of the 20ward's person or estate to consent, on behalf of the ward, to 21the ward's marriage pursuant to Part II of the Illinois 22Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act if the court finds by 23clear and convincing evidence that the marriage is in the 24ward's best interests. In making its determination, the court 25shall consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of 26this Section. Upon presentation of a court order authorizing   10400HB2562ham002- 4 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1and directing a guardian of the ward's person and estate to 2consent to the ward's marriage, the county clerk shall accept 3the guardian's application, appearance, and signature on 4behalf of the ward for purposes of issuing a license to marry 5under Section 203 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 6Marriage Act. 7    (b) If the court directs, the guardian of the person shall 8file with the court at intervals indicated by the court, a 9report that shall state briefly: (1) the current mental, 10physical, and social condition of the ward and the ward's 11minor and adult dependent children; (2) their present living 12arrangement, and a description and the address of every 13residence where they lived during the reporting period and the 14length of stay at each place; (3) a summary of the medical, 15educational, vocational, and other professional services given 16to them; (4) a resume of the guardian's visits with and 17activities on behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult 18dependent children; (5) a recommendation as to the need for 19continued guardianship; (6) any other information requested by 20the court or useful in the opinion of the guardian. The Office 21of the State Guardian shall assist the guardian in filing the 22report when requested by the guardian. The court may take such 23action as it deems appropriate pursuant to the report.24    (c) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of 25Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 26principal under an agency that survives disability, the   10400HB2562ham002- 5 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1guardian has no power, duty, or liability with respect to any 2personal or health care matters covered by the agency. If the 3Office of State Guardian or a public guardian is appointed, 4all powers of attorney are suspended under subsection (g-1) of 5Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. This 6subsection (c) applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever 7executed.8    (d) A guardian acting as a surrogate decision maker under 9the Health Care Surrogate Act shall have all the rights of a 10surrogate under that Act without court order including the 11right to make medical treatment decisions such as decisions to 12forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Any decisions by 13the guardian to forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment 14that are not authorized under the Health Care Surrogate Act 15shall require a court order. Nothing in this Section shall 16prevent an agent acting under a power of attorney for health 17care from exercising his or her authority under the Illinois 18Power of Attorney Act without further court order, unless a 19court has acted under Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of 20Attorney Act. If a guardian is also a health care agent for the 21ward under a valid power of attorney for health care, the 22guardian acting as agent may execute his or her authority 23under that act without further court order.24    (e) Decisions made by a guardian on behalf of a ward shall 25be made in accordance with the following standards for 26decision making. The guardian shall consider the ward's   10400HB2562ham002- 6 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1current preferences to the extent the ward has the ability to 2participate in decision making when those preferences are 3known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. Decisions 4by the guardian shall conform to the ward's current 5preferences: (1) unless the guardian reasonably believes that 6doing so would result in substantial harm to the ward's 7welfare or personal or financial interests; and (2) so long as 8such decisions give substantial weight to what the ward, if 9competent, would have done or intended under the 10circumstances, taking into account evidence that includes, but 11is not limited to, the ward's personal, philosophical, 12religious and moral beliefs, and ethical values relative to 13the decision to be made by the guardian. Where possible, the 14guardian shall determine how the ward would have made a 15decision based on the ward's previously expressed preferences, 16and make decisions in accordance with the preferences of the 17ward. If the ward's wishes are unknown and remain unknown 18after reasonable efforts to discern them, or if the guardian 19reasonably believes that a decision made in conformity with 20the ward's preferences would result in substantial harm to the 21ward's welfare or personal or financial interests, the 22decision shall be made on the basis of the ward's best 23interests as determined by the guardian. In determining the 24ward's best interests, the guardian shall weigh the reason for 25and nature of the proposed action, the benefit or necessity of 26the action, the possible risks and other consequences of the   10400HB2562ham002- 7 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1proposed action, and any available alternatives and their 2risks, consequences and benefits, and shall take into account 3any other information, including the views of family and 4friends, that the guardian believes the ward would have 5considered if able to act for herself or himself.6    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the 7standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 8interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 9court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 10disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 11a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 12orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 13interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 14termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 15short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 16petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 17with a disability.18    (g)(1) Unless there is a court order to the contrary, the 19guardian, consistent with the standards set forth in 20subsection (e) of this Section, shall use reasonable efforts 21to notify the ward's known adult children, who have requested 22notification and provided contact information, of the ward's 23admission to a hospital, hospice, or palliative care program, 24the ward's death, and the arrangements for the disposition of 25the ward's remains.26    (2) If a guardian unreasonably prevents an adult child,   10400HB2562ham002- 8 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or adult sibling of the ward 2from visiting the ward, the court, upon a verified petition, 3may order the guardian to permit visitation between the ward 4and the adult child, spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or 5adult sibling. In making its determination, the court shall 6consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 7Section. The court shall not allow visitation if the court 8finds that the ward has capacity to evaluate and communicate 9decisions regarding visitation and expresses a desire not to 10have visitation with the petitioner. This subsection (g) does 11not apply to duly appointed public guardians or the Office of 12State Guardian.13(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22; 14102-258, eff. 8-6-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.) 15    (755 ILCS 5/11a-18)  (from Ch. 110 1/2, par. 11a-18)16    Sec. 11a-18. Duties of the estate guardian. 17    (a) To the extent specified in the order establishing the 18guardianship, the guardian of the estate shall have the care, 19management and investment of the estate, shall manage the 20estate frugally and shall apply the income and principal of 21the estate so far as necessary for the comfort and suitable 22support and education of the ward, his minor and adult 23dependent children, and persons related by blood or marriage 24who are dependent upon or entitled to support from him, or for 25any other purpose which the court deems to be for the best   10400HB2562ham002- 9 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1interests of the ward, and the court may approve the making on 2behalf of the ward of such agreements as the court determines 3to be for the ward's best interests. The guardian may make 4disbursement of his ward's funds and estate directly to the 5ward or other distributee or in such other manner and in such 6amounts as the court directs. If the estate of a ward is 7derived in whole or in part from payments of compensation, 8adjusted compensation, pension, insurance or other similar 9benefits made directly to the estate by the Veterans 10Administration, notice of the application for leave to invest 11or expend the ward's funds or estate, together with a copy of 12the petition and proposed order, shall be given to the 13Veterans' Administration Regional Office in this State at 14least 7 days before the hearing on the application.15    (a-5) The probate court, upon petition of a guardian, 16other than the guardian of a minor, and after notice to all 17other persons interested as the court directs, may authorize 18the guardian to exercise any or all powers over the estate and 19business affairs of the ward that the ward could exercise if 20present and not under disability. The court may authorize the 21taking of an action or the application of funds not required 22for the ward's current and future maintenance and support in 23any manner approved by the court as being in keeping with the 24ward's wishes so far as they can be ascertained. The court must 25consider the permanence of the ward's disabling condition and 26the natural objects of the ward's bounty. In ascertaining and   10400HB2562ham002- 10 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1carrying out the ward's wishes the court may consider, but 2shall not be limited to, minimization of State or federal 3income, estate, or inheritance taxes; and providing gifts to 4charities, relatives, and friends that would be likely 5recipients of donations from the ward. The ward's wishes as 6best they can be ascertained shall be carried out, whether or 7not tax savings are involved. Actions or applications of funds 8may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:9        (1) making gifts of income or principal, or both, of 10    the estate, either outright or in trust;11        (2) conveying, releasing, or disclaiming his or her 12    contingent and expectant interests in property, including 13    marital property rights and any right of survivorship 14    incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety;15        (3) releasing or disclaiming his or her powers as 16    trustee, personal representative, custodian for minors, or 17    guardian;18        (4) exercising, releasing, or disclaiming his or her 19    powers as donee of a power of appointment;20        (5) entering into contracts;21        (6) creating for the benefit of the ward or others, 22    revocable or irrevocable trusts of his or her property 23    that may extend beyond his or her disability or life;24        (7) exercising options of the ward to purchase or 25    exchange securities or other property;26        (8) exercising the rights of the ward to elect benefit   10400HB2562ham002- 11 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1    or payment options, to terminate, to change beneficiaries 2    or ownership, to assign rights, to borrow, or to receive 3    cash value in return for a surrender of rights under any 4    one or more of the following:5            (i) life insurance policies, plans, or benefits,6            (ii) annuity policies, plans, or benefits,7            (iii) mutual fund and other dividend investment 8        plans,9            (iv) retirement, profit sharing, and employee 10        welfare plans and benefits;11        (9) exercising his or her right to claim or disclaim 12    an elective share in the estate of his or her deceased 13    spouse and to renounce any interest by testate or 14    intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer;15        (10) changing the ward's residence or domicile; or16        (11) modifying by means of codicil or trust amendment 17    the terms of the ward's will or any revocable trust 18    created by the ward, as the court may consider advisable 19    in light of changes in applicable tax laws.20    The guardian in his or her petition shall briefly outline 21the action or application of funds for which he or she seeks 22approval, the results expected to be accomplished thereby, and 23the tax savings, if any, expected to accrue. The proposed 24action or application of funds may include gifts of the ward's 25personal property or real estate, but transfers of real estate 26shall be subject to the requirements of Section 20 of this Act.   10400HB2562ham002- 12 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1Gifts may be for the benefit of prospective legatees, 2devisees, or heirs apparent of the ward or may be made to 3individuals or charities in which the ward is believed to have 4an interest. The guardian shall also indicate in the petition 5that any planned disposition is consistent with the intentions 6of the ward insofar as they can be ascertained, and if the 7ward's intentions cannot be ascertained, the ward will be 8presumed to favor reduction in the incidents of various forms 9of taxation and the partial distribution of his or her estate 10as provided in this subsection. The guardian shall not, 11however, be required to include as a beneficiary or fiduciary 12any person who he has reason to believe would be excluded by 13the ward. A guardian shall be required to investigate and 14pursue a ward's eligibility for governmental benefits.15    (a-6) The guardian may, without an order of court, open, 16maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on behalf of 17the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent children as 18specified under Section 16.6 of the State Treasurer Act. 19    (b) Upon the direction of the court which issued his 20letters, a guardian may perform the contracts of his ward 21which were legally subsisting at the time of the commencement 22of the ward's disability. The court may authorize the guardian 23to execute and deliver any bill of sale, deed or other 24instrument.25    (c) The guardian of the estate of a ward shall appear for 26and represent the ward in all legal proceedings unless another   10400HB2562ham002- 13 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1person is appointed for that purpose as guardian or next 2friend. This does not impair the power of any court to appoint 3a guardian ad litem or next friend to defend the interests of 4the ward in that court, or to appoint or allow any person as 5the next friend of a ward to commence, prosecute or defend any 6proceeding in his behalf. Without impairing the power of the 7court in any respect, if the guardian of the estate of a ward 8and another person as next friend shall appear for and 9represent the ward in a legal proceeding in which the 10compensation of the attorney or attorneys representing the 11guardian and next friend is solely determined under a 12contingent fee arrangement, the guardian of the estate of the 13ward shall not participate in or have any duty to review the 14prosecution of the action, to participate in or review the 15appropriateness of any settlement of the action, or to 16participate in or review any determination of the 17appropriateness of any fees awarded to the attorney or 18attorneys employed in the prosecution of the action.19    (d) Adjudication of disability shall not revoke or 20otherwise terminate a trust which is revocable by the ward. A 21guardian of the estate shall have no authority to revoke a 22trust that is revocable by the ward, except that the court may 23authorize a guardian to revoke a Totten trust or similar 24deposit or withdrawable capital account in trust to the extent 25necessary to provide funds for the purposes specified in 26paragraph (a) of this Section. If the trustee of any trust for   10400HB2562ham002- 14 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1the benefit of the ward has discretionary power to apply 2income or principal for the ward's benefit, the trustee shall 3not be required to distribute any of the income or principal to 4the guardian of the ward's estate, but the guardian may bring 5an action on behalf of the ward to compel the trustee to 6exercise the trustee's discretion or to seek relief from an 7abuse of discretion. This paragraph shall not limit the right 8of a guardian of the estate to receive accountings from the 9trustee on behalf of the ward.10    (d-5) Upon a verified petition by the plenary or limited 11guardian of the estate or the request of the ward that is 12accompanied by a current physician's report that states the 13ward possesses testamentary capacity, the court may enter an 14order authorizing the ward to execute a will or codicil. In so 15ordering, the court shall authorize the guardian to retain 16independent counsel for the ward with whom the ward may 17execute or modify a will or codicil. 18    (e) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of 19Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 20principal under an agency that survives disability, the 21guardian will have no power, duty or liability with respect to 22any property subject to the agency. If the Office of State 23Guardian or a public guardian is appointed, all powers of 24attorney are suspended under subsection (g-1) of Section 2-10 25of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. This subsection (e) 26applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever executed.  10400HB2562ham002- 15 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the 2standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 3interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 4court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 5disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 6a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 7orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 8interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 9termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 10short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 11petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 12with a disability.13(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22.) 14    Section 15.

If the ward's estate is insufficient to 9provide for education and the guardian of the ward's person 10fails to provide education, the court may award the custody of 11the ward to some other person for the purpose of providing 12education. If a person makes a settlement upon or provision 13for the support or education of a ward, the court may make an 14order for the visitation of the ward by the person making the 15settlement or provision as the court deems proper. A guardian 16of the person may not admit a ward to a mental health facility 17except at the ward's request as provided in Article IV of the 18Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code and unless 19the ward has the capacity to consent to such admission as 20provided in Article IV of the Mental Health and Developmental 21Disabilities Code. 22    (a-3) If a guardian of an estate has not been appointed, 23the guardian of the person may, without an order of court, 24open, maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on 25behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent 26children as specified under Section 16.6 of the State   10400HB2562ham002- 3 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1Treasurer Act. 2    (a-5) If the ward filed a petition for dissolution of 3marriage under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 4Marriage Act before the ward was adjudicated a person with a 5disability under this Article, the guardian of the ward's 6person and estate may maintain that action for dissolution of 7marriage on behalf of the ward. Upon petition by the guardian 8of the ward's person or estate, the court may authorize and 9direct a guardian of the ward's person or estate to file a 10petition for dissolution of marriage or to file a petition for 11legal separation or declaration of invalidity of marriage 12under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act on 13behalf of the ward if the court finds by clear and convincing 14evidence that the relief sought is in the ward's best 15interests. In making its determination, the court shall 16consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 17Section.18    (a-10) Upon petition by the guardian of the ward's person 19or estate, the court may authorize and direct a guardian of the 20ward's person or estate to consent, on behalf of the ward, to 21the ward's marriage pursuant to Part II of the Illinois 22Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act if the court finds by 23clear and convincing evidence that the marriage is in the 24ward's best interests. In making its determination, the court 25shall consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of 26this Section. Upon presentation of a court order authorizing   10400HB2562ham002- 4 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1and directing a guardian of the ward's person and estate to 2consent to the ward's marriage, the county clerk shall accept 3the guardian's application, appearance, and signature on 4behalf of the ward for purposes of issuing a license to marry 5under Section 203 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 6Marriage Act. 7    (b) If the court directs, the guardian of the person shall 8file with the court at intervals indicated by the court, a 9report that shall state briefly: (1) the current mental, 10physical, and social condition of the ward and the ward's 11minor and adult dependent children; (2) their present living 12arrangement, and a description and the address of every 13residence where they lived during the reporting period and the 14length of stay at each place; (3) a summary of the medical, 15educational, vocational, and other professional services given 16to them; (4) a resume of the guardian's visits with and 17activities on behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult 18dependent children; (5) a recommendation as to the need for 19continued guardianship; (6) any other information requested by 20the court or useful in the opinion of the guardian. The Office 21of the State Guardian shall assist the guardian in filing the 22report when requested by the guardian. The court may take such 23action as it deems appropriate pursuant to the report.24    (c) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of 25Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 26principal under an agency that survives disability, the   10400HB2562ham002- 5 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1guardian has no power, duty, or liability with respect to any 2personal or health care matters covered by the agency. If the 3Office of State Guardian or a public guardian is appointed, 4all powers of attorney are suspended under subsection (g-1) of 5Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. This 6subsection (c) applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever 7executed.8    (d) A guardian acting as a surrogate decision maker under 9the Health Care Surrogate Act shall have all the rights of a 10surrogate under that Act without court order including the 11right to make medical treatment decisions such as decisions to 12forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Any decisions by 13the guardian to forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment 14that are not authorized under the Health Care Surrogate Act 15shall require a court order. Nothing in this Section shall 16prevent an agent acting under a power of attorney for health 17care from exercising his or her authority under the Illinois 18Power of Attorney Act without further court order, unless a 19court has acted under Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of 20Attorney Act. If a guardian is also a health care agent for the 21ward under a valid power of attorney for health care, the 22guardian acting as agent may execute his or her authority 23under that act without further court order.24    (e) Decisions made by a guardian on behalf of a ward shall 25be made in accordance with the following standards for 26decision making. The guardian shall consider the ward's   10400HB2562ham002- 6 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1current preferences to the extent the ward has the ability to 2participate in decision making when those preferences are 3known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. Decisions 4by the guardian shall conform to the ward's current 5preferences: (1) unless the guardian reasonably believes that 6doing so would result in substantial harm to the ward's 7welfare or personal or financial interests; and (2) so long as 8such decisions give substantial weight to what the ward, if 9competent, would have done or intended under the 10circumstances, taking into account evidence that includes, but 11is not limited to, the ward's personal, philosophical, 12religious and moral beliefs, and ethical values relative to 13the decision to be made by the guardian. Where possible, the 14guardian shall determine how the ward would have made a 15decision based on the ward's previously expressed preferences, 16and make decisions in accordance with the preferences of the 17ward. If the ward's wishes are unknown and remain unknown 18after reasonable efforts to discern them, or if the guardian 19reasonably believes that a decision made in conformity with 20the ward's preferences would result in substantial harm to the 21ward's welfare or personal or financial interests, the 22decision shall be made on the basis of the ward's best 23interests as determined by the guardian. In determining the 24ward's best interests, the guardian shall weigh the reason for 25and nature of the proposed action, the benefit or necessity of 26the action, the possible risks and other consequences of the   10400HB2562ham002- 7 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1proposed action, and any available alternatives and their 2risks, consequences and benefits, and shall take into account 3any other information, including the views of family and 4friends, that the guardian believes the ward would have 5considered if able to act for herself or himself.6    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the 7standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 8interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 9court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 10disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 11a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 12orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 13interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 14termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 15short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 16petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 17with a disability.18    (g)(1) Unless there is a court order to the contrary, the 19guardian, consistent with the standards set forth in 20subsection (e) of this Section, shall use reasonable efforts 21to notify the ward's known adult children, who have requested 22notification and provided contact information, of the ward's 23admission to a hospital, hospice, or palliative care program, 24the ward's death, and the arrangements for the disposition of 25the ward's remains.26    (2) If a guardian unreasonably prevents an adult child,   10400HB2562ham002- 8 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or adult sibling of the ward 2from visiting the ward, the court, upon a verified petition, 3may order the guardian to permit visitation between the ward 4and the adult child, spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or 5adult sibling. In making its determination, the court shall 6consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 7Section. The court shall not allow visitation if the court 8finds that the ward has capacity to evaluate and communicate 9decisions regarding visitation and expresses a desire not to 10have visitation with the petitioner. This subsection (g) does 11not apply to duly appointed public guardians or the Office of 12State Guardian.13(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22; 14102-258, eff. 8-6-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.) 15    (755 ILCS 5/11a-18)  (from Ch. 110 1/2, par. 11a-18)16    Sec. 11a-18. Duties of the estate guardian. 17    (a) To the extent specified in the order establishing the 18guardianship, the guardian of the estate shall have the care, 19management and investment of the estate, shall manage the 20estate frugally and shall apply the income and principal of 21the estate so far as necessary for the comfort and suitable 22support and education of the ward, his minor and adult 23dependent children, and persons related by blood or marriage 24who are dependent upon or entitled to support from him, or for 25any other purpose which the court deems to be for the best   10400HB2562ham002- 9 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1interests of the ward, and the court may approve the making on 2behalf of the ward of such agreements as the court determines 3to be for the ward's best interests. The guardian may make 4disbursement of his ward's funds and estate directly to the 5ward or other distributee or in such other manner and in such 6amounts as the court directs. If the estate of a ward is 7derived in whole or in part from payments of compensation, 8adjusted compensation, pension, insurance or other similar 9benefits made directly to the estate by the Veterans 10Administration, notice of the application for leave to invest 11or expend the ward's funds or estate, together with a copy of 12the petition and proposed order, shall be given to the 13Veterans' Administration Regional Office in this State at 14least 7 days before the hearing on the application.15    (a-5) The probate court, upon petition of a guardian, 16other than the guardian of a minor, and after notice to all 17other persons interested as the court directs, may authorize 18the guardian to exercise any or all powers over the estate and 19business affairs of the ward that the ward could exercise if 20present and not under disability. The court may authorize the 21taking of an action or the application of funds not required 22for the ward's current and future maintenance and support in 23any manner approved by the court as being in keeping with the 24ward's wishes so far as they can be ascertained. The court must 25consider the permanence of the ward's disabling condition and 26the natural objects of the ward's bounty. In ascertaining and   10400HB2562ham002- 10 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1carrying out the ward's wishes the court may consider, but 2shall not be limited to, minimization of State or federal 3income, estate, or inheritance taxes; and providing gifts to 4charities, relatives, and friends that would be likely 5recipients of donations from the ward. The ward's wishes as 6best they can be ascertained shall be carried out, whether or 7not tax savings are involved. Actions or applications of funds 8may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:9        (1) making gifts of income or principal, or both, of 10    the estate, either outright or in trust;11        (2) conveying, releasing, or disclaiming his or her 12    contingent and expectant interests in property, including 13    marital property rights and any right of survivorship 14    incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety;15        (3) releasing or disclaiming his or her powers as 16    trustee, personal representative, custodian for minors, or 17    guardian;18        (4) exercising, releasing, or disclaiming his or her 19    powers as donee of a power of appointment;20        (5) entering into contracts;21        (6) creating for the benefit of the ward or others, 22    revocable or irrevocable trusts of his or her property 23    that may extend beyond his or her disability or life;24        (7) exercising options of the ward to purchase or 25    exchange securities or other property;26        (8) exercising the rights of the ward to elect benefit   10400HB2562ham002- 11 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1    or payment options, to terminate, to change beneficiaries 2    or ownership, to assign rights, to borrow, or to receive 3    cash value in return for a surrender of rights under any 4    one or more of the following:5            (i) life insurance policies, plans, or benefits,6            (ii) annuity policies, plans, or benefits,7            (iii) mutual fund and other dividend investment 8        plans,9            (iv) retirement, profit sharing, and employee 10        welfare plans and benefits;11        (9) exercising his or her right to claim or disclaim 12    an elective share in the estate of his or her deceased 13    spouse and to renounce any interest by testate or 14    intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer;15        (10) changing the ward's residence or domicile; or16        (11) modifying by means of codicil or trust amendment 17    the terms of the ward's will or any revocable trust 18    created by the ward, as the court may consider advisable 19    in light of changes in applicable tax laws.20    The guardian in his or her petition shall briefly outline 21the action or application of funds for which he or she seeks 22approval, the results expected to be accomplished thereby, and 23the tax savings, if any, expected to accrue. The proposed 24action or application of funds may include gifts of the ward's 25personal property or real estate, but transfers of real estate 26shall be subject to the requirements of Section 20 of this Act.   10400HB2562ham002- 12 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1Gifts may be for the benefit of prospective legatees, 2devisees, or heirs apparent of the ward or may be made to 3individuals or charities in which the ward is believed to have 4an interest. The guardian shall also indicate in the petition 5that any planned disposition is consistent with the intentions 6of the ward insofar as they can be ascertained, and if the 7ward's intentions cannot be ascertained, the ward will be 8presumed to favor reduction in the incidents of various forms 9of taxation and the partial distribution of his or her estate 10as provided in this subsection. The guardian shall not, 11however, be required to include as a beneficiary or fiduciary 12any person who he has reason to believe would be excluded by 13the ward. A guardian shall be required to investigate and 14pursue a ward's eligibility for governmental benefits.15    (a-6) The guardian may, without an order of court, open, 16maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on behalf of 17the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent children as 18specified under Section 16.6 of the State Treasurer Act. 19    (b) Upon the direction of the court which issued his 20letters, a guardian may perform the contracts of his ward 21which were legally subsisting at the time of the commencement 22of the ward's disability. The court may authorize the guardian 23to execute and deliver any bill of sale, deed or other 24instrument.25    (c) The guardian of the estate of a ward shall appear for 26and represent the ward in all legal proceedings unless another   10400HB2562ham002- 13 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1person is appointed for that purpose as guardian or next 2friend. This does not impair the power of any court to appoint 3a guardian ad litem or next friend to defend the interests of 4the ward in that court, or to appoint or allow any person as 5the next friend of a ward to commence, prosecute or defend any 6proceeding in his behalf. Without impairing the power of the 7court in any respect, if the guardian of the estate of a ward 8and another person as next friend shall appear for and 9represent the ward in a legal proceeding in which the 10compensation of the attorney or attorneys representing the 11guardian and next friend is solely determined under a 12contingent fee arrangement, the guardian of the estate of the 13ward shall not participate in or have any duty to review the 14prosecution of the action, to participate in or review the 15appropriateness of any settlement of the action, or to 16participate in or review any determination of the 17appropriateness of any fees awarded to the attorney or 18attorneys employed in the prosecution of the action.19    (d) Adjudication of disability shall not revoke or 20otherwise terminate a trust which is revocable by the ward. A 21guardian of the estate shall have no authority to revoke a 22trust that is revocable by the ward, except that the court may 23authorize a guardian to revoke a Totten trust or similar 24deposit or withdrawable capital account in trust to the extent 25necessary to provide funds for the purposes specified in 26paragraph (a) of this Section. If the trustee of any trust for   10400HB2562ham002- 14 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1the benefit of the ward has discretionary power to apply 2income or principal for the ward's benefit, the trustee shall 3not be required to distribute any of the income or principal to 4the guardian of the ward's estate, but the guardian may bring 5an action on behalf of the ward to compel the trustee to 6exercise the trustee's discretion or to seek relief from an 7abuse of discretion. This paragraph shall not limit the right 8of a guardian of the estate to receive accountings from the 9trustee on behalf of the ward.10    (d-5) Upon a verified petition by the plenary or limited 11guardian of the estate or the request of the ward that is 12accompanied by a current physician's report that states the 13ward possesses testamentary capacity, the court may enter an 14order authorizing the ward to execute a will or codicil. In so 15ordering, the court shall authorize the guardian to retain 16independent counsel for the ward with whom the ward may 17execute or modify a will or codicil. 18    (e) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of 19Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 20principal under an agency that survives disability, the 21guardian will have no power, duty or liability with respect to 22any property subject to the agency. If the Office of State 23Guardian or a public guardian is appointed, all powers of 24attorney are suspended under subsection (g-1) of Section 2-10 25of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. This subsection (e) 26applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever executed.  10400HB2562ham002- 15 -LRB104 08064 JRC 24540 a1    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the 2standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 3interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 4court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 5disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 6a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 7orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 8interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 9termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 10short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 11petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 12with a disability.13(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22.) 14    Section 15.
