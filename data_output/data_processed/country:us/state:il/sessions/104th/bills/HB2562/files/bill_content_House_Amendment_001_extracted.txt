The guardian shall assist the ward in 3the development of maximum self-reliance and independence. The 4guardian of the person may petition the court for an order 5directing the guardian of the estate to pay an amount 6periodically for the provision of the services specified by 7the court order. If the ward's estate is insufficient to 8provide for education and the guardian of the ward's person 9fails to provide education, the court may award the custody of 10the ward to some other person for the purpose of providing 11education. If a person makes a settlement upon or provision 12for the support or education of a ward, the court may make an 13order for the visitation of the ward by the person making the 14settlement or provision as the court deems proper. A guardian 15of the person may not admit a ward to a mental health facility 16except at the ward's request as provided in Article IV of the 17Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code and unless 18the ward has the capacity to consent to such admission as 19provided in Article IV of the Mental Health and Developmental 20Disabilities Code. 21    (a-3) If a guardian of an estate has not been appointed, 22the guardian of the person may, without an order of court, 23open, maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on 24behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent 25children as specified under Section 16.6 of the State 26Treasurer Act.   10400HB2562ham001- 3 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1    (a-5) If the ward filed a petition for dissolution of 2marriage under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 3Marriage Act before the ward was adjudicated a person with a 4disability under this Article, the guardian of the ward's 5person and estate may maintain that action for dissolution of 6marriage on behalf of the ward. Upon petition by the guardian 7of the ward's person or estate, the court may authorize and 8direct a guardian of the ward's person or estate to file a 9petition for dissolution of marriage or to file a petition for 10legal separation or declaration of invalidity of marriage 11under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act on 12behalf of the ward if the court finds by clear and convincing 13evidence that the relief sought is in the ward's best 14interests.

In making its determination, the court 24shall consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of 25this Section. Upon presentation of a court order authorizing 26and directing a guardian of the ward's person and estate to   10400HB2562ham001- 4 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1consent to the ward's marriage, the county clerk shall accept 2the guardian's application, appearance, and signature on 3behalf of the ward for purposes of issuing a license to marry 4under Section 203 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 5Marriage Act. 6    (b) If the court directs, the guardian of the person shall 7file with the court at intervals indicated by the court, a 8report that shall state briefly: (1) the current mental, 9physical, and social condition of the ward and the ward's 10minor and adult dependent children; (2) their present living 11arrangement, and a description and the address of every 12residence where they lived during the reporting period and the 13length of stay at each place; (3) a summary of the medical, 14educational, vocational, and other professional services given 15to them; (4) a resume of the guardian's visits with and 16activities on behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult 17dependent children; (5) a recommendation as to the need for 18continued guardianship; (6) any other information requested by 19the court or useful in the opinion of the guardian. The Office 20of the State Guardian shall assist the guardian in filing the 21report when requested by the guardian. The court may take such 22action as it deems appropriate pursuant to the report.23    (c) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of 24Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 25principal under an agency that survives disability, the 26guardian has no power, duty, or liability with respect to any   10400HB2562ham001- 5 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1personal or health care matters covered by the agency. If the 2Office of State Guardian or a public guardian is appointed, 3all powers of attorney are suspended under subsection (g-1) of 4Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. This 5subsection (c) applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever 6executed.7    (d) A guardian acting as a surrogate decision maker under 8the Health Care Surrogate Act shall have all the rights of a 9surrogate under that Act without court order including the 10right to make medical treatment decisions such as decisions to 11forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Any decisions by 12the guardian to forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment 13that are not authorized under the Health Care Surrogate Act 14shall require a court order. Nothing in this Section shall 15prevent an agent acting under a power of attorney for health 16care from exercising his or her authority under the Illinois 17Power of Attorney Act without further court order, unless a 18court has acted under Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of 19Attorney Act. If a guardian is also a health care agent for the 20ward under a valid power of attorney for health care, the 21guardian acting as agent may execute his or her authority 22under that act without further court order.23    (e) Decisions made by a guardian on behalf of a ward shall 24be made in accordance with the following standards for 25decision making. The guardian shall consider the ward's 26current preferences to the extent the ward has the ability to   10400HB2562ham001- 6 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1participate in decision making when those preferences are 2known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. Decisions 3by the guardian shall conform to the ward's current 4preferences: (1) unless the guardian reasonably believes that 5doing so would result in substantial harm to the ward's 6welfare or personal or financial interests; and (2) so long as 7such decisions give substantial weight to what the ward, if 8competent, would have done or intended under the 9circumstances, taking into account evidence that includes, but 10is not limited to, the ward's personal, philosophical, 11religious and moral beliefs, and ethical values relative to 12the decision to be made by the guardian. Where possible, the 13guardian shall determine how the ward would have made a 14decision based on the ward's previously expressed preferences, 15and make decisions in accordance with the preferences of the 16ward. If the ward's wishes are unknown and remain unknown 17after reasonable efforts to discern them, or if the guardian 18reasonably believes that a decision made in conformity with 19the ward's preferences would result in substantial harm to the 20ward's welfare or personal or financial interests, the 21decision shall be made on the basis of the ward's best 22interests as determined by the guardian. In determining the 23ward's best interests, the guardian shall weigh the reason for 24and nature of the proposed action, the benefit or necessity of 25the action, the possible risks and other consequences of the 26proposed action, and any available alternatives and their   10400HB2562ham001- 7 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1risks, consequences and benefits, and shall take into account 2any other information, including the views of family and 3friends, that the guardian believes the ward would have 4considered if able to act for herself or himself.5    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the 6standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 7interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 8court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 9disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 10a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 11orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 12interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 13termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 14short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 15petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 16with a disability.17    (g)(1) Unless there is a court order to the contrary, the 18guardian, consistent with the standards set forth in 19subsection (e) of this Section, shall use reasonable efforts 20to notify the ward's known adult children, who have requested 21notification and provided contact information, of the ward's 22admission to a hospital, hospice, or palliative care program, 23the ward's death, and the arrangements for the disposition of 24the ward's remains.25    (2) If a guardian unreasonably prevents an adult child, 26spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or adult sibling of the ward   10400HB2562ham001- 8 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1from visiting the ward, the court, upon a verified petition, 2may order the guardian to permit visitation between the ward 3and the adult child, spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or 4adult sibling. In making its determination, the court shall 5consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 6Section. The court shall not allow visitation if the court 7finds that the ward has capacity to evaluate and communicate 8decisions regarding visitation and expresses a desire not to 9have visitation with the petitioner. This subsection (g) does 10not apply to duly appointed public guardians or the Office of 11State Guardian.12(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22; 13102-258, eff. 8-6-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.) 14    (755 ILCS 5/11a-18)  (from Ch. 110 1/2, par. 11a-18)15    Sec. 11a-18. Duties of the estate guardian. 16    (a) To the extent specified in the order establishing the 17guardianship, the guardian of the estate shall have the care, 18management and investment of the estate, shall manage the 19estate frugally and shall apply the income and principal of 20the estate so far as necessary for the comfort and suitable 21support and education of the ward, his minor and adult 22dependent children, and persons related by blood or marriage 23who are dependent upon or entitled to support from him, or for 24any other purpose which the court deems to be for the best 25interests of the ward, and the court may approve the making on   10400HB2562ham001- 9 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1behalf of the ward of such agreements as the court determines 2to be for the ward's best interests. The guardian may make 3disbursement of his ward's funds and estate directly to the 4ward or other distributee or in such other manner and in such 5amounts as the court directs. If the estate of a ward is 6derived in whole or in part from payments of compensation, 7adjusted compensation, pension, insurance or other similar 8benefits made directly to the estate by the Veterans 9Administration, notice of the application for leave to invest 10or expend the ward's funds or estate, together with a copy of 11the petition and proposed order, shall be given to the 12Veterans' Administration Regional Office in this State at 13least 7 days before the hearing on the application.14    (a-5) The probate court, upon petition of a guardian, 15other than the guardian of a minor, and after notice to all 16other persons interested as the court directs, may authorize 17the guardian to exercise any or all powers over the estate and 18business affairs of the ward that the ward could exercise if 19present and not under disability. The court may authorize the 20taking of an action or the application of funds not required 21for the ward's current and future maintenance and support in 22any manner approved by the court as being in keeping with the 23ward's wishes so far as they can be ascertained. The court must 24consider the permanence of the ward's disabling condition and 25the natural objects of the ward's bounty. In ascertaining and 26carrying out the ward's wishes the court may consider, but   10400HB2562ham001- 10 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1shall not be limited to, minimization of State or federal 2income, estate, or inheritance taxes; and providing gifts to 3charities, relatives, and friends that would be likely 4recipients of donations from the ward. The ward's wishes as 5best they can be ascertained shall be carried out, whether or 6not tax savings are involved. Actions or applications of funds 7may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:8        (1) making gifts of income or principal, or both, of 9    the estate, either outright or in trust;10        (2) conveying, releasing, or disclaiming his or her 11    contingent and expectant interests in property, including 12    marital property rights and any right of survivorship 13    incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety;14        (3) releasing or disclaiming his or her powers as 15    trustee, personal representative, custodian for minors, or 16    guardian;17        (4) exercising, releasing, or disclaiming his or her 18    powers as donee of a power of appointment;19        (5) entering into contracts;20        (6) creating for the benefit of the ward or others, 21    revocable or irrevocable trusts of his or her property 22    that may extend beyond his or her disability or life;23        (7) exercising options of the ward to purchase or 24    exchange securities or other property;25        (8) exercising the rights of the ward to elect benefit 26    or payment options, to terminate, to change beneficiaries   10400HB2562ham001- 11 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1    or ownership, to assign rights, to borrow, or to receive 2    cash value in return for a surrender of rights under any 3    one or more of the following:4            (i) life insurance policies, plans, or benefits,5            (ii) annuity policies, plans, or benefits,6            (iii) mutual fund and other dividend investment 7        plans,8            (iv) retirement, profit sharing, and employee 9        welfare plans and benefits;10        (9) exercising his or her right to claim or disclaim 11    an elective share in the estate of his or her deceased 12    spouse and to renounce any interest by testate or 13    intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer;14        (10) changing the ward's residence or domicile; or15        (11) modifying by means of codicil or trust amendment 16    the terms of the ward's will or any revocable trust 17    created by the ward, as the court may consider advisable 18    in light of changes in applicable tax laws.19    The guardian in his or her petition shall briefly outline 20the action or application of funds for which he or she seeks 21approval, the results expected to be accomplished thereby, and 22the tax savings, if any, expected to accrue. The proposed 23action or application of funds may include gifts of the ward's 24personal property or real estate, but transfers of real estate 25shall be subject to the requirements of Section 20 of this Act. 26Gifts may be for the benefit of prospective legatees,   10400HB2562ham001- 12 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1devisees, or heirs apparent of the ward or may be made to 2individuals or charities in which the ward is believed to have 3an interest. The guardian shall also indicate in the petition 4that any planned disposition is consistent with the intentions 5of the ward insofar as they can be ascertained, and if the 6ward's intentions cannot be ascertained, the ward will be 7presumed to favor reduction in the incidents of various forms 8of taxation and the partial distribution of his or her estate 9as provided in this subsection. The guardian shall not, 10however, be required to include as a beneficiary or fiduciary 11any person who he has reason to believe would be excluded by 12the ward. A guardian shall be required to investigate and 13pursue a ward's eligibility for governmental benefits.14    (a-6) The guardian may, without an order of court, open, 15maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on behalf of 16the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent children as 17specified under Section 16.6 of the State Treasurer Act. 18    (b) Upon the direction of the court which issued his 19letters, a guardian may perform the contracts of his ward 20which were legally subsisting at the time of the commencement 21of the ward's disability. The court may authorize the guardian 22to execute and deliver any bill of sale, deed or other 23instrument.24    (c) The guardian of the estate of a ward shall appear for 25and represent the ward in all legal proceedings unless another 26person is appointed for that purpose as guardian or next   10400HB2562ham001- 13 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1friend. This does not impair the power of any court to appoint 2a guardian ad litem or next friend to defend the interests of 3the ward in that court, or to appoint or allow any person as 4the next friend of a ward to commence, prosecute or defend any 5proceeding in his behalf. Without impairing the power of the 6court in any respect, if the guardian of the estate of a ward 7and another person as next friend shall appear for and 8represent the ward in a legal proceeding in which the 9compensation of the attorney or attorneys representing the 10guardian and next friend is solely determined under a 11contingent fee arrangement, the guardian of the estate of the 12ward shall not participate in or have any duty to review the 13prosecution of the action, to participate in or review the 14appropriateness of any settlement of the action, or to 15participate in or review any determination of the 16appropriateness of any fees awarded to the attorney or 17attorneys employed in the prosecution of the action.18    (d) Adjudication of disability shall not revoke or 19otherwise terminate a trust which is revocable by the ward. A 20guardian of the estate shall have no authority to revoke a 21trust that is revocable by the ward, except that the court may 22authorize a guardian to revoke a Totten trust or similar 23deposit or withdrawable capital account in trust to the extent 24necessary to provide funds for the purposes specified in 25paragraph (a) of this Section. If the trustee of any trust for 26the benefit of the ward has discretionary power to apply   10400HB2562ham001- 14 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1income or principal for the ward's benefit, the trustee shall 2not be required to distribute any of the income or principal to 3the guardian of the ward's estate, but the guardian may bring 4an action on behalf of the ward to compel the trustee to 5exercise the trustee's discretion or to seek relief from an 6abuse of discretion. This paragraph shall not limit the right 7of a guardian of the estate to receive accountings from the 8trustee on behalf of the ward.9    (d-5) Upon a verified petition by the plenary or limited 10guardian of the estate or the request of the ward that is 11accompanied by a current physician's report that states the 12ward possesses testamentary capacity, the court may enter an 13order authorizing the ward to execute a will or codicil. In so 14ordering, the court shall authorize the guardian to retain 15independent counsel for the ward with whom the ward may 16execute or modify a will or codicil. 17    (e) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of 18Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 19principal under an agency that survives disability, the 20guardian will have no power, duty or liability with respect to 21any property subject to the agency. If the Office of State 22Guardian or a public guardian is appointed, all powers of 23attorney are suspended under subsection (g-1) of Section 2-10 24of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. This subsection (e) 25applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever executed.26    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the   10400HB2562ham001- 15 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 2interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 3court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 4disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 5a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 6orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 7interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 8termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 9short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 10petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 11with a disability.12(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22.) 13    Section 10.

If a person makes a settlement upon or provision 12for the support or education of a ward, the court may make an 13order for the visitation of the ward by the person making the 14settlement or provision as the court deems proper. A guardian 15of the person may not admit a ward to a mental health facility 16except at the ward's request as provided in Article IV of the 17Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code and unless 18the ward has the capacity to consent to such admission as 19provided in Article IV of the Mental Health and Developmental 20Disabilities Code. 21    (a-3) If a guardian of an estate has not been appointed, 22the guardian of the person may, without an order of court, 23open, maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on 24behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent 25children as specified under Section 16.6 of the State 26Treasurer Act.   10400HB2562ham001- 3 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1    (a-5) If the ward filed a petition for dissolution of 2marriage under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 3Marriage Act before the ward was adjudicated a person with a 4disability under this Article, the guardian of the ward's 5person and estate may maintain that action for dissolution of 6marriage on behalf of the ward. Upon petition by the guardian 7of the ward's person or estate, the court may authorize and 8direct a guardian of the ward's person or estate to file a 9petition for dissolution of marriage or to file a petition for 10legal separation or declaration of invalidity of marriage 11under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act on 12behalf of the ward if the court finds by clear and convincing 13evidence that the relief sought is in the ward's best 14interests. In making its determination, the court shall 15consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 16Section.17    (a-10) Upon petition by the guardian of the ward's person 18or estate, the court may authorize and direct a guardian of the 19ward's person or estate to consent, on behalf of the ward, to 20the ward's marriage pursuant to Part II of the Illinois 21Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act if the court finds by 22clear and convincing evidence that the marriage is in the 23ward's best interests. In making its determination, the court 24shall consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of 25this Section. Upon presentation of a court order authorizing 26and directing a guardian of the ward's person and estate to   10400HB2562ham001- 4 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1consent to the ward's marriage, the county clerk shall accept 2the guardian's application, appearance, and signature on 3behalf of the ward for purposes of issuing a license to marry 4under Section 203 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 5Marriage Act. 6    (b) If the court directs, the guardian of the person shall 7file with the court at intervals indicated by the court, a 8report that shall state briefly: (1) the current mental, 9physical, and social condition of the ward and the ward's 10minor and adult dependent children; (2) their present living 11arrangement, and a description and the address of every 12residence where they lived during the reporting period and the 13length of stay at each place; (3) a summary of the medical, 14educational, vocational, and other professional services given 15to them; (4) a resume of the guardian's visits with and 16activities on behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult 17dependent children; (5) a recommendation as to the need for 18continued guardianship; (6) any other information requested by 19the court or useful in the opinion of the guardian. The Office 20of the State Guardian shall assist the guardian in filing the 21report when requested by the guardian. The court may take such 22action as it deems appropriate pursuant to the report.23    (c) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of 24Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 25principal under an agency that survives disability, the 26guardian has no power, duty, or liability with respect to any   10400HB2562ham001- 5 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1personal or health care matters covered by the agency. If the 2Office of State Guardian or a public guardian is appointed, 3all powers of attorney are suspended under subsection (g-1) of 4Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. This 5subsection (c) applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever 6executed.7    (d) A guardian acting as a surrogate decision maker under 8the Health Care Surrogate Act shall have all the rights of a 9surrogate under that Act without court order including the 10right to make medical treatment decisions such as decisions to 11forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Any decisions by 12the guardian to forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment 13that are not authorized under the Health Care Surrogate Act 14shall require a court order. Nothing in this Section shall 15prevent an agent acting under a power of attorney for health 16care from exercising his or her authority under the Illinois 17Power of Attorney Act without further court order, unless a 18court has acted under Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of 19Attorney Act. If a guardian is also a health care agent for the 20ward under a valid power of attorney for health care, the 21guardian acting as agent may execute his or her authority 22under that act without further court order.23    (e) Decisions made by a guardian on behalf of a ward shall 24be made in accordance with the following standards for 25decision making. The guardian shall consider the ward's 26current preferences to the extent the ward has the ability to   10400HB2562ham001- 6 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1participate in decision making when those preferences are 2known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. Decisions 3by the guardian shall conform to the ward's current 4preferences: (1) unless the guardian reasonably believes that 5doing so would result in substantial harm to the ward's 6welfare or personal or financial interests; and (2) so long as 7such decisions give substantial weight to what the ward, if 8competent, would have done or intended under the 9circumstances, taking into account evidence that includes, but 10is not limited to, the ward's personal, philosophical, 11religious and moral beliefs, and ethical values relative to 12the decision to be made by the guardian. Where possible, the 13guardian shall determine how the ward would have made a 14decision based on the ward's previously expressed preferences, 15and make decisions in accordance with the preferences of the 16ward. If the ward's wishes are unknown and remain unknown 17after reasonable efforts to discern them, or if the guardian 18reasonably believes that a decision made in conformity with 19the ward's preferences would result in substantial harm to the 20ward's welfare or personal or financial interests, the 21decision shall be made on the basis of the ward's best 22interests as determined by the guardian. In determining the 23ward's best interests, the guardian shall weigh the reason for 24and nature of the proposed action, the benefit or necessity of 25the action, the possible risks and other consequences of the 26proposed action, and any available alternatives and their   10400HB2562ham001- 7 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1risks, consequences and benefits, and shall take into account 2any other information, including the views of family and 3friends, that the guardian believes the ward would have 4considered if able to act for herself or himself.5    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the 6standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 7interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 8court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 9disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 10a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 11orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 12interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 13termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 14short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 15petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 16with a disability.17    (g)(1) Unless there is a court order to the contrary, the 18guardian, consistent with the standards set forth in 19subsection (e) of this Section, shall use reasonable efforts 20to notify the ward's known adult children, who have requested 21notification and provided contact information, of the ward's 22admission to a hospital, hospice, or palliative care program, 23the ward's death, and the arrangements for the disposition of 24the ward's remains.25    (2) If a guardian unreasonably prevents an adult child, 26spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or adult sibling of the ward   10400HB2562ham001- 8 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1from visiting the ward, the court, upon a verified petition, 2may order the guardian to permit visitation between the ward 3and the adult child, spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or 4adult sibling. In making its determination, the court shall 5consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 6Section. The court shall not allow visitation if the court 7finds that the ward has capacity to evaluate and communicate 8decisions regarding visitation and expresses a desire not to 9have visitation with the petitioner. This subsection (g) does 10not apply to duly appointed public guardians or the Office of 11State Guardian.12(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22; 13102-258, eff. 8-6-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.) 14    (755 ILCS 5/11a-18)  (from Ch. 110 1/2, par. 11a-18)15    Sec. 11a-18. Duties of the estate guardian. 16    (a) To the extent specified in the order establishing the 17guardianship, the guardian of the estate shall have the care, 18management and investment of the estate, shall manage the 19estate frugally and shall apply the income and principal of 20the estate so far as necessary for the comfort and suitable 21support and education of the ward, his minor and adult 22dependent children, and persons related by blood or marriage 23who are dependent upon or entitled to support from him, or for 24any other purpose which the court deems to be for the best 25interests of the ward, and the court may approve the making on   10400HB2562ham001- 9 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1behalf of the ward of such agreements as the court determines 2to be for the ward's best interests. The guardian may make 3disbursement of his ward's funds and estate directly to the 4ward or other distributee or in such other manner and in such 5amounts as the court directs. If the estate of a ward is 6derived in whole or in part from payments of compensation, 7adjusted compensation, pension, insurance or other similar 8benefits made directly to the estate by the Veterans 9Administration, notice of the application for leave to invest 10or expend the ward's funds or estate, together with a copy of 11the petition and proposed order, shall be given to the 12Veterans' Administration Regional Office in this State at 13least 7 days before the hearing on the application.14    (a-5) The probate court, upon petition of a guardian, 15other than the guardian of a minor, and after notice to all 16other persons interested as the court directs, may authorize 17the guardian to exercise any or all powers over the estate and 18business affairs of the ward that the ward could exercise if 19present and not under disability. The court may authorize the 20taking of an action or the application of funds not required 21for the ward's current and future maintenance and support in 22any manner approved by the court as being in keeping with the 23ward's wishes so far as they can be ascertained. The court must 24consider the permanence of the ward's disabling condition and 25the natural objects of the ward's bounty. In ascertaining and 26carrying out the ward's wishes the court may consider, but   10400HB2562ham001- 10 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1shall not be limited to, minimization of State or federal 2income, estate, or inheritance taxes; and providing gifts to 3charities, relatives, and friends that would be likely 4recipients of donations from the ward. The ward's wishes as 5best they can be ascertained shall be carried out, whether or 6not tax savings are involved. Actions or applications of funds 7may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:8        (1) making gifts of income or principal, or both, of 9    the estate, either outright or in trust;10        (2) conveying, releasing, or disclaiming his or her 11    contingent and expectant interests in property, including 12    marital property rights and any right of survivorship 13    incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety;14        (3) releasing or disclaiming his or her powers as 15    trustee, personal representative, custodian for minors, or 16    guardian;17        (4) exercising, releasing, or disclaiming his or her 18    powers as donee of a power of appointment;19        (5) entering into contracts;20        (6) creating for the benefit of the ward or others, 21    revocable or irrevocable trusts of his or her property 22    that may extend beyond his or her disability or life;23        (7) exercising options of the ward to purchase or 24    exchange securities or other property;25        (8) exercising the rights of the ward to elect benefit 26    or payment options, to terminate, to change beneficiaries   10400HB2562ham001- 11 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1    or ownership, to assign rights, to borrow, or to receive 2    cash value in return for a surrender of rights under any 3    one or more of the following:4            (i) life insurance policies, plans, or benefits,5            (ii) annuity policies, plans, or benefits,6            (iii) mutual fund and other dividend investment 7        plans,8            (iv) retirement, profit sharing, and employee 9        welfare plans and benefits;10        (9) exercising his or her right to claim or disclaim 11    an elective share in the estate of his or her deceased 12    spouse and to renounce any interest by testate or 13    intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer;14        (10) changing the ward's residence or domicile; or15        (11) modifying by means of codicil or trust amendment 16    the terms of the ward's will or any revocable trust 17    created by the ward, as the court may consider advisable 18    in light of changes in applicable tax laws.19    The guardian in his or her petition shall briefly outline 20the action or application of funds for which he or she seeks 21approval, the results expected to be accomplished thereby, and 22the tax savings, if any, expected to accrue. The proposed 23action or application of funds may include gifts of the ward's 24personal property or real estate, but transfers of real estate 25shall be subject to the requirements of Section 20 of this Act. 26Gifts may be for the benefit of prospective legatees,   10400HB2562ham001- 12 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1devisees, or heirs apparent of the ward or may be made to 2individuals or charities in which the ward is believed to have 3an interest. The guardian shall also indicate in the petition 4that any planned disposition is consistent with the intentions 5of the ward insofar as they can be ascertained, and if the 6ward's intentions cannot be ascertained, the ward will be 7presumed to favor reduction in the incidents of various forms 8of taxation and the partial distribution of his or her estate 9as provided in this subsection. The guardian shall not, 10however, be required to include as a beneficiary or fiduciary 11any person who he has reason to believe would be excluded by 12the ward. A guardian shall be required to investigate and 13pursue a ward's eligibility for governmental benefits.14    (a-6) The guardian may, without an order of court, open, 15maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on behalf of 16the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent children as 17specified under Section 16.6 of the State Treasurer Act. 18    (b) Upon the direction of the court which issued his 19letters, a guardian may perform the contracts of his ward 20which were legally subsisting at the time of the commencement 21of the ward's disability. The court may authorize the guardian 22to execute and deliver any bill of sale, deed or other 23instrument.24    (c) The guardian of the estate of a ward shall appear for 25and represent the ward in all legal proceedings unless another 26person is appointed for that purpose as guardian or next   10400HB2562ham001- 13 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1friend. This does not impair the power of any court to appoint 2a guardian ad litem or next friend to defend the interests of 3the ward in that court, or to appoint or allow any person as 4the next friend of a ward to commence, prosecute or defend any 5proceeding in his behalf. Without impairing the power of the 6court in any respect, if the guardian of the estate of a ward 7and another person as next friend shall appear for and 8represent the ward in a legal proceeding in which the 9compensation of the attorney or attorneys representing the 10guardian and next friend is solely determined under a 11contingent fee arrangement, the guardian of the estate of the 12ward shall not participate in or have any duty to review the 13prosecution of the action, to participate in or review the 14appropriateness of any settlement of the action, or to 15participate in or review any determination of the 16appropriateness of any fees awarded to the attorney or 17attorneys employed in the prosecution of the action.18    (d) Adjudication of disability shall not revoke or 19otherwise terminate a trust which is revocable by the ward. A 20guardian of the estate shall have no authority to revoke a 21trust that is revocable by the ward, except that the court may 22authorize a guardian to revoke a Totten trust or similar 23deposit or withdrawable capital account in trust to the extent 24necessary to provide funds for the purposes specified in 25paragraph (a) of this Section. If the trustee of any trust for 26the benefit of the ward has discretionary power to apply   10400HB2562ham001- 14 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1income or principal for the ward's benefit, the trustee shall 2not be required to distribute any of the income or principal to 3the guardian of the ward's estate, but the guardian may bring 4an action on behalf of the ward to compel the trustee to 5exercise the trustee's discretion or to seek relief from an 6abuse of discretion. This paragraph shall not limit the right 7of a guardian of the estate to receive accountings from the 8trustee on behalf of the ward.9    (d-5) Upon a verified petition by the plenary or limited 10guardian of the estate or the request of the ward that is 11accompanied by a current physician's report that states the 12ward possesses testamentary capacity, the court may enter an 13order authorizing the ward to execute a will or codicil. In so 14ordering, the court shall authorize the guardian to retain 15independent counsel for the ward with whom the ward may 16execute or modify a will or codicil. 17    (e) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of 18Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 19principal under an agency that survives disability, the 20guardian will have no power, duty or liability with respect to 21any property subject to the agency. If the Office of State 22Guardian or a public guardian is appointed, all powers of 23attorney are suspended under subsection (g-1) of Section 2-10 24of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. This subsection (e) 25applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever executed.26    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the   10400HB2562ham001- 15 -LRB104 08064 JRC 23303 a1standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 2interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 3court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 4disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 5a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 6orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 7interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 8termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 9short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 10petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 11with a disability.12(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22.) 13    Section 10.
