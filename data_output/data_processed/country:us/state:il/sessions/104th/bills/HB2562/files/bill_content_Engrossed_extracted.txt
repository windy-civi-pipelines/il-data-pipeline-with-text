In the preparation and 7dissemination of training materials, the State Guardian shall 8give due consideration to making the training materials 9accessible to persons with disabilities.10(Source: P.A. 103-64, eff. 1-1-24.) 11    Section 10. The Probate Act of 1975 is amended by changing 12Section 11a-12, 11a-17, and 11a-18 as follows: 13    (755 ILCS 5/11a-12)  (from Ch. 110 1/2, par. 11a-12)14    Sec. 11a-12. Order of appointment.15    (a) If basis for the appointment of a guardian as 16specified in Section 11a-3 is not found, the court shall 17dismiss the petition.18    (b) If the respondent is adjudged to be a person with a 19disability and to lack some but not all of the capacity as 20specified in Section 11a-3, and if the court finds that 21guardianship is necessary for the protection of the person 22with a disability, his or her estate, or both, the court shall 23appoint a limited guardian for the respondent's person or 24estate or both. The court shall enter a written order stating   HB2562 Engrossed- 3 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1the factual basis for its findings and specifying the duties 2and powers of the guardian and the legal disabilities to which 3the respondent is subject.4    (c) If the respondent is adjudged to be a person with a 5disability and to be totally without capacity as specified in 6Section 11a-3, and if the court finds that limited 7guardianship will not provide sufficient protection for the 8person with a disability, his or her estate, or both, the court 9shall appoint a plenary guardian for the respondent's person 10or estate or both. The court shall enter a written order 11stating the factual basis for its findings.12    (d) The selection of the guardian shall be in the 13discretion of the court, which shall give due consideration to 14the preference of the person with a disability as to a 15guardian, as well as the qualifications of the proposed 16guardian, in making its appointment. However, the paramount 17concern in the selection of the guardian is the best interests 18and well-being of the person with a disability.19    One person or agency may be appointed a limited or plenary 20guardian of the person and another person or corporate trustee 21appointed as a limited or plenary guardian of the estate. If 22different persons are appointed, the court shall consider the 23factors set forth in subsection (b-5) of Section 11a-5. The 24court shall enter a written order stating the factual basis 25for its findings. 26    (e) The order of appointment of a guardian of the person   HB2562 Engrossed- 4 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1shall include the requirement that the guardian of the person 2complete the training program as provided in Section 33.5 of 3the Guardianship and Advocacy Act that outlines the 4responsibilities of the guardian of the person and the rights 5of the person under guardianship and file with the court a 6certificate of completion within one year from the date of 7issuance of the letters of guardianship, except that: (1) the 8chief judge of any circuit may order implementation of another 9training program by a suitable provider containing 10substantially similar content; (2) employees of the Office of 11the State Guardian, public guardians, attorneys currently 12authorized to practice law, corporate fiduciaries, and persons 13certified by the Center for Guardianship Certification are 14exempt from this training requirement; and (3) the court may, 15for good cause shown, exempt from this requirement an 16individual not otherwise listed in item (2). For the purposes 17of this subsection (e), good cause may be proven by affidavit. 18If the court finds good cause to exempt an individual from the 19training requirement, the order of appointment shall so state. 20(Source: P.A. 102-72, eff. 1-1-22; 102-770, eff. 1-1-23.) 21    (755 ILCS 5/11a-17)  (from Ch. 110 1/2, par. 11a-17)22    Sec. 11a-17. Duties of personal guardian. 23    (a) To the extent ordered by the court and under the 24direction of the court, the guardian of the person shall have 25custody of the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent   HB2562 Engrossed- 5 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1children and shall procure for them and shall make provision 2for their support, care, comfort, health, education and 3maintenance, and professional services as are appropriate, but 4the ward's spouse may not be deprived of the custody and 5education of the ward's minor and adult dependent children, 6without the consent of the spouse, unless the court finds that 7the spouse is not a fit and competent person to have that 8custody and education. The guardian shall assist the ward in 9the development of maximum self-reliance and independence. The 10guardian of the person may petition the court for an order 11directing the guardian of the estate to pay an amount 12periodically for the provision of the services specified by 13the court order. If the ward's estate is insufficient to 14provide for education and the guardian of the ward's person 15fails to provide education, the court may award the custody of 16the ward to some other person for the purpose of providing 17education. If a person makes a settlement upon or provision 18for the support or education of a ward, the court may make an 19order for the visitation of the ward by the person making the 20settlement or provision as the court deems proper. A guardian 21of the person may not admit a ward to a mental health facility 22except at the ward's request as provided in Article IV of the 23Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code and unless 24the ward has the capacity to consent to such admission as 25provided in Article IV of the Mental Health and Developmental 26Disabilities Code.   HB2562 Engrossed- 6 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1    (a-3) If a guardian of an estate has not been appointed, 2the guardian of the person may, without an order of court, 3open, maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on 4behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent 5children as specified under Section 16.6 of the State 6Treasurer Act. 7    (a-5) If the ward filed a petition for dissolution of 8marriage under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 9Marriage Act before the ward was adjudicated a person with a 10disability under this Article, the guardian of the ward's 11person and estate may maintain that action for dissolution of 12marriage on behalf of the ward. Upon petition by the guardian 13of the ward's person or estate, the court may authorize and 14direct a guardian of the ward's person or estate to file a 15petition for dissolution of marriage or to file a petition for 16legal separation or declaration of invalidity of marriage 17under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act on 18behalf of the ward if the court finds by clear and convincing 19evidence that the relief sought is in the ward's best 20interests. In making its determination, the court shall 21consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 22Section.23    (a-10) Upon petition by the guardian of the ward's person 24or estate, the court may authorize and direct a guardian of the 25ward's person or estate to consent, on behalf of the ward, to 26the ward's marriage pursuant to Part II of the Illinois   HB2562 Engrossed- 7 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act if the court finds by 2clear and convincing evidence that the marriage is in the 3ward's best interests. In making its determination, the court 4shall consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of 5this Section. Upon presentation of a court order authorizing 6and directing a guardian of the ward's person and estate to 7consent to the ward's marriage, the county clerk shall accept 8the guardian's application, appearance, and signature on 9behalf of the ward for purposes of issuing a license to marry 10under Section 203 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 11Marriage Act. 12    (b) If the court directs, the guardian of the person shall 13file with the court at intervals indicated by the court, a 14report that shall state briefly: (1) the current mental, 15physical, and social condition of the ward and the ward's 16minor and adult dependent children; (2) their present living 17arrangement, and a description and the address of every 18residence where they lived during the reporting period and the 19length of stay at each place; (3) a summary of the medical, 20educational, vocational, and other professional services given 21to them; (4) a resume of the guardian's visits with and 22activities on behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult 23dependent children; (5) a recommendation as to the need for 24continued guardianship; (6) any other information requested by 25the court or useful in the opinion of the guardian. The Office 26of the State Guardian shall assist the guardian in filing the   HB2562 Engrossed- 8 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1report when requested by the guardian. The court may take such 2action as it deems appropriate pursuant to the report.3    (c) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of 4Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 5principal under an agency that survives disability, the 6guardian has no power, duty, or liability with respect to any 7personal or health care matters covered by the agency. If the 8Office of State Guardian or a public guardian is appointed, 9all powers of attorney are suspended under subsection (g-1) of 10Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. This 11subsection (c) applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever 12executed.13    (d) A guardian acting as a surrogate decision maker under 14the Health Care Surrogate Act shall have all the rights of a 15surrogate under that Act without court order including the 16right to make medical treatment decisions such as decisions to 17forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Any decisions by 18the guardian to forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment 19that are not authorized under the Health Care Surrogate Act 20shall require a court order. Nothing in this Section shall 21prevent an agent acting under a power of attorney for health 22care from exercising his or her authority under the Illinois 23Power of Attorney Act without further court order, unless a 24court has acted under Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of 25Attorney Act. If a guardian is also a health care agent for the 26ward under a valid power of attorney for health care, the   HB2562 Engrossed- 9 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1guardian acting as agent may execute his or her authority 2under that act without further court order.3    (e) Decisions made by a guardian on behalf of a ward shall 4be made in accordance with the following standards for 5decision making. The guardian shall consider the ward's 6current preferences to the extent the ward has the ability to 7participate in decision making when those preferences are 8known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. Decisions 9by the guardian shall conform to the ward's current 10preferences: (1) unless the guardian reasonably believes that 11doing so would result in substantial harm to the ward's 12welfare or personal or financial interests; and (2) so long as 13such decisions give substantial weight to what the ward, if 14competent, would have done or intended under the 15circumstances, taking into account evidence that includes, but 16is not limited to, the ward's personal, philosophical, 17religious and moral beliefs, and ethical values relative to 18the decision to be made by the guardian. Where possible, the 19guardian shall determine how the ward would have made a 20decision based on the ward's previously expressed preferences, 21and make decisions in accordance with the preferences of the 22ward. If the ward's wishes are unknown and remain unknown 23after reasonable efforts to discern them, or if the guardian 24reasonably believes that a decision made in conformity with 25the ward's preferences would result in substantial harm to the 26ward's welfare or personal or financial interests, the   HB2562 Engrossed- 10 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1decision shall be made on the basis of the ward's best 2interests as determined by the guardian. In determining the 3ward's best interests, the guardian shall weigh the reason for 4and nature of the proposed action, the benefit or necessity of 5the action, the possible risks and other consequences of the 6proposed action, and any available alternatives and their 7risks, consequences and benefits, and shall take into account 8any other information, including the views of family and 9friends, that the guardian believes the ward would have 10considered if able to act for herself or himself.11    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the 12standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 13interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 14court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 15disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 16a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 17orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 18interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 19termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 20short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 21petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 22with a disability.23    (g)(1) Unless there is a court order to the contrary, the 24guardian, consistent with the standards set forth in 25subsection (e) of this Section, shall use reasonable efforts 26to notify the ward's known adult children, who have requested   HB2562 Engrossed- 11 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1notification and provided contact information, of the ward's 2admission to a hospital, hospice, or palliative care program, 3the ward's death, and the arrangements for the disposition of 4the ward's remains.5    (2) If a guardian unreasonably prevents an adult child, 6spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or adult sibling of the ward 7from visiting the ward, the court, upon a verified petition, 8may order the guardian to permit visitation between the ward 9and the adult child, spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or 10adult sibling. In making its determination, the court shall 11consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 12Section. The court shall not allow visitation if the court 13finds that the ward has capacity to evaluate and communicate 14decisions regarding visitation and expresses a desire not to 15have visitation with the petitioner. This subsection (g) does 16not apply to duly appointed public guardians or the Office of 17State Guardian.18(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22; 19102-258, eff. 8-6-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.) 20    (755 ILCS 5/11a-18)  (from Ch. 110 1/2, par. 11a-18)21    Sec. 11a-18. Duties of the estate guardian. 22    (a) To the extent specified in the order establishing the 23guardianship, the guardian of the estate shall have the care, 24management and investment of the estate, shall manage the 25estate frugally and shall apply the income and principal of   HB2562 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1the estate so far as necessary for the comfort and suitable 2support and education of the ward, his minor and adult 3dependent children, and persons related by blood or marriage 4who are dependent upon or entitled to support from him, or for 5any other purpose which the court deems to be for the best 6interests of the ward, and the court may approve the making on 7behalf of the ward of such agreements as the court determines 8to be for the ward's best interests. The guardian may make 9disbursement of his ward's funds and estate directly to the 10ward or other distributee or in such other manner and in such 11amounts as the court directs. If the estate of a ward is 12derived in whole or in part from payments of compensation, 13adjusted compensation, pension, insurance or other similar 14benefits made directly to the estate by the Veterans 15Administration, notice of the application for leave to invest 16or expend the ward's funds or estate, together with a copy of 17the petition and proposed order, shall be given to the 18Veterans' Administration Regional Office in this State at 19least 7 days before the hearing on the application.20    (a-5) The probate court, upon petition of a guardian, 21other than the guardian of a minor, and after notice to all 22other persons interested as the court directs, may authorize 23the guardian to exercise any or all powers over the estate and 24business affairs of the ward that the ward could exercise if 25present and not under disability. The court may authorize the 26taking of an action or the application of funds not required   HB2562 Engrossed- 13 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1for the ward's current and future maintenance and support in 2any manner approved by the court as being in keeping with the 3ward's wishes so far as they can be ascertained. The court must 4consider the permanence of the ward's disabling condition and 5the natural objects of the ward's bounty. In ascertaining and 6carrying out the ward's wishes the court may consider, but 7shall not be limited to, minimization of State or federal 8income, estate, or inheritance taxes; and providing gifts to 9charities, relatives, and friends that would be likely 10recipients of donations from the ward. The ward's wishes as 11best they can be ascertained shall be carried out, whether or 12not tax savings are involved. Actions or applications of funds 13may include, but shall not be limited to, the following:14        (1) making gifts of income or principal, or both, of 15    the estate, either outright or in trust;16        (2) conveying, releasing, or disclaiming his or her 17    contingent and expectant interests in property, including 18    marital property rights and any right of survivorship 19    incident to joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety;20        (3) releasing or disclaiming his or her powers as 21    trustee, personal representative, custodian for minors, or 22    guardian;23        (4) exercising, releasing, or disclaiming his or her 24    powers as donee of a power of appointment;25        (5) entering into contracts;26        (6) creating for the benefit of the ward or others,   HB2562 Engrossed- 14 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1    revocable or irrevocable trusts of his or her property 2    that may extend beyond his or her disability or life;3        (7) exercising options of the ward to purchase or 4    exchange securities or other property;5        (8) exercising the rights of the ward to elect benefit 6    or payment options, to terminate, to change beneficiaries 7    or ownership, to assign rights, to borrow, or to receive 8    cash value in return for a surrender of rights under any 9    one or more of the following:10            (i) life insurance policies, plans, or benefits,11            (ii) annuity policies, plans, or benefits,12            (iii) mutual fund and other dividend investment 13        plans,14            (iv) retirement, profit sharing, and employee 15        welfare plans and benefits;16        (9) exercising his or her right to claim or disclaim 17    an elective share in the estate of his or her deceased 18    spouse and to renounce any interest by testate or 19    intestate succession or by inter vivos transfer;20        (10) changing the ward's residence or domicile; or21        (11) modifying by means of codicil or trust amendment 22    the terms of the ward's will or any revocable trust 23    created by the ward, as the court may consider advisable 24    in light of changes in applicable tax laws.25    The guardian in his or her petition shall briefly outline 26the action or application of funds for which he or she seeks   HB2562 Engrossed- 15 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1approval, the results expected to be accomplished thereby, and 2the tax savings, if any, expected to accrue. The proposed 3action or application of funds may include gifts of the ward's 4personal property or real estate, but transfers of real estate 5shall be subject to the requirements of Section 20 of this Act. 6Gifts may be for the benefit of prospective legatees, 7devisees, or heirs apparent of the ward or may be made to 8individuals or charities in which the ward is believed to have 9an interest. The guardian shall also indicate in the petition 10that any planned disposition is consistent with the intentions 11of the ward insofar as they can be ascertained, and if the 12ward's intentions cannot be ascertained, the ward will be 13presumed to favor reduction in the incidents of various forms 14of taxation and the partial distribution of his or her estate 15as provided in this subsection. The guardian shall not, 16however, be required to include as a beneficiary or fiduciary 17any person who he has reason to believe would be excluded by 18the ward. A guardian shall be required to investigate and 19pursue a ward's eligibility for governmental benefits.20    (a-6) The guardian may, without an order of court, open, 21maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on behalf of 22the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent children as 23specified under Section 16.6 of the State Treasurer Act. 24    (b) Upon the direction of the court which issued his 25letters, a guardian may perform the contracts of his ward 26which were legally subsisting at the time of the commencement   HB2562 Engrossed- 16 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1of the ward's disability. The court may authorize the guardian 2to execute and deliver any bill of sale, deed or other 3instrument.4    (c) The guardian of the estate of a ward shall appear for 5and represent the ward in all legal proceedings unless another 6person is appointed for that purpose as guardian or next 7friend. This does not impair the power of any court to appoint 8a guardian ad litem or next friend to defend the interests of 9the ward in that court, or to appoint or allow any person as 10the next friend of a ward to commence, prosecute or defend any 11proceeding in his behalf. Without impairing the power of the 12court in any respect, if the guardian of the estate of a ward 13and another person as next friend shall appear for and 14represent the ward in a legal proceeding in which the 15compensation of the attorney or attorneys representing the 16guardian and next friend is solely determined under a 17contingent fee arrangement, the guardian of the estate of the 18ward shall not participate in or have any duty to review the 19prosecution of the action, to participate in or review the 20appropriateness of any settlement of the action, or to 21participate in or review any determination of the 22appropriateness of any fees awarded to the attorney or 23attorneys employed in the prosecution of the action.24    (d) Adjudication of disability shall not revoke or 25otherwise terminate a trust which is revocable by the ward. A 26guardian of the estate shall have no authority to revoke a   HB2562 Engrossed- 17 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1trust that is revocable by the ward, except that the court may 2authorize a guardian to revoke a Totten trust or similar 3deposit or withdrawable capital account in trust to the extent 4necessary to provide funds for the purposes specified in 5paragraph (a) of this Section. If the trustee of any trust for 6the benefit of the ward has discretionary power to apply 7income or principal for the ward's benefit, the trustee shall 8not be required to distribute any of the income or principal to 9the guardian of the ward's estate, but the guardian may bring 10an action on behalf of the ward to compel the trustee to 11exercise the trustee's discretion or to seek relief from an 12abuse of discretion. This paragraph shall not limit the right 13of a guardian of the estate to receive accountings from the 14trustee on behalf of the ward.15    (d-5) Upon a verified petition by the plenary or limited 16guardian of the estate or the request of the ward that is 17accompanied by a current physician's report that states the 18ward possesses testamentary capacity, the court may enter an 19order authorizing the ward to execute a will or codicil. In so 20ordering, the court shall authorize the guardian to retain 21independent counsel for the ward with whom the ward may 22execute or modify a will or codicil. 23    (e) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of 24Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 25principal under an agency that survives disability, the 26guardian will have no power, duty or liability with respect to   HB2562 Engrossed- 18 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1any property subject to the agency. If the Office of State 2Guardian or a public guardian is appointed, all powers of 3attorney are suspended under subsection (g-1) of Section 2-10 4of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. This subsection (e) 5applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever executed.6    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the 7standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 8interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 9court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 10disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 11a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 12orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 13interests of the person with a disability.

The court shall enter a written order stating   HB2562 Engrossed- 3 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1the factual basis for its findings and specifying the duties 2and powers of the guardian and the legal disabilities to which 3the respondent is subject.4    (c) If the respondent is adjudged to be a person with a 5disability and to be totally without capacity as specified in 6Section 11a-3, and if the court finds that limited 7guardianship will not provide sufficient protection for the 8person with a disability, his or her estate, or both, the court 9shall appoint a plenary guardian for the respondent's person 10or estate or both. The court shall enter a written order 11stating the factual basis for its findings.12    (d) The selection of the guardian shall be in the 13discretion of the court, which shall give due consideration to 14the preference of the person with a disability as to a 15guardian, as well as the qualifications of the proposed 16guardian, in making its appointment. However, the paramount 17concern in the selection of the guardian is the best interests 18and well-being of the person with a disability.19    One person or agency may be appointed a limited or plenary 20guardian of the person and another person or corporate trustee 21appointed as a limited or plenary guardian of the estate. If 22different persons are appointed, the court shall consider the 23factors set forth in subsection (b-5) of Section 11a-5.

The guardian shall assist the ward in 9the development of maximum self-reliance and independence. The 10guardian of the person may petition the court for an order 11directing the guardian of the estate to pay an amount 12periodically for the provision of the services specified by 13the court order. If the ward's estate is insufficient to 14provide for education and the guardian of the ward's person 15fails to provide education, the court may award the custody of 16the ward to some other person for the purpose of providing 17education. If a person makes a settlement upon or provision 18for the support or education of a ward, the court may make an 19order for the visitation of the ward by the person making the 20settlement or provision as the court deems proper. A guardian 21of the person may not admit a ward to a mental health facility 22except at the ward's request as provided in Article IV of the 23Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code and unless 24the ward has the capacity to consent to such admission as 25provided in Article IV of the Mental Health and Developmental 26Disabilities Code.   HB2562 Engrossed- 6 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1    (a-3) If a guardian of an estate has not been appointed, 2the guardian of the person may, without an order of court, 3open, maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on 4behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent 5children as specified under Section 16.6 of the State 6Treasurer Act. 7    (a-5) If the ward filed a petition for dissolution of 8marriage under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 9Marriage Act before the ward was adjudicated a person with a 10disability under this Article, the guardian of the ward's 11person and estate may maintain that action for dissolution of 12marriage on behalf of the ward. Upon petition by the guardian 13of the ward's person or estate, the court may authorize and 14direct a guardian of the ward's person or estate to file a 15petition for dissolution of marriage or to file a petition for 16legal separation or declaration of invalidity of marriage 17under the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act on 18behalf of the ward if the court finds by clear and convincing 19evidence that the relief sought is in the ward's best 20interests. In making its determination, the court shall 21consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 22Section.23    (a-10) Upon petition by the guardian of the ward's person 24or estate, the court may authorize and direct a guardian of the 25ward's person or estate to consent, on behalf of the ward, to 26the ward's marriage pursuant to Part II of the Illinois   HB2562 Engrossed- 7 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act if the court finds by 2clear and convincing evidence that the marriage is in the 3ward's best interests. In making its determination, the court 4shall consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of 5this Section. Upon presentation of a court order authorizing 6and directing a guardian of the ward's person and estate to 7consent to the ward's marriage, the county clerk shall accept 8the guardian's application, appearance, and signature on 9behalf of the ward for purposes of issuing a license to marry 10under Section 203 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 11Marriage Act. 12    (b) If the court directs, the guardian of the person shall 13file with the court at intervals indicated by the court, a 14report that shall state briefly: (1) the current mental, 15physical, and social condition of the ward and the ward's 16minor and adult dependent children; (2) their present living 17arrangement, and a description and the address of every 18residence where they lived during the reporting period and the 19length of stay at each place; (3) a summary of the medical, 20educational, vocational, and other professional services given 21to them; (4) a resume of the guardian's visits with and 22activities on behalf of the ward and the ward's minor and adult 23dependent children; (5) a recommendation as to the need for 24continued guardianship; (6) any other information requested by 25the court or useful in the opinion of the guardian. The Office 26of the State Guardian shall assist the guardian in filing the   HB2562 Engrossed- 8 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1report when requested by the guardian. The court may take such 2action as it deems appropriate pursuant to the report.3    (c) Absent court order pursuant to the Illinois Power of 4Attorney Act directing a guardian to exercise powers of the 5principal under an agency that survives disability, the 6guardian has no power, duty, or liability with respect to any 7personal or health care matters covered by the agency. If the 8Office of State Guardian or a public guardian is appointed, 9all powers of attorney are suspended under subsection (g-1) of 10Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of Attorney Act. This 11subsection (c) applies to all agencies, whenever and wherever 12executed.13    (d) A guardian acting as a surrogate decision maker under 14the Health Care Surrogate Act shall have all the rights of a 15surrogate under that Act without court order including the 16right to make medical treatment decisions such as decisions to 17forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment. Any decisions by 18the guardian to forgo or withdraw life-sustaining treatment 19that are not authorized under the Health Care Surrogate Act 20shall require a court order. Nothing in this Section shall 21prevent an agent acting under a power of attorney for health 22care from exercising his or her authority under the Illinois 23Power of Attorney Act without further court order, unless a 24court has acted under Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of 25Attorney Act. If a guardian is also a health care agent for the 26ward under a valid power of attorney for health care, the   HB2562 Engrossed- 9 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1guardian acting as agent may execute his or her authority 2under that act without further court order.3    (e) Decisions made by a guardian on behalf of a ward shall 4be made in accordance with the following standards for 5decision making. The guardian shall consider the ward's 6current preferences to the extent the ward has the ability to 7participate in decision making when those preferences are 8known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. Decisions 9by the guardian shall conform to the ward's current 10preferences: (1) unless the guardian reasonably believes that 11doing so would result in substantial harm to the ward's 12welfare or personal or financial interests; and (2) so long as 13such decisions give substantial weight to what the ward, if 14competent, would have done or intended under the 15circumstances, taking into account evidence that includes, but 16is not limited to, the ward's personal, philosophical, 17religious and moral beliefs, and ethical values relative to 18the decision to be made by the guardian. Where possible, the 19guardian shall determine how the ward would have made a 20decision based on the ward's previously expressed preferences, 21and make decisions in accordance with the preferences of the 22ward. If the ward's wishes are unknown and remain unknown 23after reasonable efforts to discern them, or if the guardian 24reasonably believes that a decision made in conformity with 25the ward's preferences would result in substantial harm to the 26ward's welfare or personal or financial interests, the   HB2562 Engrossed- 10 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1decision shall be made on the basis of the ward's best 2interests as determined by the guardian. In determining the 3ward's best interests, the guardian shall weigh the reason for 4and nature of the proposed action, the benefit or necessity of 5the action, the possible risks and other consequences of the 6proposed action, and any available alternatives and their 7risks, consequences and benefits, and shall take into account 8any other information, including the views of family and 9friends, that the guardian believes the ward would have 10considered if able to act for herself or himself.11    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the 12standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 13interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 14court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 15disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of 16a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 17orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 18interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 19termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 20short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 21petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 22with a disability.23    (g)(1) Unless there is a court order to the contrary, the 24guardian, consistent with the standards set forth in 25subsection (e) of this Section, shall use reasonable efforts 26to notify the ward's known adult children, who have requested   HB2562 Engrossed- 11 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1notification and provided contact information, of the ward's 2admission to a hospital, hospice, or palliative care program, 3the ward's death, and the arrangements for the disposition of 4the ward's remains.5    (2) If a guardian unreasonably prevents an adult child, 6spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or adult sibling of the ward 7from visiting the ward, the court, upon a verified petition, 8may order the guardian to permit visitation between the ward 9and the adult child, spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or 10adult sibling. In making its determination, the court shall 11consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 12Section. The court shall not allow visitation if the court 13finds that the ward has capacity to evaluate and communicate 14decisions regarding visitation and expresses a desire not to 15have visitation with the petitioner. This subsection (g) does 16not apply to duly appointed public guardians or the Office of 17State Guardian.18(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22; 19102-258, eff. 8-6-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.) 20    (755 ILCS 5/11a-18)  (from Ch. 110 1/2, par. 11a-18)21    Sec. 11a-18. Duties of the estate guardian. 22    (a) To the extent specified in the order establishing the 23guardianship, the guardian of the estate shall have the care, 24management and investment of the estate, shall manage the 25estate frugally and shall apply the income and principal of   HB2562 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1the estate so far as necessary for the comfort and suitable 2support and education of the ward, his minor and adult 3dependent children, and persons related by blood or marriage 4who are dependent upon or entitled to support from him, or for 5any other purpose which the court deems to be for the best 6interests of the ward, and the court may approve the making on 7behalf of the ward of such agreements as the court determines 8to be for the ward's best interests. The guardian may make 9disbursement of his ward's funds and estate directly to the 10ward or other distributee or in such other manner and in such 11amounts as the court directs. If the estate of a ward is 12derived in whole or in part from payments of compensation, 13adjusted compensation, pension, insurance or other similar 14benefits made directly to the estate by the Veterans 15Administration, notice of the application for leave to invest 16or expend the ward's funds or estate, together with a copy of 17the petition and proposed order, shall be given to the 18Veterans' Administration Regional Office in this State at 19least 7 days before the hearing on the application.20    (a-5) The probate court, upon petition of a guardian, 21other than the guardian of a minor, and after notice to all 22other persons interested as the court directs, may authorize 23the guardian to exercise any or all powers over the estate and 24business affairs of the ward that the ward could exercise if 25present and not under disability. The court may authorize the 26taking of an action or the application of funds not required   HB2562 Engrossed- 13 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1for the ward's current and future maintenance and support in 2any manner approved by the court as being in keeping with the 3ward's wishes so far as they can be ascertained. The court must 4consider the permanence of the ward's disabling condition and 5the natural objects of the ward's bounty. In ascertaining and 6carrying out the ward's wishes the court may consider, but 7shall not be limited to, minimization of State or federal 8income, estate, or inheritance taxes; and providing gifts to 9charities, relatives, and friends that would be likely 10recipients of donations from the ward. The ward's wishes as 11best they can be ascertained shall be carried out, whether or 12not tax savings are involved.

The proposed 3action or application of funds may include gifts of the ward's 4personal property or real estate, but transfers of real estate 5shall be subject to the requirements of Section 20 of this Act. 6Gifts may be for the benefit of prospective legatees, 7devisees, or heirs apparent of the ward or may be made to 8individuals or charities in which the ward is believed to have 9an interest. The guardian shall also indicate in the petition 10that any planned disposition is consistent with the intentions 11of the ward insofar as they can be ascertained, and if the 12ward's intentions cannot be ascertained, the ward will be 13presumed to favor reduction in the incidents of various forms 14of taxation and the partial distribution of his or her estate 15as provided in this subsection. The guardian shall not, 16however, be required to include as a beneficiary or fiduciary 17any person who he has reason to believe would be excluded by 18the ward. A guardian shall be required to investigate and 19pursue a ward's eligibility for governmental benefits.20    (a-6) The guardian may, without an order of court, open, 21maintain, and transfer funds to an ABLE account on behalf of 22the ward and the ward's minor and adult dependent children as 23specified under Section 16.6 of the State Treasurer Act. 24    (b) Upon the direction of the court which issued his 25letters, a guardian may perform the contracts of his ward 26which were legally subsisting at the time of the commencement   HB2562 Engrossed- 16 -LRB104 08064 JRC 18110 b1of the ward's disability.

If the trustee of any trust for 6the benefit of the ward has discretionary power to apply 7income or principal for the ward's benefit, the trustee shall 8not be required to distribute any of the income or principal to 9the guardian of the ward's estate, but the guardian may bring 10an action on behalf of the ward to compel the trustee to 11exercise the trustee's discretion or to seek relief from an 12abuse of discretion.
