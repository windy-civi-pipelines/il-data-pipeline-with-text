Findings. 5    (a) The General Assembly finds all of the following:6        (1) Suspicious death cases, when there is a history of 7    being victimized by domestic violence, are inadequately 8    investigated at times, when a premature decision is made 9    to determine the cause of death as suicide even before a 10    comprehensive investigation has been completed by law 11    enforcement professionals.12        (2) Domestic violence-related homicides are highly 13    susceptible to staging or alteration of the death scene 14    before investigators can conduct a scene investigation, 15    which hampers the responsibilities of the coroner or 16    medical examiner and compromises the ability of 17    investigators to evaluate death cases adequately.18        (3) Research has identified 10 red flag markers in 19    suspicious death cases, when there is a history of being 20    victimized by domestic violence, that should be evaluated 21    in any death investigation.22        (4) An independent right of family members of homicide 23    victims has been created in federal law to obtain 24    information, access victim services, and request an   SB1781- 2 -LRB104 07511 RLC 17555 b1    independent review of initial findings or the 2    investigation of the death of their family member but the 3    law applies only to those cases under federal 4    jurisdiction.5    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to provide 6victim services and support to family members in suspicious 7death cases and support family members who seek a second 8opinion on the death of their loved one at no cost to any 9public agency whenever practicable. 10    Section 5.

Findings. 5    (a) The General Assembly finds all of the following:6        (1) Suspicious death cases, when there is a history of 7    being victimized by domestic violence, are inadequately 8    investigated at times, when a premature decision is made 9    to determine the cause of death as suicide even before a 10    comprehensive investigation has been completed by law 11    enforcement professionals.12        (2) Domestic violence-related homicides are highly 13    susceptible to staging or alteration of the death scene 14    before investigators can conduct a scene investigation, 15    which hampers the responsibilities of the coroner or 16    medical examiner and compromises the ability of 17    investigators to evaluate death cases adequately.18        (3) Research has identified 10 red flag markers in 19    suspicious death cases, when there is a history of being 20    victimized by domestic violence, that should be evaluated 21    in any death investigation.22        (4) An independent right of family members of homicide 23    victims has been created in federal law to obtain 24    information, access victim services, and request an   SB1781- 2 -LRB104 07511 RLC 17555 b1    independent review of initial findings or the 2    investigation of the death of their family member but the 3    law applies only to those cases under federal 4    jurisdiction.5    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to provide 6victim services and support to family members in suspicious 7death cases and support family members who seek a second 8opinion on the death of their loved one at no cost to any 9public agency whenever practicable. 10    Section 5.

In the case of death without 5attendance by a licensed physician, the body may be moved with 6the coroner's consent from the place of death to a mortuary in 7the same county. Coroners in their discretion shall notify 8such physician as is designated in accordance with Section 93-3014 to attempt to ascertain the cause of death, either by 10autopsy or otherwise.11    In cases of accidental death involving a motor vehicle in 12which the decedent was (1) the operator or a suspected 13operator of a motor vehicle, or (2) a pedestrian 16 years of 14age or older, the coroner shall require that a blood specimen 15of at least 30 cc., and if medically possible a urine specimen 16of at least 30 cc. or as much as possible up to 30 cc., be 17withdrawn from the body of the decedent in a timely fashion 18after the crash causing his death, by such physician as has 19been designated in accordance with Section 3-3014, or by the 20coroner or deputy coroner or a qualified person designated by 21such physician, coroner, or deputy coroner. If the county does 22not maintain laboratory facilities for making such analysis, 23the blood and urine so drawn shall be sent to the Illinois 24State Police or any other accredited or State-certified 25laboratory for analysis of the alcohol, carbon monoxide, and 26dangerous or narcotic drug content of such blood and urine   SB1781- 15 -LRB104 07511 RLC 17555 b1specimens. Each specimen submitted shall be accompanied by 2pertinent information concerning the decedent upon a form 3prescribed by such laboratory. Any person drawing blood and 4urine and any person making any examination of the blood and 5urine under the terms of this Division shall be immune from all 6liability, civil or criminal, that might otherwise be incurred 7or imposed.8    In all other cases coming within the jurisdiction of the 9coroner and referred to in subparagraphs (a) through (e) 10above, blood, and, whenever possible, urine samples shall be 11analyzed for the presence of alcohol and other drugs. When the 12coroner suspects that drugs may have been involved in the 13death, either directly or indirectly, a toxicological 14examination shall be performed which may include analyses of 15blood, urine, bile, gastric contents, and other tissues. When 16the coroner suspects a death is due to toxic substances, other 17than drugs, the coroner shall consult with the toxicologist 18prior to collection of samples. Information submitted to the 19toxicologist shall include information as to height, weight, 20age, sex, and race of the decedent as well as medical history, 21medications used by, and the manner of death of the decedent.22    When the coroner or medical examiner finds that the cause 23of death is due to homicidal means, the coroner or medical 24examiner shall cause blood and buccal specimens (tissue may be 25submitted if no uncontaminated blood or buccal specimen can be 26obtained), whenever possible, to be withdrawn from the body of   SB1781- 16 -LRB104 07511 RLC 17555 b1the decedent in a timely fashion. For proper preservation of 2the specimens, collected blood and buccal specimens shall be 3dried and tissue specimens shall be frozen if available 4equipment exists. As soon as possible, but no later than 30 5days after the collection of the specimens, the coroner or 6medical examiner shall release those specimens to the police 7agency responsible for investigating the death. As soon as 8possible, but no later than 30 days after the receipt from the 9coroner or medical examiner, the police agency shall submit 10the specimens using the agency case number to a National DNA 11Index System (NDIS) participating laboratory within this 12State, such as the Illinois State Police, Division of Forensic 13Services, for analysis and categorizing into genetic marker 14groupings. The results of the analysis and categorizing into 15genetic marker groupings shall be provided to the Illinois 16State Police and shall be maintained by the Illinois State 17Police in the State central repository in the same manner, and 18subject to the same conditions, as provided in Section 5-4-3 19of the Unified Code of Corrections.

The   SB1781- 17 -LRB104 07511 RLC 17555 b1summons shall command these persons to present themselves 2personally at such a place and time as the coroner shall 3determine, and may be in any form which the coroner shall 4determine and may incorporate any reasonable form of request 5for acknowledgment which the coroner deems practical and 6provides a reliable proof of service. The summons may be 7served by first class mail. From the 8 persons so summoned, the 8coroner shall select 6 to serve as the jury for the inquest. 9Inquests may be continued from time to time, as the coroner may 10deem necessary. The 6 jurors selected in a given case may view 11the body of the deceased. If at any continuation of an inquest 12one or more of the original jurors shall be unable to continue 13to serve, the coroner shall fill the vacancy or vacancies. A 14juror serving pursuant to this paragraph shall receive 15compensation from the county at the same rate as the rate of 16compensation that is paid to petit or grand jurors in the 17county. The coroner shall furnish to each juror without fee at 18the time of his discharge a certificate of the number of days 19in attendance at an inquest, and, upon being presented with 20such certificate, the county treasurer shall pay to the juror 21the sum provided for his services.22    In counties which have a jury commission, in cases of 23apparent suicide or homicide or of accidental death, the 24coroner may conduct an inquest. The jury commission shall 25provide at least 8 jurors to the coroner, from whom the coroner 26shall select any 6 to serve as the jury for the inquest.   SB1781- 18 -LRB104 07511 RLC 17555 b1Inquests may be continued from time to time as the coroner may 2deem necessary. The 6 jurors originally chosen in a given case 3may view the body of the deceased. If at any continuation of an 4inquest one or more of the 6 jurors originally chosen shall be 5unable to continue to serve, the coroner shall fill the 6vacancy or vacancies. At the coroner's discretion, additional 7jurors to fill such vacancies shall be supplied by the jury 8commission. A juror serving pursuant to this paragraph in such 9county shall receive compensation from the county at the same 10rate as the rate of compensation that is paid to petit or grand 11jurors in the county.12    In every case in which a fire is determined to be a 13contributing factor in a death, the coroner shall report the 14death to the Office of the State Fire Marshal. The coroner 15shall provide a copy of the death certificate (i) within 30 16days after filing the permanent death certificate and (ii) in 17a manner that is agreed upon by the coroner and the State Fire 18Marshal. 19    In every case in which a drug overdose is officially 20determined to be the cause or a contributing factor in the 21death, the coroner or medical examiner shall report the death 22to the Department of Public Health. The Department of Public 23Health shall adopt rules regarding specific information that 24must be reported in the event of such a death, including, at a 25minimum, the following information, if possible: (i) the cause 26of the overdose; (ii) whether or not fentanyl was part or all   SB1781- 19 -LRB104 07511 RLC 17555 b1of the consumed substance; (iii) if fentanyl is part of the 2consumed substance, what other substances were consumed; and 3(iv) if fentanyl is part of the consumed substance, in what 4proportion was fentanyl consumed to other substance or 5substances. The coroner must also communicate whether there 6was a suspicious level of fentanyl in combination with other 7controlled substances present to all law enforcement agencies 8in whose jurisdiction the deceased's body was found in a 9prompt manner. As used in this paragraph, "overdose" has the 10same meaning as it does in Section 414 of the Illinois 11Controlled Substances Act. The Department of Public Health 12shall issue a semiannual report to the General Assembly 13summarizing the reports received. The Department shall also 14provide on its website a monthly report of overdose death 15figures organized by location, age, and any other factors the 16Department deems appropriate. 17    In addition, in every case in which domestic violence is 18determined to be a contributing factor in a death, the coroner 19shall report the death to the Illinois State Police.20    All deaths in State institutions and all deaths of wards 21of the State or youth in care as defined in Section 4d of the 22Children and Family Services Act in private care facilities or 23in programs funded by the Department of Human Services under 24its powers relating to mental health and developmental 25disabilities or alcoholism and substance abuse or funded by 26the Department of Children and Family Services shall be   SB1781- 20 -LRB104 07511 RLC 17555 b1reported to the coroner of the county in which the facility is 2located. If the coroner has reason to believe that an 3investigation is needed to determine whether the death was 4caused by maltreatment or negligent care of the ward of the 5State or youth in care as defined in Section 4d of the Children 6and Family Services Act, the coroner may conduct a preliminary 7investigation of the circumstances of such death as in cases 8of death under circumstances set forth in subparagraphs (a) 9through (e) of this Section.10(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 102-982, eff. 7-1-23; 11103-154, eff. 6-30-23; 103-842, eff. 1-1-25.) 12    Section 20.
