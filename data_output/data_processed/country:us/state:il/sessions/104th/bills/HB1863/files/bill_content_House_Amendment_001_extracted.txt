Amend House Bill 1863 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the One 5Health Commission Act. 6    Section 5. Findings and purpose. The General Assembly 7finds that:8        (1) The term "One Health" reflects the 9    interconnectedness of human health, animal health, and the 10    environment.11        (2) The strong connections and interdependency between 12    humans, companion animals, livestock, wildlife, and 13    ecosystem health are recognized in the One Health 14    Framework, which facilitates addressing zoonotic diseases, 15    vector-borne diseases, antimicrobial resistance, and other 16    complex, multidisciplinary issues.   10400HB1863ham001- 2 -LRB104 10416 BDA 23415 a1        (3) Existing One Health initiatives at the federal 2    level were included in both the 2021 Report of the 3    Appropriations Committee of the United States House of 4    Representatives and the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations 5    Act. Congress directed the Centers for Disease Control and 6    Prevention to collaborate with the U.S. Department of 7    Agriculture, U.S. Department of the Interior, and other 8    federal agency partners: 9            (A) to create a National One Health framework to 10        address zoonotic diseases and advance public health 11        preparedness in the United States; and12            (B) to collaborate with interagency partners on 13        the development of a One Health coordination mechanism 14        at the federal level to strengthen One Health 15        collaboration related to the prevention of, detection 16        of, control of, and response to zoonotic diseases and 17        related One Health work across the federal government. 18        (4) Existing One Health initiatives in other states 19    include the passage of Senate Bill 347 and Assembly Bill 20    1992 in New Jersey in June 2021 for the purpose of 21    developing a New Jersey One Health Commission.22        (5) Awareness and collaboration among disciplines will 23    help protect the environment and the health of all 24    species, will save lives in present and future 25    generations, and will improve the quality of life, the 26    physical and mental health, and the productivity of   10400HB1863ham001- 3 -LRB104 10416 BDA 23415 a1    residents of the State. 2        (6) A One Health approach recognizes that the health 3    of people is connected to the health of animals and the 4    environment, and it has been described as a collaborative, 5    multisector, and transdisciplinary approach, working at 6    the local, regional, national, and global levels, with the 7    goal of achieving optimal health outcomes while 8    recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, 9    plants, and their shared environment. 10        (7) A One Health approach is important because 11    approximately 60% of known infectious diseases in humans 12    and 75% of emerging infectious diseases originate from 13    animals; environmental factors, including climate change, 14    land-use changes, and biodiversity loss, significantly 15    influence the emergence and transmission of zoonotic 16    diseases. Animals can serve as early warning indicators of 17    potential public health threats, and robust agricultural 18    and environmental health systems are integral to public 19    health preparedness and response efforts.20        (8) It is, therefore, in the public interest for the 21    State to establish a One Health Commission to promote the 22    health and wellness of Illinois' natural resource, 23    residents, and animals, including pets, livestock, and 24    wildlife, by encouraging the collaborative efforts of 25    experts and leveraging knowledge and resources 26    effectively.   10400HB1863ham001- 4 -LRB104 10416 BDA 23415 a1    Section 10. Definitions.
