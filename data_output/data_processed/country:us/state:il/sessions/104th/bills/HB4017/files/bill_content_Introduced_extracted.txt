When a board of 14    education faces financial difficulties, continued 15    operation of the public school system is threatened. 16        (ii) A sound financial structure is essential to the 17    continued operation of any school system. It is vital to 18    commercial, educational, and cultural interests that the 19    public schools remain in operation.

When a board of 14    education faces financial difficulties, continued 15    operation of the public school system is threatened. 16        (ii) A sound financial structure is essential to the 17    continued operation of any school system. It is vital to 18    commercial, educational, and cultural interests that the 19    public schools remain in operation. To achieve that goal, 20    public school systems must have effective access to the 21    private market to borrow short and long term funds. 22        (iii) To promote the financial integrity of boards of 23    education of cities having a population exceeding 500,000,   HB4017- 2 -LRB104 12646 LNS 23374 b1    it is necessary to provide for the creation of school 2    finance authorities with the powers necessary to promote 3    sound financial management and to assure the continued 4    operation of the public schools.5    (b) It is the purpose of this Article to provide a secure 6financial basis for the continued operation of the public 7schools. In addition, it is the further purpose of this 8Article to facilitate implementation of school reform in the 9continued operation of the public schools in accordance with 10the provisions of this amendatory Act of 1991 and in 11accordance with the reinstatement of the Authority by this 12amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly. The intention of 13the General Assembly, in enacting this legislation, is to 14establish procedures, provide powers, and impose restrictions 15to assure the financial and educational integrity of the 16public schools while leaving principal responsibility for the 17educational policies of the public schools to the boards of 18education within the State, consistent with the requirements 19for satisfying the public policy and purpose herein set forth.20(Source: P.A. 85-1418; 86-1477.) 21    (105 ILCS 5/34A-103)  (from Ch. 122, par. 34A-103)22    Sec. 34A-103.
