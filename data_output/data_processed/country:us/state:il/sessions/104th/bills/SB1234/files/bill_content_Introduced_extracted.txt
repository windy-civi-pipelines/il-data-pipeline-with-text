Effective immediately.LRB104 04066 BDA 14090 b  A BILL FOR SB1234LRB104 04066 BDA 14090 b1    AN ACT concerning State government. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly:  4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Illinois Regional Generation Reliability Task Force Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly hereby finds, 7determines, and declares the following:8        (1) The reliability of the electricity grid of the 9    State is critically important to the consumers, 10    businesses, and residents of this State and should not be 11    compromised.12        (2) The State has taken definitive steps toward 13    redefining the generation mix in this State.14        (3) The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. 15    ("MISO") is an independent, not-for-profit, member-based 16    organization responsible for operating the power grid 17    across 15 states and the Canadian province of Manitoba, 18    serving 42 million people.19        (4) The PJM Interconnection LLC ("PJM"), is an 20    independent not-for-profit, member-based Regional 21    Transmission Organization ("RTO") that manages the 22    operations, supply, and movement of power across 13 states 23    and the District of Columbia, serving 65 million people.  SB1234- 2 -LRB104 04066 BDA 14090 b1        (5) The State is served by both PJM and MISO, which 2    collectively ensure that sufficient electric power 3    generation supply and transmission are available to meet 4    electric demand every minute of every day for over 107 5    million people across 28 states and 2 countries. Wholesale 6    electric power generation is regulated by the Federal 7    Energy Regulatory Commission due to the interstate and 8    international nature of the transmission grid operated by 9    PJM and MISO. As such, policy changes at the State level 10    can affect the reliability, availability, and cost of 11    power for seniors, families, businesses, municipalities, 12    universities, and hospitals across the region.13        (6) When natural disasters occur, such as ice storms, 14    blizzards, tornadoes, and hurricanes, states participating 15    in PJM and MISO have provided support to each other 16    through power generation restoration missions. The 17    inability to deliver power generation in critical times 18    can have a huge economic impact and can also result in 19    death across the PJM and MISO regional transmission 20    organizations.21        (7) PJM and MISO have multiple markets in which power 22    suppliers participate. The capacity market, day-ahead 23    energy market, and frequency market are markets that power 24    generators participate in to ensure over 107 million 25    people across 28 states and 2 countries receive the right 26    amount of electricity every minute of every day.  SB1234- 3 -LRB104 04066 BDA 14090 b1            (A) Capacity markets are used in wholesale 2        electricity markets to pay resources for being 3        available to meet peak electricity demand. Capacity is 4        not actual electricity but rather the ability to 5        produce electricity when called upon. Capacity is 6        procured sometimes multiple years in advance of when 7        it is needed, based on projections of future energy 8        needs using historical demand requirements.9            (B) The day-ahead energy market lets market 10        participants commit to buy or sell wholesale 11        electricity one day before the power is needed, to 12        help avoid price volatility. The real-time energy 13        market balances the differences between day-ahead 14        commitments and the actual real-time demand for and 15        production of electricity.16            (C) The power grid operates, and shall be 17        maintained, at a constant frequency of 60 hertz. 18        Significant deviation from this level can result in 19        catastrophic damage to the power grid as well as 20        household appliances. Frequency is maintained when 21        electric generators automatically add or remove power 22        from the grid. For example, a large power plant 23        suddenly tripping offline reduces the total amount of 24        available kinetic energy, leading the rotating 25        generators on the system to start rotating less 26        rapidly and thereby decreasing the alternating current   SB1234- 4 -LRB104 04066 BDA 14090 b1        frequency across the grid system. Since a generator 2        turbine's rotational velocity is directly coupled to 3        the grid frequency, the generator's control systems 4        can sense this frequency decline as an indicator of 5        insufficient energy provision. The control system 6        within each power plant, which usually has been in the 7        form of a governor, can then automatically increase 8        the plant's power output. This process is autonomous 9        because the governor does not have to wait for a 10        central dispatcher to send a signal, thus bypassing 11        communications system delays.12        (8) The shifting generation mix in PJM and MISO will 13    require optimum performance and an increased focus on the 14    need to retain reliability as certain existing generators 15    shut down operations and new, intermittent generators are 16    added. Additionally, increased power generation 17    consumption due to increased electric vehicles and 18    charging stations, along with increased electrification of 19    building heating needs, will undoubtedly place greater 20    demand on the power system.21        (9) The State has a responsibility to ensure that the 22    performance of State and regional power grids are safe, 23    reliable, and maintain the necessary capacity to meet the 24    power demands of residents of this State. Additionally, 25    the State has an obligation to do its part to ensure the 26    regional power grid is safe and reliable for its   SB1234- 5 -LRB104 04066 BDA 14090 b1    partnering states. As part of the regional power grid, 2    this State should be concerned that shuttered facilities 3    in this State will be replaced by higher cost, higher 4    emissions resources from other states. 5    Section 10. Illinois Regional Generation Reliability Task 6Force.7    (a) The Illinois Regional Generation Reliability Task 8Force is created. The Task Force shall monitor the reliability 9of the power grid of this State. The Task Force should consider 10the present and future needs of consumers of this State while 11simultaneously addressing any issues related to the 12performance and reliability of power generation and 13transmission and being mindful of the ultimate cost to 14consumers.15    (b) The duties and responsibilities of the Task Force 16include the following:17        (1) identifying and assessing policies, rules, and 18    laws that have the potential to significantly affect the 19    reliability of the State and regional power grids;20        (2) developing a set of standards and conditions that 21    will ensure optimal performance of the State and regional 22    power grids based on new and emerging technologies;23        (3) identifying opportunities to improve the power 24    supply mix in this State through existing and new laws to 25    ensure continued power reliability at affordable rates for   SB1234- 6 -LRB104 04066 BDA 14090 b1    consumers of this State;2        (4) compiling research and best practices from other 3    states and countries on how to deploy technology to 4    benefit the performance and reliability of the power grid;5        (5) developing tools to assess the impact of proposed 6    policies and evaluate their costs and benefits on 7    families, employers, the public, this State, and other 8    states as part of the State and regional power grids;9        (6) identifying data, reports, and relevant 10    information on the performance of the power grid to ensure 11    reliability and that pricing of power generation is in the 12    best interest of families, businesses, and communities in 13    this State;14        (7) providing its findings and recommendations for 15    policy changes and any revisions to policies, rules, and 16    laws that will facilitate the stability and reliability of 17    the State and regional power grids on an annual basis to 18    the General Assembly; and19        (8) developing and proposing legislative concepts to 20    ensure the future stability and reliability of the power 21    grid. 22    Section 15.
