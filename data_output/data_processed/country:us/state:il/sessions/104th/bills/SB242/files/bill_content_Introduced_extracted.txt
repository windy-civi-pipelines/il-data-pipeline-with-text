"New benefit increase", 9however, does not include any benefit increase resulting from 10the changes made to Article 1 or this Article by Public Act 1196-37, Public Act 100-23, Public Act 100-587, Public Act 12100-611, Public Act 101-10, Public Act 101-610, Public Act 13102-210, Public Act 102-856, Public Act 102-956, or this 14amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly or this 15amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly. 16    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code or 17any subsequent amendment to this Code, every new benefit 18increase is subject to this Section and shall be deemed to be 19granted only in conformance with and contingent upon 20compliance with the provisions of this Section. 21    (c) The Public Act enacting a new benefit increase must 22identify and provide for payment to the System of additional 23funding at least sufficient to fund the resulting annual 24increase in cost to the System as it accrues.25    Every new benefit increase is contingent upon the General 26Assembly providing the additional funding required under this   SB0242- 45 -LRB104 03145 RPS 13166 b1subsection. The Commission on Government Forecasting and 2Accountability shall analyze whether adequate additional 3funding has been provided for the new benefit increase and 4shall report its analysis to the Public Pension Division of 5the Department of Insurance.
