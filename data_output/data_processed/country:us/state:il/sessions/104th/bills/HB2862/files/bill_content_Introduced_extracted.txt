Amy Elik SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 220 ILCS 5/9-220  from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 9-220    Amends the Public Utilities Act. Provides that the Illinois Commerce Commission shall not authorize any charges based upon changes in the cost of fuel. Removes provisions concerning the Commission's ability to authorize the increase or decrease of a public utility's rates and charges based upon changes in the cost of fuel used in the generation or production of electric power, changes in the cost of purchased power, or changes in the cost of purchased gas through the application of fuel adjustment clauses or purchased gas adjustment clauses and based upon expenditures or revenues resulting from the purchase or sale of emission allowances through such fuel adjustment clauses as a cost of fuel. Removes provisions concerning a public utility's ability to, at any time during the mandatory transition period, file with the Commission proposed tariff sheets that establish the rate of the provided utility to be applied pursuant to the public utility's fuel adjustment clause at the average value for such rate during the preceding 24 months, provided that such average rate results in a credit to customers' bills, without making any revisions to the public utility's base rate tariffs. LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b  A BILL FOR HB2862LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Public Utilities Act is amended by changing 5Section 9-220 as follows: 6    (220 ILCS 5/9-220)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 9-220)7    Sec. 9-220. Rate changes based on changes in fuel costs. 8    (a) The Commission shall not authorize any charges based 9upon changes in the cost of fuel. Notwithstanding the 10provisions of Section 9-201, the Commission may authorize the 11increase or decrease of rates and charges based upon changes 12in the cost of fuel used in the generation or production of 13electric power, changes in the cost of purchased power, or 14changes in the cost of purchased gas through the application 15of fuel adjustment clauses or purchased gas adjustment 16clauses. The Commission may also authorize the increase or 17decrease of rates and charges based upon expenditures or 18revenues resulting from the purchase or sale of emission 19allowances created under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments 20of 1990, through such fuel adjustment clauses, as a cost of 21fuel. For the purposes of this paragraph, cost of fuel used in 22the generation or production of electric power shall include 23the amount of any fees paid by the utility for the   HB2862- 2 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1implementation and operation of a process for the 2desulfurization of the flue gas when burning high sulfur coal 3at any location within the State of Illinois irrespective of 4the attainment status designation of such location; but shall 5not include transportation costs of coal (i) except to the 6extent that for contracts entered into on and after the 7effective date of this amendatory Act of 1997, the cost of the 8coal, including transportation costs, constitutes the lowest 9cost for adequate and reliable fuel supply reasonably 10available to the public utility in comparison to the cost, 11including transportation costs, of other adequate and reliable 12sources of fuel supply reasonably available to the public 13utility, or (ii) except as otherwise provided in the next 3 14sentences of this paragraph. Such costs of fuel shall, when 15requested by a utility or at the conclusion of the utility's 16next general electric rate proceeding, whichever shall first 17occur, include transportation costs of coal purchased under 18existing coal purchase contracts. For purposes of this 19paragraph "existing coal purchase contracts" means contracts 20for the purchase of coal in effect on the effective date of 21this amendatory Act of 1991, as such contracts may thereafter 22be amended, but only to the extent that any such amendment does 23not increase the aggregate quantity of coal to be purchased 24under such contract. Nothing herein shall authorize an 25electric utility to recover through its fuel adjustment clause 26any amounts of transportation costs of coal that were included   HB2862- 3 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1in the revenue requirement used to set base rates in its most 2recent general rate proceeding. Cost shall be based upon 3uniformly applied accounting principles. Annually, the 4Commission shall initiate public hearings to determine whether 5the clauses reflect actual costs of fuel, gas, power, or coal 6transportation purchased to determine whether such purchases 7were prudent, and to reconcile any amounts collected with the 8actual costs of fuel, power, gas, or coal transportation 9prudently purchased. In each such proceeding, the burden of 10proof shall be upon the utility to establish the prudence of 11its cost of fuel, power, gas, or coal transportation purchases 12and costs. The Commission shall issue its final order in each 13such annual proceeding for an electric utility by December 31 14of the year immediately following the year to which the 15proceeding pertains, provided, that the Commission shall issue 16its final order with respect to such annual proceeding for the 17years 1996 and earlier by December 31, 1998.18    (b) (Blank). A public utility providing electric service, 19other than a public utility described in subsections (e) or 20(f) of this Section, may at any time during the mandatory 21transition period file with the Commission proposed tariff 22sheets that eliminate the public utility's fuel adjustment 23clause and adjust the public utility's base rate tariffs by 24the amount necessary for the base fuel component of the base 25rates to recover the public utility's average fuel and power 26supply costs per kilowatt-hour for the 2 most recent years for   HB2862- 4 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1which the Commission has issued final orders in annual 2proceedings pursuant to subsection (a), where the average fuel 3and power supply costs per kilowatt-hour shall be calculated 4as the sum of the public utility's prudent and allowable fuel 5and power supply costs as found by the Commission in the 2 6proceedings divided by the public utility's actual 7jurisdictional kilowatt-hour sales for those 2 years. 8Notwithstanding any contrary or inconsistent provisions in 9Section 9-201 of this Act, in subsection (a) of this Section or 10in any rules or regulations promulgated by the Commission 11pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section, the Commission 12shall review and shall by order approve, or approve as 13modified, the proposed tariff sheets within 60 days after the 14date of the public utility's filing. The Commission may modify 15the public utility's proposed tariff sheets only to the extent 16the Commission finds necessary to achieve conformance to the 17requirements of this subsection (b). During the 5 years 18following the date of the Commission's order, but in any event 19no earlier than January 1, 2007, a public utility whose fuel 20adjustment clause has been eliminated pursuant to this 21subsection shall not file proposed tariff sheets seeking, or 22otherwise petition the Commission for, reinstatement of a fuel 23adjustment clause.24    (c) (Blank). Notwithstanding any contrary or inconsistent 25provisions in Section 9-201 of this Act, in subsection (a) of 26this Section or in any rules or regulations promulgated by the   HB2862- 5 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1Commission pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section, a 2public utility providing electric service, other than a public 3utility described in subsection (e) or (f) of this Section, 4may at any time during the mandatory transition period file 5with the Commission proposed tariff sheets that establish the 6rate per kilowatt-hour to be applied pursuant to the public 7utility's fuel adjustment clause at the average value for such 8rate during the preceding 24 months, provided that such 9average rate results in a credit to customers' bills, without 10making any revisions to the public utility's base rate 11tariffs. The proposed tariff sheets shall establish the fuel 12adjustment rate for a specific time period of at least 3 years 13but not more than 5 years, provided that the terms and 14conditions for any reinstatement earlier than 5 years shall be 15set forth in the proposed tariff sheets and subject to 16modification or approval by the Commission. The Commission 17shall review and shall by order approve the proposed tariff 18sheets if it finds that the requirements of this subsection 19are met. The Commission shall not conduct the annual hearings 20specified in the last 3 sentences of subsection (a) of this 21Section for the utility for the period that the factor 22established pursuant to this subsection is in effect.23    (d) (Blank). A public utility providing electric service, 24or a public utility providing gas service may file with the 25Commission proposed tariff sheets that eliminate the public 26utility's fuel or purchased gas adjustment clause and adjust   HB2862- 6 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1the public utility's base rate tariffs to provide for recovery 2of power supply costs or gas supply costs that would have been 3recovered through such clause; provided, that the provisions 4of this subsection (d) shall not be available to a public 5utility described in subsections (e) or (f) of this Section to 6eliminate its fuel adjustment clause. Notwithstanding any 7contrary or inconsistent provisions in Section 9-201 of this 8Act, in subsection (a) of this Section, or in any rules or 9regulations promulgated by the Commission pursuant to 10subsection (g) of this Section, the Commission shall review 11and shall by order approve, or approve as modified in the 12Commission's order, the proposed tariff sheets within 240 days 13after the date of the public utility's filing. The 14Commission's order shall approve rates and charges that the 15Commission, based on information in the public utility's 16filing or on the record if a hearing is held by the Commission, 17finds will recover the reasonable, prudent and necessary 18jurisdictional power supply costs or gas supply costs incurred 19or to be incurred by the public utility during a 12 month 20period found by the Commission to be appropriate for these 21purposes, provided, that such period shall be either (i) a 12 22month historical period occurring during the 15 months ending 23on the date of the public utility's filing, or (ii) a 12 month 24future period ending no later than 15 months following the 25date of the public utility's filing. The public utility shall 26include with its tariff filing information showing both (1)   HB2862- 7 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1its actual jurisdictional power supply costs or gas supply 2costs for a 12 month historical period conforming to (i) above 3and (2) its projected jurisdictional power supply costs or gas 4supply costs for a future 12 month period conforming to (ii) 5above. If the Commission's order requires modifications in the 6tariff sheets filed by the public utility, the public utility 7shall have 7 days following the date of the order to notify the 8Commission whether the public utility will implement the 9modified tariffs or elect to continue its fuel or purchased 10gas adjustment clause in force as though no order had been 11entered. The Commission's order shall provide for any 12reconciliation of power supply costs or gas supply costs, as 13the case may be, and associated revenues through the date that 14the public utility's fuel or purchased gas adjustment clause 15is eliminated. During the 5 years following the date of the 16Commission's order, a public utility whose fuel or purchased 17gas adjustment clause has been eliminated pursuant to this 18subsection shall not file proposed tariff sheets seeking, or 19otherwise petition the Commission for, reinstatement or 20adoption of a fuel or purchased gas adjustment clause. Nothing 21in this subsection (d) shall be construed as limiting the 22Commission's authority to eliminate a public utility's fuel 23adjustment clause or purchased gas adjustment clause in 24accordance with any other applicable provisions of this Act.25    (e) (Blank). Notwithstanding any contrary or inconsistent 26provisions in Section 9-201 of this Act, in subsection (a) of   HB2862- 8 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1this Section, or in any rules promulgated by the Commission 2pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section, a public utility 3providing electric service to more than 1,000,000 customers in 4this State may, within the first 6 months after the effective 5date of this amendatory Act of 1997, file with the Commission 6proposed tariff sheets that eliminate, effective January 1, 71997, the public utility's fuel adjustment clause without 8adjusting its base rates, and such tariff sheets shall be 9effective upon filing. To the extent the application of the 10fuel adjustment clause had resulted in net charges to 11customers after January 1, 1997, the utility shall also file a 12tariff sheet that provides for a refund stated on a per 13kilowatt-hour basis of such charges over a period not to 14exceed 6 months; provided however, that such refund shall not 15include the proportional amounts of taxes paid under the Use 16Tax Act, Service Use Tax Act, Service Occupation Tax Act, and 17Retailers' Occupation Tax Act on fuel used in generation. The 18Commission shall issue an order within 45 days after the date 19of the public utility's filing approving or approving as 20modified such tariff sheet. If the fuel adjustment clause is 21eliminated pursuant to this subsection, the Commission shall 22not conduct the annual hearings specified in the last 3 23sentences of subsection (a) of this Section for the utility 24for any period after December 31, 1996 and prior to any 25reinstatement of such clause.

If the parties are in agreement on the terms of the 3contract, then the Illinois Power Agency shall approve the 4contract. If after mediation the parties have failed to come 5to agreement, then the Illinois Power Agency shall revise the 6draft contract as necessary to confirm that the contract 7contains only terms that are reasonable and equitable. The 8Illinois Power Agency may, in its discretion, retain an 9independent, qualified, and experienced expert to assist in 10its obligations under this subsection (h). The Illinois Power 11Agency shall adopt and make public policies detailing the 12processes for retaining a mediator and an expert under this 13subsection (h). Any mediator or expert retained under this 14subsection (h) shall be retained no later than 60 days after 15August 2, 2011.16    The Illinois Power Agency shall complete all of its 17responsibilities under this subsection (h) within 60 days 18after August 2, 2011. The clean coal SNG facility shall pay a 19reasonable fee as required by the Illinois Power Agency for 20its services under this subsection (h) and shall pay the 21mediator's and expert's reasonable fees, if any. A gas utility 22and its customers shall have no obligation to reimburse the 23clean coal SNG facility or the Illinois Power Agency of any 24such costs.25    Within 30 days after commercial production of SNG has 26begun, the Commission shall initiate a review to determine   HB2862- 16 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1whether the final capitalized plant cost of the clean coal SNG 2facility reflects actual incurred costs and whether the 3incurred costs were reasonable. In determining the actual 4incurred costs included in the final capitalized plant cost 5and the reasonableness of those costs, the Commission may in 6its discretion retain independent, qualified, and experienced 7experts to assist in its determination. The expert shall not 8own or control any direct or indirect interest in the clean 9coal SNG facility and shall have no contractual relationship 10with the clean coal SNG facility. If an expert is retained by 11the Commission, then the clean coal SNG facility shall pay the 12expert's reasonable fees. The fees shall not be passed on to a 13utility or its customers. The Commission shall adopt and make 14public a policy detailing the process for retaining experts 15under this subsection (h).16    Within 30 days after completion of its review, the 17Commission shall initiate a formal proceeding on the final 18capitalized plant cost of the clean coal SNG facility at which 19comments and testimony may be submitted by any interested 20parties and the public. If the Commission finds that the final 21capitalized plant cost includes costs that were not actually 22incurred or costs that were unreasonably incurred, then the 23Commission shall disallow the amount of non-incurred or 24unreasonable costs from the SNG price under contracts entered 25into under this subsection (h). If the Commission disallows 26any costs, then the Commission shall adjust the SNG price   HB2862- 17 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1using the price formula in the contract approved by the 2Illinois Power Agency under this subsection (h) to reflect the 3disallowed costs and shall enter an order specifying the 4revised price. In addition, the Commission's order shall 5direct the clean coal SNG facility to issue refunds of such 6sums as shall represent the difference between actual gross 7revenues and the gross revenue that would have been obtained 8based upon the same volume, from the price revised by the 9Commission. Any refund shall include interest calculated at a 10rate determined by the Commission and shall be returned 11according to procedures prescribed by the Commission.12    Nothing in this subsection (h) shall preclude any party 13affected by a decision of the Commission under this subsection 14(h) from seeking judicial review of the Commission's decision.15    (h-1) Any Illinois gas utility may enter into a sourcing 16agreement for up to 30 years of supply with the clean coal SNG 17brownfield facility if the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 18has commenced construction. Any gas utility that is providing 19service to more than 150,000 customers on July 13, 2011 (the 20effective date of Public Act 97-096) shall either elect to 21file biennial rate proceedings before the Commission in the 22years 2012, 2014, and 2016 or enter into a sourcing agreement 23or sourcing agreements with a clean coal SNG brownfield 24facility with an initial term of 30 years for either (i) a 25percentage of 43,500,000,000 cubic feet per year, such that 26the utilities entering into sourcing agreements with the clean   HB2862- 18 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1coal SNG brownfield facility purchase 100%, allocated by total 2therms sold to ultimate customers by each gas utility in 2008 3or (ii) such lesser amount as may be available from the clean 4coal SNG brownfield facility; provided that no utility shall 5be required to purchase more than 42% of the projected annual 6output of the clean coal SNG brownfield facility, with the 7remainder of such utility's obligation to be divided 8proportionately between the other utilities, and provided that 9the Illinois Power Agency shall further adjust the allocation 10only as required to take into account adverse consolidation, 11derivative, or lease impacts to the balance sheet or income 12statement of any gas utility.13    A gas utility electing to file biennial rate proceedings 14before the Commission must file a notice of its election with 15the Commission within 60 days after July 13, 2011 or its right 16to make the election is irrevocably waived. A gas utility 17electing to file biennial rate proceedings shall make such 18filings no later than August 1 of the years 2012, 2014, and 192016, consistent with all requirements of 83 Ill. Adm. Code 20255 and 285 as though the gas utility were filing for an 21increase in its rates, without regard to whether such filing 22would produce an increase, a decrease, or no change in the gas 23utility's rates, and notwithstanding any other provisions of 24this Act, the Commission shall fully review the gas utility's 25filing and shall issue its order in accordance with the 26provisions of Section 9-201 of this Act, regardless of whether   HB2862- 19 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1the Commission has approved a formula rate for the gas 2utility. 3    Within 15 days after July 13, 2011, the owner of the clean 4coal SNG brownfield facility shall submit to the Illinois 5Power Agency and each gas utility that is providing service to 6more than 150,000 customers on July 13, 2011 a copy of a draft 7sourcing agreement. Within 45 days after receipt of the draft 8sourcing agreement, each such gas utility shall provide the 9Illinois Power Agency and the owner of a clean coal SNG 10brownfield facility with its comments and recommended 11revisions to the draft sourcing agreement. Within 15 days 12after the receipt of the gas utility's comments and 13recommended revisions, the owner of the clean coal SNG 14brownfield facility shall submit its responsive comments and a 15further revised draft of the sourcing agreement to the 16Illinois Power Agency. The Illinois Power Agency shall review 17the draft sourcing agreement and comments.18    If the parties to the sourcing agreement do not agree on 19the terms therein, then the Illinois Power Agency shall retain 20an independent mediator to mediate the dispute between the 21parties. If the parties are in agreement on the terms of the 22sourcing agreement, the Illinois Power Agency shall approve 23the final draft sourcing agreement. If after mediation the 24parties have failed to come to agreement, then the Illinois 25Power Agency shall revise the draft sourcing agreement as 26necessary to confirm that the final draft sourcing agreement   HB2862- 20 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1contains only terms that are reasonable and equitable. The 2Illinois Power Agency shall adopt and make public a policy 3detailing the process for retaining a mediator under this 4subsection (h-1). Any mediator retained to assist with 5mediating disputes between the parties regarding the sourcing 6agreement shall be retained no later than 60 days after July 713, 2011.8    Upon approval of a final draft agreement, the Illinois 9Power Agency shall submit the final draft agreement to the 10Capital Development Board and the Commission no later than 90 11days after July 13, 2011. The gas utility and the clean coal 12SNG brownfield facility shall pay a reasonable fee as required 13by the Illinois Power Agency for its services under this 14subsection (h-1) and shall pay the mediator's reasonable fees, 15if any. The Illinois Power Agency shall adopt and make public a 16policy detailing the process for retaining a mediator under 17this Section. 18    The sourcing agreement between a gas utility and the clean 19coal SNG brownfield facility shall contain the following 20provisions:21        (1) Any and all coal used in the gasification process 22    must be coal that has high volatile bituminous rank and 23    greater than 1.7 pounds of sulfur per million Btu content.24        (2) Coal and petroleum coke are feedstocks for the 25    gasification process, with coal comprising at least 50% of 26    the total feedstock over the term of the sourcing   HB2862- 21 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    agreement unless the facility reasonably determines that 2    it is necessary to use additional petroleum coke to 3    deliver net consumer savings, in which case the facility 4    shall use coal for at least 35% of the total feedstock over 5    the term of any sourcing agreement and with the feedstocks 6    to be procured in accordance with requirements of Section 7    1-78 of the Illinois Power Agency Act.8        (3) The sourcing agreement has an initial term that 9    once entered into terminates no more than 30 years after 10    the commencement of the commercial production of SNG at 11    the clean coal SNG brownfield facility.12        (4) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility guarantees 13    a minimum of $100,000,000 in consumer savings to customers 14    of the utilities that have entered into sourcing 15    agreements with the clean coal SNG brownfield facility, 16    calculated in real 2010 dollars at the conclusion of the 17    term of the sourcing agreement by comparing the delivered 18    SNG price to the Chicago City-gate price on a weighted 19    daily basis for each day over the entire term of the 20    sourcing agreement, to be provided in accordance with 21    subsection (h-2) of this Section.22        (5) Prior to the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 23    issuing a notice to proceed to construction, the clean 24    coal SNG brownfield facility shall establish a consumer 25    protection reserve account for the benefit of the 26    customers of the utilities that have entered into sourcing   HB2862- 22 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    agreements with the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 2    pursuant to this subsection (h-1), with cash principal in 3    the amount of $150,000,000. This cash principal shall only 4    be recoverable through the consumer protection reserve 5    account and not as a cost to be recovered in the delivered 6    SNG price pursuant to subsection (h-3) of this Section. 7    The consumer protection reserve account shall be 8    maintained and administered by an independent trustee that 9    is mutually agreed upon by the clean coal SNG brownfield 10    facility, the utilities, and the Commission in an 11    interest-bearing account in accordance with subsection 12    (h-2) of this Section.13        "Consumer protection reserve account principal maximum 14    amount" shall mean the maximum amount of principal to be 15    maintained in the consumer protection reserve account. 16    During the first 2 years of operation of the facility, 17    there shall be no consumer protection reserve account 18    maximum amount. After the first 2 years of operation of 19    the facility, the consumer protection reserve account 20    maximum amount shall be $150,000,000. After 5 years of 21    operation, and every 5 years thereafter, the trustee shall 22    calculate the 5-year average balance of the consumer 23    protection reserve account. If the trustee determines that 24    during the prior 5 years the consumer protection reserve 25    account has had an average account balance of less than 26    $75,000,000, then the consumer protection reserve account   HB2862- 23 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    principal maximum amount shall be increased by $5,000,000. 2    If the trustee determines that during the prior 5 years 3    the consumer protection reserve account has had an average 4    account balance of more than $75,000,000, then the 5    consumer protection reserve account principal maximum 6    amount shall be decreased by $5,000,000. 7        (6) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall 8    identify and sell economically viable by-products produced 9    by the facility.10        (7) Fifty percent of all additional net revenue, 11    defined as miscellaneous net revenue from products 12    produced by the facility and delivered during the month 13    after cost allowance for costs associated with additional 14    net revenue that are not otherwise recoverable pursuant to 15    subsection (h-3) of this Section, including net revenue 16    from sales of substitute natural gas derived from the 17    facility above the nameplate capacity of the facility and 18    other by-products produced by the facility, shall be 19    credited to the consumer protection reserve account 20    pursuant to subsection (h-2) of this Section.21        (8) The delivered SNG price per million btu to be paid 22    monthly by the utility to the clean coal SNG brownfield 23    facility, which shall be based only upon the following: 24    (A) a capital recovery charge, operations and maintenance 25    costs, and sequestration costs, only to the extent 26    approved by the Commission pursuant to paragraphs (1),   HB2862- 24 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    (2), and (3) of subsection (h-3) of this Section; (B) the 2    actual delivered and processed fuel costs pursuant to 3    paragraph (4) of subsection (h-3) of this Section; (C) 4    actual costs of SNG transportation pursuant to paragraph 5    (6) of subsection (h-3) of this Section; (D) certain taxes 6    and fees imposed by the federal government, the State, or 7    any unit of local government as provided in paragraph (6) 8    of subsection (h-3) of this Section; and (E) the credit, 9    if any, from the consumer protection reserve account 10    pursuant to subsection (h-2) of this Section. The 11    delivered SNG price per million Btu shall proportionately 12    reflect these elements over the term of the sourcing 13    agreement.14        (9) A formula to translate the recoverable costs and 15    charges under subsection (h-3) of this Section into the 16    delivered SNG price per million btu.17        (10) Title to the SNG shall pass at a mutually 18    agreeable point in Illinois, and may provide that, rather 19    than the utility taking title to the SNG, a mutually 20    agreed upon third-party gas marketer pursuant to a 21    contract approved by the Illinois Power Agency or its 22    designee may take title to the SNG pursuant to an 23    agreement between the utility, the owner of the clean coal 24    SNG brownfield facility, and the third-party gas marketer. 25        (11) A utility may exit the sourcing agreement without 26    penalty if the clean coal SNG brownfield facility does not   HB2862- 25 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    commence construction by July 1, 2015.2        (12) A utility is responsible to pay only the 3    Commission determined unit price cost of SNG that is 4    purchased by the utility. Nothing in the sourcing 5    agreement will obligate a utility to invest capital in a 6    clean coal SNG brownfield facility.7        (13) The quality of SNG must, at a minimum, be 8    equivalent to the quality required for interstate pipeline 9    gas before a utility is required to accept and pay for SNG 10    gas.11        (14) Nothing in the sourcing agreement will require a 12    utility to construct any facilities to accept delivery of 13    SNG. Provided, however, if a utility is required by law or 14    otherwise elects to connect the clean coal SNG brownfield 15    facility to an interstate pipeline, then the utility shall 16    be entitled to recover pursuant to its tariffs all just 17    and reasonable costs that are prudently incurred. Any 18    costs incurred by the utility to receive, deliver, manage, 19    or otherwise accommodate purchases under the SNG sourcing 20    agreement will be fully recoverable through a utility's 21    purchased gas adjustment clause rider mechanism in 22    conjunction with a SNG brownfield facility rider 23    mechanism. The SNG brownfield facility rider mechanism (A) 24    shall be applicable to all customers who receive 25    transportation service from the utility, (B) shall be 26    designed to have an equal percent impact on the   HB2862- 26 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    transportation services rates of each class of the 2    utility's customers, and (C) shall accurately reflect the 3    net consumer savings, if any, and above-market costs, if 4    any, associated with the utility receiving, delivering, 5    managing, or otherwise accommodating purchases under the 6    SNG sourcing agreement. 7        (15) Remedies for the clean coal SNG brownfield 8    facility's failure to deliver a designated amount for a 9    designated period.10        (16) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall make 11    a good faith effort to ensure that an amount equal to not 12    less than 15% of the value of its prime construction 13    contract for the facility shall be established as a goal 14    to be awarded to minority-owned businesses, women-owned 15    businesses, and businesses owned by a person with a 16    disability; provided that at least 75% of the amount of 17    such total goal shall be for minority-owned businesses. 18    "Minority-owned business", "women-owned business", and 19    "business owned by a person with a disability" shall have 20    the meanings ascribed to them in Section 2 of the Business 21    Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and Persons with 22    Disabilities Act. 23        (17) Prior to the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 24    issuing a notice to proceed to construction, the clean 25    coal SNG brownfield facility shall file with the 26    Commission a certificate from an independent engineer that   HB2862- 27 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    the clean coal SNG brownfield facility has (A) obtained 2    all applicable State and federal environmental permits 3    required for construction; (B) obtained approval from the 4    Commission of a carbon capture and sequestration plan; and 5    (C) obtained all necessary permits required for 6    construction for the transportation and sequestration of 7    carbon dioxide as set forth in the Commission-approved 8    carbon capture and sequestration plan. 9    (h-2) Consumer protection reserve account. The clean coal 10SNG brownfield facility shall guarantee a minimum of 11$100,000,000 in consumer savings to customers of the utilities 12that have entered into sourcing agreements with the clean coal 13SNG brownfield facility, calculated in real 2010 dollars at 14the conclusion of the term of the sourcing agreement by 15comparing the delivered SNG price to the Chicago City-gate 16price on a weighted daily basis for each day over the entire 17term of the sourcing agreement. Prior to the clean coal SNG 18brownfield facility issuing a notice to proceed to 19construction, the clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall 20establish a consumer protection reserve account for the 21benefit of the retail customers of the utilities that have 22entered into sourcing agreements with the clean coal SNG 23brownfield facility pursuant to subsection (h-1), with cash 24principal in the amount of $150,000,000. Such cash principal 25shall only be recovered through the consumer protection 26reserve account and not as a cost to be recovered in the   HB2862- 28 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1delivered SNG price pursuant to subsection (h-3) of this 2Section. The consumer protection reserve account shall be 3maintained and administered by an independent trustee that is 4mutually agreed upon by the clean coal SNG brownfield 5facility, the utilities, and the Commission in an 6interest-bearing account in accordance with the following:7        (1) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility monthly 8    shall calculate (A) the difference between the monthly 9    delivered SNG price and the Chicago City-gate price, by 10    comparing the delivered SNG price, which shall include the 11    cost of transportation to the delivery point, if any, to 12    the Chicago City-gate price on a weighted daily basis for 13    each day of the prior month based upon a mutually agreed 14    upon published index and (B) the overage amount, if any, 15    by calculating the annualized incremental additional cost, 16    if any, of the delivered SNG in excess of 2.015% of the 17    average annual inflation-adjusted amounts paid by all gas 18    distribution customers in connection with natural gas 19    service during the 5 years ending May 31, 2010.20        (2) During the first 2 years of operation of the 21    facility:22            (A) to the extent there is an overage amount, the 23        consumer protection reserve account shall be used to 24        provide a credit to reduce the SNG price by an amount 25        equal to the overage amount; and26            (B) to the extent the monthly delivered SNG price   HB2862- 29 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        is less than or equal to the Chicago City-gate price, 2        the utility shall credit the difference between the 3        monthly delivered SNG price and the monthly Chicago 4        City-gate price, if any, to the consumer protection 5        reserve account. Such credit issued pursuant to this 6        paragraph (B) shall be deemed prudent and reasonable 7        and not subject to a Commission prudence review;8        (3) After 2 years of operation of the facility, and 9    monthly, on an on-going basis, thereafter:10            (A) to the extent that the monthly delivered SNG 11        price is less than or equal to the Chicago City-gate 12        price, calculated using the weighted average of the 13        daily Chicago City-gate price on a daily basis over 14        the entire month, the utility shall credit the 15        difference, if any, to the consumer protection reserve 16        account. Such credit issued pursuant to this 17        subparagraph (A) shall be deemed prudent and 18        reasonable and not subject to a Commission prudence 19        review;20            (B) any amounts in the consumer protection reserve 21        account in excess of the consumer protection reserve 22        account principal maximum amount shall be distributed 23        as follows: (i) if retail customers have not realized 24        net consumer savings, calculated by comparing the 25        delivered SNG price to the weighted average of the 26        daily Chicago City-gate price on a daily basis over   HB2862- 30 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        the entire term of the sourcing agreement to date, 2        then 50% of any amounts in the consumer protection 3        reserve account in excess of the consumer protection 4        reserve account principal maximum shall be distributed 5        to the clean coal SNG brownfield facility, with the 6        remaining 50% of any such additional amounts being 7        credited to retail customers, and (ii) if retail 8        customers have realized net consumer savings, then 9        100% of any amounts in the consumer protection reserve 10        account in excess of the consumer protection reserve 11        account principal maximum shall be distributed to the 12        clean coal SNG brownfield facility; provided, however, 13        that under no circumstances shall the total cumulative 14        amount distributed to the clean coal SNG brownfield 15        facility under this subparagraph (B) exceed 16        $150,000,000;17            (C) to the extent there is an overage amount, 18        after distributing the amounts pursuant to 19        subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (3), if any, the 20        consumer protection reserve account shall be used to 21        provide a credit to reduce the SNG price by an amount 22        equal to the overage amount;23            (D) if retail customers have realized net consumer 24        savings, calculated by comparing the delivered SNG 25        price to the weighted average of the daily Chicago 26        City-gate price on a daily basis over the entire term   HB2862- 31 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        of the sourcing agreement to date, then after 2        distributing the amounts pursuant to subparagraphs (B) 3        and (C) of this paragraph (3), 50% of any additional 4        amounts in the consumer protection reserve account in 5        excess of the consumer protection reserve account 6        principal maximum shall be distributed to the clean 7        coal SNG brownfield facility, with the remaining 50% 8        of any such additional amounts being credited to 9        retail customers; provided, however, that if retail 10        customers have not realized such net consumer savings, 11        no such distribution shall be made to the clean coal 12        SNG brownfield facility, and 100% of such additional 13        amounts shall be credited to the retail customers to 14        the extent the consumer protection reserve account 15        exceeds the consumer protection reserve account 16        principal maximum amount.17        (4) Fifty percent of all additional net revenue, 18    defined as miscellaneous net revenue after cost allowance 19    for costs associated with additional net revenue that are 20    not otherwise recoverable pursuant to subsection (h-3) of 21    this Section, including net revenue from sales of 22    substitute natural gas derived from the facility above the 23    nameplate capacity of the facility and other by-products 24    produced by the facility, shall be credited to the 25    consumer protection reserve account.26        (5) At the conclusion of the term of the sourcing   HB2862- 32 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    agreement, to the extent retail customers have not saved 2    the minimum of $100,000,000 in consumer savings as 3    guaranteed in this subsection (h-2), amounts in the 4    consumer protection reserve account shall be credited to 5    retail customers to the extent the retail customers have 6    saved the minimum of $100,000,000; 50% of any additional 7    amounts in the consumer protection reserve account shall 8    be distributed to the company, and the remaining 50% shall 9    be distributed to retail customers.10        (6) If, at the conclusion of the term of the sourcing 11    agreement, the customers have not saved the minimum 12    $100,000,000 in savings as guaranteed in this subsection 13    (h-2) and the consumer protection reserve account has been 14    depleted, then the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 15    shall be liable for any remaining amount owed to the 16    retail customers to the extent that the customers are 17    provided with the $100,000,000 in savings as guaranteed in 18    this subsection (h-2). The retail customers shall have 19    first priority in recovering that debt above any 20    creditors, except the original senior secured lender to 21    the extent that the original senior secured lender has any 22    senior secured debt outstanding, including any clean coal 23    SNG brownfield facility parent companies or affiliates.24        (7) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility, the 25    utilities, and the trustee shall work together to take 26    commercially reasonable steps to minimize the tax impact   HB2862- 33 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    of these transactions, while preserving the consumer 2    benefits.3        (8) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall each 4    month, starting in the facility's first year of commercial 5    operation, file with the Commission, in such form as the 6    Commission shall require, a report as to the consumer 7    protection reserve account.

The Capital Development Board shall make 13        its final determination of the range of capital costs 14        confidentially and shall submit that range to the 15        Commission in a confidential filing within 120 days 16        after July 13, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 17        97-096). The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall 18        submit to the Commission its estimate of the capital 19        costs to be recovered under the sourcing agreement. 20        Only after the clean coal SNG brownfield facility has 21        submitted this estimate shall the Commission publicly 22        announce the range of capital costs submitted by the 23        Capital Development Board.24            In the event that the estimate submitted by the 25        clean coal SNG brownfield facility is within or below 26        the range submitted by the Capital Development Board,   HB2862- 39 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        the clean coal SNG brownfield facility's estimate 2        shall be approved by the Commission as the amount of 3        capital costs to be recovered under the sourcing 4        agreement. In the event that the estimate submitted by 5        the clean coal SNG brownfield facility is above the 6        range submitted by the Capital Development Board, the 7        amount of capital costs at the lowest end of the range 8        submitted by the Capital Development Board shall be 9        approved by the Commission as the amount of capital 10        costs to be recovered under the sourcing agreement. 11        Within 15 days after the Capital Development Board has 12        submitted its range and the clean coal SNG brownfield 13        facility has submitted its estimate, the Commission 14        shall approve the capital costs for the clean coal SNG 15        brownfield facility.16            The Capital Development Board shall monitor the 17        construction of the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 18        for the full duration of construction to assess 19        potential cost overruns. The Capital Development 20        Board, in its discretion, may retain an expert to 21        facilitate such monitoring. The clean coal SNG 22        brownfield facility shall pay a reasonable fee as 23        required by the Capital Development Board for the 24        Capital Development Board's services under this 25        subsection (h-3) to be deposited into the Capital 26        Development Board Revolving Fund, and such fee shall   HB2862- 40 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        not be passed through to a utility or its customers. If 2        an expert is retained by the Capital Development Board 3        for monitoring of construction, then the clean coal 4        SNG brownfield facility must pay for the expert's 5        reasonable fees and such costs shall not be passed 6        through to a utility or its customers.7            (B) Rate of Return. No later than 30 days after the 8        date on which the Illinois Power Agency submits a 9        final draft sourcing agreement, the Commission shall 10        hold a public hearing to determine the rate of return 11        to be recovered under the sourcing agreement. Rate of 12        return shall be comprised of the clean coal SNG 13        brownfield facility's actual cost of debt, including 14        mortgage-style amortization, and a reasonable return 15        on equity. The Commission shall post notice of the 16        hearing on its website no later than 10 days prior to 17        the date of the hearing. The Commission shall provide 18        the public and all interested parties, including the 19        gas utilities, the Attorney General, and the Illinois 20        Power Agency, an opportunity to be heard.21            In determining the return on equity, the 22        Commission shall select a commercially reasonable 23        return on equity taking into account the return on 24        equity being received by developers of similar 25        facilities in or outside of Illinois, the need to 26        balance an incentive for clean-coal technology with   HB2862- 41 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        the need to protect ratepayers from high gas prices, 2        the risks being borne by the clean coal SNG brownfield 3        facility in the final draft sourcing agreement, and 4        any other information that the Commission may deem 5        relevant. The Commission may establish a return on 6        equity that varies with the amount of savings, if any, 7        to customers during the term of the sourcing 8        agreement, comparing the delivered SNG price to a 9        daily weighted average price of natural gas, based 10        upon an index. The Illinois Power Agency shall 11        recommend a return on equity to the Commission using 12        the same criteria. Within 60 days after receiving the 13        final draft sourcing agreement from the Illinois Power 14        Agency, the Commission shall approve the rate of 15        return for the clean coal brownfield facility. Within 16        30 days after obtaining debt financing for the clean 17        coal SNG brownfield facility, the clean coal SNG 18        brownfield facility shall file a notice with the 19        Commission identifying the actual cost of debt.20        (2) Operations and maintenance costs approved by the 21    Commission shall be recoverable by the clean coal SNG 22    brownfield facility under the sourcing agreement. The 23    operations and maintenance costs mean costs that have been 24    incurred for the administration, supervision, operation, 25    maintenance, preservation, and protection of the clean 26    coal SNG brownfield facility's physical plant.  HB2862- 42 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        The Capital Development Board shall calculate a range 2    of operations and maintenance costs that it believes would 3    be reasonable for the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 4    to recover under the sourcing agreement, incorporating an 5    inflation index or combination of inflation indices to 6    most accurately reflect the actual costs of operating the 7    clean coal SNG brownfield facility. In making this 8    determination, the Capital Development Board shall review 9    the facility cost report, if any, of the clean coal SNG 10    brownfield facility, adjusting the results for inflation 11    based on the change in the Annual Consumer Price Index for 12    All Urban Consumers for the Midwest Region as published in 13    April by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of 14    Labor Statistics, the final draft of the sourcing 15    agreement, and the rate of return approved by the 16    Commission. In addition, the Capital Development Board may 17    consult as much as it deems necessary with the clean coal 18    SNG brownfield facility and conduct whatever research and 19    investigation it deems necessary. As set forth in 20    subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of this subsection 21    (h-3), the Capital Development Board shall retain an 22    independent engineering expert to assist in determining 23    both the range of operations and maintenance costs that it 24    believes would be reasonable for the clean coal SNG 25    brownfield facility to recover under the sourcing 26    agreement. The clean coal SNG brownfield facility and the   HB2862- 43 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    Illinois Power Agency shall cooperate with the Capital 2    Development Board in any investigation it deems necessary. 3    The Capital Development Board shall make its final 4    determination of the range of operations and maintenance 5    costs confidentially and shall submit that range to the 6    Commission in a confidential filing within 120 days after 7    July 13, 2011.8        The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall submit to 9    the Commission its estimate of the operations and 10    maintenance costs to be recovered under the sourcing 11    agreement. Only after the clean coal SNG brownfield 12    facility has submitted this estimate shall the Commission 13    publicly announce the range of operations and maintenance 14    costs submitted by the Capital Development Board. In the 15    event that the estimate submitted by the clean coal SNG 16    brownfield facility is within or below the range submitted 17    by the Capital Development Board, the clean coal SNG 18    brownfield facility's estimate shall be approved by the 19    Commission as the amount of operations and maintenance 20    costs to be recovered under the sourcing agreement. In the 21    event that the estimate submitted by the clean coal SNG 22    brownfield facility is above the range submitted by the 23    Capital Development Board, the amount of operations and 24    maintenance costs at the lowest end of the range submitted 25    by the Capital Development Board shall be approved by the 26    Commission as the amount of operations and maintenance   HB2862- 44 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    costs to be recovered under the sourcing agreement. Within 2    15 days after the Capital Development Board has submitted 3    its range and the clean coal SNG brownfield facility has 4    submitted its estimate, the Commission shall approve the 5    operations and maintenance costs for the clean coal SNG 6    brownfield facility.7        The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall pay for 8    the independent engineering expert's reasonable fees and 9    such costs shall not be passed through to a utility or its 10    customers. The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall 11    pay a reasonable fee as required by the Capital 12    Development Board for the Capital Development Board's 13    services under this subsection (h-3) to be deposited into 14    the Capital Development Board Revolving Fund, and such fee 15    shall not be passed through to a utility or its customers.16        (3) Sequestration costs approved by the Commission 17    shall be recoverable by the clean coal SNG brownfield 18    facility. "Sequestration costs" means costs to be incurred 19    by the clean coal SNG brownfield facility in accordance 20    with its Commission-approved carbon capture and 21    sequestration plan to:22            (A) capture carbon dioxide;23            (B) build, operate, and maintain a sequestration 24        site in which carbon dioxide may be injected;25            (C) build, operate, and maintain a carbon dioxide 26        pipeline; and  HB2862- 45 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1            (D) transport the carbon dioxide to the 2        sequestration site or a pipeline.3        The Commission shall assess the prudency of the 4    sequestration costs for the clean coal SNG brownfield 5    facility before construction commences at the 6    sequestration site or pipeline. Any revenues the clean 7    coal SNG brownfield facility receives as a result of the 8    capture, transportation, or sequestration of carbon 9    dioxide shall be first credited against all sequestration 10    costs, with the positive balance, if any, treated as 11    additional net revenue.12        The Commission may, in its discretion, retain an 13    expert to assist in its review of sequestration costs. The 14    clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall pay for the 15    expert's reasonable fees if an expert is retained by the 16    Commission, and such costs shall not be passed through to 17    a utility or its customers. Once made, the Commission's 18    determination of the amount of recoverable sequestration 19    costs shall not be increased unless the clean coal SNG 20    brownfield facility can show by clear and convincing 21    evidence that (i) the costs were not reasonably 22    foreseeable; (ii) the costs were due to circumstances 23    beyond the clean coal SNG brownfield facility's control; 24    and (iii) the clean coal SNG brownfield facility took all 25    reasonable steps to mitigate the costs. If the Commission 26    determines that sequestration costs may be increased, the   HB2862- 46 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    Commission shall provide for notice and a public hearing 2    for approval of the increased sequestration costs.3        (4) Actual delivered and processed fuel costs shall be 4    set by the Illinois Power Agency through a SNG feedstock 5    procurement, pursuant to Sections 1-20, 1-77, and 1-78 of 6    the Illinois Power Agency Act, to be performed at least 7    every 5 years and purchased by the clean coal SNG 8    brownfield facility pursuant to feedstock procurement 9    contracts developed by the Illinois Power Agency, with 10    coal comprising at least 50% of the total feedstock over 11    the term of the sourcing agreement and petroleum coke 12    comprising the remainder of the SNG feedstock. If the 13    Commission fails to approve a feedstock procurement plan 14    or fails to approve the results of a feedstock procurement 15    event, then the fuel shall be purchased by the company 16    month-by-month on the spot market and those actual 17    delivered and processed fuel costs shall be recoverable 18    under the sourcing agreement. If a supplier defaults under 19    the terms of a procurement contract, then the Illinois 20    Power Agency shall immediately initiate a feedstock 21    procurement process to obtain a replacement supply, and, 22    prior to the conclusion of that process, fuel shall be 23    purchased by the company month-by-month on the spot market 24    and those actual delivered and processed fuel costs shall 25    be recoverable under the sourcing agreement.26        (5) Taxes and fees imposed by the federal government,   HB2862- 47 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    the State, or any unit of local government applicable to 2    the clean coal SNG brownfield facility, excluding income 3    tax, shall be recoverable by the clean coal SNG brownfield 4    facility under the sourcing agreement to the extent such 5    taxes and fees were not applicable to the facility on July 6    13, 2011.7        (6) The actual transportation costs, in accordance 8    with the applicable utility's tariffs, and third-party 9    marketer costs incurred by the company, if any, associated 10    with transporting the SNG from the clean coal SNG 11    brownfield facility to the Chicago City-gate to sell such 12    SNG into the natural gas markets shall be recoverable 13    under the sourcing agreement.14        (7) Unless otherwise provided, within 30 days after a 15    decision of the Commission on recoverable costs under this 16    Section, any interested party to the Commission's decision 17    may apply for a rehearing with respect to the decision. 18    The Commission shall receive and consider the application 19    for rehearing and shall grant or deny the application in 20    whole or in part within 20 days after the date of the 21    receipt of the application by the Commission. If no 22    rehearing is applied for within the required 30 days or an 23    application for rehearing is denied, then the Commission 24    decision shall be final. If an application for rehearing 25    is granted, then the Commission shall hold a rehearing 26    within 30 days after granting the application. The   HB2862- 48 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    decision of the Commission upon rehearing shall be final.2        Any person affected by a decision of the Commission 3    under this subsection (h-3) may have the decision reviewed 4    only under and in accordance with the Administrative 5    Review Law. Unless otherwise provided, the provisions of 6    the Administrative Review Law, all amendments and 7    modifications to that Law, and the rules adopted pursuant 8    to that Law shall apply to and govern all proceedings for 9    the judicial review of final administrative decisions of 10    the Commission under this subsection (h-3). The term 11    "administrative decision" is defined as in Section 3-101 12    of the Code of Civil Procedure.13        (8) The Capital Development Board shall adopt and make 14    public a policy detailing the process for retaining 15    experts under this Section. Any experts retained to assist 16    with calculating the range of capital costs or operations 17    and maintenance costs shall be retained no later than 45 18    days after July 13, 2011. 19    (h-4) No later than 90 days after the Illinois Power 20Agency submits the final draft sourcing agreement pursuant to 21subsection (h-1), the Commission shall approve a sourcing 22agreement containing (i) the capital costs, rate of return, 23and operations and maintenance costs established pursuant to 24subsection (h-3) and (ii) all other terms and conditions, 25rights, provisions, exceptions, and limitations contained in 26the final draft sourcing agreement; provided, however, the   HB2862- 49 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1Commission shall correct typographical and scrivener's errors 2and modify the contract only as necessary to provide that the 3gas utility does not have the right to terminate the sourcing 4agreement due to any future events that may occur other than 5the clean coal SNG brownfield facility's failure to timely 6meet milestones, uncured default, extended force majeure, or 7abandonment. Once the sourcing agreement is approved, then the 8gas utility subject to that sourcing agreement shall have 45 9days after the date of the Commission's approval to enter into 10the sourcing agreement.11    (h-5) Sequestration enforcement.12        (A) All contracts entered into under subsection (h) of 13    this Section and all sourcing agreements under subsection 14    (h-1) of this Section, regardless of duration, shall 15    require the owner of any facility supplying SNG under the 16    contract or sourcing agreement to provide certified 17    documentation to the Commission each year, starting in the 18    facility's first year of commercial operation, accurately 19    reporting the quantity of carbon dioxide emissions from 20    the facility that have been captured and sequestered and 21    reporting any quantities of carbon dioxide released from 22    the site or sites at which carbon dioxide emissions were 23    sequestered in prior years, based on continuous monitoring 24    of those sites.25        (B) If, in any year, the owner of the clean coal SNG 26    facility fails to demonstrate that the SNG facility   HB2862- 50 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    captured and sequestered at least 90% of the total carbon 2    dioxide emissions that the facility would otherwise emit 3    or that sequestration of emissions from prior years has 4    failed, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide into 5    the atmosphere, then the owner of the clean coal SNG 6    facility must pay a penalty of $20 per ton of excess carbon 7    dioxide emissions not to exceed $40,000,000, in any given 8    year which shall be deposited into the Energy Efficiency 9    Trust Fund and distributed pursuant to subsection (b) of 10    Section 6-6 of the Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, 11    and Coal Resources Development Law of 1997. On or before 12    the 5-year anniversary of the execution of the contract 13    and every 5 years thereafter, an expert hired by the owner 14    of the facility with the approval of the Attorney General 15    shall conduct an analysis to determine the cost of 16    sequestration of at least 90% of the total carbon dioxide 17    emissions the plant would otherwise emit. If the analysis 18    shows that the actual annual cost is greater than the 19    penalty, then the penalty shall be increased to equal the 20    actual cost. Provided, however, to the extent that the 21    owner of the facility described in subsection (h) of this 22    Section can demonstrate that the failure was as a result 23    of acts of God (including fire, flood, earthquake, 24    tornado, lightning, hurricane, or other natural disaster); 25    any amendment, modification, or abrogation of any 26    applicable law or regulation that would prevent   HB2862- 51 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    performance; war; invasion; act of foreign enemies; 2    hostilities (regardless of whether war is declared); civil 3    war; rebellion; revolution; insurrection; military or 4    usurped power or confiscation; terrorist activities; civil 5    disturbance; riots; nationalization; sabotage; blockage; 6    or embargo, the owner of the facility described in 7    subsection (h) of this Section shall not be subject to a 8    penalty if and only if (i) it promptly provides notice of 9    its failure to the Commission; (ii) as soon as practicable 10    and consistent with any order or direction from the 11    Commission, it submits to the Commission proposed 12    modifications to its carbon capture and sequestration 13    plan; and (iii) it carries out its proposed modifications 14    in the manner and time directed by the Commission.15        If the Commission finds that the facility has not 16    satisfied each of these requirements, then the facility 17    shall be subject to the penalty. If the owner of the clean 18    coal SNG facility captured and sequestered more than 90% 19    of the total carbon dioxide emissions that the facility 20    would otherwise emit, then the owner of the facility may 21    credit such additional amounts to reduce the amount of any 22    future penalty to be paid. The penalty resulting from the 23    failure to capture and sequester at least the minimum 24    amount of carbon dioxide shall not be passed on to a 25    utility or its customers.26        If the clean coal SNG facility fails to meet the   HB2862- 52 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    requirements specified in this subsection (h-5), then the 2    Attorney General, on behalf of the People of the State of 3    Illinois, shall bring an action to enforce the obligations 4    related to the facility set forth in this subsection 5    (h-5), including any penalty payments owed, but not 6    including the physical obligation to capture and sequester 7    at least 90% of the total carbon dioxide emissions that 8    the facility would otherwise emit. Such action may be 9    filed in any circuit court in Illinois. By entering into a 10    contract pursuant to subsection (h) of this Section, the 11    clean coal SNG facility agrees to waive any objections to 12    venue or to the jurisdiction of the court with regard to 13    the Attorney General's action under this subsection (h-5).14        Compliance with the sequestration requirements and any 15    penalty requirements specified in this subsection (h-5) 16    for the clean coal SNG facility shall be assessed annually 17    by the Commission, which may in its discretion retain an 18    expert to facilitate its assessment. If any expert is 19    retained by the Commission, then the clean coal SNG 20    facility shall pay for the expert's reasonable fees, and 21    such costs shall not be passed through to the utility or 22    its customers.23        In addition, carbon dioxide emission credits received 24    by the clean coal SNG facility in connection with 25    sequestration of carbon dioxide from the facility must be 26    sold in a timely fashion with any revenue, less applicable   HB2862- 53 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    fees and expenses and any expenses required to be paid by 2    facility for carbon dioxide transportation or 3    sequestration, deposited into the reconciliation account 4    within 30 days after receipt of such funds by the owner of 5    the clean coal SNG facility.6        The clean coal SNG facility is prohibited from 7    transporting or sequestering carbon dioxide unless the 8    owner of the carbon dioxide pipeline that transfers the 9    carbon dioxide from the facility and the owner of the 10    sequestration site where the carbon dioxide captured by 11    the facility is stored has acquired all applicable permits 12    under applicable State and federal laws, statutes, rules, 13    or regulations prior to the transfer or sequestration of 14    carbon dioxide. The responsibility for compliance with the 15    sequestration requirements specified in this subsection 16    (h-5) for the clean coal SNG facility shall reside solely 17    with the clean coal SNG facility, regardless of whether 18    the facility has contracted with another party to capture, 19    transport, or sequester carbon dioxide.20        (C) If, in any year, the owner of a clean coal SNG 21    brownfield facility fails to demonstrate that the clean 22    coal SNG brownfield facility captured and sequestered at 23    least 85% of the total carbon dioxide emissions that the 24    facility would otherwise emit, then the owner of the clean 25    coal SNG brownfield facility must pay a penalty of $20 per 26    ton of excess carbon emissions up to $20,000,000, which   HB2862- 54 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    shall be deposited into the Energy Efficiency Trust Fund 2    and distributed pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 6-6 3    of the Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Coal 4    Resources Development Law of 1997. Provided, however, to 5    the extent that the owner of the clean coal SNG brownfield 6    facility can demonstrate that the failure was as a result 7    of acts of God (including fire, flood, earthquake, 8    tornado, lightning, hurricane, or other natural disaster); 9    any amendment, modification, or abrogation of any 10    applicable law or regulation that would prevent 11    performance; war; invasion; act of foreign enemies; 12    hostilities (regardless of whether war is declared); civil 13    war; rebellion; revolution; insurrection; military or 14    usurped power or confiscation; terrorist activities; civil 15    disturbances; riots; nationalization; sabotage; blockage; 16    or embargo, the owner of the clean coal SNG brownfield 17    facility shall not be subject to a penalty if and only if 18    (i) it promptly provides notice of its failure to the 19    Commission; (ii) as soon as practicable and consistent 20    with any order or direction from the Commission, it 21    submits to the Commission proposed modifications to its 22    carbon capture and sequestration plan; and (iii) it 23    carries out its proposed modifications in the manner and 24    time directed by the Commission. If the Commission finds 25    that the facility has not satisfied each of these 26    requirements, then the facility shall be subject to the   HB2862- 55 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    penalty. If the owner of a clean coal SNG brownfield 2    facility demonstrates that the clean coal SNG brownfield 3    facility captured and sequestered more than 85% of the 4    total carbon emissions that the facility would otherwise 5    emit, the owner of the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 6    may credit such additional amounts to reduce the amount of 7    any future penalty to be paid. The penalty resulting from 8    the failure to capture and sequester at least the minimum 9    amount of carbon dioxide shall not be passed on to a 10    utility or its customers.11        In addition to any penalty for the clean coal SNG 12    brownfield facility's failure to capture and sequester at 13    least its minimum sequestration requirement, the Attorney 14    General, on behalf of the People of the State of Illinois, 15    shall bring an action for specific performance of this 16    subsection (h-5). Such action may be filed in any circuit 17    court in Illinois. By entering into a sourcing agreement 18    pursuant to subsection (h-1) of this Section, the clean 19    coal SNG brownfield facility agrees to waive any 20    objections to venue or to the jurisdiction of the court 21    with regard to the Attorney General's action for specific 22    performance under this subsection (h-5).23        Compliance with the sequestration requirements and 24    penalty requirements specified in this subsection (h-5) 25    for the clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall be 26    assessed annually by the Commission, which may in its   HB2862- 56 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    discretion retain an expert to facilitate its assessment. 2    If an expert is retained by the Commission, then the clean 3    coal SNG brownfield facility shall pay for the expert's 4    reasonable fees, and such costs shall not be passed 5    through to a utility or its customers. A SNG facility 6    operating pursuant to this subsection (h-5) shall not 7    forfeit its designation as a clean coal SNG facility or a 8    clean coal SNG brownfield facility if the facility fails 9    to fully comply with the applicable carbon sequestration 10    requirements in any given year, provided the requisite 11    offsets are purchased or requisite penalties are paid.12        Responsibility for compliance with the sequestration 13    requirements specified in this subsection (h-5) for the 14    clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall reside solely 15    with the clean coal SNG brownfield facility regardless of 16    whether the facility has contracted with another party to 17    capture, transport, or sequester carbon dioxide. 18    (h-7) Sequestration permitting, oversight, and 19investigations.20        (1) No clean coal facility or clean coal SNG 21    brownfield facility may transport or sequester carbon 22    dioxide unless the Commission approves the method of 23    carbon dioxide transportation or sequestration. Such 24    approval shall be required regardless of whether the 25    facility has contracted with another to transport or 26    sequester the carbon dioxide. Nothing in this subsection   HB2862- 57 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    (h-7) shall release the owner or operator of a carbon 2    dioxide sequestration site or carbon dioxide pipeline from 3    any other permitting requirements under applicable State 4    and federal laws, statutes, rules, or regulations.5        (2) The Commission shall review carbon dioxide 6    transportation and sequestration methods proposed by a 7    clean coal facility or a clean coal SNG brownfield 8    facility and shall approve those methods it deems 9    reasonable and cost-effective. For purposes of this 10    review, "cost-effective" means a commercially reasonable 11    price for similar carbon dioxide transportation or 12    sequestration techniques. In determining whether 13    sequestration is reasonable and cost-effective, the 14    Commission may consult with the Illinois State Geological 15    Survey and retain third parties to assist in its 16    determination, provided that such third parties shall not 17    own or control any direct or indirect interest in the 18    facility that is proposing the carbon dioxide 19    transportation or the carbon dioxide sequestration method 20    and shall have no contractual relationship with that 21    facility. If a third party is retained by the Commission, 22    then the facility proposing the carbon dioxide 23    transportation or sequestration method shall pay for the 24    expert's reasonable fees, and these costs shall not be 25    passed through to a utility or its customers.26        No later than 6 months prior to the date upon which the   HB2862- 58 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    owner intends to commence construction of a clean coal 2    facility or the clean coal SNG brownfield facility, the 3    owner of the facility shall file with the Commission a 4    carbon dioxide transportation or sequestration plan. The 5    Commission shall hold a public hearing within 30 days 6    after receipt of the facility's carbon dioxide 7    transportation or sequestration plan. The Commission shall 8    post notice of the review on its website upon submission 9    of a carbon dioxide transportation or sequestration method 10    and shall accept written public comments. The Commission 11    shall take the comments into account when making its 12    decision.13        The Commission may not approve a carbon dioxide 14    sequestration method if the owner or operator of the 15    sequestration site has not received (i) an Underground 16    Injection Control permit from the United States 17    Environmental Protection Agency, or from the Illinois 18    Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the 19    Environmental Protection Act; (ii) an Underground 20    Injection Control permit from the Illinois Department of 21    Natural Resources pursuant to the Illinois Oil and Gas 22    Act; or (iii) an Underground Injection Control permit from 23    the United States Environmental Protection Agency or a 24    permit similar to items (i) or (ii) from the state in which 25    the sequestration site is located if the sequestration 26    will take place outside of Illinois. The Commission shall   HB2862- 59 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    approve or deny the carbon dioxide transportation or 2    sequestration method within 90 days after the receipt of 3    all required information.4        (3) At least annually, the Illinois Environmental 5    Protection Agency shall inspect all carbon dioxide 6    sequestration sites in Illinois. The Illinois 7    Environmental Protection Agency may, as often as deemed 8    necessary, monitor and conduct investigations of those 9    sites. The owner or operator of the sequestration site 10    must cooperate with the Illinois Environmental Protection 11    Agency investigations of carbon dioxide sequestration 12    sites.13        If the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency 14    determines at any time a site creates conditions that 15    warrant the issuance of a seal order under Section 34 of 16    the Environmental Protection Act, then the Illinois 17    Environmental Protection Agency shall seal the site 18    pursuant to the Environmental Protection Act. If the 19    Illinois Environmental Protection Agency determines at any 20    time a carbon dioxide sequestration site creates 21    conditions that warrant the institution of a civil action 22    for an injunction under Section 43 of the Environmental 23    Protection Act, then the Illinois Environmental Protection 24    Agency shall request the State's Attorney or the Attorney 25    General institute such action. The Illinois Environmental 26    Protection Agency shall provide notice of any such actions   HB2862- 60 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    as soon as possible on its website. The SNG facility shall 2    incur all reasonable costs associated with any such 3    inspection or monitoring of the sequestration sites, and 4    these costs shall not be recoverable from utilities or 5    their customers.6        (4) (Blank).7    (h-9) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall have 8the right to recover prudently incurred increased costs or 9reduced revenue resulting from any new or amendatory 10legislation or other action. The State of Illinois pledges 11that the State will not enact any law or take any action to:12        (1) break, or repeal the authority for, sourcing 13    agreements approved by the Commission and entered into 14    between public utilities and the clean coal SNG brownfield 15    facility;16        (2) deny public utilities full cost recovery for their 17    costs incurred under those sourcing agreements; or18        (3) deny the clean coal SNG brownfield facility full 19    cost and revenue recovery as provided under those sourcing 20    agreements that are recoverable pursuant to subsection 21    (h-3) of this Section.22    These pledges are for the benefit of the parties to those 23sourcing agreements and the issuers and holders of bonds or 24other obligations issued or incurred to finance or refinance 25the clean coal SNG brownfield facility. The clean coal SNG 26brownfield facility is authorized to include and refer to   HB2862- 61 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1these pledges in any financing agreement into which it may 2enter in regard to those sourcing agreements.3    The State of Illinois retains and reserves all other 4rights to enact new or amendatory legislation or take any 5other action, without impairment of the right of the clean 6coal SNG brownfield facility to recover prudently incurred 7increased costs or reduced revenue resulting from the new or 8amendatory legislation or other action, including, but not 9limited to, such legislation or other action that would (i) 10directly or indirectly raise the costs the clean coal SNG 11brownfield facility must incur; (ii) directly or indirectly 12place additional restrictions, regulations, or requirements on 13the clean coal SNG brownfield facility; (iii) prohibit 14sequestration in general or prohibit a specific sequestration 15method or project; or (iv) increase minimum sequestration 16requirements for the clean coal SNG brownfield facility to the 17extent technically feasible. The clean coal SNG brownfield 18facility shall have the right to recover prudently incurred 19increased costs or reduced revenue resulting from the new or 20amendatory legislation or other action as described in this 21subsection (h-9). 22    (h-10) Contract costs for SNG incurred by an Illinois gas 23utility are reasonable and prudent and recoverable through the 24purchased gas adjustment clause and are not subject to review 25or disallowance by the Commission. Contract costs are costs 26incurred by the utility under the terms of a contract that   HB2862- 62 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1incorporates the terms stated in subsection (h) of this 2Section as confirmed in writing by the Illinois Power Agency 3as set forth in subsection (h) of this Section, which 4confirmation shall be deemed conclusive, or as a consequence 5of or condition to its performance under the contract, 6including (i) amounts paid for SNG under the SNG contract and 7(ii) costs of transportation and storage services of SNG 8purchased from interstate pipelines under federally approved 9tariffs. The Illinois gas utility shall initiate a clean coal 10SNG facility rider mechanism that (A) shall be applicable to 11all customers who receive transportation service from the 12utility, (B) shall be designed to have an equal percentage 13impact on the transportation services rates of each class of 14the utility's total customers, and (C) shall accurately 15reflect the net customer savings, if any, and above market 16costs, if any, under the SNG contract. Any contract, the terms 17of which have been confirmed in writing by the Illinois Power 18Agency as set forth in subsection (h) of this Section and the 19performance of the parties under such contract cannot be 20grounds for challenging prudence or cost recovery by the 21utility through the purchased gas adjustment clause, and in 22such cases, the Commission is directed not to consider, and 23has no authority to consider, any attempted challenges. 24    The contracts entered into by Illinois gas utilities 25pursuant to subsection (h) of this Section shall provide that 26the utility retains the right to terminate the contract   HB2862- 63 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1without further obligation or liability to any party if the 2contract has been impaired as a result of any legislative, 3administrative, judicial, or other governmental action that is 4taken that eliminates all or part of the prudence protection 5of this subsection (h-10) or denies the recoverability of all 6or part of the contract costs through the purchased gas 7adjustment clause. Should any Illinois gas utility exercise 8its right under this subsection (h-10) to terminate the 9contract, all contract costs incurred prior to termination are 10and will be deemed reasonable, prudent, and recoverable as and 11when incurred and not subject to review or disallowance by the 12Commission. Any order, issued by the State requiring or 13authorizing the discontinuation of the merchant function, 14defined as the purchase and sale of natural gas by an Illinois 15gas utility for the ultimate consumer in its service territory 16shall include provisions necessary to prevent the impairment 17of the value of any contract hereunder over its full term. 18    (h-11) All costs incurred by an Illinois gas utility in 19procuring SNG from a clean coal SNG brownfield facility 20pursuant to subsection (h-1) or a third-party marketer 21pursuant to subsection (h-1) are reasonable and prudent and 22recoverable through the purchased gas adjustment clause in 23conjunction with a SNG brownfield facility rider mechanism and 24are not subject to review or disallowance by the Commission; 25provided that if a utility is required by law or otherwise 26elects to connect the clean coal SNG brownfield facility to an   HB2862- 64 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1interstate pipeline, then the utility shall be entitled to 2recover pursuant to its tariffs all just and reasonable costs 3that are prudently incurred. Sourcing agreement costs are 4costs incurred by the utility under the terms of a sourcing 5agreement that incorporates the terms stated in subsection 6(h-1) of this Section as approved by the Commission as set 7forth in subsection (h-4) of this Section, which approval 8shall be deemed conclusive, or as a consequence of or 9condition to its performance under the contract, including (i) 10amounts paid for SNG under the SNG contract and (ii) costs of 11transportation and storage services of SNG purchased from 12interstate pipelines under federally approved tariffs. Any 13sourcing agreement, the terms of which have been approved by 14the Commission as set forth in subsection (h-4) of this 15Section, and the performance of the parties under the sourcing 16agreement cannot be grounds for challenging prudence or cost 17recovery by the utility, and in these cases, the Commission is 18directed not to consider, and has no authority to consider, 19any attempted challenges. 20    (h-15) Reconciliation account. The clean coal SNG facility 21shall establish a reconciliation account for the benefit of 22the retail customers of the utilities that have entered into 23contracts with the clean coal SNG facility pursuant to 24subsection (h). The reconciliation account shall be maintained 25and administered by an independent trustee that is mutually 26agreed upon by the owners of the clean coal SNG facility, the   HB2862- 65 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1utilities, and the Commission in an interest-bearing account 2in accordance with the following:3        (1) The clean coal SNG facility shall conduct an 4    analysis annually within 60 days after receiving the 5    necessary cost information, which shall be provided by the 6    gas utility within 6 months after the end of the preceding 7    calendar year, to determine (i) the average annual 8    contract SNG cost, which shall be calculated as the total 9    amount paid for SNG purchased from the clean coal SNG 10    facility over the preceding 12 months, plus the cost to 11    the utility of the required transportation and storage 12    services of SNG, divided by the total number of MMBtus of 13    SNG actually purchased from the clean coal SNG facility in 14    the preceding 12 months under the utility contract; (ii) 15    the average annual natural gas purchase cost, which shall 16    be calculated as the total annual supply costs paid for 17    baseload natural gas (excluding any SNG) purchased by such 18    utility over the preceding 12 months plus the costs of 19    transportation and storage services of such natural gas 20    (excluding such costs for SNG), divided by the total 21    number of MMbtus of baseload natural gas (excluding SNG) 22    actually purchased by the utility during the year; (iii) 23    the cost differential, which shall be the difference 24    between the average annual contract SNG cost and the 25    average annual natural gas purchase cost; and (iv) the 26    revenue share target which shall be the cost differential   HB2862- 66 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    multiplied by the total amount of SNG purchased over the 2    preceding 12 months under such utility contract.3            (A) To the extent the annual average contract SNG 4        cost is less than the annual average natural gas 5        purchase cost, the utility shall credit an amount 6        equal to the revenue share target to the 7        reconciliation account. Such credit payment shall be 8        made monthly starting within 30 days after the 9        completed analysis in this subsection (h-15) and based 10        on collections from all customers via a line item 11        charge in all customer bills designed to have an equal 12        percentage impact on the transportation services of 13        each class of customers. Credit payments made pursuant 14        to this subparagraph (A) shall be deemed prudent and 15        reasonable and not subject to Commission prudence 16        review.17            (B) To the extent the annual average contract SNG 18        cost is greater than the annual average natural gas 19        purchase cost, the reconciliation account shall be 20        used to provide a credit equal to the revenue share 21        target to the utilities to be used to reduce the 22        utility's natural gas costs through the purchased gas 23        adjustment clause. Such payment shall be made within 24        30 days after the completed analysis pursuant to this 25        subsection (h-15), but only to the extent that the 26        reconciliation account has a positive balance.  HB2862- 67 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        (2) At the conclusion of the term of the SNG contracts 2    pursuant to subsection (h) and the completion of the final 3    annual analysis pursuant to this subsection (h-15), to the 4    extent the facility owes any amount to retail customers, 5    amounts in the account shall be credited to retail 6    customers to the extent the owed amount is repaid; 50% of 7    any additional amount in the reconciliation account shall 8    be distributed to the utilities to be used to reduce the 9    utilities' natural gas costs through the purchase gas 10    adjustment clause with the remaining amount distributed to 11    the clean coal SNG facility. Such payment shall be made 12    within 30 days after the last completed analysis pursuant 13    to this subsection (h-15). If the facility has repaid all 14    owed amounts, if any, to retail customers and has 15    distributed 50% of any additional amount in the account to 16    the utilities, then the owners of the clean coal SNG 17    facility shall have no further obligation to the utility 18    or the retail customers.19        If, at the conclusion of the term of the contracts 20    pursuant to subsection (h) and the completion of the final 21    annual analysis pursuant to this subsection (h-15), the 22    facility owes any amount to retail customers and the 23    account has been depleted, then the clean coal SNG 24    facility shall be liable for any remaining amount owed to 25    the retail customers. The clean coal SNG facility shall 26    market the daily production of SNG and distribute on a   HB2862- 68 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    monthly basis 5% of the amounts collected with respect to 2    such future sales to the utilities in proportion to each 3    utility's SNG contract to be used to reduce the utility's 4    natural gas costs through the purchase gas adjustment 5    clause; such payments to the utility shall continue until 6    either 15 years after the conclusion of the contract or 7    such time as the sum of such payments equals the remaining 8    amount owed to the retail customers at the end of the 9    contract, whichever is earlier. If the debt to the retail 10    customers is not repaid within 15 years after the 11    conclusion of the contract, then the owner of the clean 12    coal SNG facility must sell the facility, and all proceeds 13    from that sale must be used to repay any amount owed to the 14    retail customers under this subsection (h-15).15        The retail customers shall have first priority in 16    recovering that debt above any creditors, except the 17    secured lenders to the extent that the secured lenders 18    have any secured debt outstanding, including any parent 19    companies or affiliates of the clean coal SNG facility.20        (3) 50% of all additional net revenue, defined as 21    miscellaneous net revenue after cost allowance and above 22    the budgeted estimate established for revenue pursuant to 23    subsection (h), including sale of substitute natural gas 24    derived from the clean coal SNG facility above the 25    nameplate capacity of the facility and other by-products 26    produced by the facility, shall be credited to the   HB2862- 69 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    reconciliation account on an annual basis with such 2    payment made within 30 days after the end of each calendar 3    year during the term of the contract.4        (4) The clean coal SNG facility shall each year, 5    starting in the facility's first year of commercial 6    operation, file with the Commission, in such form as the 7    Commission shall require, a report as to the 8    reconciliation account. The annual report must contain the 9    following information:10            (A) the revenue share target amount;11            (B) the amount credited or debited to the 12        reconciliation account during the year;13            (C) the amount credited to the utilities to be 14        used to reduce the utilities natural gas costs though 15        the purchase gas adjustment clause;16            (D) the total amount of reconciliation account at 17        the beginning and end of the year;18            (E) the total amount of consumer savings to date; 19        and20            (F) any additional information the Commission may 21        require.22    When any report is erroneous or defective or appears to 23the Commission to be erroneous or defective, the Commission 24may notify the clean coal SNG facility to amend the report 25within 30 days; before or after the termination of the 30-day 26period, the Commission may examine the trustee of the   HB2862- 70 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1reconciliation account or the officers, agents, employees, 2books, records, or accounts of the clean coal SNG facility and 3correct such items in the report as upon such examination the 4Commission may find defective or erroneous. All reports shall 5be under oath.6    All reports made to the Commission by the clean coal SNG 7facility and the contents of the reports shall be open to 8public inspection and shall be deemed a public record under 9the Freedom of Information Act. Such reports shall be 10preserved in the office of the Commission. The Commission 11shall publish an annual summary of the reports prior to 12February 1 of the following year. The annual summary shall be 13made available to the public on the Commission's website and 14shall be submitted to the General Assembly.15    Any facility that fails to file the report required under 16this paragraph (4) to the Commission within the time specified 17or to make specific answer to any question propounded by the 18Commission within 30 days after the time it is lawfully 19required to do so, or within such further time not to exceed 90 20days as may be allowed by the Commission in its discretion, 21shall pay a penalty of $500 to the Commission for each day it 22is in default.23    Any person who willfully makes any false report to the 24Commission or to any member, officer, or employee thereof, any 25person who willfully in a report withholds or fails to provide 26material information to which the Commission is entitled under   HB2862- 71 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1this paragraph (4) and which information is either required to 2be filed by statute, rule, regulation, order, or decision of 3the Commission or has been requested by the Commission, and 4any person who willfully aids or abets such person shall be 5guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.6    (h-20) The General Assembly authorizes the Illinois 7Finance Authority to issue bonds to the maximum extent 8permitted to finance coal gasification facilities described in 9this Section, which constitute both "industrial projects" 10under Article 801 of the Illinois Finance Authority Act and 11"clean coal and energy projects" under Sections 825-65 through 12825-75 of the Illinois Finance Authority Act. 13    Administrative costs incurred by the Illinois Finance 14Authority in performance of this subsection (h-20) shall be 15subject to reimbursement by the clean coal SNG facility on 16terms as the Illinois Finance Authority and the clean coal SNG 17facility may agree. The utility and its customers shall have 18no obligation to reimburse the clean coal SNG facility or the 19Illinois Finance Authority for any such costs. 20    (h-25) The State of Illinois pledges that the State may 21not enact any law or take any action to (1) break or repeal the 22authority for SNG purchase contracts entered into between 23public gas utilities and the clean coal SNG facility pursuant 24to subsection (h) of this Section or (2) deny public gas 25utilities their full cost recovery for contract costs, as 26defined in subsection (h-10), that are incurred under such SNG   HB2862- 72 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1purchase contracts. These pledges are for the benefit of the 2parties to such SNG purchase contracts and the issuers and 3holders of bonds or other obligations issued or incurred to 4finance or refinance the clean coal SNG facility. The 5beneficiaries are authorized to include and refer to these 6pledges in any finance agreement into which they may enter in 7regard to such contracts.8    (h-30) The State of Illinois retains and reserves all 9other rights to enact new or amendatory legislation or take 10any other action, including, but not limited to, such 11legislation or other action that would (1) directly or 12indirectly raise the costs that the clean coal SNG facility 13must incur; (2) directly or indirectly place additional 14restrictions, regulations, or requirements on the clean coal 15SNG facility; (3) prohibit sequestration in general or 16prohibit a specific sequestration method or project; or (4) 17increase minimum sequestration requirements. 18    (i) If a gas utility or an affiliate of a gas utility has 19an ownership interest in any entity that produces or sells 20synthetic natural gas, Article VII of this Act shall apply. 21(Source: P.A. 100-391, eff. 8-25-17.)

Full Text of HB2862 ILGA.GOV HB2862 - 104th General Assembly 104TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY State of Illinois 2025 and 2026HB2862 Introduced 2/6/2025, by Rep. Amy Elik SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 220 ILCS 5/9-220  from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 9-220    Amends the Public Utilities Act. Provides that the Illinois Commerce Commission shall not authorize any charges based upon changes in the cost of fuel. Removes provisions concerning the Commission's ability to authorize the increase or decrease of a public utility's rates and charges based upon changes in the cost of fuel used in the generation or production of electric power, changes in the cost of purchased power, or changes in the cost of purchased gas through the application of fuel adjustment clauses or purchased gas adjustment clauses and based upon expenditures or revenues resulting from the purchase or sale of emission allowances through such fuel adjustment clauses as a cost of fuel. Removes provisions concerning a public utility's ability to, at any time during the mandatory transition period, file with the Commission proposed tariff sheets that establish the rate of the provided utility to be applied pursuant to the public utility's fuel adjustment clause at the average value for such rate during the preceding 24 months, provided that such average rate results in a credit to customers' bills, without making any revisions to the public utility's base rate tariffs. LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b  A BILL FOR HB2862LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Public Utilities Act is amended by changing 5Section 9-220 as follows: 6    (220 ILCS 5/9-220)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 9-220)7    Sec. 9-220. Rate changes based on changes in fuel costs. 8    (a) The Commission shall not authorize any charges based 9upon changes in the cost of fuel. Notwithstanding the 10provisions of Section 9-201, the Commission may authorize the 11increase or decrease of rates and charges based upon changes 12in the cost of fuel used in the generation or production of 13electric power, changes in the cost of purchased power, or 14changes in the cost of purchased gas through the application 15of fuel adjustment clauses or purchased gas adjustment 16clauses. The Commission may also authorize the increase or 17decrease of rates and charges based upon expenditures or 18revenues resulting from the purchase or sale of emission 19allowances created under the federal Clean Air Act Amendments 20of 1990, through such fuel adjustment clauses, as a cost of 21fuel. For the purposes of this paragraph, cost of fuel used in 22the generation or production of electric power shall include 23the amount of any fees paid by the utility for the   HB2862- 2 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1implementation and operation of a process for the 2desulfurization of the flue gas when burning high sulfur coal 3at any location within the State of Illinois irrespective of 4the attainment status designation of such location; but shall 5not include transportation costs of coal (i) except to the 6extent that for contracts entered into on and after the 7effective date of this amendatory Act of 1997, the cost of the 8coal, including transportation costs, constitutes the lowest 9cost for adequate and reliable fuel supply reasonably 10available to the public utility in comparison to the cost, 11including transportation costs, of other adequate and reliable 12sources of fuel supply reasonably available to the public 13utility, or (ii) except as otherwise provided in the next 3 14sentences of this paragraph. Such costs of fuel shall, when 15requested by a utility or at the conclusion of the utility's 16next general electric rate proceeding, whichever shall first 17occur, include transportation costs of coal purchased under 18existing coal purchase contracts. For purposes of this 19paragraph "existing coal purchase contracts" means contracts 20for the purchase of coal in effect on the effective date of 21this amendatory Act of 1991, as such contracts may thereafter 22be amended, but only to the extent that any such amendment does 23not increase the aggregate quantity of coal to be purchased 24under such contract. Nothing herein shall authorize an 25electric utility to recover through its fuel adjustment clause 26any amounts of transportation costs of coal that were included   HB2862- 3 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1in the revenue requirement used to set base rates in its most 2recent general rate proceeding. Cost shall be based upon 3uniformly applied accounting principles. Annually, the 4Commission shall initiate public hearings to determine whether 5the clauses reflect actual costs of fuel, gas, power, or coal 6transportation purchased to determine whether such purchases 7were prudent, and to reconcile any amounts collected with the 8actual costs of fuel, power, gas, or coal transportation 9prudently purchased. In each such proceeding, the burden of 10proof shall be upon the utility to establish the prudence of 11its cost of fuel, power, gas, or coal transportation purchases 12and costs. The Commission shall issue its final order in each 13such annual proceeding for an electric utility by December 31 14of the year immediately following the year to which the 15proceeding pertains, provided, that the Commission shall issue 16its final order with respect to such annual proceeding for the 17years 1996 and earlier by December 31, 1998.18    (b) (Blank). A public utility providing electric service, 19other than a public utility described in subsections (e) or 20(f) of this Section, may at any time during the mandatory 21transition period file with the Commission proposed tariff 22sheets that eliminate the public utility's fuel adjustment 23clause and adjust the public utility's base rate tariffs by 24the amount necessary for the base fuel component of the base 25rates to recover the public utility's average fuel and power 26supply costs per kilowatt-hour for the 2 most recent years for   HB2862- 4 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1which the Commission has issued final orders in annual 2proceedings pursuant to subsection (a), where the average fuel 3and power supply costs per kilowatt-hour shall be calculated 4as the sum of the public utility's prudent and allowable fuel 5and power supply costs as found by the Commission in the 2 6proceedings divided by the public utility's actual 7jurisdictional kilowatt-hour sales for those 2 years. 8Notwithstanding any contrary or inconsistent provisions in 9Section 9-201 of this Act, in subsection (a) of this Section or 10in any rules or regulations promulgated by the Commission 11pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section, the Commission 12shall review and shall by order approve, or approve as 13modified, the proposed tariff sheets within 60 days after the 14date of the public utility's filing. The Commission may modify 15the public utility's proposed tariff sheets only to the extent 16the Commission finds necessary to achieve conformance to the 17requirements of this subsection (b). During the 5 years 18following the date of the Commission's order, but in any event 19no earlier than January 1, 2007, a public utility whose fuel 20adjustment clause has been eliminated pursuant to this 21subsection shall not file proposed tariff sheets seeking, or 22otherwise petition the Commission for, reinstatement of a fuel 23adjustment clause.24    (c) (Blank). Notwithstanding any contrary or inconsistent 25provisions in Section 9-201 of this Act, in subsection (a) of 26this Section or in any rules or regulations promulgated by the   HB2862- 5 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1Commission pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section, a 2public utility providing electric service, other than a public 3utility described in subsection (e) or (f) of this Section, 4may at any time during the mandatory transition period file 5with the Commission proposed tariff sheets that establish the 6rate per kilowatt-hour to be applied pursuant to the public 7utility's fuel adjustment clause at the average value for such 8rate during the preceding 24 months, provided that such 9average rate results in a credit to customers' bills, without 10making any revisions to the public utility's base rate 11tariffs. The proposed tariff sheets shall establish the fuel 12adjustment rate for a specific time period of at least 3 years 13but not more than 5 years, provided that the terms and 14conditions for any reinstatement earlier than 5 years shall be 15set forth in the proposed tariff sheets and subject to 16modification or approval by the Commission. The Commission 17shall review and shall by order approve the proposed tariff 18sheets if it finds that the requirements of this subsection 19are met. The Commission shall not conduct the annual hearings 20specified in the last 3 sentences of subsection (a) of this 21Section for the utility for the period that the factor 22established pursuant to this subsection is in effect.23    (d) (Blank). A public utility providing electric service, 24or a public utility providing gas service may file with the 25Commission proposed tariff sheets that eliminate the public 26utility's fuel or purchased gas adjustment clause and adjust   HB2862- 6 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1the public utility's base rate tariffs to provide for recovery 2of power supply costs or gas supply costs that would have been 3recovered through such clause; provided, that the provisions 4of this subsection (d) shall not be available to a public 5utility described in subsections (e) or (f) of this Section to 6eliminate its fuel adjustment clause. Notwithstanding any 7contrary or inconsistent provisions in Section 9-201 of this 8Act, in subsection (a) of this Section, or in any rules or 9regulations promulgated by the Commission pursuant to 10subsection (g) of this Section, the Commission shall review 11and shall by order approve, or approve as modified in the 12Commission's order, the proposed tariff sheets within 240 days 13after the date of the public utility's filing. The 14Commission's order shall approve rates and charges that the 15Commission, based on information in the public utility's 16filing or on the record if a hearing is held by the Commission, 17finds will recover the reasonable, prudent and necessary 18jurisdictional power supply costs or gas supply costs incurred 19or to be incurred by the public utility during a 12 month 20period found by the Commission to be appropriate for these 21purposes, provided, that such period shall be either (i) a 12 22month historical period occurring during the 15 months ending 23on the date of the public utility's filing, or (ii) a 12 month 24future period ending no later than 15 months following the 25date of the public utility's filing.

The Commission's order shall provide for any 12reconciliation of power supply costs or gas supply costs, as 13the case may be, and associated revenues through the date that 14the public utility's fuel or purchased gas adjustment clause 15is eliminated. During the 5 years following the date of the 16Commission's order, a public utility whose fuel or purchased 17gas adjustment clause has been eliminated pursuant to this 18subsection shall not file proposed tariff sheets seeking, or 19otherwise petition the Commission for, reinstatement or 20adoption of a fuel or purchased gas adjustment clause. Nothing 21in this subsection (d) shall be construed as limiting the 22Commission's authority to eliminate a public utility's fuel 23adjustment clause or purchased gas adjustment clause in 24accordance with any other applicable provisions of this Act.25    (e) (Blank). Notwithstanding any contrary or inconsistent 26provisions in Section 9-201 of this Act, in subsection (a) of   HB2862- 8 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1this Section, or in any rules promulgated by the Commission 2pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section, a public utility 3providing electric service to more than 1,000,000 customers in 4this State may, within the first 6 months after the effective 5date of this amendatory Act of 1997, file with the Commission 6proposed tariff sheets that eliminate, effective January 1, 71997, the public utility's fuel adjustment clause without 8adjusting its base rates, and such tariff sheets shall be 9effective upon filing. To the extent the application of the 10fuel adjustment clause had resulted in net charges to 11customers after January 1, 1997, the utility shall also file a 12tariff sheet that provides for a refund stated on a per 13kilowatt-hour basis of such charges over a period not to 14exceed 6 months; provided however, that such refund shall not 15include the proportional amounts of taxes paid under the Use 16Tax Act, Service Use Tax Act, Service Occupation Tax Act, and 17Retailers' Occupation Tax Act on fuel used in generation. The 18Commission shall issue an order within 45 days after the date 19of the public utility's filing approving or approving as 20modified such tariff sheet. If the fuel adjustment clause is 21eliminated pursuant to this subsection, the Commission shall 22not conduct the annual hearings specified in the last 3 23sentences of subsection (a) of this Section for the utility 24for any period after December 31, 1996 and prior to any 25reinstatement of such clause.

If the parties are in agreement on the terms of the 3contract, then the Illinois Power Agency shall approve the 4contract. If after mediation the parties have failed to come 5to agreement, then the Illinois Power Agency shall revise the 6draft contract as necessary to confirm that the contract 7contains only terms that are reasonable and equitable. The 8Illinois Power Agency may, in its discretion, retain an 9independent, qualified, and experienced expert to assist in 10its obligations under this subsection (h). The Illinois Power 11Agency shall adopt and make public policies detailing the 12processes for retaining a mediator and an expert under this 13subsection (h). Any mediator or expert retained under this 14subsection (h) shall be retained no later than 60 days after 15August 2, 2011.16    The Illinois Power Agency shall complete all of its 17responsibilities under this subsection (h) within 60 days 18after August 2, 2011. The clean coal SNG facility shall pay a 19reasonable fee as required by the Illinois Power Agency for 20its services under this subsection (h) and shall pay the 21mediator's and expert's reasonable fees, if any. A gas utility 22and its customers shall have no obligation to reimburse the 23clean coal SNG facility or the Illinois Power Agency of any 24such costs.25    Within 30 days after commercial production of SNG has 26begun, the Commission shall initiate a review to determine   HB2862- 16 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1whether the final capitalized plant cost of the clean coal SNG 2facility reflects actual incurred costs and whether the 3incurred costs were reasonable. In determining the actual 4incurred costs included in the final capitalized plant cost 5and the reasonableness of those costs, the Commission may in 6its discretion retain independent, qualified, and experienced 7experts to assist in its determination. The expert shall not 8own or control any direct or indirect interest in the clean 9coal SNG facility and shall have no contractual relationship 10with the clean coal SNG facility. If an expert is retained by 11the Commission, then the clean coal SNG facility shall pay the 12expert's reasonable fees. The fees shall not be passed on to a 13utility or its customers. The Commission shall adopt and make 14public a policy detailing the process for retaining experts 15under this subsection (h).16    Within 30 days after completion of its review, the 17Commission shall initiate a formal proceeding on the final 18capitalized plant cost of the clean coal SNG facility at which 19comments and testimony may be submitted by any interested 20parties and the public. If the Commission finds that the final 21capitalized plant cost includes costs that were not actually 22incurred or costs that were unreasonably incurred, then the 23Commission shall disallow the amount of non-incurred or 24unreasonable costs from the SNG price under contracts entered 25into under this subsection (h). If the Commission disallows 26any costs, then the Commission shall adjust the SNG price   HB2862- 17 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1using the price formula in the contract approved by the 2Illinois Power Agency under this subsection (h) to reflect the 3disallowed costs and shall enter an order specifying the 4revised price. In addition, the Commission's order shall 5direct the clean coal SNG facility to issue refunds of such 6sums as shall represent the difference between actual gross 7revenues and the gross revenue that would have been obtained 8based upon the same volume, from the price revised by the 9Commission. Any refund shall include interest calculated at a 10rate determined by the Commission and shall be returned 11according to procedures prescribed by the Commission.12    Nothing in this subsection (h) shall preclude any party 13affected by a decision of the Commission under this subsection 14(h) from seeking judicial review of the Commission's decision.15    (h-1) Any Illinois gas utility may enter into a sourcing 16agreement for up to 30 years of supply with the clean coal SNG 17brownfield facility if the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 18has commenced construction.

If the trustee determines that 24    during the prior 5 years the consumer protection reserve 25    account has had an average account balance of less than 26    $75,000,000, then the consumer protection reserve account   HB2862- 23 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    principal maximum amount shall be increased by $5,000,000. 2    If the trustee determines that during the prior 5 years 3    the consumer protection reserve account has had an average 4    account balance of more than $75,000,000, then the 5    consumer protection reserve account principal maximum 6    amount shall be decreased by $5,000,000. 7        (6) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall 8    identify and sell economically viable by-products produced 9    by the facility.10        (7) Fifty percent of all additional net revenue, 11    defined as miscellaneous net revenue from products 12    produced by the facility and delivered during the month 13    after cost allowance for costs associated with additional 14    net revenue that are not otherwise recoverable pursuant to 15    subsection (h-3) of this Section, including net revenue 16    from sales of substitute natural gas derived from the 17    facility above the nameplate capacity of the facility and 18    other by-products produced by the facility, shall be 19    credited to the consumer protection reserve account 20    pursuant to subsection (h-2) of this Section.21        (8) The delivered SNG price per million btu to be paid 22    monthly by the utility to the clean coal SNG brownfield 23    facility, which shall be based only upon the following: 24    (A) a capital recovery charge, operations and maintenance 25    costs, and sequestration costs, only to the extent 26    approved by the Commission pursuant to paragraphs (1),   HB2862- 24 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    (2), and (3) of subsection (h-3) of this Section; (B) the 2    actual delivered and processed fuel costs pursuant to 3    paragraph (4) of subsection (h-3) of this Section; (C) 4    actual costs of SNG transportation pursuant to paragraph 5    (6) of subsection (h-3) of this Section; (D) certain taxes 6    and fees imposed by the federal government, the State, or 7    any unit of local government as provided in paragraph (6) 8    of subsection (h-3) of this Section; and (E) the credit, 9    if any, from the consumer protection reserve account 10    pursuant to subsection (h-2) of this Section. The 11    delivered SNG price per million Btu shall proportionately 12    reflect these elements over the term of the sourcing 13    agreement.14        (9) A formula to translate the recoverable costs and 15    charges under subsection (h-3) of this Section into the 16    delivered SNG price per million btu.17        (10) Title to the SNG shall pass at a mutually 18    agreeable point in Illinois, and may provide that, rather 19    than the utility taking title to the SNG, a mutually 20    agreed upon third-party gas marketer pursuant to a 21    contract approved by the Illinois Power Agency or its 22    designee may take title to the SNG pursuant to an 23    agreement between the utility, the owner of the clean coal 24    SNG brownfield facility, and the third-party gas marketer. 25        (11) A utility may exit the sourcing agreement without 26    penalty if the clean coal SNG brownfield facility does not   HB2862- 25 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    commence construction by July 1, 2015.2        (12) A utility is responsible to pay only the 3    Commission determined unit price cost of SNG that is 4    purchased by the utility. Nothing in the sourcing 5    agreement will obligate a utility to invest capital in a 6    clean coal SNG brownfield facility.7        (13) The quality of SNG must, at a minimum, be 8    equivalent to the quality required for interstate pipeline 9    gas before a utility is required to accept and pay for SNG 10    gas.11        (14) Nothing in the sourcing agreement will require a 12    utility to construct any facilities to accept delivery of 13    SNG. Provided, however, if a utility is required by law or 14    otherwise elects to connect the clean coal SNG brownfield 15    facility to an interstate pipeline, then the utility shall 16    be entitled to recover pursuant to its tariffs all just 17    and reasonable costs that are prudently incurred. Any 18    costs incurred by the utility to receive, deliver, manage, 19    or otherwise accommodate purchases under the SNG sourcing 20    agreement will be fully recoverable through a utility's 21    purchased gas adjustment clause rider mechanism in 22    conjunction with a SNG brownfield facility rider 23    mechanism. The SNG brownfield facility rider mechanism (A) 24    shall be applicable to all customers who receive 25    transportation service from the utility, (B) shall be 26    designed to have an equal percent impact on the   HB2862- 26 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    transportation services rates of each class of the 2    utility's customers, and (C) shall accurately reflect the 3    net consumer savings, if any, and above-market costs, if 4    any, associated with the utility receiving, delivering, 5    managing, or otherwise accommodating purchases under the 6    SNG sourcing agreement. 7        (15) Remedies for the clean coal SNG brownfield 8    facility's failure to deliver a designated amount for a 9    designated period.10        (16) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall make 11    a good faith effort to ensure that an amount equal to not 12    less than 15% of the value of its prime construction 13    contract for the facility shall be established as a goal 14    to be awarded to minority-owned businesses, women-owned 15    businesses, and businesses owned by a person with a 16    disability; provided that at least 75% of the amount of 17    such total goal shall be for minority-owned businesses. 18    "Minority-owned business", "women-owned business", and 19    "business owned by a person with a disability" shall have 20    the meanings ascribed to them in Section 2 of the Business 21    Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and Persons with 22    Disabilities Act. 23        (17) Prior to the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 24    issuing a notice to proceed to construction, the clean 25    coal SNG brownfield facility shall file with the 26    Commission a certificate from an independent engineer that   HB2862- 27 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    the clean coal SNG brownfield facility has (A) obtained 2    all applicable State and federal environmental permits 3    required for construction; (B) obtained approval from the 4    Commission of a carbon capture and sequestration plan; and 5    (C) obtained all necessary permits required for 6    construction for the transportation and sequestration of 7    carbon dioxide as set forth in the Commission-approved 8    carbon capture and sequestration plan. 9    (h-2) Consumer protection reserve account. The clean coal 10SNG brownfield facility shall guarantee a minimum of 11$100,000,000 in consumer savings to customers of the utilities 12that have entered into sourcing agreements with the clean coal 13SNG brownfield facility, calculated in real 2010 dollars at 14the conclusion of the term of the sourcing agreement by 15comparing the delivered SNG price to the Chicago City-gate 16price on a weighted daily basis for each day over the entire 17term of the sourcing agreement. Prior to the clean coal SNG 18brownfield facility issuing a notice to proceed to 19construction, the clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall 20establish a consumer protection reserve account for the 21benefit of the retail customers of the utilities that have 22entered into sourcing agreements with the clean coal SNG 23brownfield facility pursuant to subsection (h-1), with cash 24principal in the amount of $150,000,000. Such cash principal 25shall only be recovered through the consumer protection 26reserve account and not as a cost to be recovered in the   HB2862- 28 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1delivered SNG price pursuant to subsection (h-3) of this 2Section. The consumer protection reserve account shall be 3maintained and administered by an independent trustee that is 4mutually agreed upon by the clean coal SNG brownfield 5facility, the utilities, and the Commission in an 6interest-bearing account in accordance with the following:7        (1) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility monthly 8    shall calculate (A) the difference between the monthly 9    delivered SNG price and the Chicago City-gate price, by 10    comparing the delivered SNG price, which shall include the 11    cost of transportation to the delivery point, if any, to 12    the Chicago City-gate price on a weighted daily basis for 13    each day of the prior month based upon a mutually agreed 14    upon published index and (B) the overage amount, if any, 15    by calculating the annualized incremental additional cost, 16    if any, of the delivered SNG in excess of 2.015% of the 17    average annual inflation-adjusted amounts paid by all gas 18    distribution customers in connection with natural gas 19    service during the 5 years ending May 31, 2010.20        (2) During the first 2 years of operation of the 21    facility:22            (A) to the extent there is an overage amount, the 23        consumer protection reserve account shall be used to 24        provide a credit to reduce the SNG price by an amount 25        equal to the overage amount; and26            (B) to the extent the monthly delivered SNG price   HB2862- 29 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        is less than or equal to the Chicago City-gate price, 2        the utility shall credit the difference between the 3        monthly delivered SNG price and the monthly Chicago 4        City-gate price, if any, to the consumer protection 5        reserve account. Such credit issued pursuant to this 6        paragraph (B) shall be deemed prudent and reasonable 7        and not subject to a Commission prudence review;8        (3) After 2 years of operation of the facility, and 9    monthly, on an on-going basis, thereafter:10            (A) to the extent that the monthly delivered SNG 11        price is less than or equal to the Chicago City-gate 12        price, calculated using the weighted average of the 13        daily Chicago City-gate price on a daily basis over 14        the entire month, the utility shall credit the 15        difference, if any, to the consumer protection reserve 16        account. Such credit issued pursuant to this 17        subparagraph (A) shall be deemed prudent and 18        reasonable and not subject to a Commission prudence 19        review;20            (B) any amounts in the consumer protection reserve 21        account in excess of the consumer protection reserve 22        account principal maximum amount shall be distributed 23        as follows: (i) if retail customers have not realized 24        net consumer savings, calculated by comparing the 25        delivered SNG price to the weighted average of the 26        daily Chicago City-gate price on a daily basis over   HB2862- 30 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        the entire term of the sourcing agreement to date, 2        then 50% of any amounts in the consumer protection 3        reserve account in excess of the consumer protection 4        reserve account principal maximum shall be distributed 5        to the clean coal SNG brownfield facility, with the 6        remaining 50% of any such additional amounts being 7        credited to retail customers, and (ii) if retail 8        customers have realized net consumer savings, then 9        100% of any amounts in the consumer protection reserve 10        account in excess of the consumer protection reserve 11        account principal maximum shall be distributed to the 12        clean coal SNG brownfield facility; provided, however, 13        that under no circumstances shall the total cumulative 14        amount distributed to the clean coal SNG brownfield 15        facility under this subparagraph (B) exceed 16        $150,000,000;17            (C) to the extent there is an overage amount, 18        after distributing the amounts pursuant to 19        subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (3), if any, the 20        consumer protection reserve account shall be used to 21        provide a credit to reduce the SNG price by an amount 22        equal to the overage amount;23            (D) if retail customers have realized net consumer 24        savings, calculated by comparing the delivered SNG 25        price to the weighted average of the daily Chicago 26        City-gate price on a daily basis over the entire term   HB2862- 31 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        of the sourcing agreement to date, then after 2        distributing the amounts pursuant to subparagraphs (B) 3        and (C) of this paragraph (3), 50% of any additional 4        amounts in the consumer protection reserve account in 5        excess of the consumer protection reserve account 6        principal maximum shall be distributed to the clean 7        coal SNG brownfield facility, with the remaining 50% 8        of any such additional amounts being credited to 9        retail customers; provided, however, that if retail 10        customers have not realized such net consumer savings, 11        no such distribution shall be made to the clean coal 12        SNG brownfield facility, and 100% of such additional 13        amounts shall be credited to the retail customers to 14        the extent the consumer protection reserve account 15        exceeds the consumer protection reserve account 16        principal maximum amount.17        (4) Fifty percent of all additional net revenue, 18    defined as miscellaneous net revenue after cost allowance 19    for costs associated with additional net revenue that are 20    not otherwise recoverable pursuant to subsection (h-3) of 21    this Section, including net revenue from sales of 22    substitute natural gas derived from the facility above the 23    nameplate capacity of the facility and other by-products 24    produced by the facility, shall be credited to the 25    consumer protection reserve account.26        (5) At the conclusion of the term of the sourcing   HB2862- 32 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    agreement, to the extent retail customers have not saved 2    the minimum of $100,000,000 in consumer savings as 3    guaranteed in this subsection (h-2), amounts in the 4    consumer protection reserve account shall be credited to 5    retail customers to the extent the retail customers have 6    saved the minimum of $100,000,000; 50% of any additional 7    amounts in the consumer protection reserve account shall 8    be distributed to the company, and the remaining 50% shall 9    be distributed to retail customers.10        (6) If, at the conclusion of the term of the sourcing 11    agreement, the customers have not saved the minimum 12    $100,000,000 in savings as guaranteed in this subsection 13    (h-2) and the consumer protection reserve account has been 14    depleted, then the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 15    shall be liable for any remaining amount owed to the 16    retail customers to the extent that the customers are 17    provided with the $100,000,000 in savings as guaranteed in 18    this subsection (h-2). The retail customers shall have 19    first priority in recovering that debt above any 20    creditors, except the original senior secured lender to 21    the extent that the original senior secured lender has any 22    senior secured debt outstanding, including any clean coal 23    SNG brownfield facility parent companies or affiliates.24        (7) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility, the 25    utilities, and the trustee shall work together to take 26    commercially reasonable steps to minimize the tax impact   HB2862- 33 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    of these transactions, while preserving the consumer 2    benefits.3        (8) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall each 4    month, starting in the facility's first year of commercial 5    operation, file with the Commission, in such form as the 6    Commission shall require, a report as to the consumer 7    protection reserve account. The monthly report must 8    contain the following information:9            (A) the extent the monthly delivered SNG price is 10        greater than, less than, or equal to the Chicago 11        City-gate price;12            (B) the amount credited or debited to the consumer 13        protection reserve account during the month;14            (C) the amounts credited to consumers and 15        distributed to the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 16        during the month;17            (D) the total amount of the consumer protection 18        reserve account at the beginning and end of the month;19            (E) the total amount of consumer savings to date;20            (F) a confidential summary of the inputs used to 21        calculate the additional net revenue; and22            (G) any other additional information the 23        Commission shall require. 24        When any report is erroneous or defective or appears 25    to the Commission to be erroneous or defective, the 26    Commission may notify the clean coal SNG brownfield   HB2862- 34 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    facility to amend the report within 30 days, and, before 2    or after the termination of the 30-day period, the 3    Commission may examine the trustee of the consumer 4    protection reserve account or the officers, agents, 5    employees, books, records, or accounts of the clean coal 6    SNG brownfield facility and correct such items in the 7    report as upon such examination the Commission may find 8    defective or erroneous. All reports shall be under oath.9        All reports made to the Commission by the clean coal 10    SNG brownfield facility and the contents of the reports 11    shall be open to public inspection and shall be deemed a 12    public record under the Freedom of Information Act. Such 13    reports shall be preserved in the office of the 14    Commission. The Commission shall publish an annual summary 15    of the reports prior to February 1 of the following year. 16    The annual summary shall be made available to the public 17    on the Commission's website and shall be submitted to the 18    General Assembly.19        Any facility that fails to file a report required 20    under this paragraph (8) to the Commission within the time 21    specified or to make specific answer to any question 22    propounded by the Commission within 30 days from the time 23    it is lawfully required to do so, or within such further 24    time not to exceed 90 days as may in its discretion be 25    allowed by the Commission, shall pay a penalty of $500 to 26    the Commission for each day it is in default.  HB2862- 35 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        Any person who willfully makes any false report to the 2    Commission or to any member, officer, or employee thereof, 3    any person who willfully in a report withholds or fails to 4    provide material information to which the Commission is 5    entitled under this paragraph (8) and which information is 6    either required to be filed by statute, rule, regulation, 7    order, or decision of the Commission or has been requested 8    by the Commission, and any person who willfully aids or 9    abets such person shall be guilty of a Class A 10    misdemeanor.11    (h-3) Recoverable costs and revenue by the clean coal SNG 12brownfield facility.13        (1) A capital recovery charge approved by the 14    Commission shall be recoverable by the clean coal SNG 15    brownfield facility under a sourcing agreement. The 16    capital recovery charge shall be comprised of capital 17    costs and a reasonable rate of return. "Capital costs" 18    means costs to be incurred in connection with the 19    construction and development of a facility, as defined in 20    Section 1-10 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, and such 21    other costs as the Capital Development Board deems 22    appropriate to be recovered in the capital recovery 23    charge.24            (A) Capital costs. The Capital Development Board 25        shall calculate a range of capital costs that it 26        believes would be reasonable for the clean coal SNG   HB2862- 36 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        brownfield facility to recover under the sourcing 2        agreement. In making this determination, the Capital 3        Development Board shall review the facility cost 4        report, if any, of the clean coal SNG brownfield 5        facility, adjusting the results based on the change in 6        the Annual Consumer Price Index for All Urban 7        Consumers for the Midwest Region as published in April 8        by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of 9        Labor Statistics, the final draft of the sourcing 10        agreement, and the rate of return approved by the 11        Commission. In addition, the Capital Development Board 12        may consult as much as it deems necessary with the 13        clean coal SNG brownfield facility and conduct 14        whatever research and investigation it deems 15        necessary.16            The Capital Development Board shall retain an 17        engineering expert to assist in determining both the 18        range of capital costs and the range of operations and 19        maintenance costs that it believes would be reasonable 20        for the clean coal SNG brownfield facility to recover 21        under the sourcing agreement. Provided, however, that 22        such expert shall: (i) not have been involved in the 23        clean coal SNG brownfield facility's facility cost 24        report, if any, (ii) not own or control any direct or 25        indirect interest in the initial clean coal facility, 26        and (iii) have no contractual relationship with the   HB2862- 37 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        clean coal SNG brownfield facility. In order to 2        qualify as an independent expert, a person or company 3        must have:4                (i) direct previous experience conducting 5            front-end engineering and design studies for 6            large-scale energy facilities and administering 7            large-scale energy operations and maintenance 8            contracts, which may be particularized to the 9            specific type of financing associated with the 10            clean coal SNG brownfield facility;11                (ii) an advanced degree in economics, 12            mathematics, engineering, or a related area of 13            study;14                (iii) ten years of experience in the energy 15            sector, including construction and risk management 16            experience;17                (iv) expertise in assisting companies with 18            obtaining financing for large-scale energy 19            projects, which may be particularized to the 20            specific type of financing associated with the 21            clean coal SNG brownfield facility;22                (v) expertise in operations and maintenance 23            which may be particularized to the specific type 24            of operations and maintenance associated with the 25            clean coal SNG brownfield facility;26                (vi) expertise in credit and contract   HB2862- 38 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1            protocols;2                (vii) adequate resources to perform and 3            fulfill the required functions and 4            responsibilities; and5                (viii) the absence of a conflict of interest 6            and inappropriate bias for or against an affected 7            gas utility or the clean coal SNG brownfield 8            facility.9            The clean coal SNG brownfield facility and the 10        Illinois Power Agency shall cooperate with the Capital 11        Development Board in any investigation it deems 12        necessary. The Capital Development Board shall make 13        its final determination of the range of capital costs 14        confidentially and shall submit that range to the 15        Commission in a confidential filing within 120 days 16        after July 13, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 17        97-096). The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall 18        submit to the Commission its estimate of the capital 19        costs to be recovered under the sourcing agreement. 20        Only after the clean coal SNG brownfield facility has 21        submitted this estimate shall the Commission publicly 22        announce the range of capital costs submitted by the 23        Capital Development Board.24            In the event that the estimate submitted by the 25        clean coal SNG brownfield facility is within or below 26        the range submitted by the Capital Development Board,   HB2862- 39 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        the clean coal SNG brownfield facility's estimate 2        shall be approved by the Commission as the amount of 3        capital costs to be recovered under the sourcing 4        agreement. In the event that the estimate submitted by 5        the clean coal SNG brownfield facility is above the 6        range submitted by the Capital Development Board, the 7        amount of capital costs at the lowest end of the range 8        submitted by the Capital Development Board shall be 9        approved by the Commission as the amount of capital 10        costs to be recovered under the sourcing agreement. 11        Within 15 days after the Capital Development Board has 12        submitted its range and the clean coal SNG brownfield 13        facility has submitted its estimate, the Commission 14        shall approve the capital costs for the clean coal SNG 15        brownfield facility.16            The Capital Development Board shall monitor the 17        construction of the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 18        for the full duration of construction to assess 19        potential cost overruns. The Capital Development 20        Board, in its discretion, may retain an expert to 21        facilitate such monitoring. The clean coal SNG 22        brownfield facility shall pay a reasonable fee as 23        required by the Capital Development Board for the 24        Capital Development Board's services under this 25        subsection (h-3) to be deposited into the Capital 26        Development Board Revolving Fund, and such fee shall   HB2862- 40 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        not be passed through to a utility or its customers. If 2        an expert is retained by the Capital Development Board 3        for monitoring of construction, then the clean coal 4        SNG brownfield facility must pay for the expert's 5        reasonable fees and such costs shall not be passed 6        through to a utility or its customers.7            (B) Rate of Return. No later than 30 days after the 8        date on which the Illinois Power Agency submits a 9        final draft sourcing agreement, the Commission shall 10        hold a public hearing to determine the rate of return 11        to be recovered under the sourcing agreement. Rate of 12        return shall be comprised of the clean coal SNG 13        brownfield facility's actual cost of debt, including 14        mortgage-style amortization, and a reasonable return 15        on equity. The Commission shall post notice of the 16        hearing on its website no later than 10 days prior to 17        the date of the hearing. The Commission shall provide 18        the public and all interested parties, including the 19        gas utilities, the Attorney General, and the Illinois 20        Power Agency, an opportunity to be heard.21            In determining the return on equity, the 22        Commission shall select a commercially reasonable 23        return on equity taking into account the return on 24        equity being received by developers of similar 25        facilities in or outside of Illinois, the need to 26        balance an incentive for clean-coal technology with   HB2862- 41 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        the need to protect ratepayers from high gas prices, 2        the risks being borne by the clean coal SNG brownfield 3        facility in the final draft sourcing agreement, and 4        any other information that the Commission may deem 5        relevant. The Commission may establish a return on 6        equity that varies with the amount of savings, if any, 7        to customers during the term of the sourcing 8        agreement, comparing the delivered SNG price to a 9        daily weighted average price of natural gas, based 10        upon an index. The Illinois Power Agency shall 11        recommend a return on equity to the Commission using 12        the same criteria. Within 60 days after receiving the 13        final draft sourcing agreement from the Illinois Power 14        Agency, the Commission shall approve the rate of 15        return for the clean coal brownfield facility. Within 16        30 days after obtaining debt financing for the clean 17        coal SNG brownfield facility, the clean coal SNG 18        brownfield facility shall file a notice with the 19        Commission identifying the actual cost of debt.20        (2) Operations and maintenance costs approved by the 21    Commission shall be recoverable by the clean coal SNG 22    brownfield facility under the sourcing agreement. The 23    operations and maintenance costs mean costs that have been 24    incurred for the administration, supervision, operation, 25    maintenance, preservation, and protection of the clean 26    coal SNG brownfield facility's physical plant.  HB2862- 42 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        The Capital Development Board shall calculate a range 2    of operations and maintenance costs that it believes would 3    be reasonable for the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 4    to recover under the sourcing agreement, incorporating an 5    inflation index or combination of inflation indices to 6    most accurately reflect the actual costs of operating the 7    clean coal SNG brownfield facility. In making this 8    determination, the Capital Development Board shall review 9    the facility cost report, if any, of the clean coal SNG 10    brownfield facility, adjusting the results for inflation 11    based on the change in the Annual Consumer Price Index for 12    All Urban Consumers for the Midwest Region as published in 13    April by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of 14    Labor Statistics, the final draft of the sourcing 15    agreement, and the rate of return approved by the 16    Commission. In addition, the Capital Development Board may 17    consult as much as it deems necessary with the clean coal 18    SNG brownfield facility and conduct whatever research and 19    investigation it deems necessary. As set forth in 20    subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of this subsection 21    (h-3), the Capital Development Board shall retain an 22    independent engineering expert to assist in determining 23    both the range of operations and maintenance costs that it 24    believes would be reasonable for the clean coal SNG 25    brownfield facility to recover under the sourcing 26    agreement. The clean coal SNG brownfield facility and the   HB2862- 43 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    Illinois Power Agency shall cooperate with the Capital 2    Development Board in any investigation it deems necessary. 3    The Capital Development Board shall make its final 4    determination of the range of operations and maintenance 5    costs confidentially and shall submit that range to the 6    Commission in a confidential filing within 120 days after 7    July 13, 2011.8        The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall submit to 9    the Commission its estimate of the operations and 10    maintenance costs to be recovered under the sourcing 11    agreement. Only after the clean coal SNG brownfield 12    facility has submitted this estimate shall the Commission 13    publicly announce the range of operations and maintenance 14    costs submitted by the Capital Development Board. In the 15    event that the estimate submitted by the clean coal SNG 16    brownfield facility is within or below the range submitted 17    by the Capital Development Board, the clean coal SNG 18    brownfield facility's estimate shall be approved by the 19    Commission as the amount of operations and maintenance 20    costs to be recovered under the sourcing agreement. In the 21    event that the estimate submitted by the clean coal SNG 22    brownfield facility is above the range submitted by the 23    Capital Development Board, the amount of operations and 24    maintenance costs at the lowest end of the range submitted 25    by the Capital Development Board shall be approved by the 26    Commission as the amount of operations and maintenance   HB2862- 44 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    costs to be recovered under the sourcing agreement. Within 2    15 days after the Capital Development Board has submitted 3    its range and the clean coal SNG brownfield facility has 4    submitted its estimate, the Commission shall approve the 5    operations and maintenance costs for the clean coal SNG 6    brownfield facility.7        The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall pay for 8    the independent engineering expert's reasonable fees and 9    such costs shall not be passed through to a utility or its 10    customers. The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall 11    pay a reasonable fee as required by the Capital 12    Development Board for the Capital Development Board's 13    services under this subsection (h-3) to be deposited into 14    the Capital Development Board Revolving Fund, and such fee 15    shall not be passed through to a utility or its customers.16        (3) Sequestration costs approved by the Commission 17    shall be recoverable by the clean coal SNG brownfield 18    facility. "Sequestration costs" means costs to be incurred 19    by the clean coal SNG brownfield facility in accordance 20    with its Commission-approved carbon capture and 21    sequestration plan to:22            (A) capture carbon dioxide;23            (B) build, operate, and maintain a sequestration 24        site in which carbon dioxide may be injected;25            (C) build, operate, and maintain a carbon dioxide 26        pipeline; and  HB2862- 45 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1            (D) transport the carbon dioxide to the 2        sequestration site or a pipeline.3        The Commission shall assess the prudency of the 4    sequestration costs for the clean coal SNG brownfield 5    facility before construction commences at the 6    sequestration site or pipeline. Any revenues the clean 7    coal SNG brownfield facility receives as a result of the 8    capture, transportation, or sequestration of carbon 9    dioxide shall be first credited against all sequestration 10    costs, with the positive balance, if any, treated as 11    additional net revenue.12        The Commission may, in its discretion, retain an 13    expert to assist in its review of sequestration costs. The 14    clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall pay for the 15    expert's reasonable fees if an expert is retained by the 16    Commission, and such costs shall not be passed through to 17    a utility or its customers. Once made, the Commission's 18    determination of the amount of recoverable sequestration 19    costs shall not be increased unless the clean coal SNG 20    brownfield facility can show by clear and convincing 21    evidence that (i) the costs were not reasonably 22    foreseeable; (ii) the costs were due to circumstances 23    beyond the clean coal SNG brownfield facility's control; 24    and (iii) the clean coal SNG brownfield facility took all 25    reasonable steps to mitigate the costs. If the Commission 26    determines that sequestration costs may be increased, the   HB2862- 46 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    Commission shall provide for notice and a public hearing 2    for approval of the increased sequestration costs.3        (4) Actual delivered and processed fuel costs shall be 4    set by the Illinois Power Agency through a SNG feedstock 5    procurement, pursuant to Sections 1-20, 1-77, and 1-78 of 6    the Illinois Power Agency Act, to be performed at least 7    every 5 years and purchased by the clean coal SNG 8    brownfield facility pursuant to feedstock procurement 9    contracts developed by the Illinois Power Agency, with 10    coal comprising at least 50% of the total feedstock over 11    the term of the sourcing agreement and petroleum coke 12    comprising the remainder of the SNG feedstock. If the 13    Commission fails to approve a feedstock procurement plan 14    or fails to approve the results of a feedstock procurement 15    event, then the fuel shall be purchased by the company 16    month-by-month on the spot market and those actual 17    delivered and processed fuel costs shall be recoverable 18    under the sourcing agreement. If a supplier defaults under 19    the terms of a procurement contract, then the Illinois 20    Power Agency shall immediately initiate a feedstock 21    procurement process to obtain a replacement supply, and, 22    prior to the conclusion of that process, fuel shall be 23    purchased by the company month-by-month on the spot market 24    and those actual delivered and processed fuel costs shall 25    be recoverable under the sourcing agreement.26        (5) Taxes and fees imposed by the federal government,   HB2862- 47 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    the State, or any unit of local government applicable to 2    the clean coal SNG brownfield facility, excluding income 3    tax, shall be recoverable by the clean coal SNG brownfield 4    facility under the sourcing agreement to the extent such 5    taxes and fees were not applicable to the facility on July 6    13, 2011.7        (6) The actual transportation costs, in accordance 8    with the applicable utility's tariffs, and third-party 9    marketer costs incurred by the company, if any, associated 10    with transporting the SNG from the clean coal SNG 11    brownfield facility to the Chicago City-gate to sell such 12    SNG into the natural gas markets shall be recoverable 13    under the sourcing agreement.14        (7) Unless otherwise provided, within 30 days after a 15    decision of the Commission on recoverable costs under this 16    Section, any interested party to the Commission's decision 17    may apply for a rehearing with respect to the decision. 18    The Commission shall receive and consider the application 19    for rehearing and shall grant or deny the application in 20    whole or in part within 20 days after the date of the 21    receipt of the application by the Commission. If no 22    rehearing is applied for within the required 30 days or an 23    application for rehearing is denied, then the Commission 24    decision shall be final. If an application for rehearing 25    is granted, then the Commission shall hold a rehearing 26    within 30 days after granting the application. The   HB2862- 48 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    decision of the Commission upon rehearing shall be final.2        Any person affected by a decision of the Commission 3    under this subsection (h-3) may have the decision reviewed 4    only under and in accordance with the Administrative 5    Review Law. Unless otherwise provided, the provisions of 6    the Administrative Review Law, all amendments and 7    modifications to that Law, and the rules adopted pursuant 8    to that Law shall apply to and govern all proceedings for 9    the judicial review of final administrative decisions of 10    the Commission under this subsection (h-3). The term 11    "administrative decision" is defined as in Section 3-101 12    of the Code of Civil Procedure.13        (8) The Capital Development Board shall adopt and make 14    public a policy detailing the process for retaining 15    experts under this Section. Any experts retained to assist 16    with calculating the range of capital costs or operations 17    and maintenance costs shall be retained no later than 45 18    days after July 13, 2011. 19    (h-4) No later than 90 days after the Illinois Power 20Agency submits the final draft sourcing agreement pursuant to 21subsection (h-1), the Commission shall approve a sourcing 22agreement containing (i) the capital costs, rate of return, 23and operations and maintenance costs established pursuant to 24subsection (h-3) and (ii) all other terms and conditions, 25rights, provisions, exceptions, and limitations contained in 26the final draft sourcing agreement; provided, however, the   HB2862- 49 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1Commission shall correct typographical and scrivener's errors 2and modify the contract only as necessary to provide that the 3gas utility does not have the right to terminate the sourcing 4agreement due to any future events that may occur other than 5the clean coal SNG brownfield facility's failure to timely 6meet milestones, uncured default, extended force majeure, or 7abandonment. Once the sourcing agreement is approved, then the 8gas utility subject to that sourcing agreement shall have 45 9days after the date of the Commission's approval to enter into 10the sourcing agreement.11    (h-5) Sequestration enforcement.12        (A) All contracts entered into under subsection (h) of 13    this Section and all sourcing agreements under subsection 14    (h-1) of this Section, regardless of duration, shall 15    require the owner of any facility supplying SNG under the 16    contract or sourcing agreement to provide certified 17    documentation to the Commission each year, starting in the 18    facility's first year of commercial operation, accurately 19    reporting the quantity of carbon dioxide emissions from 20    the facility that have been captured and sequestered and 21    reporting any quantities of carbon dioxide released from 22    the site or sites at which carbon dioxide emissions were 23    sequestered in prior years, based on continuous monitoring 24    of those sites.25        (B) If, in any year, the owner of the clean coal SNG 26    facility fails to demonstrate that the SNG facility   HB2862- 50 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    captured and sequestered at least 90% of the total carbon 2    dioxide emissions that the facility would otherwise emit 3    or that sequestration of emissions from prior years has 4    failed, resulting in the release of carbon dioxide into 5    the atmosphere, then the owner of the clean coal SNG 6    facility must pay a penalty of $20 per ton of excess carbon 7    dioxide emissions not to exceed $40,000,000, in any given 8    year which shall be deposited into the Energy Efficiency 9    Trust Fund and distributed pursuant to subsection (b) of 10    Section 6-6 of the Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, 11    and Coal Resources Development Law of 1997. On or before 12    the 5-year anniversary of the execution of the contract 13    and every 5 years thereafter, an expert hired by the owner 14    of the facility with the approval of the Attorney General 15    shall conduct an analysis to determine the cost of 16    sequestration of at least 90% of the total carbon dioxide 17    emissions the plant would otherwise emit. If the analysis 18    shows that the actual annual cost is greater than the 19    penalty, then the penalty shall be increased to equal the 20    actual cost. Provided, however, to the extent that the 21    owner of the facility described in subsection (h) of this 22    Section can demonstrate that the failure was as a result 23    of acts of God (including fire, flood, earthquake, 24    tornado, lightning, hurricane, or other natural disaster); 25    any amendment, modification, or abrogation of any 26    applicable law or regulation that would prevent   HB2862- 51 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    performance; war; invasion; act of foreign enemies; 2    hostilities (regardless of whether war is declared); civil 3    war; rebellion; revolution; insurrection; military or 4    usurped power or confiscation; terrorist activities; civil 5    disturbance; riots; nationalization; sabotage; blockage; 6    or embargo, the owner of the facility described in 7    subsection (h) of this Section shall not be subject to a 8    penalty if and only if (i) it promptly provides notice of 9    its failure to the Commission; (ii) as soon as practicable 10    and consistent with any order or direction from the 11    Commission, it submits to the Commission proposed 12    modifications to its carbon capture and sequestration 13    plan; and (iii) it carries out its proposed modifications 14    in the manner and time directed by the Commission.15        If the Commission finds that the facility has not 16    satisfied each of these requirements, then the facility 17    shall be subject to the penalty. If the owner of the clean 18    coal SNG facility captured and sequestered more than 90% 19    of the total carbon dioxide emissions that the facility 20    would otherwise emit, then the owner of the facility may 21    credit such additional amounts to reduce the amount of any 22    future penalty to be paid. The penalty resulting from the 23    failure to capture and sequester at least the minimum 24    amount of carbon dioxide shall not be passed on to a 25    utility or its customers.26        If the clean coal SNG facility fails to meet the   HB2862- 52 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    requirements specified in this subsection (h-5), then the 2    Attorney General, on behalf of the People of the State of 3    Illinois, shall bring an action to enforce the obligations 4    related to the facility set forth in this subsection 5    (h-5), including any penalty payments owed, but not 6    including the physical obligation to capture and sequester 7    at least 90% of the total carbon dioxide emissions that 8    the facility would otherwise emit. Such action may be 9    filed in any circuit court in Illinois. By entering into a 10    contract pursuant to subsection (h) of this Section, the 11    clean coal SNG facility agrees to waive any objections to 12    venue or to the jurisdiction of the court with regard to 13    the Attorney General's action under this subsection (h-5).14        Compliance with the sequestration requirements and any 15    penalty requirements specified in this subsection (h-5) 16    for the clean coal SNG facility shall be assessed annually 17    by the Commission, which may in its discretion retain an 18    expert to facilitate its assessment. If any expert is 19    retained by the Commission, then the clean coal SNG 20    facility shall pay for the expert's reasonable fees, and 21    such costs shall not be passed through to the utility or 22    its customers.23        In addition, carbon dioxide emission credits received 24    by the clean coal SNG facility in connection with 25    sequestration of carbon dioxide from the facility must be 26    sold in a timely fashion with any revenue, less applicable   HB2862- 53 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    fees and expenses and any expenses required to be paid by 2    facility for carbon dioxide transportation or 3    sequestration, deposited into the reconciliation account 4    within 30 days after receipt of such funds by the owner of 5    the clean coal SNG facility.6        The clean coal SNG facility is prohibited from 7    transporting or sequestering carbon dioxide unless the 8    owner of the carbon dioxide pipeline that transfers the 9    carbon dioxide from the facility and the owner of the 10    sequestration site where the carbon dioxide captured by 11    the facility is stored has acquired all applicable permits 12    under applicable State and federal laws, statutes, rules, 13    or regulations prior to the transfer or sequestration of 14    carbon dioxide. The responsibility for compliance with the 15    sequestration requirements specified in this subsection 16    (h-5) for the clean coal SNG facility shall reside solely 17    with the clean coal SNG facility, regardless of whether 18    the facility has contracted with another party to capture, 19    transport, or sequester carbon dioxide.20        (C) If, in any year, the owner of a clean coal SNG 21    brownfield facility fails to demonstrate that the clean 22    coal SNG brownfield facility captured and sequestered at 23    least 85% of the total carbon dioxide emissions that the 24    facility would otherwise emit, then the owner of the clean 25    coal SNG brownfield facility must pay a penalty of $20 per 26    ton of excess carbon emissions up to $20,000,000, which   HB2862- 54 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    shall be deposited into the Energy Efficiency Trust Fund 2    and distributed pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 6-6 3    of the Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Coal 4    Resources Development Law of 1997. Provided, however, to 5    the extent that the owner of the clean coal SNG brownfield 6    facility can demonstrate that the failure was as a result 7    of acts of God (including fire, flood, earthquake, 8    tornado, lightning, hurricane, or other natural disaster); 9    any amendment, modification, or abrogation of any 10    applicable law or regulation that would prevent 11    performance; war; invasion; act of foreign enemies; 12    hostilities (regardless of whether war is declared); civil 13    war; rebellion; revolution; insurrection; military or 14    usurped power or confiscation; terrorist activities; civil 15    disturbances; riots; nationalization; sabotage; blockage; 16    or embargo, the owner of the clean coal SNG brownfield 17    facility shall not be subject to a penalty if and only if 18    (i) it promptly provides notice of its failure to the 19    Commission; (ii) as soon as practicable and consistent 20    with any order or direction from the Commission, it 21    submits to the Commission proposed modifications to its 22    carbon capture and sequestration plan; and (iii) it 23    carries out its proposed modifications in the manner and 24    time directed by the Commission. If the Commission finds 25    that the facility has not satisfied each of these 26    requirements, then the facility shall be subject to the   HB2862- 55 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    penalty. If the owner of a clean coal SNG brownfield 2    facility demonstrates that the clean coal SNG brownfield 3    facility captured and sequestered more than 85% of the 4    total carbon emissions that the facility would otherwise 5    emit, the owner of the clean coal SNG brownfield facility 6    may credit such additional amounts to reduce the amount of 7    any future penalty to be paid. The penalty resulting from 8    the failure to capture and sequester at least the minimum 9    amount of carbon dioxide shall not be passed on to a 10    utility or its customers.11        In addition to any penalty for the clean coal SNG 12    brownfield facility's failure to capture and sequester at 13    least its minimum sequestration requirement, the Attorney 14    General, on behalf of the People of the State of Illinois, 15    shall bring an action for specific performance of this 16    subsection (h-5). Such action may be filed in any circuit 17    court in Illinois. By entering into a sourcing agreement 18    pursuant to subsection (h-1) of this Section, the clean 19    coal SNG brownfield facility agrees to waive any 20    objections to venue or to the jurisdiction of the court 21    with regard to the Attorney General's action for specific 22    performance under this subsection (h-5).23        Compliance with the sequestration requirements and 24    penalty requirements specified in this subsection (h-5) 25    for the clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall be 26    assessed annually by the Commission, which may in its   HB2862- 56 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    discretion retain an expert to facilitate its assessment. 2    If an expert is retained by the Commission, then the clean 3    coal SNG brownfield facility shall pay for the expert's 4    reasonable fees, and such costs shall not be passed 5    through to a utility or its customers. A SNG facility 6    operating pursuant to this subsection (h-5) shall not 7    forfeit its designation as a clean coal SNG facility or a 8    clean coal SNG brownfield facility if the facility fails 9    to fully comply with the applicable carbon sequestration 10    requirements in any given year, provided the requisite 11    offsets are purchased or requisite penalties are paid.12        Responsibility for compliance with the sequestration 13    requirements specified in this subsection (h-5) for the 14    clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall reside solely 15    with the clean coal SNG brownfield facility regardless of 16    whether the facility has contracted with another party to 17    capture, transport, or sequester carbon dioxide. 18    (h-7) Sequestration permitting, oversight, and 19investigations.20        (1) No clean coal facility or clean coal SNG 21    brownfield facility may transport or sequester carbon 22    dioxide unless the Commission approves the method of 23    carbon dioxide transportation or sequestration. Such 24    approval shall be required regardless of whether the 25    facility has contracted with another to transport or 26    sequester the carbon dioxide. Nothing in this subsection   HB2862- 57 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    (h-7) shall release the owner or operator of a carbon 2    dioxide sequestration site or carbon dioxide pipeline from 3    any other permitting requirements under applicable State 4    and federal laws, statutes, rules, or regulations.5        (2) The Commission shall review carbon dioxide 6    transportation and sequestration methods proposed by a 7    clean coal facility or a clean coal SNG brownfield 8    facility and shall approve those methods it deems 9    reasonable and cost-effective. For purposes of this 10    review, "cost-effective" means a commercially reasonable 11    price for similar carbon dioxide transportation or 12    sequestration techniques. In determining whether 13    sequestration is reasonable and cost-effective, the 14    Commission may consult with the Illinois State Geological 15    Survey and retain third parties to assist in its 16    determination, provided that such third parties shall not 17    own or control any direct or indirect interest in the 18    facility that is proposing the carbon dioxide 19    transportation or the carbon dioxide sequestration method 20    and shall have no contractual relationship with that 21    facility. If a third party is retained by the Commission, 22    then the facility proposing the carbon dioxide 23    transportation or sequestration method shall pay for the 24    expert's reasonable fees, and these costs shall not be 25    passed through to a utility or its customers.26        No later than 6 months prior to the date upon which the   HB2862- 58 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    owner intends to commence construction of a clean coal 2    facility or the clean coal SNG brownfield facility, the 3    owner of the facility shall file with the Commission a 4    carbon dioxide transportation or sequestration plan. The 5    Commission shall hold a public hearing within 30 days 6    after receipt of the facility's carbon dioxide 7    transportation or sequestration plan. The Commission shall 8    post notice of the review on its website upon submission 9    of a carbon dioxide transportation or sequestration method 10    and shall accept written public comments. The Commission 11    shall take the comments into account when making its 12    decision.13        The Commission may not approve a carbon dioxide 14    sequestration method if the owner or operator of the 15    sequestration site has not received (i) an Underground 16    Injection Control permit from the United States 17    Environmental Protection Agency, or from the Illinois 18    Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the 19    Environmental Protection Act; (ii) an Underground 20    Injection Control permit from the Illinois Department of 21    Natural Resources pursuant to the Illinois Oil and Gas 22    Act; or (iii) an Underground Injection Control permit from 23    the United States Environmental Protection Agency or a 24    permit similar to items (i) or (ii) from the state in which 25    the sequestration site is located if the sequestration 26    will take place outside of Illinois. The Commission shall   HB2862- 59 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    approve or deny the carbon dioxide transportation or 2    sequestration method within 90 days after the receipt of 3    all required information.4        (3) At least annually, the Illinois Environmental 5    Protection Agency shall inspect all carbon dioxide 6    sequestration sites in Illinois. The Illinois 7    Environmental Protection Agency may, as often as deemed 8    necessary, monitor and conduct investigations of those 9    sites. The owner or operator of the sequestration site 10    must cooperate with the Illinois Environmental Protection 11    Agency investigations of carbon dioxide sequestration 12    sites.13        If the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency 14    determines at any time a site creates conditions that 15    warrant the issuance of a seal order under Section 34 of 16    the Environmental Protection Act, then the Illinois 17    Environmental Protection Agency shall seal the site 18    pursuant to the Environmental Protection Act. If the 19    Illinois Environmental Protection Agency determines at any 20    time a carbon dioxide sequestration site creates 21    conditions that warrant the institution of a civil action 22    for an injunction under Section 43 of the Environmental 23    Protection Act, then the Illinois Environmental Protection 24    Agency shall request the State's Attorney or the Attorney 25    General institute such action. The Illinois Environmental 26    Protection Agency shall provide notice of any such actions   HB2862- 60 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    as soon as possible on its website. The SNG facility shall 2    incur all reasonable costs associated with any such 3    inspection or monitoring of the sequestration sites, and 4    these costs shall not be recoverable from utilities or 5    their customers.6        (4) (Blank).7    (h-9) The clean coal SNG brownfield facility shall have 8the right to recover prudently incurred increased costs or 9reduced revenue resulting from any new or amendatory 10legislation or other action. The State of Illinois pledges 11that the State will not enact any law or take any action to:12        (1) break, or repeal the authority for, sourcing 13    agreements approved by the Commission and entered into 14    between public utilities and the clean coal SNG brownfield 15    facility;16        (2) deny public utilities full cost recovery for their 17    costs incurred under those sourcing agreements; or18        (3) deny the clean coal SNG brownfield facility full 19    cost and revenue recovery as provided under those sourcing 20    agreements that are recoverable pursuant to subsection 21    (h-3) of this Section.22    These pledges are for the benefit of the parties to those 23sourcing agreements and the issuers and holders of bonds or 24other obligations issued or incurred to finance or refinance 25the clean coal SNG brownfield facility. The clean coal SNG 26brownfield facility is authorized to include and refer to   HB2862- 61 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1these pledges in any financing agreement into which it may 2enter in regard to those sourcing agreements.3    The State of Illinois retains and reserves all other 4rights to enact new or amendatory legislation or take any 5other action, without impairment of the right of the clean 6coal SNG brownfield facility to recover prudently incurred 7increased costs or reduced revenue resulting from the new or 8amendatory legislation or other action, including, but not 9limited to, such legislation or other action that would (i) 10directly or indirectly raise the costs the clean coal SNG 11brownfield facility must incur; (ii) directly or indirectly 12place additional restrictions, regulations, or requirements on 13the clean coal SNG brownfield facility; (iii) prohibit 14sequestration in general or prohibit a specific sequestration 15method or project; or (iv) increase minimum sequestration 16requirements for the clean coal SNG brownfield facility to the 17extent technically feasible. The clean coal SNG brownfield 18facility shall have the right to recover prudently incurred 19increased costs or reduced revenue resulting from the new or 20amendatory legislation or other action as described in this 21subsection (h-9). 22    (h-10) Contract costs for SNG incurred by an Illinois gas 23utility are reasonable and prudent and recoverable through the 24purchased gas adjustment clause and are not subject to review 25or disallowance by the Commission. Contract costs are costs 26incurred by the utility under the terms of a contract that   HB2862- 62 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1incorporates the terms stated in subsection (h) of this 2Section as confirmed in writing by the Illinois Power Agency 3as set forth in subsection (h) of this Section, which 4confirmation shall be deemed conclusive, or as a consequence 5of or condition to its performance under the contract, 6including (i) amounts paid for SNG under the SNG contract and 7(ii) costs of transportation and storage services of SNG 8purchased from interstate pipelines under federally approved 9tariffs. The Illinois gas utility shall initiate a clean coal 10SNG facility rider mechanism that (A) shall be applicable to 11all customers who receive transportation service from the 12utility, (B) shall be designed to have an equal percentage 13impact on the transportation services rates of each class of 14the utility's total customers, and (C) shall accurately 15reflect the net customer savings, if any, and above market 16costs, if any, under the SNG contract. Any contract, the terms 17of which have been confirmed in writing by the Illinois Power 18Agency as set forth in subsection (h) of this Section and the 19performance of the parties under such contract cannot be 20grounds for challenging prudence or cost recovery by the 21utility through the purchased gas adjustment clause, and in 22such cases, the Commission is directed not to consider, and 23has no authority to consider, any attempted challenges. 24    The contracts entered into by Illinois gas utilities 25pursuant to subsection (h) of this Section shall provide that 26the utility retains the right to terminate the contract   HB2862- 63 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1without further obligation or liability to any party if the 2contract has been impaired as a result of any legislative, 3administrative, judicial, or other governmental action that is 4taken that eliminates all or part of the prudence protection 5of this subsection (h-10) or denies the recoverability of all 6or part of the contract costs through the purchased gas 7adjustment clause. Should any Illinois gas utility exercise 8its right under this subsection (h-10) to terminate the 9contract, all contract costs incurred prior to termination are 10and will be deemed reasonable, prudent, and recoverable as and 11when incurred and not subject to review or disallowance by the 12Commission. Any order, issued by the State requiring or 13authorizing the discontinuation of the merchant function, 14defined as the purchase and sale of natural gas by an Illinois 15gas utility for the ultimate consumer in its service territory 16shall include provisions necessary to prevent the impairment 17of the value of any contract hereunder over its full term. 18    (h-11) All costs incurred by an Illinois gas utility in 19procuring SNG from a clean coal SNG brownfield facility 20pursuant to subsection (h-1) or a third-party marketer 21pursuant to subsection (h-1) are reasonable and prudent and 22recoverable through the purchased gas adjustment clause in 23conjunction with a SNG brownfield facility rider mechanism and 24are not subject to review or disallowance by the Commission; 25provided that if a utility is required by law or otherwise 26elects to connect the clean coal SNG brownfield facility to an   HB2862- 64 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1interstate pipeline, then the utility shall be entitled to 2recover pursuant to its tariffs all just and reasonable costs 3that are prudently incurred. Sourcing agreement costs are 4costs incurred by the utility under the terms of a sourcing 5agreement that incorporates the terms stated in subsection 6(h-1) of this Section as approved by the Commission as set 7forth in subsection (h-4) of this Section, which approval 8shall be deemed conclusive, or as a consequence of or 9condition to its performance under the contract, including (i) 10amounts paid for SNG under the SNG contract and (ii) costs of 11transportation and storage services of SNG purchased from 12interstate pipelines under federally approved tariffs. Any 13sourcing agreement, the terms of which have been approved by 14the Commission as set forth in subsection (h-4) of this 15Section, and the performance of the parties under the sourcing 16agreement cannot be grounds for challenging prudence or cost 17recovery by the utility, and in these cases, the Commission is 18directed not to consider, and has no authority to consider, 19any attempted challenges. 20    (h-15) Reconciliation account. The clean coal SNG facility 21shall establish a reconciliation account for the benefit of 22the retail customers of the utilities that have entered into 23contracts with the clean coal SNG facility pursuant to 24subsection (h). The reconciliation account shall be maintained 25and administered by an independent trustee that is mutually 26agreed upon by the owners of the clean coal SNG facility, the   HB2862- 65 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1utilities, and the Commission in an interest-bearing account 2in accordance with the following:3        (1) The clean coal SNG facility shall conduct an 4    analysis annually within 60 days after receiving the 5    necessary cost information, which shall be provided by the 6    gas utility within 6 months after the end of the preceding 7    calendar year, to determine (i) the average annual 8    contract SNG cost, which shall be calculated as the total 9    amount paid for SNG purchased from the clean coal SNG 10    facility over the preceding 12 months, plus the cost to 11    the utility of the required transportation and storage 12    services of SNG, divided by the total number of MMBtus of 13    SNG actually purchased from the clean coal SNG facility in 14    the preceding 12 months under the utility contract; (ii) 15    the average annual natural gas purchase cost, which shall 16    be calculated as the total annual supply costs paid for 17    baseload natural gas (excluding any SNG) purchased by such 18    utility over the preceding 12 months plus the costs of 19    transportation and storage services of such natural gas 20    (excluding such costs for SNG), divided by the total 21    number of MMbtus of baseload natural gas (excluding SNG) 22    actually purchased by the utility during the year; (iii) 23    the cost differential, which shall be the difference 24    between the average annual contract SNG cost and the 25    average annual natural gas purchase cost; and (iv) the 26    revenue share target which shall be the cost differential   HB2862- 66 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    multiplied by the total amount of SNG purchased over the 2    preceding 12 months under such utility contract.3            (A) To the extent the annual average contract SNG 4        cost is less than the annual average natural gas 5        purchase cost, the utility shall credit an amount 6        equal to the revenue share target to the 7        reconciliation account. Such credit payment shall be 8        made monthly starting within 30 days after the 9        completed analysis in this subsection (h-15) and based 10        on collections from all customers via a line item 11        charge in all customer bills designed to have an equal 12        percentage impact on the transportation services of 13        each class of customers. Credit payments made pursuant 14        to this subparagraph (A) shall be deemed prudent and 15        reasonable and not subject to Commission prudence 16        review.17            (B) To the extent the annual average contract SNG 18        cost is greater than the annual average natural gas 19        purchase cost, the reconciliation account shall be 20        used to provide a credit equal to the revenue share 21        target to the utilities to be used to reduce the 22        utility's natural gas costs through the purchased gas 23        adjustment clause. Such payment shall be made within 24        30 days after the completed analysis pursuant to this 25        subsection (h-15), but only to the extent that the 26        reconciliation account has a positive balance.  HB2862- 67 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1        (2) At the conclusion of the term of the SNG contracts 2    pursuant to subsection (h) and the completion of the final 3    annual analysis pursuant to this subsection (h-15), to the 4    extent the facility owes any amount to retail customers, 5    amounts in the account shall be credited to retail 6    customers to the extent the owed amount is repaid; 50% of 7    any additional amount in the reconciliation account shall 8    be distributed to the utilities to be used to reduce the 9    utilities' natural gas costs through the purchase gas 10    adjustment clause with the remaining amount distributed to 11    the clean coal SNG facility. Such payment shall be made 12    within 30 days after the last completed analysis pursuant 13    to this subsection (h-15). If the facility has repaid all 14    owed amounts, if any, to retail customers and has 15    distributed 50% of any additional amount in the account to 16    the utilities, then the owners of the clean coal SNG 17    facility shall have no further obligation to the utility 18    or the retail customers.19        If, at the conclusion of the term of the contracts 20    pursuant to subsection (h) and the completion of the final 21    annual analysis pursuant to this subsection (h-15), the 22    facility owes any amount to retail customers and the 23    account has been depleted, then the clean coal SNG 24    facility shall be liable for any remaining amount owed to 25    the retail customers. The clean coal SNG facility shall 26    market the daily production of SNG and distribute on a   HB2862- 68 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    monthly basis 5% of the amounts collected with respect to 2    such future sales to the utilities in proportion to each 3    utility's SNG contract to be used to reduce the utility's 4    natural gas costs through the purchase gas adjustment 5    clause; such payments to the utility shall continue until 6    either 15 years after the conclusion of the contract or 7    such time as the sum of such payments equals the remaining 8    amount owed to the retail customers at the end of the 9    contract, whichever is earlier. If the debt to the retail 10    customers is not repaid within 15 years after the 11    conclusion of the contract, then the owner of the clean 12    coal SNG facility must sell the facility, and all proceeds 13    from that sale must be used to repay any amount owed to the 14    retail customers under this subsection (h-15).15        The retail customers shall have first priority in 16    recovering that debt above any creditors, except the 17    secured lenders to the extent that the secured lenders 18    have any secured debt outstanding, including any parent 19    companies or affiliates of the clean coal SNG facility.20        (3) 50% of all additional net revenue, defined as 21    miscellaneous net revenue after cost allowance and above 22    the budgeted estimate established for revenue pursuant to 23    subsection (h), including sale of substitute natural gas 24    derived from the clean coal SNG facility above the 25    nameplate capacity of the facility and other by-products 26    produced by the facility, shall be credited to the   HB2862- 69 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1    reconciliation account on an annual basis with such 2    payment made within 30 days after the end of each calendar 3    year during the term of the contract.4        (4) The clean coal SNG facility shall each year, 5    starting in the facility's first year of commercial 6    operation, file with the Commission, in such form as the 7    Commission shall require, a report as to the 8    reconciliation account. The annual report must contain the 9    following information:10            (A) the revenue share target amount;11            (B) the amount credited or debited to the 12        reconciliation account during the year;13            (C) the amount credited to the utilities to be 14        used to reduce the utilities natural gas costs though 15        the purchase gas adjustment clause;16            (D) the total amount of reconciliation account at 17        the beginning and end of the year;18            (E) the total amount of consumer savings to date; 19        and20            (F) any additional information the Commission may 21        require.22    When any report is erroneous or defective or appears to 23the Commission to be erroneous or defective, the Commission 24may notify the clean coal SNG facility to amend the report 25within 30 days; before or after the termination of the 30-day 26period, the Commission may examine the trustee of the   HB2862- 70 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1reconciliation account or the officers, agents, employees, 2books, records, or accounts of the clean coal SNG facility and 3correct such items in the report as upon such examination the 4Commission may find defective or erroneous. All reports shall 5be under oath.6    All reports made to the Commission by the clean coal SNG 7facility and the contents of the reports shall be open to 8public inspection and shall be deemed a public record under 9the Freedom of Information Act. Such reports shall be 10preserved in the office of the Commission. The Commission 11shall publish an annual summary of the reports prior to 12February 1 of the following year. The annual summary shall be 13made available to the public on the Commission's website and 14shall be submitted to the General Assembly.15    Any facility that fails to file the report required under 16this paragraph (4) to the Commission within the time specified 17or to make specific answer to any question propounded by the 18Commission within 30 days after the time it is lawfully 19required to do so, or within such further time not to exceed 90 20days as may be allowed by the Commission in its discretion, 21shall pay a penalty of $500 to the Commission for each day it 22is in default.23    Any person who willfully makes any false report to the 24Commission or to any member, officer, or employee thereof, any 25person who willfully in a report withholds or fails to provide 26material information to which the Commission is entitled under   HB2862- 71 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1this paragraph (4) and which information is either required to 2be filed by statute, rule, regulation, order, or decision of 3the Commission or has been requested by the Commission, and 4any person who willfully aids or abets such person shall be 5guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.6    (h-20) The General Assembly authorizes the Illinois 7Finance Authority to issue bonds to the maximum extent 8permitted to finance coal gasification facilities described in 9this Section, which constitute both "industrial projects" 10under Article 801 of the Illinois Finance Authority Act and 11"clean coal and energy projects" under Sections 825-65 through 12825-75 of the Illinois Finance Authority Act. 13    Administrative costs incurred by the Illinois Finance 14Authority in performance of this subsection (h-20) shall be 15subject to reimbursement by the clean coal SNG facility on 16terms as the Illinois Finance Authority and the clean coal SNG 17facility may agree. The utility and its customers shall have 18no obligation to reimburse the clean coal SNG facility or the 19Illinois Finance Authority for any such costs. 20    (h-25) The State of Illinois pledges that the State may 21not enact any law or take any action to (1) break or repeal the 22authority for SNG purchase contracts entered into between 23public gas utilities and the clean coal SNG facility pursuant 24to subsection (h) of this Section or (2) deny public gas 25utilities their full cost recovery for contract costs, as 26defined in subsection (h-10), that are incurred under such SNG   HB2862- 72 -LRB104 10764 AAS 20844 b1purchase contracts. These pledges are for the benefit of the 2parties to such SNG purchase contracts and the issuers and 3holders of bonds or other obligations issued or incurred to 4finance or refinance the clean coal SNG facility. The 5beneficiaries are authorized to include and refer to these 6pledges in any finance agreement into which they may enter in 7regard to such contracts.8    (h-30) The State of Illinois retains and reserves all 9other rights to enact new or amendatory legislation or take 10any other action, including, but not limited to, such 11legislation or other action that would (1) directly or 12indirectly raise the costs that the clean coal SNG facility 13must incur; (2) directly or indirectly place additional 14restrictions, regulations, or requirements on the clean coal 15SNG facility; (3) prohibit sequestration in general or 16prohibit a specific sequestration method or project; or (4) 17increase minimum sequestration requirements. 18    (i) If a gas utility or an affiliate of a gas utility has 19an ownership interest in any entity that produces or sells 20synthetic natural gas, Article VII of this Act shall apply. 21(Source: P.A. 100-391, eff. 8-25-17.)
