This support may include, but 8is not limited to, fingerprint comparison; forensic 9odontology; nuclear or mitochondrial DNA analysis, or both; 10and forensic anthropology. 11    (f-5) In this subsection, "local, State, and federal 12automated fingerprint identification system databases" 13includes: 14        (1) local criminal history repositories;15        (2) the Illinois State Police Automated Biometric 16    Identification System (ABIS), both criminal and civil, and 17    any successor databases; and18        (3) the Next Generation Integrated Automated 19    Fingerprint Identification System (NGI) and other federal 20    fingerprint databases, including immigration and military 21    databases and the Repository for Individuals of Special 22    Concern (RISC), and any successor databases. 23    It is the responsibility of the submitting agency to 24ensure the following steps are completed in the following 25order:26        (1) Fingerprints from unidentified human remains,   10400SB0024sam001- 21 -LRB104 06956 RTM 25286 a1    including partial prints, if any, shall be submitted for 2    analysis within 7 days of recovery of the remains by the 3    assisting law enforcement agency, medical examiner, or 4    coroner to all local, State, and federal automated 5    fingerprint identification system databases.6        (2) The submitting agency shall ensure fingerprints 7    are appropriately searched for identification purposes.8    If there are no matches in any of the local, State, and 9federal automated fingerprint identification system databases, 10the unidentified fingerprint records shall be uploaded to the 11National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) 12within 60 days after recovery of the remains. If no matches are 13made in the local, State, and federal automated fingerprint 14identification system databases, the submitting agency may 15contact the International Criminal Police Organization 16(INTERPOL) to search through the automated fingerprint 17identification system databases of member countries if remains 18are believed to have an international nexus. If the 19fingerprint analysis does not aid in the identification of the 20remains, then the assisting law enforcement agency, coroner, 21or medical examiner shall cause a dental examination to be 22performed by a forensic odontologist within 45 days of 23recovery of the remains for the purpose of dental charting, 24direct comparison to missing person dental records, and 25uploading to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and 26National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). If   10400SB0024sam001- 22 -LRB104 06956 RTM 25286 a1the fingerprint and dental analysis does not aid in the 2identification of the remains, then blood, tissue, or bone 3samples from the unidentified remains shall be submitted for 4DNA analysis within 90 days of the recovery of the remains to a 5Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) accredited laboratory where 6DNA profiles are entered into the National DNA Index System 7upon completion of testing. In the case of markedly decomposed 8or skeletal remains, a forensic anthropological analysis of 9the remains, authorized by the coroner or medical examiner, 10shall also be performed within 60 days from the recovery and 11preparation of the remains for the analysis. 12     Fingerprints from the unidentified remains, including 13partial prints, shall be submitted to the Illinois State 14Police or other resource for the purpose of attempting to 15identify the deceased. The coroner or medical examiner shall 16cause a dental examination to be performed by a forensic 17odontologist for the purpose of dental charting, comparison to 18missing person records, or both. Tissue samples collected for 19DNA analysis shall be submitted within 30 days of the recovery 20of the remains to a National Missing and Unidentified Persons 21System partner laboratory or other resource where DNA profiles 22are entered into the National DNA Index System upon completion 23of testing. Forensic anthropological analysis of the remains 24shall also be considered. 25    (g) (Blank). 26    (g-2) The medical examiner or coroner shall report the   10400SB0024sam001- 23 -LRB104 06956 RTM 25286 a1unidentified human remains and the location where the remains 2were found to the Illinois State Police within 24 hours of 3discovery and then to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 4within 72 hours of discovery if the remains are not identified 5as mandated by Section 15 of this Act.
