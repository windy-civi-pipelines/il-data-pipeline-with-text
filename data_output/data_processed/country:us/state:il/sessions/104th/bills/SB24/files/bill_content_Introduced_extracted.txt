Unidentified persons or human remains 4identification responsibilities. 5    (a) In this Section, "assisting law enforcement agency" 6means a law enforcement agency with jurisdiction acting under 7the request and direction of the medical examiner or coroner 8to assist with human remains identification. 9    (a-5) If the official with custody of the human remains is 10not a coroner or medical examiner, the official shall 11immediately notify the coroner or medical examiner of the 12county in which the remains were found. The coroner or medical 13examiner shall go to the scene and take charge of the remains.14    (b) Notwithstanding any other action deemed appropriate 15for the handling of the human remains, the assisting law 16enforcement agency, medical examiner, or coroner shall make 17reasonable attempts to promptly identify human remains. This 18does not include historic or prehistoric skeletal remains. 19These actions shall include, but are not limited to, obtaining 20the following when possible: 21        (1) photographs of the human remains (prior to an 22    autopsy); 23        (2) dental and skeletal radiographs X-rays; 24        (3) photographs of items found on or with the human 25    remains;   SB0024- 18 -LRB104 06956 RTM 16993 b1        (4) fingerprints from the remains; 2        (5) tissue samples suitable for DNA analysis; 3        (6) (blank); and 4        (7) any other information that may support 5    identification efforts. 6    (c) No medical examiner or coroner or any other person 7shall dispose of, or engage in actions that will materially 8affect the unidentified human remains before the assisting law 9enforcement agency, medical examiner, or coroner obtains items 10essential for human identification efforts listed in 11subsection (b) of this Section. 12    (d) Cremation of unidentified human remains is prohibited. 13    (e) (Blank). 14    (f) The assisting law enforcement agency, medical 15examiner, or coroner shall seek support from appropriate State 16and federal agencies, including National Missing and 17Unidentified Persons System resources to facilitate prompt 18identification of human remains. This support may include, but 19is not limited to, fingerprint comparison; forensic 20odontology; nuclear or mitochondrial DNA analysis, or both; 21and forensic anthropology. 22    (f-5) In this subsection, "local, State, and federal 23automated fingerprint identification system databases" 24includes: 25        (1) local criminal history repositories;26        (2) the Illinois State Police Automated Biometric   SB0024- 19 -LRB104 06956 RTM 16993 b1    Identification System (ABIS), both criminal and civil, and 2    any successor databases; and3        (3) the Next Generation Integrated Automated 4    Fingerprint Identification System (NGI) and other federal 5    fingerprint databases, including immigration and military 6    databases and the Repository for Individuals of Special 7    Concern (RISC), and any successor databases. 8    It is the responsibility of the submitting agency to 9ensure the following steps are completed in the following 10order:11        (1) Fingerprints from unidentified human remains, 12    including partial prints, shall be submitted for analysis 13    within 7 days of recovery of the remains by the assisting 14    law enforcement agency, medical examiner, or coroner to 15    all local, State, and federal automated fingerprint 16    identification system databases.17        (2) The submitting agency shall ensure fingerprints 18    are appropriately searched for identification purposes.19    If there are no matches in any of the local, State, and 20federal automated fingerprint identification system databases, 21the unidentified fingerprint records shall be uploaded to the 22National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) on 23the 30th day after recovery of the remains. If no matches are 24made in the local, State, and federal automated fingerprint 25identification system databases, the submitting agency may 26contact the International Criminal Police Organization   SB0024- 20 -LRB104 06956 RTM 16993 b1(INTERPOL) to search through the automated fingerprint 2identification system databases of member countries if remains 3are believed to have an international nexus. If the 4fingerprint analysis does not aid in the identification of the 5remains, then the assisting law enforcement agency, coroner, 6or medical examiner shall cause a dental examination to be 7performed by a forensic odontologist within 45 days of 8recovery of the remains for the purpose of dental charting, 9direct comparison to missing person dental records, and 10uploading to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and 11National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). If 12the fingerprint and dental analysis does not aid in the 13identification of the remains, then blood, tissue, or bone 14samples from the unidentified remains shall be submitted for 15DNA analysis within 90 days of the recovery of the remains to a 16National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) 17partner laboratory or other accredited laboratory where DNA 18profiles are entered into the National DNA Index System upon 19completion of testing. In the case of markedly decomposed or 20skeletal remains, a forensic anthropological analysis of the 21remains shall also be performed within 30 days from the 22recovery of the remains. 23     Fingerprints from the unidentified remains, including 24partial prints, shall be submitted to the Illinois State 25Police or other resource for the purpose of attempting to 26identify the deceased. The coroner or medical examiner shall   SB0024- 21 -LRB104 06956 RTM 16993 b1cause a dental examination to be performed by a forensic 2odontologist for the purpose of dental charting, comparison to 3missing person records, or both. Tissue samples collected for 4DNA analysis shall be submitted within 30 days of the recovery 5of the remains to a National Missing and Unidentified Persons 6System partner laboratory or other resource where DNA profiles 7are entered into the National DNA Index System upon completion 8of testing. Forensic anthropological analysis of the remains 9shall also be considered. 10    (g) (Blank). 11    (g-2) The medical examiner or coroner shall report the 12unidentified human remains and the location where the remains 13were found to the Illinois State Police within 24 hours of 14discovery and then to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 15within 72 hours of discovery if the remains are not identified 16as mandated by Section 15 of this Act. The assisting law 17enforcement agency, medical examiner, or coroner shall contact 18the Illinois State Police to request the creation of a 19National Crime Information Center Unidentified Person record 20within 5 days of the discovery of the remains.

A National Crime Information Center Unidentified 9Person record shall remain on file indefinitely or until 10action is taken by the originating agency to clear or cancel 11the record. The assisting law enforcement agency, medical 12examiner, or coroner shall notify the Illinois State Police of 13necessary record modifications or cancellation if 14identification is made. 15    (h) (Blank). 16    (h-5) The assisting law enforcement agency, medical 17examiner, or coroner shall create an unidentified person 18record in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System 19prior to the submission of samples and on the 30th day after or 20within 30 days of the discovery of the remains, if no 21identification has been made. The entry shall include all 22available case information, including fingerprint data and 23dental radiographs and charts.

An assisting law enforcement agency, a 8medical examiner, a coroner, or the Illinois State Police may 9not close an unidentified person case until the individual has 10been identified. Law enforcement agencies, medical examiners, 11and coroners shall keep such cases under active investigation 12until the person is identified. Reasons for closing an 13unidentified person case may not include exhaustion of leads 14or termination of the anticipated life span of the missing 15person's next of kin. 16    (j) For historic or prehistoric human skeletal remains 17determined by an anthropologist to be older than 100 years, 18jurisdiction shall be transferred to the Department of Natural 19Resources for further investigation under the Archaeological 20and Paleontological Resources Protection Act. 21(Source: P.A. 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 22102-869, eff. 1-1-23.) 23    (50 ILCS 722/25)24    Sec. 25.
