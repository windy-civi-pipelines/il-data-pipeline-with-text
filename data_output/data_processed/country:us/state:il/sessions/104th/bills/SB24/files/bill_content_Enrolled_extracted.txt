If no matches are 6made in the local, State, and federal automated fingerprint 7identification system databases, the submitting agency may 8contact the International Criminal Police Organization 9(INTERPOL) to search through the automated fingerprint 10identification system databases of member countries if remains 11are believed to have an international nexus. If the 12fingerprint analysis does not aid in the identification of the 13remains, then the assisting law enforcement agency, coroner, 14or medical examiner shall cause a dental examination to be 15performed by a forensic odontologist within 45 days of 16recovery of the remains for the purpose of dental charting, 17direct comparison to missing person dental records, and 18uploading to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) and 19National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs). If 20the fingerprint and dental analysis does not aid in the 21identification of the remains, then blood, tissue, or bone 22samples from the unidentified remains shall be submitted for 23DNA analysis within 90 days of the recovery of the remains to a 24Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) accredited laboratory where 25DNA profiles are entered into the National DNA Index System 26upon completion of testing. In the case of markedly decomposed   SB0024 Enrolled- 22 -LRB104 06956 RTM 16993 b1or skeletal remains, a forensic anthropological analysis of 2the remains, authorized by the coroner or medical examiner, 3shall also be performed within 60 days from the recovery and 4preparation of the remains for the analysis. 5     Fingerprints from the unidentified remains, including 6partial prints, shall be submitted to the Illinois State 7Police or other resource for the purpose of attempting to 8identify the deceased. The coroner or medical examiner shall 9cause a dental examination to be performed by a forensic 10odontologist for the purpose of dental charting, comparison to 11missing person records, or both. Tissue samples collected for 12DNA analysis shall be submitted within 30 days of the recovery 13of the remains to a National Missing and Unidentified Persons 14System partner laboratory or other resource where DNA profiles 15are entered into the National DNA Index System upon completion 16of testing. Forensic anthropological analysis of the remains 17shall also be considered. 18    (g) (Blank). 19    (g-2) The medical examiner or coroner shall report the 20unidentified human remains and the location where the remains 21were found to the Illinois State Police within 24 hours of 22discovery and then to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 23within 72 hours of discovery if the remains are not identified 24as mandated by Section 15 of this Act.
