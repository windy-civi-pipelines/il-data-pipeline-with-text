Findings. The General Assembly finds that, to 5address the increasing mental health and behavioral health 6needs of students in our schools, a new social work associate 7endorsement on an Educator License with Stipulations is needed 8to expand the availability of qualified social workers to work 9within school settings.

The intent of this Act is 15to expand the availability of qualified social workers in our 16schools, not to replace or supplant professional educator 17license holders or to fill professional educator license 18vacancies. This Act is also intended to encourage the holders 19of social work associate endorsements to pursue a Professional 20Educator License with a school support personnel endorsement 21in the area of school social work. 22    Section 10.
