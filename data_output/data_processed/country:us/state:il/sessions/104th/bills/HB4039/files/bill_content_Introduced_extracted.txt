General Provisions 5    Section 1-1. Short title; references to Act. 6    (a) Short title. This Act may be cited as the Holistic 7Overdose Prevention and Equity Act.8    (b) References to Act. This Act may be referred to as the 9HOPE Act. 10    Section 1-5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that:11        (1) The Department of Public Health reported 3,261 12    opioid-related overdose fatalities in 2022, representing 13    an estimated 272 lives lost every month as the State's 14    overdose crisis persists.15        (2) The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office 16    confirmed that 2,000 opioid-related deaths occurred in 17    Cook County during 2022, with Black residents comprising 18    56% of deaths despite only representing 23% of the 19    county's population.20        (3) The Opioid Data Dashboard provided by the 21    Department of Public Health vividly demonstrates the 22    extensive reach of opioid-related overdose across the   HB4039- 2 -LRB104 13076 BDA 25057 b1    State; outside of Cook County, the counties that 2    experience the brunt of fatalities include Will County, 3    Winnebago County, DuPage County, Lake County, Kane County, 4    Madison County, St. Clair County, Sangamon County, McHenry 5    County, and Champaign County.6        (4) Harm reduction measures have been proven to reduce 7    HIV transmissions, among other benefits, including 8    assisting in the prevention against the acquisition of 9    other bloodborne viruses such as Hepatitis B and C, the 10    prevention of fatal overdoses, decrease in encounters with 11    the criminal justice system, reduction in crime, reduction 12    of social exclusion for people who use drugs, and 13    improvement in access to medical care, mental health 14    support, housing, community support, food, and other basic 15    needs.16        (5) Extensive research and reports continue to 17    demonstrate that harm reduction strategies not only save 18    lives by preventing overdose deaths but also limit 19    expenses in response to hospitalizations, emergency calls, 20    and deaths, promote public safety by diverting hazardous 21    waste from public spaces, and do not lead to an increase in 22    crime rates or substance use.23        (6) Harm reduction operates on the understanding that 24    recovery is a multifaceted journey and that harm reduction 25    strategies complement traditional recovery approaches.26        (7) While people who use drugs continue to face social   HB4039- 3 -LRB104 13076 BDA 25057 b1    stigma, they still possess the right to receive access to 2    housing, education, economic mobility, mental health care, 3    and a range of services to support a better quality of 4    life.5        (8) Harm reduction acknowledges the intersecting 6    systems of oppression that marginalize people who use 7    drugs and centers the need for racial, economic, and 8    gender justice within policies and practices.9        (9) Across the State, harm reductionists tirelessly 10    dedicate themselves toward mitigating the harms of 11    substance use and providing critical support to 12    individuals in need, and it is essential to recognize and 13    appreciate the strain and labor undertaken by these 14    individuals as they endure secondary trauma and navigate 15    complex social, economic, and political landscapes.16        (10) Recent reports have highlighted funding and other 17    stresses endured by harm reduction providers, including 18    inadequate and inefficient distribution of opioid 19    settlement funds. 20    Section 1-10.

The General Assembly finds that:11        (1) The Department of Public Health reported 3,261 12    opioid-related overdose fatalities in 2022, representing 13    an estimated 272 lives lost every month as the State's 14    overdose crisis persists.15        (2) The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office 16    confirmed that 2,000 opioid-related deaths occurred in 17    Cook County during 2022, with Black residents comprising 18    56% of deaths despite only representing 23% of the 19    county's population.20        (3) The Opioid Data Dashboard provided by the 21    Department of Public Health vividly demonstrates the 22    extensive reach of opioid-related overdose across the   HB4039- 2 -LRB104 13076 BDA 25057 b1    State; outside of Cook County, the counties that 2    experience the brunt of fatalities include Will County, 3    Winnebago County, DuPage County, Lake County, Kane County, 4    Madison County, St. Clair County, Sangamon County, McHenry 5    County, and Champaign County.6        (4) Harm reduction measures have been proven to reduce 7    HIV transmissions, among other benefits, including 8    assisting in the prevention against the acquisition of 9    other bloodborne viruses such as Hepatitis B and C, the 10    prevention of fatal overdoses, decrease in encounters with 11    the criminal justice system, reduction in crime, reduction 12    of social exclusion for people who use drugs, and 13    improvement in access to medical care, mental health 14    support, housing, community support, food, and other basic 15    needs.16        (5) Extensive research and reports continue to 17    demonstrate that harm reduction strategies not only save 18    lives by preventing overdose deaths but also limit 19    expenses in response to hospitalizations, emergency calls, 20    and deaths, promote public safety by diverting hazardous 21    waste from public spaces, and do not lead to an increase in 22    crime rates or substance use.23        (6) Harm reduction operates on the understanding that 24    recovery is a multifaceted journey and that harm reduction 25    strategies complement traditional recovery approaches.26        (7) While people who use drugs continue to face social   HB4039- 3 -LRB104 13076 BDA 25057 b1    stigma, they still possess the right to receive access to 2    housing, education, economic mobility, mental health care, 3    and a range of services to support a better quality of 4    life.5        (8) Harm reduction acknowledges the intersecting 6    systems of oppression that marginalize people who use 7    drugs and centers the need for racial, economic, and 8    gender justice within policies and practices.9        (9) Across the State, harm reductionists tirelessly 10    dedicate themselves toward mitigating the harms of 11    substance use and providing critical support to 12    individuals in need, and it is essential to recognize and 13    appreciate the strain and labor undertaken by these 14    individuals as they endure secondary trauma and navigate 15    complex social, economic, and political landscapes.16        (10) Recent reports have highlighted funding and other 17    stresses endured by harm reduction providers, including 18    inadequate and inefficient distribution of opioid 19    settlement funds. 20    Section 1-10.
