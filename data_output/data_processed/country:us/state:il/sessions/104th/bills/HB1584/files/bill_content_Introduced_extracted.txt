The Illinois Municipal Code is amended by 5changing Sections 3.1-10-50 and 3.1-10-51 as follows: 6    (65 ILCS 5/3.1-10-50)7    Sec. 3.1-10-50. Events upon which an elective office 8becomes vacant in municipality with population under 500,000. 9    (a) Vacancy by resignation. A resignation is not effective 10unless it is in writing, signed by the person holding the 11elective office, and notarized. 12        (1) Unconditional resignation. An unconditional 13    resignation by a person holding the elective office may 14    specify a future date, not later than 60 days after the 15    date the resignation is received by the officer authorized 16    to fill the vacancy, at which time it becomes operative, 17    but the resignation may not be withdrawn after it is 18    received by the officer authorized to fill the vacancy. 19    The effective date of a resignation that does not specify 20    a future date at which it becomes operative is the date the 21    resignation is received by the officer authorized to fill 22    the vacancy. The effective date of a resignation that has 23    a specified future effective date is that specified future   HB1584- 2 -LRB104 07734 RTM 17779 b1    date or the date the resignation is received by the 2    officer authorized to fill the vacancy, whichever date 3    occurs later.4        (2) Conditional resignation. A resignation that does 5    not become effective unless a specified event occurs can 6    be withdrawn at any time prior to the occurrence of the 7    specified event, but if not withdrawn, the effective date 8    of the resignation is the date of the occurrence of the 9    specified event or the date the resignation is received by 10    the officer authorized to fill the vacancy, whichever date 11    occurs later.12        (3) Vacancy upon the effective date. For the purpose 13    of determining the time period that would require an 14    election to fill the vacancy by resignation or the 15    commencement of the 60-day time period referred to in 16    subsection (e), the resignation of an elected officer is 17    deemed to have created a vacancy as of the effective date 18    of the resignation.19        (4) Duty of the clerk. If a resignation is delivered 20    to the clerk of the municipality, the clerk shall forward 21    a certified copy of the written resignation to the 22    official who is authorized to fill the vacancy within 7 23    business days after receipt of the resignation.24    (b) Vacancy by death or disability. A vacancy occurs in an 25office by reason of the death of the incumbent. The date of the 26death may be established by the date shown on the death   HB1584- 3 -LRB104 07734 RTM 17779 b1certificate. A vacancy occurs in an office by permanent 2physical or mental disability rendering the person incapable 3of performing the duties of the office. The corporate 4authorities have the authority to make the determination 5whether an officer is incapable of performing the duties of 6the office because of a permanent physical or mental 7disability. A finding of mental disability shall not be made 8prior to the appointment by a court of a guardian ad litem for 9the officer or until a duly licensed doctor certifies, in 10writing, that the officer is mentally impaired to the extent 11that the officer is unable to effectively perform the duties 12of the office. If the corporate authorities find that an 13officer is incapable of performing the duties of the office 14due to permanent physical or mental disability, that person is 15removed from the office and the vacancy of the office occurs on 16the date of the determination.17    (c) Vacancy by other causes.18        (1) Abandonment and other causes. A vacancy occurs in 19    an office by reason of abandonment of office; removal from 20    office; or failure to qualify; or more than temporary 21    removal of residence from the municipality; or in the case 22    of an alderperson of a ward or councilman or trustee of a 23    district, more than temporary removal of residence from 24    the ward or district, as the case may be. The corporate 25    authorities have the authority to determine whether a 26    vacancy under this subsection has occurred. If the   HB1584- 4 -LRB104 07734 RTM 17779 b1    corporate authorities determine that a vacancy exists, the 2    office is deemed vacant as of the date of that 3    determination for all purposes including the calculation 4    under subsections (e), (f), and (g).5        (2) Guilty of a criminal offense. An admission of 6    guilt of a criminal offense that upon conviction would 7    disqualify the municipal officer from holding the office, 8    in the form of a written agreement with State or federal 9    prosecutors to plead guilty to a felony, bribery, perjury, 10    or other infamous crime under State or federal law, 11    constitutes a resignation from that office, effective on 12    the date the plea agreement is made. For purposes of this 13    Section, a conviction for an offense that disqualifies a 14    municipal officer from holding that office occurs on the 15    date of the return of a guilty verdict or, in the case of a 16    trial by the court, on the entry of a finding of guilt.17        (3) Election declared void. A vacancy occurs on the 18    date of the decision of a competent tribunal declaring the 19    election of the officer void.20        (4) Owing a debt to the municipality.

The Illinois Municipal Code is amended by 5changing Sections 3.1-10-50 and 3.1-10-51 as follows: 6    (65 ILCS 5/3.1-10-50)7    Sec. 3.1-10-50. Events upon which an elective office 8becomes vacant in municipality with population under 500,000. 9    (a) Vacancy by resignation. A resignation is not effective 10unless it is in writing, signed by the person holding the 11elective office, and notarized. 12        (1) Unconditional resignation. An unconditional 13    resignation by a person holding the elective office may 14    specify a future date, not later than 60 days after the 15    date the resignation is received by the officer authorized 16    to fill the vacancy, at which time it becomes operative, 17    but the resignation may not be withdrawn after it is 18    received by the officer authorized to fill the vacancy. 19    The effective date of a resignation that does not specify 20    a future date at which it becomes operative is the date the 21    resignation is received by the officer authorized to fill 22    the vacancy. The effective date of a resignation that has 23    a specified future effective date is that specified future   HB1584- 2 -LRB104 07734 RTM 17779 b1    date or the date the resignation is received by the 2    officer authorized to fill the vacancy, whichever date 3    occurs later.4        (2) Conditional resignation. A resignation that does 5    not become effective unless a specified event occurs can 6    be withdrawn at any time prior to the occurrence of the 7    specified event, but if not withdrawn, the effective date 8    of the resignation is the date of the occurrence of the 9    specified event or the date the resignation is received by 10    the officer authorized to fill the vacancy, whichever date 11    occurs later.12        (3) Vacancy upon the effective date. For the purpose 13    of determining the time period that would require an 14    election to fill the vacancy by resignation or the 15    commencement of the 60-day time period referred to in 16    subsection (e), the resignation of an elected officer is 17    deemed to have created a vacancy as of the effective date 18    of the resignation.19        (4) Duty of the clerk. If a resignation is delivered 20    to the clerk of the municipality, the clerk shall forward 21    a certified copy of the written resignation to the 22    official who is authorized to fill the vacancy within 7 23    business days after receipt of the resignation.24    (b) Vacancy by death or disability. A vacancy occurs in an 25office by reason of the death of the incumbent. The date of the 26death may be established by the date shown on the death   HB1584- 3 -LRB104 07734 RTM 17779 b1certificate. A vacancy occurs in an office by permanent 2physical or mental disability rendering the person incapable 3of performing the duties of the office. The corporate 4authorities have the authority to make the determination 5whether an officer is incapable of performing the duties of 6the office because of a permanent physical or mental 7disability. A finding of mental disability shall not be made 8prior to the appointment by a court of a guardian ad litem for 9the officer or until a duly licensed doctor certifies, in 10writing, that the officer is mentally impaired to the extent 11that the officer is unable to effectively perform the duties 12of the office. If the corporate authorities find that an 13officer is incapable of performing the duties of the office 14due to permanent physical or mental disability, that person is 15removed from the office and the vacancy of the office occurs on 16the date of the determination.17    (c) Vacancy by other causes.18        (1) Abandonment and other causes. A vacancy occurs in 19    an office by reason of abandonment of office; removal from 20    office; or failure to qualify; or more than temporary 21    removal of residence from the municipality; or in the case 22    of an alderperson of a ward or councilman or trustee of a 23    district, more than temporary removal of residence from 24    the ward or district, as the case may be. The corporate 25    authorities have the authority to determine whether a 26    vacancy under this subsection has occurred. If the   HB1584- 4 -LRB104 07734 RTM 17779 b1    corporate authorities determine that a vacancy exists, the 2    office is deemed vacant as of the date of that 3    determination for all purposes including the calculation 4    under subsections (e), (f), and (g).5        (2) Guilty of a criminal offense. An admission of 6    guilt of a criminal offense that upon conviction would 7    disqualify the municipal officer from holding the office, 8    in the form of a written agreement with State or federal 9    prosecutors to plead guilty to a felony, bribery, perjury, 10    or other infamous crime under State or federal law, 11    constitutes a resignation from that office, effective on 12    the date the plea agreement is made. For purposes of this 13    Section, a conviction for an offense that disqualifies a 14    municipal officer from holding that office occurs on the 15    date of the return of a guilty verdict or, in the case of a 16    trial by the court, on the entry of a finding of guilt.17        (3) Election declared void. A vacancy occurs on the 18    date of the decision of a competent tribunal declaring the 19    election of the officer void.20        (4) Owing a debt to the municipality.
