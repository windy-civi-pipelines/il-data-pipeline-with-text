Instead of requiring the licensee to file an 6amended return, the Department may simply notify the licensee 7of the correction or corrections it has made. Proof of such 8correction by the Department, or of the determination of the 9amount of tax due as provided in Sections 8-4 and 8-10, may be 10made at any hearing before the Department or in any legal 11proceeding by a reproduced copy of the Department's record 12relating thereto in the name of the Department under the 13certificate of the Director of Revenue. Such reproduced copy 14shall, without further proof, be admitted into evidence before 15the Department or in any legal proceeding and shall be prima 16facie proof of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as 17shown therein.
