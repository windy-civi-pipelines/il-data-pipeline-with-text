Findings. The General Assembly finds that: 5        (1) Atherosclerosis occurs when blood flow is reduced 6    because arteries become narrowed or blocked with fatty 7    deposits. 8        (2) Atherosclerosis is responsible for more deaths in 9    the United States than any other condition, and heart 10    attacks resulting from clogged coronary arteries are the 11    leading cause of death in America. 12        (3) Atherosclerosis also occurs in the legs and is 13    known as peripheral artery disease (referred to as "PAD"), 14    and having PAD significantly increases the risk for heart 15    attack, stroke, amputation, and death. 16        (4) While most Americans are aware of atherosclerosis 17    in the heart, many Americans have never heard of PAD and 18    Americans with PAD are often unaware of the serious risks 19    of the disease. 20        (5) An estimated 21,000,000 Americans have PAD, and 21    about 200,000 of them, who are disproportionately 22    minorities, suffer avoidable amputations every year as a 23    result of such disease. 24        (6) Screening and arterial testing for PAD is cost   SB1418- 2 -LRB104 06136 BAB 16169 b1    effective and should be part of routine medical care. 2        (7) Once PAD is detected, amputations and deaths can 3    be reduced through the use of national, evidence-based PAD 4    care guidelines. 5    Section 5.

Napoleon Harris, III SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 5 ILCS 375/6.1155 ILCS 5/5-1069.365 ILCS 5/10-4-2.3105 ILCS 5/10-22.3f215 ILCS 5/356z.80 new215 ILCS 125/5-3  from Ch. 111 1/2, par. 1411.2215 ILCS 130/4003  from Ch. 73, par. 1504-3215 ILCS 165/10  from Ch. 32, par. 604305 ILCS 5/5-16.8    Amends the Illinois Insurance Code. Provides that a group or individual plan of accident and health insurance or managed care plan amended, delivered, issued, or renewed after January 1, 2026 must provide coverage, no less than once every 12 months, for a peripheral artery disease screening test for any at-risk individual. Amends the State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971, the Counties Code, the Illinois Municipal Code, the School Code, the Health Maintenance Organization Act, the Limited Health Service Organization Act, the Voluntary Health Services Plans Act, and the Illinois Public Aid Code to require coverage under those provisions.LRB104 06136 BAB 16169 b  A BILL FOR SB1418LRB104 06136 BAB 16169 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Findings. The General Assembly finds that: 5        (1) Atherosclerosis occurs when blood flow is reduced 6    because arteries become narrowed or blocked with fatty 7    deposits. 8        (2) Atherosclerosis is responsible for more deaths in 9    the United States than any other condition, and heart 10    attacks resulting from clogged coronary arteries are the 11    leading cause of death in America. 12        (3) Atherosclerosis also occurs in the legs and is 13    known as peripheral artery disease (referred to as "PAD"), 14    and having PAD significantly increases the risk for heart 15    attack, stroke, amputation, and death. 16        (4) While most Americans are aware of atherosclerosis 17    in the heart, many Americans have never heard of PAD and 18    Americans with PAD are often unaware of the serious risks 19    of the disease. 20        (5) An estimated 21,000,000 Americans have PAD, and 21    about 200,000 of them, who are disproportionately 22    minorities, suffer avoidable amputations every year as a 23    result of such disease. 24        (6) Screening and arterial testing for PAD is cost   SB1418- 2 -LRB104 06136 BAB 16169 b1    effective and should be part of routine medical care. 2        (7) Once PAD is detected, amputations and deaths can 3    be reduced through the use of national, evidence-based PAD 4    care guidelines. 5    Section 5. The State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971 6is amended by changing Section 6.11 as follows: 7    (5 ILCS 375/6.11)8    Sec. 6.11. Required health benefits; Illinois Insurance 9Code requirements.
