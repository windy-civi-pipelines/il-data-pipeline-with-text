For the taxes which are extended for the 1997 5levy year, the recovered tax increment value for a non-home 6rule taxing district that first became subject to this Law for 7the 1995 levy year because a majority of its 1994 equalized 8assessed value was in an affected county or counties shall be 9increased if a municipality terminated the designation of an 10area in 1993 as a redevelopment project area previously 11established under the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment 12Act in the Illinois Municipal Code, previously established 13under the Industrial Jobs Recovery Law in the Illinois 14Municipal Code, or previously established under the Economic 15Development Area Tax Increment Allocation Act, by an amount 16equal to the 1994 equalized assessed value of each taxable 17lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property in the 18redevelopment project area over and above the initial 19equalized assessed value of each property in the redevelopment 20project area. In the first year after a municipality removes a 21taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property from a 22redevelopment project area established under the Tax Increment 23Allocation Redevelopment Act in the Illinois Municipal Code, 24the Industrial Jobs Recovery Law in the Illinois Municipal 25Code, or the Economic Development Area Tax Increment 26Allocation Act, "recovered tax increment value" means the   HB1497- 20 -LRB104 06528 HLH 16564 b1amount of the current year's equalized assessed value of each 2taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property removed 3from the redevelopment project area over and above the initial 4equalized assessed value of that real property before removal 5from the redevelopment project area. 6    Except as otherwise provided in this Section, "limiting 7rate" means a fraction the numerator of which is the last 8preceding aggregate extension base times an amount equal to 9one plus the extension limitation defined in this Section and 10the denominator of which is the current year's equalized 11assessed value of all real property in the territory under the 12jurisdiction of the taxing district during the prior levy 13year. For those taxing districts that reduced their aggregate 14extension for the last preceding levy year, except for school 15districts that reduced their extension for educational 16purposes pursuant to Section 18-206, the highest aggregate 17extension in any of the last 3 preceding levy years shall be 18used for the purpose of computing the limiting rate. The 19denominator shall not include new property or the recovered 20tax increment value. If a new rate, a rate decrease, or a 21limiting rate increase has been approved at an election held 22after March 21, 2006, then (i) the otherwise applicable 23limiting rate shall be increased by the amount of the new rate 24or shall be reduced by the amount of the rate decrease, as the 25case may be, or (ii) in the case of a limiting rate increase, 26the limiting rate shall be equal to the rate set forth in the   HB1497- 21 -LRB104 06528 HLH 16564 b1proposition approved by the voters for each of the years 2specified in the proposition, after which the limiting rate of 3the taxing district shall be calculated as otherwise provided. 4In the case of a taxing district that obtained referendum 5approval for an increased limiting rate on March 20, 2012, the 6limiting rate for tax year 2012 shall be the rate that 7generates the approximate total amount of taxes extendable for 8that tax year, as set forth in the proposition approved by the 9voters; this rate shall be the final rate applied by the county 10clerk for the aggregate of all capped funds of the district for 11tax year 2012.12(Source: P.A. 102-263, eff. 8-6-21; 102-311, eff. 8-6-21; 13102-519, eff. 8-20-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-707, eff. 144-22-22; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-895, eff. 5-23-22; 15103-154, eff. 6-30-23; 103-587, eff. 5-28-24; 103-591, eff. 167-1-24; 103-592, eff. 6-7-24; revised 7-9-24.) 17    (35 ILCS 200/18-187 new)18    Sec. 18-187.

A taxing district may increase its extension limitation 10for one or more levy years if that taxing district holds a 11referendum before the levy date for the first levy year at 12which a majority of voters voting on the issue approves 13adoption of a higher extension limitation.

For the taxes which are extended for the 1997 5levy year, the recovered tax increment value for a non-home 6rule taxing district that first became subject to this Law for 7the 1995 levy year because a majority of its 1994 equalized 8assessed value was in an affected county or counties shall be 9increased if a municipality terminated the designation of an 10area in 1993 as a redevelopment project area previously 11established under the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment 12Act in the Illinois Municipal Code, previously established 13under the Industrial Jobs Recovery Law in the Illinois 14Municipal Code, or previously established under the Economic 15Development Area Tax Increment Allocation Act, by an amount 16equal to the 1994 equalized assessed value of each taxable 17lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property in the 18redevelopment project area over and above the initial 19equalized assessed value of each property in the redevelopment 20project area. In the first year after a municipality removes a 21taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property from a 22redevelopment project area established under the Tax Increment 23Allocation Redevelopment Act in the Illinois Municipal Code, 24the Industrial Jobs Recovery Law in the Illinois Municipal 25Code, or the Economic Development Area Tax Increment 26Allocation Act, "recovered tax increment value" means the   HB1497- 20 -LRB104 06528 HLH 16564 b1amount of the current year's equalized assessed value of each 2taxable lot, block, tract, or parcel of real property removed 3from the redevelopment project area over and above the initial 4equalized assessed value of that real property before removal 5from the redevelopment project area. 6    Except as otherwise provided in this Section, "limiting 7rate" means a fraction the numerator of which is the last 8preceding aggregate extension base times an amount equal to 9one plus the extension limitation defined in this Section and 10the denominator of which is the current year's equalized 11assessed value of all real property in the territory under the 12jurisdiction of the taxing district during the prior levy 13year. For those taxing districts that reduced their aggregate 14extension for the last preceding levy year, except for school 15districts that reduced their extension for educational 16purposes pursuant to Section 18-206, the highest aggregate 17extension in any of the last 3 preceding levy years shall be 18used for the purpose of computing the limiting rate. The 19denominator shall not include new property or the recovered 20tax increment value. If a new rate, a rate decrease, or a 21limiting rate increase has been approved at an election held 22after March 21, 2006, then (i) the otherwise applicable 23limiting rate shall be increased by the amount of the new rate 24or shall be reduced by the amount of the rate decrease, as the 25case may be, or (ii) in the case of a limiting rate increase, 26the limiting rate shall be equal to the rate set forth in the   HB1497- 21 -LRB104 06528 HLH 16564 b1proposition approved by the voters for each of the years 2specified in the proposition, after which the limiting rate of 3the taxing district shall be calculated as otherwise provided. 4In the case of a taxing district that obtained referendum 5approval for an increased limiting rate on March 20, 2012, the 6limiting rate for tax year 2012 shall be the rate that 7generates the approximate total amount of taxes extendable for 8that tax year, as set forth in the proposition approved by the 9voters; this rate shall be the final rate applied by the county 10clerk for the aggregate of all capped funds of the district for 11tax year 2012.12(Source: P.A. 102-263, eff. 8-6-21; 102-311, eff. 8-6-21; 13102-519, eff. 8-20-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-707, eff. 144-22-22; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-895, eff. 5-23-22; 15103-154, eff. 6-30-23; 103-587, eff. 5-28-24; 103-591, eff. 167-1-24; 103-592, eff. 6-7-24; revised 7-9-24.) 17    (35 ILCS 200/18-187 new)18    Sec. 18-187.
