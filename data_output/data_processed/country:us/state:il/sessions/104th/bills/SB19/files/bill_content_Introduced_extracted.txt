If the victim or 11        the victim's attorney was not allowed to be heard at 12        the hearing regarding the prosecuting attorney's 13        motion, and the court denies the prosecuting 14        attorney's assertion of the right or denies the 15        request for enforcement of a right, the victim or 16        victim's attorney may file a motion to assert the 17        victim's right or to request enforcement of the right 18        within 10 days of the court's ruling. The motion need 19        not demonstrate the grounds for a motion for 20        reconsideration. The court shall rule on the merits of 21        the motion.22            (D) The court shall take up and decide any motion 23        or request asserting or seeking enforcement of a 24        victim's right without delay, unless a specific time 25        period is specified by law or court rule. The reasons 26        for any decision denying the motion or request shall   SB0019- 14 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        be clearly stated on the record.2            (E) No later than January 1, 2023, the Office of 3        the Attorney General shall: 4                (i) designate an administrative authority 5            within the Office of the Attorney General to 6            receive and investigate complaints relating to the 7            provision or violation of the rights of a crime 8            victim as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 9            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act;10                (ii) create and administer a course of 11            training for employees and offices of the State of 12            Illinois that fail to comply with provisions of 13            Illinois law pertaining to the treatment of crime 14            victims as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 15            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act as 16            required by the court under Section 5 of this Act; 17            and18                (iii) have the authority to make 19            recommendations to employees and offices of the 20            State of Illinois to respond more effectively to 21            the needs of crime victims, including regarding 22            the violation of the rights of a crime victim.23            (F) Crime victims' rights may also be asserted by 24        filing a complaint for mandamus, injunctive, or 25        declaratory relief in the jurisdiction in which the 26        victim's right is being violated or where the crime is   SB0019- 15 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        being prosecuted. For complaints or motions filed by 2        or on behalf of the victim, the clerk of court shall 3        waive filing fees that would otherwise be owed by the 4        victim for any court filing with the purpose of 5        enforcing crime victims' rights. If the court denies 6        the relief sought by the victim, the reasons for the 7        denial shall be clearly stated on the record in the 8        transcript of the proceedings, in a written opinion, 9        or in the docket entry, and the victim may appeal the 10        circuit court's decision to the appellate court. The 11        court shall issue prompt rulings regarding victims' 12        rights. Proceedings seeking to enforce victims' rights 13        shall not be stayed or subject to unreasonable delay 14        via continuances. 15        (5) Violation of rights and remedies. 16            (A) If the court determines that a victim's right 17        has been violated, the court shall determine the 18        appropriate remedy for the violation of the victim's 19        right by hearing from the victim and the parties, 20        considering all factors relevant to the issue, and 21        then awarding appropriate relief to the victim.22            (A-5) Consideration of an issue of a substantive 23        nature or an issue that implicates the constitutional 24        or statutory right of a victim at a court proceeding 25        labeled as a status hearing shall constitute a per se 26        violation of a victim's right.   SB0019- 16 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1            (B) The appropriate remedy shall include only 2        actions necessary to provide the victim the right to 3        which the victim was entitled. Remedies may include, 4        but are not limited to: injunctive relief requiring 5        the victim's right to be afforded; declaratory 6        judgment recognizing or clarifying the victim's 7        rights; a writ of mandamus; and may include reopening 8        previously held proceedings; however, in no event 9        shall the court vacate a conviction. Any remedy shall 10        be tailored to provide the victim an appropriate 11        remedy without violating any constitutional right of 12        the defendant. In no event shall the appropriate 13        remedy to the victim be a new trial or damages.14        The court shall impose a mandatory training course 15    provided by the Attorney General for the employee under 16    item (ii) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph (4), which must 17    be successfully completed within 6 months of the entry of 18    the court order.19        This paragraph (5) takes effect January 2, 2023.20        (6) Right to be heard. Whenever a victim has the right 21    to be heard, the court shall allow the victim to exercise 22    the right in any reasonable manner the victim chooses.23        (7) Right to attend trial. A party must file a written 24    motion to exclude a victim from trial at least 60 days 25    prior to the date set for trial. The motion must state with 26    specificity the reason exclusion is necessary to protect a   SB0019- 17 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1    constitutional right of the party, and must contain an 2    offer of proof. The court shall rule on the motion within 3    30 days. If the motion is granted, the court shall set 4    forth on the record the facts that support its finding 5    that the victim's testimony will be materially affected if 6    the victim hears other testimony at trial.7        (8) Right to have advocate and support person present 8    at court proceedings.9            (A) A party who intends to call an advocate as a 10        witness at trial must seek permission of the court 11        before the subpoena is issued. The party must file a 12        written motion at least 90 days before trial that sets 13        forth specifically the issues on which the advocate's 14        testimony is sought and an offer of proof regarding 15        (i) the content of the anticipated testimony of the 16        advocate; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 17        materiality of the anticipated testimony. The court 18        shall consider the motion and make findings within 30 19        days of the filing of the motion. If the court finds by 20        a preponderance of the evidence that: (i) the 21        anticipated testimony is not protected by an absolute 22        privilege; and (ii) the anticipated testimony contains 23        relevant, admissible, and material evidence that is 24        not available through other witnesses or evidence, the 25        court shall issue a subpoena requiring the advocate to 26        appear to testify at an in camera hearing. The   SB0019- 18 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        prosecuting attorney and the victim shall have 15 days 2        to seek appellate review before the advocate is 3        required to testify at an ex parte in camera 4        proceeding. 5            The prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the 6        advocate's attorney shall be allowed to be present at 7        the ex parte in camera proceeding. If, after 8        conducting the ex parte in camera hearing, the court 9        determines that due process requires any testimony 10        regarding confidential or privileged information or 11        communications, the court shall provide to the 12        prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the advocate's 13        attorney a written memorandum on the substance of the 14        advocate's testimony. The prosecuting attorney, the 15        victim, and the advocate's attorney shall have 15 days 16        to seek appellate review before a subpoena may be 17        issued for the advocate to testify at trial. The 18        presence of the prosecuting attorney at the ex parte 19        in camera proceeding does not make the substance of 20        the advocate's testimony that the court has ruled 21        inadmissible subject to discovery.22            (B) If a victim has asserted the right to have a 23        support person present at the court proceedings, the 24        victim shall provide the name of the person the victim 25        has chosen to be the victim's support person to the 26        prosecuting attorney, within 60 days of trial. The   SB0019- 19 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        prosecuting attorney shall provide the name to the 2        defendant. If the defendant intends to call the 3        support person as a witness at trial, the defendant 4        must seek permission of the court before a subpoena is 5        issued. The defendant must file a written motion at 6        least 45 days prior to trial that sets forth 7        specifically the issues on which the support person 8        will testify and an offer of proof regarding: (i) the 9        content of the anticipated testimony of the support 10        person; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 11        materiality of the anticipated testimony.12            If the prosecuting attorney intends to call the 13        support person as a witness during the State's 14        case-in-chief, the prosecuting attorney shall inform 15        the court of this intent in the response to the 16        defendant's written motion. The victim may choose a 17        different person to be the victim's support person. 18        The court may allow the defendant to inquire about 19        matters outside the scope of the direct examination 20        during cross-examination. If the court allows the 21        defendant to do so, the support person shall be 22        allowed to remain in the courtroom after the support 23        person has testified. A defendant who fails to 24        question the support person about matters outside the 25        scope of direct examination during the State's 26        case-in-chief waives the right to challenge the   SB0019- 20 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        presence of the support person on appeal. The court 2        shall allow the support person to testify if called as 3        a witness in the defendant's case-in-chief or the 4        State's rebuttal.5            If the court does not allow the defendant to 6        inquire about matters outside the scope of the direct 7        examination, the support person shall be allowed to 8        remain in the courtroom after the support person has 9        been called by the defendant or the defendant has 10        rested. The court shall allow the support person to 11        testify in the State's rebuttal.12            If the prosecuting attorney does not intend to 13        call the support person in the State's case-in-chief, 14        the court shall verify with the support person whether 15        the support person, if called as a witness, would 16        testify as set forth in the offer of proof. If the 17        court finds that the support person would testify as 18        set forth in the offer of proof, the court shall rule 19        on the relevance, materiality, and admissibility of 20        the anticipated testimony. If the court rules the 21        anticipated testimony is admissible, the court shall 22        issue the subpoena. The support person may remain in 23        the courtroom after the support person testifies and 24        shall be allowed to testify in rebuttal.25            If the court excludes the victim's support person 26        during the State's case-in-chief, the victim shall be   SB0019- 21 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        allowed to choose another support person to be present 2        in court. 3            If the victim fails to designate a support person 4        within 60 days of trial and the defendant has 5        subpoenaed the support person to testify at trial, the 6        court may exclude the support person from the trial 7        until the support person testifies. If the court 8        excludes the support person the victim may choose 9        another person as a support person. 10        (9) Right to notice and hearing before disclosure of 11    confidential or privileged information or records.12            (A) A defendant who seeks to subpoena testimony or 13        records of or concerning the victim that are 14        confidential or privileged by law must seek permission 15        of the court before the subpoena is issued. The 16        defendant must file a written motion and an offer of 17        proof regarding the relevance, admissibility and 18        materiality of the testimony or records. If the court 19        finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:20                (i) the testimony or records are not protected 21            by an absolute privilege and22                (ii) the testimony or records contain 23            relevant, admissible, and material evidence that 24            is not available through other witnesses or 25            evidence, the court shall issue a subpoena 26            requiring the witness to appear in camera or a   SB0019- 22 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1            sealed copy of the records be delivered to the 2            court to be reviewed in camera. If, after 3            conducting an in camera review of the witness 4            statement or records, the court determines that 5            due process requires disclosure of any potential 6            testimony or any portion of the records, the court 7            shall provide copies of the records that it 8            intends to disclose to the prosecuting attorney 9            and the victim. The prosecuting attorney and the 10            victim shall have 30 days to seek appellate review 11            before the records are disclosed to the defendant, 12            used in any court proceeding, or disclosed to 13            anyone or in any way that would subject the 14            testimony or records to public review. The 15            disclosure of copies of any portion of the 16            testimony or records to the prosecuting attorney 17            under this Section does not make the records 18            subject to discovery or required to be provided to 19            the defendant.20            (B) A prosecuting attorney who seeks to subpoena 21        information or records concerning the victim that are 22        confidential or privileged by law must first request 23        the written consent of the crime victim. If the victim 24        does not provide such written consent, including where 25        necessary the appropriate signed document required for 26        waiving privilege, the prosecuting attorney must serve   SB0019- 23 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        the subpoena at least 21 days prior to the date a 2        response or appearance is required to allow the 3        subject of the subpoena time to file a motion to quash 4        or request a hearing. The prosecuting attorney must 5        also send a written notice to the victim at least 21 6        days prior to the response date to allow the victim to 7        file a motion or request a hearing. The notice to the 8        victim shall inform the victim (i) that a subpoena has 9        been issued for confidential information or records 10        concerning the victim, (ii) that the victim has the 11        right to request a hearing prior to the response date 12        of the subpoena, and (iii) how to request the hearing. 13        The notice to the victim shall also include a copy of 14        the subpoena. If requested, a hearing regarding the 15        subpoena shall occur before information or records are 16        provided to the prosecuting attorney. 17        (10) Right to notice of court proceedings. If the 18    victim is not present at a court proceeding in which a 19    right of the victim is at issue, the court shall ask the 20    prosecuting attorney whether the victim was notified of 21    the time, place, and purpose of the court proceeding and 22    that the victim had a right to be heard at the court 23    proceeding. If the court determines that timely notice was 24    not given or that the victim was not adequately informed 25    of the nature of the court proceeding, the court shall not 26    rule on any substantive issues, accept a plea, or impose a   SB0019- 24 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1    sentence and shall continue the hearing for the time 2    necessary to notify the victim of the time, place and 3    nature of the court proceeding. The time between court 4    proceedings shall not be attributable to the State under 5    Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.6        (11) Right to timely disposition of the case. A victim 7    has the right to timely disposition of the case so as to 8    minimize the stress, cost, and inconvenience resulting 9    from the victim's involvement in the case. Before ruling 10    on a motion to continue trial or other court proceeding, 11    the court shall inquire into the circumstances for the 12    request for the delay and, if the victim has provided 13    written notice of the assertion of the right to a timely 14    disposition, and whether the victim objects to the delay. 15    If the victim objects, the prosecutor shall inform the 16    court of the victim's objections. If the prosecutor has 17    not conferred with the victim about the continuance, the 18    prosecutor shall inform the court of the attempts to 19    confer. If the court finds the attempts of the prosecutor 20    to confer with the victim were inadequate to protect the 21    victim's right to be heard, the court shall give the 22    prosecutor at least 3 but not more than 5 business days to 23    confer with the victim. In ruling on a motion to continue, 24    the court shall consider the reasons for the requested 25    continuance, the number and length of continuances that 26    have been granted, the victim's objections and procedures   SB0019- 25 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1    to avoid further delays. If a continuance is granted over 2    the victim's objection, the court shall specify on the 3    record the reasons for the continuance and the procedures 4    that have been or will be taken to avoid further delays.5        (12) Right to Restitution.6            (A) If the victim has asserted the right to 7        restitution and the amount of restitution is known at 8        the time of sentencing, the court shall enter the 9        judgment of restitution at the time of sentencing. 10            (B) If the victim has asserted the right to 11        restitution and the amount of restitution is not known 12        at the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall, 13        within 5 days after sentencing, notify the victim what 14        information and documentation related to restitution 15        is needed and that the information and documentation 16        must be provided to the prosecutor within 45 days 17        after sentencing. Failure to timely provide 18        information and documentation related to restitution 19        shall be deemed a waiver of the right to restitution. 20        The prosecutor shall file and serve within 60 days 21        after sentencing a proposed judgment for restitution 22        and a notice that includes information concerning the 23        identity of any victims or other persons seeking 24        restitution, whether any victim or other person 25        expressly declines restitution, the nature and amount 26        of any damages together with any supporting   SB0019- 26 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        documentation, a restitution amount recommendation, 2        and the names of any co-defendants and their case 3        numbers. Within 30 days after receipt of the proposed 4        judgment for restitution, the defendant shall file any 5        objection to the proposed judgment, a statement of 6        grounds for the objection, and a financial statement. 7        If the defendant does not file an objection, the court 8        may enter the judgment for restitution without further 9        proceedings. If the defendant files an objection and 10        either party requests a hearing, the court shall 11        schedule a hearing. 12        (13) Access to presentence reports.13            (A) The victim may request a copy of the 14        presentence report prepared under the Unified Code of 15        Corrections from the State's Attorney. The State's 16        Attorney shall redact the following information before 17        providing a copy of the report:18                (i) the defendant's mental history and 19            condition;20                (ii) any evaluation prepared under subsection 21            (b) or (b-5) of Section 5-3-2; and22                (iii) the name, address, phone number, and 23            other personal information about any other victim.24            (B) The State's Attorney or the defendant may 25        request the court redact other information in the 26        report that may endanger the safety of any person.  SB0019- 27 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1            (C) The State's Attorney may orally disclose to 2        the victim any of the information that has been 3        redacted if there is a reasonable likelihood that the 4        information will be stated in court at the sentencing.5            (D) The State's Attorney must advise the victim 6        that the victim must maintain the confidentiality of 7        the report and other information. Any dissemination of 8        the report or information that was not stated at a 9        court proceeding constitutes indirect criminal 10        contempt of court. 11        (14) Appellate relief. If the trial court denies the 12    relief requested, the victim, the victim's attorney, or 13    the prosecuting attorney may file an appeal within 30 days 14    of the trial court's ruling. The trial or appellate court 15    may stay the court proceedings if the court finds that a 16    stay would not violate a constitutional right of the 17    defendant. If the appellate court denies the relief 18    sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated 19    in a written opinion. In any appeal in a criminal case, the 20    State may assert as error the court's denial of any crime 21    victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal 22    relates.23        (15) Limitation on appellate relief. In no case shall 24    an appellate court provide a new trial to remedy the 25    violation of a victim's right. 26        (16) The right to be reasonably protected from the   SB0019- 28 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1    accused throughout the criminal justice process and the 2    right to have the safety of the victim and the victim's 3    family considered in determining whether to release the 4    defendant, and setting conditions of release after arrest 5    and conviction. A victim of domestic violence, a sexual 6    offense, or stalking may request the entry of a protective 7    order under Article 112A of the Code of Criminal Procedure 8    of 1963. 9    (d) Procedures after the imposition of sentence.10        (1) The Prisoner Review Board shall inform a victim or 11    any other concerned citizen, upon written request, of the 12    prisoner's release on parole, mandatory supervised 13    release, electronic detention, work release, international 14    transfer or exchange, or by the custodian, other than the 15    Department of Juvenile Justice, of the discharge of any 16    individual who was adjudicated a delinquent for a crime 17    from State custody and by the sheriff of the appropriate 18    county of any such person's final discharge from county 19    custody.

Upon written request by the   SB0019- 29 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1    victim or any other concerned citizen, the State's 2    Attorney shall notify the person once of the times and 3    dates of release of a prisoner sentenced to periodic 4    imprisonment. Notification shall be based on the most 5    recent information as to the victim's or other concerned 6    citizen's residence or other location available to the 7    notifying authority. 8        (2) When the defendant has been committed to the 9    Department of Human Services pursuant to Section 5-2-4 or 10    any other provision of the Unified Code of Corrections, 11    the victim may request to be notified by the releasing 12    authority of the approval by the court of an on-grounds 13    pass, a supervised off-grounds pass, an unsupervised 14    off-grounds pass, or conditional release; the release on 15    an off-grounds pass; the return from an off-grounds pass; 16    transfer to another facility; conditional release; escape; 17    death; or final discharge from State custody.

When 6    the escapee is apprehended, the Department of Corrections 7    or the Department of Juvenile Justice immediately shall 8    notify the Prisoner Review Board and the Board shall 9    notify the victim.10        (4) The victim of the crime for which the prisoner has 11    been sentenced has the right to register with the Prisoner 12    Review Board's victim registry. Victims registered with 13    the Board shall receive reasonable written notice not less 14    than 30 days prior to the parole hearing or target 15    aftercare release date. The victim has the right to submit 16    a victim statement for consideration by the Prisoner 17    Review Board or the Department of Juvenile Justice in 18    writing, on film, videotape, or other electronic means, or 19    in the form of a recording prior to the parole hearing or 20    target aftercare release date, or in person at the parole 21    hearing or aftercare release protest hearing, or by 22    calling the toll-free number established in subsection (f) 23    of this Section.

Whenever possible, notice of the hearing shall 12    be given within 48 hours of the court's scheduling of the 13    hearing;14        (19) shall forward a copy of any statement presented 15    under Section 6 to the Prisoner Review Board or Department 16    of Juvenile Justice to be considered in making a 17    determination under Section 3-2.5-85 or subsection (b) of 18    Section 3-3-8 of the Unified Code of Corrections;19        (20) shall, within a reasonable time, offer to meet 20    with the crime victim regarding the decision of the 21    State's Attorney not to charge an offense, and shall meet 22    with the victim, if the victim agrees. The victim has a 23    right to have an attorney, advocate, and other support 24    person of the victim's choice attend this meeting with the 25    victim; and26        (21) shall give the crime victim timely notice of any   SB0019- 11 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1    decision not to pursue charges and consider the safety of 2    the victim when deciding how to give such notice. 3    (c) The court shall ensure that the rights of the victim 4are afforded. 5    (c-5) The following procedures shall be followed to afford 6victims the rights guaranteed by Article I, Section 8.1 of the 7Illinois Constitution:8        (1) Written notice. A victim may complete a written 9    notice of intent to assert rights on a form prepared by the 10    Office of the Attorney General and provided to the victim 11    by the State's Attorney. The victim may at any time 12    provide a revised written notice to the State's Attorney. 13    The State's Attorney shall file the written notice with 14    the court. At the beginning of any court proceeding in 15    which the right of a victim may be at issue, the court and 16    prosecutor shall review the written notice to determine 17    whether the victim has asserted the right that may be at 18    issue.19        (2) Victim's retained attorney. A victim's attorney 20    shall file an entry of appearance limited to assertion of 21    the victim's rights. Upon the filing of the entry of 22    appearance and service on the State's Attorney and the 23    defendant, the attorney is to receive copies of all 24    notices, motions and court orders filed thereafter in the 25    case.26        (3) Standing. The victim has standing to assert the   SB0019- 12 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1    rights enumerated in subsection (a) of Article I, Section 2    8.1 of the Illinois Constitution and the statutory rights 3    under Section 4 of this Act in any court exercising 4    jurisdiction over the criminal case. The prosecuting 5    attorney, a victim, or the victim's retained attorney may 6    assert the victim's rights. The defendant in the criminal 7    case has no standing to assert a right of the victim in any 8    court proceeding, including on appeal.9        (4) Assertion of and enforcement of rights.10            (A) The prosecuting attorney shall assert a 11        victim's right or request enforcement of a right by 12        filing a motion or by orally asserting the right or 13        requesting enforcement in open court in the criminal 14        case outside the presence of the jury. The prosecuting 15        attorney shall consult with the victim and the 16        victim's attorney regarding the assertion or 17        enforcement of a right. If the prosecuting attorney 18        decides not to assert or enforce a victim's right, the 19        prosecuting attorney shall notify the victim or the 20        victim's attorney in sufficient time to allow the 21        victim or the victim's attorney to assert the right or 22        to seek enforcement of a right.23            (B) If the prosecuting attorney elects not to 24        assert a victim's right or to seek enforcement of a 25        right, the victim or the victim's attorney may assert 26        the victim's right or request enforcement of a right   SB0019- 13 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        by filing a motion or by orally asserting the right or 2        requesting enforcement in open court in the criminal 3        case outside the presence of the jury.4            (C) If the prosecuting attorney asserts a victim's 5        right or seeks enforcement of a right, unless the 6        prosecuting attorney objects or the trial court does 7        not allow it, the victim or the victim's attorney may 8        be heard regarding the prosecuting attorney's motion 9        or may file a simultaneous motion to assert or request 10        enforcement of the victim's right. If the victim or 11        the victim's attorney was not allowed to be heard at 12        the hearing regarding the prosecuting attorney's 13        motion, and the court denies the prosecuting 14        attorney's assertion of the right or denies the 15        request for enforcement of a right, the victim or 16        victim's attorney may file a motion to assert the 17        victim's right or to request enforcement of the right 18        within 10 days of the court's ruling. The motion need 19        not demonstrate the grounds for a motion for 20        reconsideration. The court shall rule on the merits of 21        the motion.22            (D) The court shall take up and decide any motion 23        or request asserting or seeking enforcement of a 24        victim's right without delay, unless a specific time 25        period is specified by law or court rule. The reasons 26        for any decision denying the motion or request shall   SB0019- 14 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        be clearly stated on the record.2            (E) No later than January 1, 2023, the Office of 3        the Attorney General shall: 4                (i) designate an administrative authority 5            within the Office of the Attorney General to 6            receive and investigate complaints relating to the 7            provision or violation of the rights of a crime 8            victim as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 9            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act;10                (ii) create and administer a course of 11            training for employees and offices of the State of 12            Illinois that fail to comply with provisions of 13            Illinois law pertaining to the treatment of crime 14            victims as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 15            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act as 16            required by the court under Section 5 of this Act; 17            and18                (iii) have the authority to make 19            recommendations to employees and offices of the 20            State of Illinois to respond more effectively to 21            the needs of crime victims, including regarding 22            the violation of the rights of a crime victim.23            (F) Crime victims' rights may also be asserted by 24        filing a complaint for mandamus, injunctive, or 25        declaratory relief in the jurisdiction in which the 26        victim's right is being violated or where the crime is   SB0019- 15 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        being prosecuted. For complaints or motions filed by 2        or on behalf of the victim, the clerk of court shall 3        waive filing fees that would otherwise be owed by the 4        victim for any court filing with the purpose of 5        enforcing crime victims' rights. If the court denies 6        the relief sought by the victim, the reasons for the 7        denial shall be clearly stated on the record in the 8        transcript of the proceedings, in a written opinion, 9        or in the docket entry, and the victim may appeal the 10        circuit court's decision to the appellate court. The 11        court shall issue prompt rulings regarding victims' 12        rights. Proceedings seeking to enforce victims' rights 13        shall not be stayed or subject to unreasonable delay 14        via continuances. 15        (5) Violation of rights and remedies. 16            (A) If the court determines that a victim's right 17        has been violated, the court shall determine the 18        appropriate remedy for the violation of the victim's 19        right by hearing from the victim and the parties, 20        considering all factors relevant to the issue, and 21        then awarding appropriate relief to the victim.22            (A-5) Consideration of an issue of a substantive 23        nature or an issue that implicates the constitutional 24        or statutory right of a victim at a court proceeding 25        labeled as a status hearing shall constitute a per se 26        violation of a victim's right.   SB0019- 16 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1            (B) The appropriate remedy shall include only 2        actions necessary to provide the victim the right to 3        which the victim was entitled. Remedies may include, 4        but are not limited to: injunctive relief requiring 5        the victim's right to be afforded; declaratory 6        judgment recognizing or clarifying the victim's 7        rights; a writ of mandamus; and may include reopening 8        previously held proceedings; however, in no event 9        shall the court vacate a conviction. Any remedy shall 10        be tailored to provide the victim an appropriate 11        remedy without violating any constitutional right of 12        the defendant. In no event shall the appropriate 13        remedy to the victim be a new trial or damages.14        The court shall impose a mandatory training course 15    provided by the Attorney General for the employee under 16    item (ii) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph (4), which must 17    be successfully completed within 6 months of the entry of 18    the court order.19        This paragraph (5) takes effect January 2, 2023.20        (6) Right to be heard. Whenever a victim has the right 21    to be heard, the court shall allow the victim to exercise 22    the right in any reasonable manner the victim chooses.23        (7) Right to attend trial. A party must file a written 24    motion to exclude a victim from trial at least 60 days 25    prior to the date set for trial. The motion must state with 26    specificity the reason exclusion is necessary to protect a   SB0019- 17 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1    constitutional right of the party, and must contain an 2    offer of proof. The court shall rule on the motion within 3    30 days. If the motion is granted, the court shall set 4    forth on the record the facts that support its finding 5    that the victim's testimony will be materially affected if 6    the victim hears other testimony at trial.7        (8) Right to have advocate and support person present 8    at court proceedings.9            (A) A party who intends to call an advocate as a 10        witness at trial must seek permission of the court 11        before the subpoena is issued. The party must file a 12        written motion at least 90 days before trial that sets 13        forth specifically the issues on which the advocate's 14        testimony is sought and an offer of proof regarding 15        (i) the content of the anticipated testimony of the 16        advocate; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 17        materiality of the anticipated testimony. The court 18        shall consider the motion and make findings within 30 19        days of the filing of the motion. If the court finds by 20        a preponderance of the evidence that: (i) the 21        anticipated testimony is not protected by an absolute 22        privilege; and (ii) the anticipated testimony contains 23        relevant, admissible, and material evidence that is 24        not available through other witnesses or evidence, the 25        court shall issue a subpoena requiring the advocate to 26        appear to testify at an in camera hearing. The   SB0019- 18 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        prosecuting attorney and the victim shall have 15 days 2        to seek appellate review before the advocate is 3        required to testify at an ex parte in camera 4        proceeding. 5            The prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the 6        advocate's attorney shall be allowed to be present at 7        the ex parte in camera proceeding. If, after 8        conducting the ex parte in camera hearing, the court 9        determines that due process requires any testimony 10        regarding confidential or privileged information or 11        communications, the court shall provide to the 12        prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the advocate's 13        attorney a written memorandum on the substance of the 14        advocate's testimony. The prosecuting attorney, the 15        victim, and the advocate's attorney shall have 15 days 16        to seek appellate review before a subpoena may be 17        issued for the advocate to testify at trial. The 18        presence of the prosecuting attorney at the ex parte 19        in camera proceeding does not make the substance of 20        the advocate's testimony that the court has ruled 21        inadmissible subject to discovery.22            (B) If a victim has asserted the right to have a 23        support person present at the court proceedings, the 24        victim shall provide the name of the person the victim 25        has chosen to be the victim's support person to the 26        prosecuting attorney, within 60 days of trial. The   SB0019- 19 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        prosecuting attorney shall provide the name to the 2        defendant. If the defendant intends to call the 3        support person as a witness at trial, the defendant 4        must seek permission of the court before a subpoena is 5        issued. The defendant must file a written motion at 6        least 45 days prior to trial that sets forth 7        specifically the issues on which the support person 8        will testify and an offer of proof regarding: (i) the 9        content of the anticipated testimony of the support 10        person; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 11        materiality of the anticipated testimony.12            If the prosecuting attorney intends to call the 13        support person as a witness during the State's 14        case-in-chief, the prosecuting attorney shall inform 15        the court of this intent in the response to the 16        defendant's written motion. The victim may choose a 17        different person to be the victim's support person. 18        The court may allow the defendant to inquire about 19        matters outside the scope of the direct examination 20        during cross-examination. If the court allows the 21        defendant to do so, the support person shall be 22        allowed to remain in the courtroom after the support 23        person has testified. A defendant who fails to 24        question the support person about matters outside the 25        scope of direct examination during the State's 26        case-in-chief waives the right to challenge the   SB0019- 20 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        presence of the support person on appeal. The court 2        shall allow the support person to testify if called as 3        a witness in the defendant's case-in-chief or the 4        State's rebuttal.5            If the court does not allow the defendant to 6        inquire about matters outside the scope of the direct 7        examination, the support person shall be allowed to 8        remain in the courtroom after the support person has 9        been called by the defendant or the defendant has 10        rested. The court shall allow the support person to 11        testify in the State's rebuttal.12            If the prosecuting attorney does not intend to 13        call the support person in the State's case-in-chief, 14        the court shall verify with the support person whether 15        the support person, if called as a witness, would 16        testify as set forth in the offer of proof. If the 17        court finds that the support person would testify as 18        set forth in the offer of proof, the court shall rule 19        on the relevance, materiality, and admissibility of 20        the anticipated testimony. If the court rules the 21        anticipated testimony is admissible, the court shall 22        issue the subpoena. The support person may remain in 23        the courtroom after the support person testifies and 24        shall be allowed to testify in rebuttal.25            If the court excludes the victim's support person 26        during the State's case-in-chief, the victim shall be   SB0019- 21 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        allowed to choose another support person to be present 2        in court. 3            If the victim fails to designate a support person 4        within 60 days of trial and the defendant has 5        subpoenaed the support person to testify at trial, the 6        court may exclude the support person from the trial 7        until the support person testifies. If the court 8        excludes the support person the victim may choose 9        another person as a support person. 10        (9) Right to notice and hearing before disclosure of 11    confidential or privileged information or records.12            (A) A defendant who seeks to subpoena testimony or 13        records of or concerning the victim that are 14        confidential or privileged by law must seek permission 15        of the court before the subpoena is issued. The 16        defendant must file a written motion and an offer of 17        proof regarding the relevance, admissibility and 18        materiality of the testimony or records. If the court 19        finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:20                (i) the testimony or records are not protected 21            by an absolute privilege and22                (ii) the testimony or records contain 23            relevant, admissible, and material evidence that 24            is not available through other witnesses or 25            evidence, the court shall issue a subpoena 26            requiring the witness to appear in camera or a   SB0019- 22 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1            sealed copy of the records be delivered to the 2            court to be reviewed in camera. If, after 3            conducting an in camera review of the witness 4            statement or records, the court determines that 5            due process requires disclosure of any potential 6            testimony or any portion of the records, the court 7            shall provide copies of the records that it 8            intends to disclose to the prosecuting attorney 9            and the victim. The prosecuting attorney and the 10            victim shall have 30 days to seek appellate review 11            before the records are disclosed to the defendant, 12            used in any court proceeding, or disclosed to 13            anyone or in any way that would subject the 14            testimony or records to public review. The 15            disclosure of copies of any portion of the 16            testimony or records to the prosecuting attorney 17            under this Section does not make the records 18            subject to discovery or required to be provided to 19            the defendant.20            (B) A prosecuting attorney who seeks to subpoena 21        information or records concerning the victim that are 22        confidential or privileged by law must first request 23        the written consent of the crime victim. If the victim 24        does not provide such written consent, including where 25        necessary the appropriate signed document required for 26        waiving privilege, the prosecuting attorney must serve   SB0019- 23 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        the subpoena at least 21 days prior to the date a 2        response or appearance is required to allow the 3        subject of the subpoena time to file a motion to quash 4        or request a hearing. The prosecuting attorney must 5        also send a written notice to the victim at least 21 6        days prior to the response date to allow the victim to 7        file a motion or request a hearing. The notice to the 8        victim shall inform the victim (i) that a subpoena has 9        been issued for confidential information or records 10        concerning the victim, (ii) that the victim has the 11        right to request a hearing prior to the response date 12        of the subpoena, and (iii) how to request the hearing. 13        The notice to the victim shall also include a copy of 14        the subpoena. If requested, a hearing regarding the 15        subpoena shall occur before information or records are 16        provided to the prosecuting attorney. 17        (10) Right to notice of court proceedings. If the 18    victim is not present at a court proceeding in which a 19    right of the victim is at issue, the court shall ask the 20    prosecuting attorney whether the victim was notified of 21    the time, place, and purpose of the court proceeding and 22    that the victim had a right to be heard at the court 23    proceeding. If the court determines that timely notice was 24    not given or that the victim was not adequately informed 25    of the nature of the court proceeding, the court shall not 26    rule on any substantive issues, accept a plea, or impose a   SB0019- 24 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1    sentence and shall continue the hearing for the time 2    necessary to notify the victim of the time, place and 3    nature of the court proceeding. The time between court 4    proceedings shall not be attributable to the State under 5    Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.6        (11) Right to timely disposition of the case. A victim 7    has the right to timely disposition of the case so as to 8    minimize the stress, cost, and inconvenience resulting 9    from the victim's involvement in the case. Before ruling 10    on a motion to continue trial or other court proceeding, 11    the court shall inquire into the circumstances for the 12    request for the delay and, if the victim has provided 13    written notice of the assertion of the right to a timely 14    disposition, and whether the victim objects to the delay. 15    If the victim objects, the prosecutor shall inform the 16    court of the victim's objections. If the prosecutor has 17    not conferred with the victim about the continuance, the 18    prosecutor shall inform the court of the attempts to 19    confer. If the court finds the attempts of the prosecutor 20    to confer with the victim were inadequate to protect the 21    victim's right to be heard, the court shall give the 22    prosecutor at least 3 but not more than 5 business days to 23    confer with the victim. In ruling on a motion to continue, 24    the court shall consider the reasons for the requested 25    continuance, the number and length of continuances that 26    have been granted, the victim's objections and procedures   SB0019- 25 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1    to avoid further delays. If a continuance is granted over 2    the victim's objection, the court shall specify on the 3    record the reasons for the continuance and the procedures 4    that have been or will be taken to avoid further delays.5        (12) Right to Restitution.6            (A) If the victim has asserted the right to 7        restitution and the amount of restitution is known at 8        the time of sentencing, the court shall enter the 9        judgment of restitution at the time of sentencing. 10            (B) If the victim has asserted the right to 11        restitution and the amount of restitution is not known 12        at the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall, 13        within 5 days after sentencing, notify the victim what 14        information and documentation related to restitution 15        is needed and that the information and documentation 16        must be provided to the prosecutor within 45 days 17        after sentencing. Failure to timely provide 18        information and documentation related to restitution 19        shall be deemed a waiver of the right to restitution. 20        The prosecutor shall file and serve within 60 days 21        after sentencing a proposed judgment for restitution 22        and a notice that includes information concerning the 23        identity of any victims or other persons seeking 24        restitution, whether any victim or other person 25        expressly declines restitution, the nature and amount 26        of any damages together with any supporting   SB0019- 26 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1        documentation, a restitution amount recommendation, 2        and the names of any co-defendants and their case 3        numbers. Within 30 days after receipt of the proposed 4        judgment for restitution, the defendant shall file any 5        objection to the proposed judgment, a statement of 6        grounds for the objection, and a financial statement. 7        If the defendant does not file an objection, the court 8        may enter the judgment for restitution without further 9        proceedings. If the defendant files an objection and 10        either party requests a hearing, the court shall 11        schedule a hearing. 12        (13) Access to presentence reports.13            (A) The victim may request a copy of the 14        presentence report prepared under the Unified Code of 15        Corrections from the State's Attorney. The State's 16        Attorney shall redact the following information before 17        providing a copy of the report:18                (i) the defendant's mental history and 19            condition;20                (ii) any evaluation prepared under subsection 21            (b) or (b-5) of Section 5-3-2; and22                (iii) the name, address, phone number, and 23            other personal information about any other victim.24            (B) The State's Attorney or the defendant may 25        request the court redact other information in the 26        report that may endanger the safety of any person.  SB0019- 27 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1            (C) The State's Attorney may orally disclose to 2        the victim any of the information that has been 3        redacted if there is a reasonable likelihood that the 4        information will be stated in court at the sentencing.5            (D) The State's Attorney must advise the victim 6        that the victim must maintain the confidentiality of 7        the report and other information. Any dissemination of 8        the report or information that was not stated at a 9        court proceeding constitutes indirect criminal 10        contempt of court. 11        (14) Appellate relief. If the trial court denies the 12    relief requested, the victim, the victim's attorney, or 13    the prosecuting attorney may file an appeal within 30 days 14    of the trial court's ruling. The trial or appellate court 15    may stay the court proceedings if the court finds that a 16    stay would not violate a constitutional right of the 17    defendant. If the appellate court denies the relief 18    sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated 19    in a written opinion. In any appeal in a criminal case, the 20    State may assert as error the court's denial of any crime 21    victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal 22    relates.23        (15) Limitation on appellate relief. In no case shall 24    an appellate court provide a new trial to remedy the 25    violation of a victim's right. 26        (16) The right to be reasonably protected from the   SB0019- 28 -LRB104 08032 JDS 18078 b1    accused throughout the criminal justice process and the 2    right to have the safety of the victim and the victim's 3    family considered in determining whether to release the 4    defendant, and setting conditions of release after arrest 5    and conviction. A victim of domestic violence, a sexual 6    offense, or stalking may request the entry of a protective 7    order under Article 112A of the Code of Criminal Procedure 8    of 1963. 9    (d) Procedures after the imposition of sentence.10        (1) The Prisoner Review Board shall inform a victim or 11    any other concerned citizen, upon written request, of the 12    prisoner's release on parole, mandatory supervised 13    release, electronic detention, work release, international 14    transfer or exchange, or by the custodian, other than the 15    Department of Juvenile Justice, of the discharge of any 16    individual who was adjudicated a delinquent for a crime 17    from State custody and by the sheriff of the appropriate 18    county of any such person's final discharge from county 19    custody. The Prisoner Review Board, upon written request, 20    shall provide to a victim or any other concerned citizen a 21    recent photograph of any person convicted of a felony, 22    upon his or her release from custody.
