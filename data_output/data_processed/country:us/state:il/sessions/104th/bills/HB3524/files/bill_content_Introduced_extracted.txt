If the flagged 15        recording was used in a criminal, civil, or 16        administrative proceeding, the recording shall not be 17        destroyed except upon a final disposition and order 18        from the court.19            (D) Nothing in this Act prohibits law enforcement 20        agencies from labeling officer-worn body camera video 21        within the recording medium; provided that the 22        labeling does not alter the actual recording of the 23        incident captured on the officer-worn body camera. The 24        labels, titles, and tags shall not be construed as 25        altering the officer-worn body camera video in any 26        way.   HB3524- 8 -LRB104 11849 RTM 21939 b1        (8) Following the 90-day storage period, recordings 2    may be retained if a supervisor at the law enforcement 3    agency designates the recording for training purposes.

Upon 24    becoming aware, officers must as soon as practical 25    document and notify the appropriate supervisor of any 26    technical difficulties, failures, or problems with the   HB3524- 9 -LRB104 11849 RTM 21939 b1    officer-worn body camera or associated equipment. Upon 2    receiving notice, the appropriate supervisor shall make 3    every reasonable effort to correct and repair any of the 4    officer-worn body camera equipment.5        (11) No officer may hinder or prohibit any person, not 6    a law enforcement officer, from recording a law 7    enforcement officer in the performance of his or her 8    duties in a public place or when the officer has no 9    reasonable expectation of privacy. The law enforcement 10    agency's written policy shall indicate the potential 11    criminal penalties, as well as any departmental 12    discipline, which may result from unlawful confiscation or 13    destruction of the recording medium of a person who is not 14    a law enforcement officer. However, an officer may take 15    reasonable action to maintain safety and control, secure 16    crime scenes and accident sites, protect the integrity and 17    confidentiality of investigations, and protect the public 18    safety and order.19    (b) Recordings made with the use of an officer-worn body 20camera are not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of 21Information Act, except that:22        (1) if the subject of the encounter has a reasonable 23    expectation of privacy, at the time of the recording, any 24    recording which is flagged, due to the filing of a 25    complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of force, arrest or 26    detention, or resulting death or bodily harm, shall be   HB3524- 10 -LRB104 11849 RTM 21939 b1    disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information 2    Act if:3            (A) the subject of the encounter captured on the 4        recording is a victim or witness; and5            (B) the law enforcement agency obtains written 6        permission of the subject or the subject's legal 7        representative;8        (2) except as provided in paragraph (1) of this 9    subsection (b), any recording which is flagged due to the 10    filing of a complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of 11    force, arrest or detention, or resulting death or bodily 12    harm shall be disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of 13    Information Act; and14        (3) upon request, the law enforcement agency shall 15    disclose, in accordance with the Freedom of Information 16    Act, the recording to the subject of the encounter 17    captured on the recording or to the subject's attorney, or 18    the officer or his or her legal representative.19    For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection (b), 20the subject of the encounter does not have a reasonable 21expectation of privacy if the subject was arrested as a result 22of the encounter. For purposes of subparagraph (A) of 23paragraph (1) of this subsection (b), "witness" does not 24include a person who is a victim or who was arrested as a 25result of the encounter. 26    Only recordings or portions of recordings responsive to   HB3524- 11 -LRB104 11849 RTM 21939 b1the request shall be available for inspection or reproduction. 2Any recording disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act 3shall be redacted to remove identification of any person that 4appears on the recording and is not the officer, a subject of 5the encounter, or directly involved in the encounter. Nothing 6in this subsection (b) shall require the disclosure of any 7recording or portion of any recording which would be exempt 8from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.9    (c) Nothing in this Section shall limit access to a camera 10recording for the purposes of complying with Supreme Court 11rules or the rules of evidence.12(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-28, eff. 6-25-21; 13102-687, eff. 12-17-21; 102-694, eff. 1-7-22; 102-1104, eff. 1412-6-22.)
