Paragraph (3) shall be included only if the 17increased limiting rate will be applicable for more than one 18levy year and shall list each levy year for which the increased 19limiting rate will be applicable. The additional tax shown for 20each levy year shall be the approximate dollar amount of the 21increase over the amount of the most recently completed 22extension at the time the submission of the proposition is 23initiated by the taxing district. The approximate amount of 24the additional taxes extendable shown in paragraphs (2) and 25(3) shall be calculated by multiplying $100,000 (the fair 26market value of the property without regard to any property   SB2660- 26 -LRB104 13562 HLH 26122 b1tax exemptions) by (i) the percentage level of assessment 2prescribed for that property by statute, or by ordinance of 3the county board in counties that classify property for 4purposes of taxation in accordance with Section 4 of Article 5IX of the Illinois Constitution; (ii) the most recent final 6equalization factor certified to the county clerk by the 7Department of Revenue at the time the taxing district 8initiates the submission of the proposition to the electors; 9and (iii) either the new rate or the amount by which the 10limiting rate is to be increased.

Any notice required to be 17published in connection with the submission of the proposition 18shall also contain this supplemental information and shall not 19contain any other supplemental information regarding the 20proposition. Any error, miscalculation, or inaccuracy in 21computing any amount set forth on the ballot and in the notice 22that is not deliberate shall not invalidate or affect the 23validity of any proposition approved.

Paragraph (3) shall be included only if the 17increased limiting rate will be applicable for more than one 18levy year and shall list each levy year for which the increased 19limiting rate will be applicable.

The approximate amount of 24the additional taxes extendable shown in paragraphs (2) and 25(3) shall be calculated by multiplying $100,000 (the fair 26market value of the property without regard to any property   SB2660- 26 -LRB104 13562 HLH 26122 b1tax exemptions) by (i) the percentage level of assessment 2prescribed for that property by statute, or by ordinance of 3the county board in counties that classify property for 4purposes of taxation in accordance with Section 4 of Article 5IX of the Illinois Constitution; (ii) the most recent final 6equalization factor certified to the county clerk by the 7Department of Revenue at the time the taxing district 8initiates the submission of the proposition to the electors; 9and (iii) either the new rate or the amount by which the 10limiting rate is to be increased. This amendatory Act of the 1197th General Assembly is intended to clarify the existing 12requirements of this Section, and shall not be construed to 13validate any prior non-compliant referendum language. 14Paragraph (4) shall be included if the proposition concerns a 15limiting rate increase but shall not be included if the 16proposition concerns a new rate. Any notice required to be 17published in connection with the submission of the proposition 18shall also contain this supplemental information and shall not 19contain any other supplemental information regarding the 20proposition. Any error, miscalculation, or inaccuracy in 21computing any amount set forth on the ballot and in the notice 22that is not deliberate shall not invalidate or affect the 23validity of any proposition approved.
