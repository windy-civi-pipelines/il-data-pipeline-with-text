Every effort shall be made by the Department when 6developing the program requirements to consider the different 7geographic differences of both urban and rural areas of the 8State for initial treatment and necessary follow-up care. No 9provider shall be charged a fee by any unit of local government 10to participate in the school-based dental program administered 11by the Department. Nothing in this paragraph shall be 12construed to limit or preempt a home rule unit's or school 13district's authority to establish, change, or administer a 14school-based dental program in addition to, or independent of, 15the school-based dental program administered by the 16Department. 17    The Illinois Department, by rule, may distinguish and 18classify the medical services to be provided only in 19accordance with the classes of persons designated in Section 205-2. 21    The Department of Healthcare and Family Services must 22provide coverage and reimbursement for amino acid-based 23elemental formulas, regardless of delivery method, for the 24diagnosis and treatment of (i) eosinophilic disorders and (ii) 25short bowel syndrome when the prescribing physician has issued 26a written order stating that the amino acid-based elemental   SB0206- 9 -LRB104 08790 KTG 18845 b1formula is medically necessary. 2    The Illinois Department shall authorize the provision of, 3and shall authorize payment for, screening by low-dose 4mammography for the presence of occult breast cancer for 5individuals 35 years of age or older who are eligible for 6medical assistance under this Article, as follows:7        (A) A baseline mammogram for individuals 35 to 39 8    years of age. 9        (B) An annual mammogram for individuals 40 years of 10    age or older.11        (C) A mammogram at the age and intervals considered 12    medically necessary by the individual's health care 13    provider for individuals under 40 years of age and having 14    a family history of breast cancer, prior personal history 15    of breast cancer, positive genetic testing, or other risk 16    factors.17        (D) A comprehensive ultrasound screening and MRI of an 18    entire breast or breasts if a mammogram demonstrates 19    heterogeneous or dense breast tissue or when medically 20    necessary as determined by a physician licensed to 21    practice medicine in all of its branches. 22        (E) A screening MRI when medically necessary, as 23    determined by a physician licensed to practice medicine in 24    all of its branches. 25        (F) A diagnostic mammogram when medically necessary, 26    as determined by a physician licensed to practice medicine   SB0206- 10 -LRB104 08790 KTG 18845 b1    in all its branches, advanced practice registered nurse, 2    or physician assistant. 3    The Department shall not impose a deductible, coinsurance, 4copayment, or any other cost-sharing requirement on the 5coverage provided under this paragraph; except that this 6sentence does not apply to coverage of diagnostic mammograms 7to the extent such coverage would disqualify a high-deductible 8health plan from eligibility for a health savings account 9pursuant to Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 10U.S.C. 223). 11    All screenings shall include a physical breast exam, 12instruction on self-examination and information regarding the 13frequency of self-examination and its value as a preventative 14tool.15    For purposes of this Section:16    "Diagnostic mammogram" means a mammogram obtained using 17diagnostic mammography.18    "Diagnostic mammography" means a method of screening that 19is designed to evaluate an abnormality in a breast, including 20an abnormality seen or suspected on a screening mammogram or a 21subjective or objective abnormality otherwise detected in the 22breast.23    "Low-dose mammography" means the x-ray examination of the 24breast using equipment dedicated specifically for mammography, 25including the x-ray tube, filter, compression device, and 26image receptor, with an average radiation exposure delivery of   SB0206- 11 -LRB104 08790 KTG 18845 b1less than one rad per breast for 2 views of an average size 2breast. The term also includes digital mammography and 3includes breast tomosynthesis.4    "Breast tomosynthesis" means a radiologic procedure that 5involves the acquisition of projection images over the 6stationary breast to produce cross-sectional digital 7three-dimensional images of the breast.8    If, at any time, the Secretary of the United States 9Department of Health and Human Services, or its successor 10agency, promulgates rules or regulations to be published in 11the Federal Register or publishes a comment in the Federal 12Register or issues an opinion, guidance, or other action that 13would require the State, pursuant to any provision of the 14Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law 15111-148), including, but not limited to, 42 U.S.C. 1618031(d)(3)(B) or any successor provision, to defray the cost 17of any coverage for breast tomosynthesis outlined in this 18paragraph, then the requirement that an insurer cover breast 19tomosynthesis is inoperative other than any such coverage 20authorized under Section 1902 of the Social Security Act, 42 21U.S.C. 1396a, and the State shall not assume any obligation 22for the cost of coverage for breast tomosynthesis set forth in 23this paragraph.24    On and after January 1, 2016, the Department shall ensure 25that all networks of care for adult clients of the Department 26include access to at least one breast imaging Center of   SB0206- 12 -LRB104 08790 KTG 18845 b1Imaging Excellence as certified by the American College of 2Radiology.3    On and after January 1, 2012, providers participating in a 4quality improvement program approved by the Department shall 5be reimbursed for screening and diagnostic mammography at the 6same rate as the Medicare program's rates, including the 7increased reimbursement for digital mammography and, after 8January 1, 2023 (the effective date of Public Act 102-1018), 9breast tomosynthesis.10    The Department shall convene an expert panel including 11representatives of hospitals, free-standing mammography 12facilities, and doctors, including radiologists, to establish 13quality standards for mammography.14    On and after January 1, 2017, providers participating in a 15breast cancer treatment quality improvement program approved 16by the Department shall be reimbursed for breast cancer 17treatment at a rate that is no lower than 95% of the Medicare 18program's rates for the data elements included in the breast 19cancer treatment quality program.20    The Department shall convene an expert panel, including 21representatives of hospitals, free-standing breast cancer 22treatment centers, breast cancer quality organizations, and 23doctors, including breast surgeons, reconstructive breast 24surgeons, oncologists, and primary care providers to establish 25quality standards for breast cancer treatment.26    Subject to federal approval, the Department shall   SB0206- 13 -LRB104 08790 KTG 18845 b1establish a rate methodology for mammography at federally 2qualified health centers and other encounter-rate clinics. 3These clinics or centers may also collaborate with other 4hospital-based mammography facilities.

This performance 19goal shall be used to provide additional reimbursement in the 20form of a quality performance bonus to primary care providers 21who meet that goal.22    The Department shall devise a means of case-managing or 23patient navigation for beneficiaries diagnosed with breast 24cancer. This program shall initially operate as a pilot 25program in areas of the State with the highest incidence of 26mortality related to breast cancer. At least one pilot program   SB0206- 14 -LRB104 08790 KTG 18845 b1site shall be in the metropolitan Chicago area and at least one 2site shall be outside the metropolitan Chicago area. On or 3after July 1, 2016, the pilot program shall be expanded to 4include one site in western Illinois, one site in southern 5Illinois, one site in central Illinois, and 4 sites within 6metropolitan Chicago. An evaluation of the pilot program shall 7be carried out measuring health outcomes and cost of care for 8those served by the pilot program compared to similarly 9situated patients who are not served by the pilot program. 10    The Department shall require all networks of care to 11develop a means either internally or by contract with experts 12in navigation and community outreach to navigate cancer 13patients to comprehensive care in a timely fashion.
