The State 22    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 23    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 24    that the exemption holder has made a material 25    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 26    or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000   HB3172- 14 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1    gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 2    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 3    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 4    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 5    spirits.6        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 7    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 8    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 9    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 10    production and sales information of a self-distribution 11    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 12    such information to any person.13        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 14    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 15    this Section and this Act.16        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 17    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 18    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 19    licensed Illinois distributor.20        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 21    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 22    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 23    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 24    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 25    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 26    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small   HB3172- 15 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1    for distributor or importing distributor business 2    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 3    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 4    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 5    integrity of the 3-tier system. 6        (17.5)(A) A person who has a third-class wine-maker's 7    license and annually produces less than 250,000 gallons of 8    wine may make application to the Commission for a 9    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 10    than 25,000 gallons of the exemption holder's wine to 11    retail licensees per year and to sell cider, mead, or both 12    cider and mead to brewers, class 1 brewers, class 2 13    brewers, and class 3 brewers that, pursuant to subsection 14    (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or 15    any combination thereof to non-licensees at their 16    breweries.17        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 18    penalty of perjury, such person shall state (1) the date 19    it was established; (2) its volume of production and sales 20    for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to 21    establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 22    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 23    marketing of its wine; and (5) that it will comply with the 24    liquor and revenue laws of the United States, this State, 25    and any other state where it is licensed.26        (C) The State Commission shall approve the application   HB3172- 16 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1    for a self-distribution exemption if such person: (1) is 2    in compliance with State revenue and liquor laws; (2) is 3    not a member of any affiliated group that produces 4    directly or indirectly more than 250,000 gallons of wine 5    per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 50,000 6    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) will not annually 7    produce for sale more than 250,000 gallons of wine, 8    930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; and 9    (4) will not annually sell more than 25,000 gallons of its 10    wine to retail licensees.11        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 12    annually certify to the State Commission its production of 13    wine in the previous 12 months and its anticipated 14    production and sales for the next 12 months. The State 15    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 16    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 17    that the exemption holder has made a material 18    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 19    or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 250,000 20    gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 21    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 22    an affiliated group producing more than 250,000 gallons of 23    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 24    spirits.25        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 26    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly   HB3172- 17 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 2    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 3    production and sales information of a self-distribution 4    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 5    such information to any person.6        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 7    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 8    this Section and this Act.9        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17.5) shall prohibit a 10    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 11    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 12    licensed Illinois distributor.13        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17.5) to 14    promote and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly 15    finds that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 16    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 17    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 18    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 19    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small 20    for distributor or importing distributor business 21    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 22    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 23    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 24    integrity of the 3-tier system. 25        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be 26    either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer   HB3172- 18 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1    and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of 2    beer, may make application to the State Commission for a 3    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 4    than 232,500 gallons per year of the exemption holder's 5    beer to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, 6    and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of 7    Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or any 8    combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries.9        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 10    penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall 11    state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of 12    beer manufactured and sold for each year since its 13    establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor 14    relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 15    necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) 16    that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and 17    revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any 18    other state where it is licensed.19        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 20    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 21    action by the State Commission.

The 17    State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 18    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 19    that the exemption holder has made a material 20    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 21    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 22    manufacture of 930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of 23    wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits in any calendar year or 24    became part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than 25    930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 26    gallons of spirits.  HB3172- 20 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1        (E) The State Commission shall issue rules and 2    regulations governing self-distribution exemptions 3    consistent with this Act.4        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (18) shall prohibit a 5    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 6    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 7    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 8    If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a 9    distribution agreement and has assigned distribution 10    rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then 11    the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution 12    rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a 13    reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.14        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (18) to promote 15    and continue orderly markets.

The State Commission may fine, suspend, or 5    revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it 6    finds that the exemption holder has made a material 7    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 8    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 9    manufacture of 50,000 gallons of spirits, 930,000 gallons 10    of beer, or 25,000 gallons of wine in any calendar year, or 11    has become part of an affiliated group manufacturing more 12    than 50,000 gallons of spirits, 930,000 gallons of beer, 13    or 25,000 gallons of wine. 14        (E) The State Commission shall adopt rules governing 15    self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act. 16        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (19) shall prohibit a 17    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 18    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 19    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 20        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (19) to promote 21    and continue orderly markets.

Except in the case of an 24    action taken pursuant to a violation of Section 6-3, 6-5, 25    or 6-9, any action by the State Commission to suspend or   HB3172- 3 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1    revoke a licensee's license may be limited to the license 2    for the specific premises where the violation occurred. An 3    action for a violation of this Act shall be commenced by 4    the State Commission within 2 years after the date the 5    State Commission becomes aware of the violation. 6        In lieu of suspending or revoking a license, the 7    commission may impose a fine, upon the State Commission's 8    determination and notice after hearing, that a licensee 9    has violated any provision of this Act or any rule or 10    regulation issued pursuant thereto and in effect for 30 11    days prior to such violation.12        For the purpose of this paragraph (1), when 13    determining multiple violations for the sale of alcohol to 14    a person under the age of 21, a second or subsequent 15    violation for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age 16    of 21 shall only be considered if it was committed within 5 17    years after the date when a prior violation for the sale of 18    alcohol to a person under the age of 21 was committed. 19        The fine imposed under this paragraph may not exceed 20    $500 for each violation. Each day that the activity, which 21    gave rise to the original fine, continues is a separate 22    violation.

If the State Commission 23    has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaint 24    substantially alleges a violation of this Act or rules and 25    regulations adopted pursuant to this Act, it shall conduct 26    an investigation. If, after conducting an investigation,   HB3172- 7 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1    the State Commission is satisfied that the alleged 2    violation did occur, it shall proceed with disciplinary 3    action against the licensee as provided in this Act. 4        (5.4) To make arrests and issue notices of civil 5    violations where necessary for the enforcement of this 6    Act. 7        (5.5) To investigate any and all unlicensed activity. 8        (5.6) To impose civil penalties or fines to any person 9    who, without holding a valid license, engages in conduct 10    that requires a license pursuant to this Act, in an amount 11    not to exceed $20,000 for each offense as determined by 12    the State Commission.

The accounts, forms, records, and memoranda 15    shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection 16    by authorized representatives of the State Commission or 17    by any local liquor control commissioner or his or her 18    authorized representative. The commission may, from time 19    to time, alter, amend, or repeal, in whole or in part, any 20    uniform system of accounts, or the form and manner of 21    keeping accounts. 22        (8) In the conduct of any hearing authorized to be 23    held by the State Commission, to appoint, at the 24    commission's discretion, hearing officers to conduct 25    hearings involving complex issues or issues that will 26    require a protracted period of time to resolve, to   HB3172- 9 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1    examine, or cause to be examined, under oath, any 2    licensee, and to examine or cause to be examined the books 3    and records of such licensee; to hear testimony and take 4    proof material for its information in the discharge of its 5    duties hereunder; to administer or cause to be 6    administered oaths; for any such purpose to issue subpoena 7    or subpoenas to require the attendance of witnesses and 8    the production of books, which shall be effective in any 9    part of this State, and to adopt rules to implement its 10    powers under this paragraph (8). 11        Any circuit court may, by order duly entered, require 12    the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant 13    books subpoenaed by the State Commission and the court may 14    compel obedience to its order by proceedings for contempt. 15        (9) To investigate the administration of laws in 16    relation to alcoholic liquors in this and other states and 17    any foreign countries, and to recommend from time to time 18    to the Governor and through him or her to the legislature 19    of this State, such amendments to this Act, if any, as it 20    may think desirable and as will serve to further the 21    general broad purposes contained in Section 1-2 hereof. 22        (10) To adopt such rules and regulations consistent 23    with the provisions of this Act which shall be necessary 24    for the control, sale, or disposition of alcoholic liquor 25    damaged as a result of an accident, wreck, flood, fire, or 26    other similar occurrence.   HB3172- 10 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1        (11) To develop industry educational programs related 2    to responsible serving and selling, particularly in the 3    areas of overserving consumers and illegal underage 4    purchasing and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 5        (11.1) To license persons providing education and 6    training to alcohol beverage sellers and servers for 7    mandatory and non-mandatory training under the Beverage 8    Alcohol Sellers and Servers Education and Training 9    (BASSET) programs and to develop and administer a public 10    awareness program in Illinois to reduce or eliminate the 11    illegal purchase and consumption of alcoholic beverage 12    products by persons under the age of 21.

As part of its report, the State 25    Commission shall provide all of the following information:26            (A) The amount of State excise and sales tax   HB3172- 11 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1        revenues generated.2            (B) The amount of licensing fees received.3            (C) The number of cases of wine shipped from 4        inside and outside of this State directly to residents 5        of this State.6            (D) The number of alcohol compliance operations 7        conducted.8            (E) The number of winery shipper's licenses 9        issued.10            (F) The number of each of the following: reported 11        violations; cease and desist notices issued by the 12        Commission; notices of violations issued by the 13        Commission and to the Department of Revenue; and 14        notices and complaints of violations to law 15        enforcement officials, including, without limitation, 16        the Illinois Attorney General and the U.S. Department 17        of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade 18        Bureau.19        (15) As a means to reduce the underage consumption of 20    alcoholic liquors, the State Commission shall conduct 21    alcohol compliance operations to investigate whether 22    businesses that are soliciting, selling, and shipping wine 23    from inside or outside of this State directly to residents 24    of this State are licensed by this State or are selling or 25    attempting to sell wine to persons under 21 years of age in 26    violation of this Act.  HB3172- 12 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1        (16) The State Commission shall, in addition to 2    notifying any appropriate law enforcement agency, submit 3    notices of complaints or violations of Sections 6-29 and 4    6-29.1 by persons who do not hold a winery shipper's 5    license under this Act to the Illinois Attorney General 6    and to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Alcohol and 7    Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.8        (17)(A) A person licensed to make wine under the laws 9    of another state who has a winery shipper's license under 10    this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of 11    wine or a person who has a first-class or second-class 12    wine manufacturer's license, a first-class or second-class 13    wine-maker's license, or a limited wine manufacturer's 14    license under this Act and annually produces less than 15    25,000 gallons of wine may make application to the 16    Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the 17    sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the exemption 18    holder's wine to retail licensees per year and to sell 19    cider, mead, or both cider and mead to brewers, class 1 20    brewers, class 2 brewers, and class 3 brewers that, 21    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 22    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 23    non-licensees at their breweries.24        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 25    penalty of perjury, such person shall state (1) the date 26    it was established; (2) its volume of production and sales   HB3172- 13 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1    for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to 2    establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 3    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 4    marketing of its wine; and (5) that it will comply with the 5    liquor and revenue laws of the United States, this State, 6    and any other state where it is licensed.7        (C) The State Commission shall approve the application 8    for a self-distribution exemption if such person: (1) is 9    in compliance with State revenue and liquor laws; (2) is 10    not a member of any affiliated group that produces 11    directly or indirectly more than 25,000 gallons of wine 12    per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 50,000 13    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) will not annually 14    produce for sale more than 25,000 gallons of wine, 930,000 15    gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; and (4) 16    will not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its wine 17    to retail licensees.18        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 19    annually certify to the State Commission its production of 20    wine in the previous 12 months and its anticipated 21    production and sales for the next 12 months. The State 22    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 23    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 24    that the exemption holder has made a material 25    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 26    or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000   HB3172- 14 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1    gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 2    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 3    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 4    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 5    spirits.6        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 7    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 8    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 9    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 10    production and sales information of a self-distribution 11    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 12    such information to any person.13        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 14    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 15    this Section and this Act.16        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 17    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 18    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 19    licensed Illinois distributor.20        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 21    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 22    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 23    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 24    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 25    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 26    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small   HB3172- 15 -LRB104 08306 RPS 18357 b1    for distributor or importing distributor business 2    strategies.
