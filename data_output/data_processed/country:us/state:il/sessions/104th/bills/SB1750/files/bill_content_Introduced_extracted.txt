In all other 12counties, the amount of the exemption is as follows: (i) 13through taxable year 2005 and for taxable year 2007 and 14thereafter, the amount of this exemption shall be the 15equalized assessed value of the residence in the taxable year 16for which application is made minus the base amount; and (ii) 17for taxable year 2006, the amount of the exemption is as 18follows:19        (1) For an applicant who has a household income of 20    $45,000 or less, the amount of the exemption is the 21    equalized assessed value of the residence in the taxable 22    year for which application is made minus the base amount.23        (2) For an applicant who has a household income 24    exceeding $45,000 but not exceeding $46,250, the amount of 25    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 26    residence in the taxable year for which application is   SB1750- 7 -LRB104 09307 HLH 19365 b1    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.8.2        (3) For an applicant who has a household income 3    exceeding $46,250 but not exceeding $47,500, the amount of 4    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 5    residence in the taxable year for which application is 6    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.6.7        (4) For an applicant who has a household income 8    exceeding $47,500 but not exceeding $48,750, the amount of 9    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 10    residence in the taxable year for which application is 11    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.4.12        (5) For an applicant who has a household income 13    exceeding $48,750 but not exceeding $50,000, the amount of 14    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 15    residence in the taxable year for which application is 16    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.2. 17    When the applicant is a surviving spouse of an applicant 18for a prior year for the same residence for which an exemption 19under this Section has been granted, the base year and base 20amount for that residence are the same as for the applicant for 21the prior year.22    Each year at the time the assessment books are certified 23to the County Clerk, the Board of Review or Board of Appeals 24shall give to the County Clerk a list of the assessed values of 25improvements on each parcel qualifying for this exemption that 26were added after the base year for this parcel and that   SB1750- 8 -LRB104 09307 HLH 19365 b1increased the assessed value of the property.2    In the case of land improved with an apartment building 3owned and operated as a cooperative or a building that is a 4life care facility that qualifies as a cooperative, the 5maximum reduction from the equalized assessed value of the 6property is limited to the sum of the reductions calculated 7for each unit occupied as a residence by a person or persons 8(i) 65 years of age or older, (ii) with a household income that 9does not exceed the maximum income limitation, (iii) who is 10liable, by contract with the owner or owners of record, for 11paying real property taxes on the property, and (iv) who is an 12owner of record of a legal or equitable interest in the 13cooperative apartment building, other than a leasehold 14interest. In the instance of a cooperative where a homestead 15exemption has been granted under this Section, the cooperative 16association or its management firm shall credit the savings 17resulting from that exemption only to the apportioned tax 18liability of the owner who qualified for the exemption.

The Chief County Assessment Officer 4in a county with 3,000,000 or more inhabitants may request 5full social security numbers or individual taxpayer 6identification numbers, as appropriate, for all members of the 7applicant's household. If, in a subsequent year, the Chief 8County Assessment Officer is able to confirm both that the 9applicant still owns and resides at the subject property and 10that applicant's household income still qualifies for the 11exemption under this Section, that Chief County Assessment 12Officer may renew the exemption without a new application.

In addition, in taxable year 1997, the applicant's 15exemption shall also include an amount equal to (i) the amount 16of any exemption denied to the applicant in taxable year 1995 17as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, as the base year, 18(ii) the amount of any exemption denied to the applicant in 19taxable year 1996 as a result of using 1994, rather than 1993, 20as the base year, and (iii) the amount of the exemption 21erroneously denied for taxable year 1994.22    For purposes of this Section, a person who will be 65 years 23of age during the current taxable year shall be eligible to 24apply for the homestead exemption during that taxable year. 25Application shall be made during the application period in 26effect for the county of his or her residence.   SB1750- 14 -LRB104 09307 HLH 19365 b1    The Chief County Assessment Officer may determine the 2eligibility of a life care facility that qualifies as a 3cooperative to receive the benefits provided by this Section 4by use of an affidavit, application, visual inspection, 5questionnaire, or other reasonable method in order to insure 6that the tax savings resulting from the exemption are credited 7by the management firm to the apportioned tax liability of 8each qualifying resident.
