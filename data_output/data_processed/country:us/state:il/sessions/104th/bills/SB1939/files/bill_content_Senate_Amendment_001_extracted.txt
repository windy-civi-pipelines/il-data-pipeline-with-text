The reasonable facilities requirement 9    set forth in item (ii) of subsection (d)(8) shall not 10    include any requirement that a franchisee establish or 11    maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display 12    space.

A motor vehicle dealer must provide a written 17    notification of its intent to add a make or line of new 18    motor vehicles to the manufacturer. If the manufacturer 19    does not respond to the motor vehicle dealer, in writing, 20    objecting to the addition of the make or line within 60 21    days after the date that the motor vehicle dealer sends 22    the written notification, then the manufacturer shall be 23    deemed to have approved the addition of the make or line; 24        (9) to use or consider the performance of a motor 25    vehicle dealer relating to the sale of the manufacturer's, 26    distributor's, or wholesaler's vehicles or the motor   10400SB1939sam001- 18 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    vehicle dealer's ability to satisfy any minimum sales or 2    market share quota or responsibility relating to the sale 3    of the manufacturer's, distributor's, or wholesaler's new 4    vehicles in determining:5            (A) the motor vehicle dealer's eligibility to 6        purchase program, certified, or other used motor 7        vehicles from the manufacturer, distributor, or 8        wholesaler;9            (B) the volume, type, or model of program, 10        certified, or other used motor vehicles that a motor 11        vehicle dealer is eligible to purchase from the 12        manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler;13            (C) the price of any program, certified, or other 14        used motor vehicle that the dealer is eligible to 15        purchase from the manufacturer, distributor, or 16        wholesaler; or17            (D) the availability or amount of any discount, 18        credit, rebate, or sales incentive that the dealer is 19        eligible to receive from the manufacturer, 20        distributor, or wholesaler for the purchase of any 21        program, certified, or other used motor vehicle 22        offered for sale by the manufacturer, distributor, or 23        wholesaler;24        (10) to take any adverse action against a dealer 25    pursuant to an export or sale-for-resale prohibition 26    because the dealer sold or leased a vehicle to a customer   10400SB1939sam001- 19 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    who either exported the vehicle to a foreign country or 2    resold the vehicle in violation of the prohibition, unless 3    the export or sale-for-resale prohibition policy was 4    provided to the dealer in writing either electronically or 5    on paper, prior to the sale or lease, and the dealer knew 6    or reasonably should have known of the customer's intent 7    to export or resell the vehicle in violation of the 8    prohibition at the time of the sale or lease. If the dealer 9    causes the vehicle to be registered and titled in this or 10    any other state, and collects or causes to be collected 11    any applicable sales or use tax to this State, a 12    rebuttable presumption is established that the dealer did 13    not have reason to know of the customer's intent to resell 14    the vehicle;15        (11) to coerce or require any dealer to construct 16    improvements to his or her facilities or to install new 17    signs or other franchiser image elements that replace or 18    substantially alter those improvements, signs, or 19    franchiser image elements completed within the past 10 20    years that were required and approved by the manufacturer 21    or one of its affiliates. The 10-year period under this 22    paragraph (11) begins to run for a dealer, including that 23    dealer's successors and assigns, on the date that the 24    manufacturer gives final written approval of the facility 25    improvements or installation of signs or other franchiser 26    image elements or the date that the dealer receives a   10400SB1939sam001- 20 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    certificate of occupancy, whichever is later. For the 2    purpose of this paragraph (11), the term "substantially 3    alter" does not include routine maintenance, including, 4    but not limited to, interior painting, that is reasonably 5    necessary to keep a dealer facility in attractive 6    condition; or 7        (12) to require a dealer to purchase goods or services 8    to make improvements to the dealer's facilities from a 9    vendor selected, identified, or designated by a 10    manufacturer or one of its affiliates by agreement, 11    program, incentive provision, or otherwise without making 12    available to the dealer the option to obtain the goods or 13    services of substantially similar quality and overall 14    design from a vendor chosen by the dealer and approved by 15    the manufacturer; however, approval by the manufacturer 16    shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the dealer's 17    option to select a vendor shall not be available if the 18    manufacturer provides substantial reimbursement for the 19    goods or services offered. "Substantial reimbursement" 20    means an amount equal to or greater than the cost savings 21    that would result if the dealer were to utilize a vendor of 22    the dealer's own selection instead of using the vendor 23    identified by the manufacturer. For the purpose of this 24    paragraph (12), the term "goods" does not include movable 25    displays, brochures, and promotional materials containing 26    material subject to the intellectual property rights of a   10400SB1939sam001- 21 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    manufacturer. If signs, other than signs containing the 2    manufacturer's brand or logo or free-standing signs that 3    are not directly attached to a building, or other 4    franchiser image or design elements or trade dress are to 5    be leased to the dealer by a vendor selected, identified, 6    or designated by the manufacturer, the dealer has the 7    right to purchase the signs or other franchiser image or 8    design elements or trade dress of substantially similar 9    quality and design from a vendor selected by the dealer if 10    the signs, franchiser image or design elements, or trade 11    dress are approved by the manufacturer. Approval by the 12    manufacturer shall not be unreasonably withheld.

This 20    paragraph (12) shall not be construed to permit a dealer 21    to erect or maintain signs that do not conform to the 22    manufacturer's intellectual property rights or trademark 23    or trade dress usage guidelines. 24        (13) to establish or utilize any common entity, 25    affiliate, or spin-off company to sell, lease, or 26    otherwise distribute new motor vehicles directly to   10400SB1939sam001- 22 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    consumers or to circumvent the manufacturer's new motor 2    vehicle distribution obligations under this Act, if the 3    manufacturer, including any common entities, subsidiaries, 4    or affiliates, currently or previously maintained a 5    franchise or selling agreement with a motor vehicle dealer 6    for the retail sale of motor vehicles in this State. 7    (e) It shall be deemed a violation for a manufacturer, a 8distributor, a wholesaler, a distributor branch or division or 9officer, agent or other representative thereof:10        (1) to resort to or use any false or misleading 11    advertisement in connection with his business as such 12    manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch 13    or division or officer, agent or other representative 14    thereof;15        (2) to offer to sell or lease, or to sell or lease, any 16    new motor vehicle to any motor vehicle dealer at a lower 17    actual price therefor than the actual price offered to any 18    other motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle 19    similarly equipped or to utilize any device including, but 20    not limited to, sales promotion plans or programs which 21    result in such lesser actual price or fail to make 22    available to any motor vehicle dealer any preferential 23    pricing, incentive, rebate, finance rate, or low interest 24    loan program offered to competing motor vehicle dealers in 25    other contiguous states. However, the provisions of this 26    paragraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle   10400SB1939sam001- 23 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    dealer for resale to any unit of the United States 2    Government, the State or any of its political 3    subdivisions;4        (3) to offer to sell or lease, or to sell or lease, any 5    new motor vehicle to any person, except a wholesaler, 6    distributor or manufacturer's employees at a lower actual 7    price therefor than the actual price offered and charged 8    to a motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle 9    similarly equipped or to utilize any device which results 10    in such lesser actual price. However, the provisions of 11    this paragraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle 12    dealer for resale to any unit of the United States 13    Government, the State or any of its political 14    subdivisions;15        (4) to prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or 16    otherwise any motor vehicle dealer or franchisee from 17    changing the executive management control of the motor 18    vehicle dealer or franchisee unless the franchiser, having 19    the burden of proof, proves that such change of executive 20    management will result in executive management control by 21    a person or persons who are not of good moral character or 22    who do not meet the franchiser's existing and, with 23    consideration given to the volume of sales and service of 24    the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 25    experience standards in the market area. However, where 26    the manufacturer rejects a proposed change in executive   10400SB1939sam001- 24 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    management control, the manufacturer shall give written 2    notice of his reasons to the dealer within 60 days of 3    notice to the manufacturer by the dealer of the proposed 4    change. If the manufacturer does not send a letter to the 5    franchisee by certified mail, return receipt requested, 6    within 60 days from receipt by the manufacturer of the 7    proposed change, then the change of the executive 8    management control of the franchisee shall be deemed 9    accepted as proposed by the franchisee, and the 10    manufacturer shall give immediate effect to such change;11        (5) to prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or 12    otherwise any motor vehicle dealer from establishing or 13    changing the capital structure of his dealership or the 14    means by or through which he finances the operation 15    thereof; provided the dealer meets any reasonable capital 16    standards agreed to between the dealer and the 17    manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler, who may require 18    that the sources, method and manner by which the dealer 19    finances or intends to finance its operation, equipment or 20    facilities be fully disclosed; 21        (6) to refuse to give effect to or prevent or attempt 22    to prevent by contract or otherwise any motor vehicle 23    dealer or any officer, partner or stockholder of any motor 24    vehicle dealer from selling or transferring any part of 25    the interest of any of them to any other person or persons 26    or party or parties unless such sale or transfer is to a   10400SB1939sam001- 25 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    transferee who would not otherwise qualify for a new motor 2    vehicle dealers license under the Illinois Vehicle Code or 3    unless the franchiser, having the burden of proof, proves 4    that such sale or transfer is to a person or party who is 5    not of good moral character or does not meet the 6    franchiser's existing and reasonable capital standards 7    and, with consideration given to the volume of sales and 8    service of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum 9    business experience standards in the market area. However, 10    nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a franchiser 11    from implementing affirmative action programs providing 12    business opportunities for minorities or from complying 13    with applicable federal, State or local law:14            (A) If the manufacturer intends to refuse to 15        approve the sale or transfer of all or a part of the 16        interest, then it shall, within 60 days from receipt 17        of the completed application forms generally utilized 18        by a manufacturer to conduct its review and a copy of 19        all agreements regarding the proposed transfer, send a 20        letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, 21        advising the franchisee of any refusal to approve the 22        sale or transfer of all or part of the interest and 23        shall state that the dealer only has 30 days from the 24        receipt of the notice to file with the Motor Vehicle 25        Review Board a written protest against the proposed 26        action. The notice shall set forth specific criteria   10400SB1939sam001- 26 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        used to evaluate the prospective transferee and the 2        grounds for refusing to approve the sale or transfer 3        to that transferee. Within 30 days from the 4        franchisee's receipt of the manufacturer's notice, the 5        franchisee may file with the Board a written protest 6        against the proposed action.7            When a protest has been timely filed, the Board 8        shall enter an order, fixing the date (within 60 days 9        of the date of such order), time, and place of a 10        hearing on the protest, required under Sections 12 and 11        29 of this Act, and send by certified mail, return 12        receipt requested, a copy of the order to the 13        manufacturer that filed notice of intention of the 14        proposed action and to the protesting franchisee.15            The manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to 16        establish that good cause exists to refuse to approve 17        the sale or transfer to the transferee. The 18        determination whether good cause exists to refuse to 19        approve the sale or transfer shall be made by the Board 20        under subdivisions (6)(B). The manufacturer shall not 21        refuse to approve the sale or transfer by a dealer or 22        an officer, partner, or stockholder of a franchise or 23        any part of the interest to any person or persons 24        before the hearing process is concluded as prescribed 25        by this Act, and thereafter if the Board determines 26        that the manufacturer has failed to meet its burden of   10400SB1939sam001- 27 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        proof and that good cause does not exist to refuse to 2        approve the sale or transfer to the transferee.3            (B) Good cause to refuse to approve such sale or 4        transfer under this Section is established when such 5        sale or transfer is to a transferee who would not 6        otherwise qualify for a new motor vehicle dealers 7        license under the Illinois Vehicle Code or such sale 8        or transfer is to a person or party who is not of good 9        moral character or does not meet the franchiser's 10        existing and reasonable capital standards and, with 11        consideration given to the volume of sales and service 12        of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 13        experience standards in the market area.14        (7) to obtain money, goods, services, anything of 15    value, or any other benefit from any other person with 16    whom the motor vehicle dealer does business, on account of 17    or in relation to the transactions between the dealer and 18    the other person as compensation, except for services 19    actually rendered, unless such benefit is promptly 20    accounted for and transmitted to the motor vehicle dealer;21        (8) to grant an additional franchise in the relevant 22    market area of an existing franchise of the same line make 23    or to relocate an existing motor vehicle dealership within 24    or into a relevant market area of an existing franchise of 25    the same line make. However, if the manufacturer wishes to 26    grant such an additional franchise to an independent   10400SB1939sam001- 28 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    person in a bona fide relationship in which such person is 2    prepared to make a significant investment subject to loss 3    in such a dealership, or if the manufacturer wishes to 4    relocate an existing motor vehicle dealership, then the 5    manufacturer shall send a letter by certified mail, return 6    receipt requested, to each existing dealer or dealers of 7    the same line make whose relevant market area includes the 8    proposed location of the additional or relocated franchise 9    at least 60 days before the manufacturer grants an 10    additional franchise or relocates an existing franchise of 11    the same line make within or into the relevant market area 12    of an existing franchisee of the same line make. Each 13    notice shall set forth the specific grounds for the 14    proposed grant of an additional or relocation of an 15    existing franchise and shall state that the dealer has 16    only 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice to file 17    with the Motor Vehicle Review Board a written protest 18    against the proposed action. Unless the parties agree upon 19    the grant or establishment of the additional or relocated 20    franchise within 30 days from the date the notice was 21    received by the existing franchisee of the same line make 22    or any person entitled to receive such notice, the 23    franchisee or other person may file with the Board a 24    written protest against the grant or establishment of the 25    proposed additional or relocated franchise.26        When a protest has been timely filed, the Board shall   10400SB1939sam001- 29 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    enter an order fixing a date (within 60 days of the date of 2    the order), time, and place of a hearing on the protest, 3    required under Sections 12 and 29 of this Act, and send by 4    certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, a 5    copy of the order to the manufacturer that filed the 6    notice of intention to grant or establish the proposed 7    additional or relocated franchise and to the protesting 8    dealer or dealers of the same line make whose relevant 9    market area includes the proposed location of the 10    additional or relocated franchise. 11        When more than one protest is filed against the grant 12    or establishment of the additional or relocated franchise 13    of the same line make, the Board may consolidate the 14    hearings to expedite disposition of the matter. The 15    manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to establish 16    that good cause exists to allow the grant or establishment 17    of the additional or relocated franchise. The manufacturer 18    may not grant or establish the additional franchise or 19    relocate the existing franchise before the hearing process 20    is concluded as prescribed by this Act, and thereafter if 21    the Board determines that the manufacturer has failed to 22    meet its burden of proof and that good cause does not exist 23    to allow the grant or establishment of the additional 24    franchise or relocation of the existing franchise.25        The determination whether good cause exists for 26    allowing the grant or establishment of an additional   10400SB1939sam001- 30 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    franchise or relocated existing franchise, shall be made 2    by the Board under subsection (c) of Section 12 of this 3    Act. If the manufacturer seeks to enter into a contract, 4    agreement or other arrangement with any person, 5    establishing any additional motor vehicle dealership or 6    other facility, limited to the sale of factory repurchase 7    vehicles or late model vehicles, then the manufacturer 8    shall follow the notice procedures set forth in this 9    Section and the determination whether good cause exists 10    for allowing the proposed agreement shall be made by the 11    Board under subsection (c) of Section 12, with the 12    manufacturer having the burden of proof.13            A. (Blank).14            B. For the purposes of this Section, appointment 15        of a successor motor vehicle dealer at the same 16        location as its predecessor, or within 2 miles of such 17        location, or the relocation of an existing dealer or 18        franchise within 2 miles of the relocating dealer's or 19        franchisee's existing location, shall not be construed 20        as a grant, establishment or the entering into of an 21        additional franchise or selling agreement, or a 22        relocation of an existing franchise. The reopening of 23        a motor vehicle dealership that has not been in 24        operation for 18 months or more shall be deemed the 25        grant of an additional franchise or selling agreement.26            C. This Section does not apply to the relocation   10400SB1939sam001- 31 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        of an existing dealership or franchise in a county 2        having a population of more than 300,000 persons when 3        the new location is within the dealer's current 4        relevant market area, provided the new location is 5        more than 7 miles from the nearest dealer of the same 6        line make. This Section does not apply to the 7        relocation of an existing dealership or franchise in a 8        county having a population of less than 300,000 9        persons when the new location is within the dealer's 10        current relevant market area, provided the new 11        location is more than 12 miles from the nearest dealer 12        of the same line make. A dealer that would be farther 13        away from the new location of an existing dealership 14        or franchise of the same line make after a relocation 15        may not file a written protest against the relocation 16        with the Motor Vehicle Review Board.17            D. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to 18        prevent a franchiser from implementing affirmative 19        action programs providing business opportunities for 20        minorities or from complying with applicable federal, 21        State or local law;22        (9) to require a motor vehicle dealer to assent to a 23    release, assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which 24    would relieve any person from liability imposed by this 25    Act;26        (10) to prevent or refuse to give effect to the   10400SB1939sam001- 32 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    succession to the ownership or management control of a 2    dealership by any legatee under the will of a dealer or to 3    an heir under the laws of descent and distribution of this 4    State unless the franchisee has designated a successor to 5    the ownership or management control under the succession 6    provisions of the franchise. Unless the franchiser, having 7    the burden of proof, proves that the successor is a person 8    who is not of good moral character or does not meet the 9    franchiser's existing and reasonable capital standards 10    and, with consideration given to the volume of sales and 11    service of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum 12    business experience standards in the market area, any 13    designated successor of a dealer or franchisee may succeed 14    to the ownership or management control of a dealership 15    under the existing franchise if:16                (i) The designated successor gives the 17            franchiser written notice by certified mail, 18            return receipt requested, of his or her intention 19            to succeed to the ownership of the dealer within 20            60 days of the dealer's death or incapacity; and21                (ii) The designated successor agrees to be 22            bound by all the terms and conditions of the 23            existing franchise.24        Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the motor 25    vehicle dealer or franchisee and manufacturer have duly 26    executed an agreement concerning succession rights prior   10400SB1939sam001- 33 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    to the dealer's death or incapacitation, the agreement 2    shall be observed.3            (A) If the franchiser intends to refuse to honor 4        the successor to the ownership of a deceased or 5        incapacitated dealer or franchisee under an existing 6        franchise agreement, the franchiser shall send a 7        letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, to 8        the designated successor within 60 days from receipt 9        of a proposal advising of its intent to refuse to honor 10        the succession and to discontinue the existing 11        franchise agreement and shall state that the 12        designated successor only has 30 days from the receipt 13        of the notice to file with the Motor Vehicle Review 14        Board a written protest against the proposed action. 15        The notice shall set forth the specific grounds for 16        the refusal to honor the succession and discontinue 17        the existing franchise agreement.18            If notice of refusal is not timely served upon the 19        designated successor, the franchise agreement shall 20        continue in effect subject to termination only as 21        otherwise permitted by paragraph (6) of subsection (d) 22        of Section 4 of this Act.23            Within 30 days from the date the notice was 24        received by the designated successor or any other 25        person entitled to notice, the designee or other 26        person may file with the Board a written protest   10400SB1939sam001- 34 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        against the proposed action.2            When a protest has been timely filed, the Board 3        shall enter an order, fixing a date (within 60 days of 4        the date of the order), time, and place of a hearing on 5        the protest, required under Sections 12 and 29 of this 6        Act, and send by certified mail, return receipt 7        requested, a copy of the order to the franchiser that 8        filed the notice of intention of the proposed action 9        and to the protesting designee or such other person.10            The manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to 11        establish that good cause exists to refuse to honor 12        the succession and discontinue the existing franchise 13        agreement. The determination whether good cause exists 14        to refuse to honor the succession shall be made by the 15        Board under subdivision (B) of this paragraph (10). 16        The manufacturer shall not refuse to honor the 17        succession or discontinue the existing franchise 18        agreement before the hearing process is concluded as 19        prescribed by this Act, and thereafter if the Board 20        determines that it has failed to meet its burden of 21        proof and that good cause does not exist to refuse to 22        honor the succession and discontinue the existing 23        franchise agreement.24            (B) No manufacturer shall impose any conditions 25        upon honoring the succession and continuing the 26        existing franchise agreement with the designated   10400SB1939sam001- 35 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        successor other than that the franchisee has 2        designated a successor to the ownership or management 3        control under the succession provisions of the 4        franchise, or that the designated successor is of good 5        moral character or meets the reasonable capital 6        standards and, with consideration given to the volume 7        of sales and service of the dealership, uniformly 8        applied minimum business experience standards in the 9        market area;10        (11) to prevent or refuse to approve a proposal to 11    establish a successor franchise at a location previously 12    approved by the franchiser when submitted with the 13    voluntary termination by the existing franchisee unless 14    the successor franchisee would not otherwise qualify for a 15    new motor vehicle dealer's license under the Illinois 16    Vehicle Code or unless the franchiser, having the burden 17    of proof, proves that such proposed successor is not of 18    good moral character or does not meet the franchiser's 19    existing and reasonable capital standards and, with 20    consideration given to the volume of sales and service of 21    the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 22    experience standards in the market area. However, when 23    such a rejection of a proposal is made, the manufacturer 24    shall give written notice of its reasons to the franchisee 25    within 60 days of receipt by the manufacturer of the 26    proposal. However, nothing herein shall be construed to   10400SB1939sam001- 36 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    prevent a franchiser from implementing affirmative action 2    programs providing business opportunities for minorities, 3    or from complying with applicable federal, State or local 4    law;5        (12) to prevent or refuse to grant a franchise to a 6    person because such person owns, has investment in or 7    participates in the management of or holds a franchise for 8    the sale of another make or line of motor vehicles within 7 9    miles of the proposed franchise location in a county 10    having a population of more than 300,000 persons, or 11    within 12 miles of the proposed franchise location in a 12    county having a population of less than 300,000 persons;13        (13) to prevent or attempt to prevent any new motor 14    vehicle dealer from establishing any additional motor 15    vehicle dealership or other facility limited to the sale 16    of factory repurchase vehicles or late model vehicles or 17    otherwise offering for sale factory repurchase vehicles of 18    the same line make at an existing franchise by failing to 19    make available any contract, agreement or other 20    arrangement which is made available or otherwise offered 21    to any person; or22        (14) to exercise a right of first refusal or other 23    right to acquire a franchise from a dealer, unless the 24    manufacturer:25            (A) notifies the dealer in writing that it intends 26        to exercise its right to acquire the franchise not   10400SB1939sam001- 37 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        later than 60 days after the manufacturer's or 2        distributor's receipt of a notice of the proposed 3        transfer from the dealer and all information and 4        documents reasonably and customarily required by the 5        manufacturer or distributor supporting the proposed 6        transfer;7            (B) pays to the dealer the same or greater 8        consideration as the dealer has contracted to receive 9        in connection with the proposed transfer or sale of 10        all or substantially all of the dealership assets, 11        stock, or other ownership interest, including the 12        purchase or lease of all real property, leasehold, or 13        improvements related to the transfer or sale of the 14        dealership. Upon exercise of the right of first 15        refusal or such other right, the manufacturer or 16        distributor shall have the right to assign the lease 17        or to convey the real property;18            (C) assumes all of the duties, obligations, and 19        liabilities contained in the agreements that were to 20        be assumed by the proposed transferee and with respect 21        to which the manufacturer or distributor exercised the 22        right of first refusal or other right to acquire the 23        franchise;24            (D) reimburses the proposed transferee for all 25        reasonable expenses incurred in evaluating, 26        investigating, and negotiating the transfer of the   10400SB1939sam001- 38 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        dealership prior to the manufacturer's or 2        distributor's exercise of its right of first refusal 3        or other right to acquire the dealership.

No successor dealer, other than the former 4    franchisee, may be appointed or franchised by the 5    successor manufacturer within the relevant market area of 6    the former franchisee until the Board has held a hearing 7    and rendered a determination on the issue of whether the 8    successor manufacturer would have had good cause to 9    terminate the former franchisee. 10    In the event that a successor manufacturer attempts to 11enter into a same line make franchise with any person or to 12permit the relocation of any existing line make franchise 13under this subsection (h) at a location that is within the 14relevant market area of 2 or more former franchisees, then the 15successor manufacturer may not offer it to any person other 16than one of those former franchisees unless the successor 17manufacturer can prove that at least one of the 3 exceptions in 18items (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection (h) applies to each 19of those former franchisees. 20    (i) It shall be deemed a violation of this Section for any 21manufacturer with an established franchise dealer network in 22this State, either directly or indirectly, through any parent, 23subsidiary, affiliate, or agent of the manufacturer, any 24person under common ownership or control, or common entity, to 25engage in the sale, lease, or warranty servicing of new motor 26vehicles in a manner that bypasses or competes with the   10400SB1939sam001- 49 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1manufacturer's existing franchisee network, including, but not 2limited to:3        (1) engaging in practices intended to circumvent, 4    evade, or undermine the rights, obligations, or 5    protections afforded to franchisees under this Act; or6        (2) establishing or using newly branded entities, 7    spin-offs, or affiliated or subsidiary entities to conduct 8    retail operations outside the franchise system.9    (j) A manufacturer or distributor shall not engage in the 10sale of new motor vehicles directly to the general public in 11this State unless the manufacturer or distributor was lawfully 12licensed to sell new motor vehicles directly to consumers in 13this State before January 1, 2022.14(Source: P.A. 102-433, eff. 1-1-22.) 15    (815 ILCS 710/6)  (from Ch. 121 1/2, par. 756)16    Sec. 6. Warranty agreements; claims; approval; payment; 17written disapproval.18    (a) Every manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, 19distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or 20wholesale branch or division shall properly fulfill any 21warranty agreement and adequately and fairly compensate each 22of its motor vehicle dealers for labor and parts.23    (b) Adequate and fair compensation requires the 24manufacturer to pay each dealer no less than the amount the 25retail customer pays for the same services with regard to rate   10400SB1939sam001- 50 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1and time.2    Any time guide previously agreed to by the manufacturer 3and the dealer for extended warranty repairs may be used in 4lieu of actual time expended. In the event that a time guide 5has not been agreed to for warranty repairs, or said time guide 6does not define time for an applicable warranty repair, the 7manufacturer's time guide shall be used, multiplied by 1.5. 8    In no event shall such compensation fail to include full 9compensation for diagnostic work, as well as repair service, 10labor, and parts. Time allowances for the diagnosis and 11performance of warranty work and service shall be no less than 12charged to retail customers for the same work to be performed.13    No warranty or factory compensated repairs shall be 14excluded from this requirement, including recalls or other 15voluntary stop-sell repairs required by the manufacturer. If a 16manufacturer is required to issue a recall, the dealer will be 17compensated for labor time as above stated.18    Furthermore, manufacturers shall pay the dealer the same 19effective labor rate (using the 100 sequential repair orders 20chosen and submitted by the dealer less simple maintenance 21repair orders) that the dealer receives for customer-pay 22repairs. This requirement includes vehicle diagnostic times 23for all warranty repairs. Additionally, if a technician is 24required to communicate with a Technical Assistance 25Center/Engineering/or some external manufacturer source in 26order to provide a warranty repair, the manufacturer shall pay   10400SB1939sam001- 51 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1for the time from start of communications (including hold 2time) until the communication is complete.3    The dealer may submit a request to the manufacturer for 4warranty labor rate increases a maximum of once per calendar 5year.6    A claim made by a franchised motor vehicle dealer for 7compensation under this Section shall be either approved or 8disapproved within 30 days after the claim is submitted to the 9manufacturer in the manner and on the forms the manufacturer 10reasonably prescribes. An approved claim shall be paid within 1130 days after its approval. If a claim is not specifically 12disapproved in writing or by electronic transmission within 30 13days after the date on which the manufacturer receives it, the 14claim shall be considered to be approved and payment shall 15follow within 30 days. 16    In no event shall compensation to a motor vehicle dealer 17for labor times and labor rates be less than the rates charged 18by such dealer for like service to retail customers for 19nonwarranty service and repairs. Additionally, the 20manufacturer shall reimburse the dealer for any parts provided 21in satisfaction of a warranty at the prevailing retail price 22charged by that dealer for the same parts when not provided in 23satisfaction of a warranty; provided that such dealer's 24prevailing retail price is not unreasonable when compared with 25that of the holders of motor vehicle franchises of from the 26same line make manufacturer for identical parts in the   10400SB1939sam001- 52 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1geographic area in which the dealer is engaged in business.2    There shall be no reduction in payments due to 3preestablished market norms or market averages. Manufacturers 4are prohibited from establishing restrictions or limitations 5of customer repair frequency due to failure rate indexes or 6national failure averages.7    No debit reduction or charge back of any item on a warranty 8repair order may be made absent a finding of fraud or illegal 9actions by the dealer.10    A warranty claim timely made shall not be deemed invalid 11solely because unavailable parts cause additional use and 12mileage on the vehicle.13    If a manufacturer imposes a recall or stop sale on any new 14vehicle in a dealer's inventory that prevents the sale of the 15vehicle, the manufacturer shall compensate the dealer for any 16interest and storage until the vehicle is repaired and made 17ready for sale.18    Manufacturers are not permitted to impose any form of cost 19recovery fees or surcharges against a franchised auto 20dealership for payments made in accordance with this Section. 21    All claims, either original or resubmitted, made by motor 22vehicle dealers hereunder and under Section 5 for such labor 23and parts shall be either approved or disapproved within 30 24days following their submission. All approved claims shall be 25paid within 30 days following their approval. The motor 26vehicle dealer who submits a claim which is disapproved shall   10400SB1939sam001- 53 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1be notified in writing of the disapproval within the same 2period, and each such notice shall state the specific grounds 3upon which the disapproval is based. The motor vehicle dealer 4shall be permitted to correct and resubmit such disapproved 5claims within 30 days of receipt of disapproval. Any claims 6not specifically disapproved in writing within 30 days from 7their submission shall be deemed approved and payment shall 8follow within 30 days. The manufacturer or franchiser shall 9have the right to require reasonable documentation for claims 10and to audit such claims within a one year period from the date 11the claim was paid or credit issued by the manufacturer or 12franchiser, and to charge back any false or unsubstantiated 13claims. The audit and charge back provisions of this Section 14also apply to all other incentive and reimbursement programs 15for a period of one year after the date the claim was paid or 16credit issued by the manufacturer or franchiser. However, the 17manufacturer retains the right to charge back any fraudulent 18claim if the manufacturer establishes in a court of competent 19jurisdiction in this State that the claim is fraudulent.20    (c) The motor vehicle franchiser shall not, by agreement, 21by restrictions upon reimbursement, or otherwise, restrict the 22nature and extent of services to be rendered or parts to be 23provided so that such restriction prevents the motor vehicle 24franchisee from satisfying the warranty by rendering services 25in a good and workmanlike manner and providing parts which are 26required in accordance with generally accepted standards. Any   10400SB1939sam001- 54 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1such restriction shall constitute a prohibited practice.2    (d) For the purposes of this Section, the "prevailing 3retail price charged by that dealer for the same parts" means 4the price paid by the motor vehicle franchisee for parts, 5including all shipping and other charges, multiplied by the 6sum of 1.0 and the franchisee's average percentage markup over 7the price paid by the motor vehicle franchisee for parts 8purchased by the motor vehicle franchisee from the motor 9vehicle franchiser and sold at retail. The motor vehicle 10franchisee may establish average percentage markup under this 11Section by submitting to the motor vehicle franchiser 100 12sequential customer paid service repair orders or 90 days of 13customer paid service repair orders, whichever is less, 14covering repairs made no more than 180 days before the 15submission, and declaring what the average percentage markup 16is. The average percentage markup so declared shall go into 17effect 30 days following the declaration, subject to audit of 18the submitted repair orders by the motor vehicle franchiser 19and adjustment of the average percentage markup based on that 20audit. Any audit must be conducted within 30 days following 21the declaration. Only retail sales not involving warranty 22repairs, parts covered by subsection (e) of this Section, or 23parts supplied for routine vehicle maintenance, shall be 24considered in calculating average percentage markup. For the 25purpose of this subsection, "routine maintenance" includes, 26but is not limited to: (i) the replacement of oil or other   10400SB1939sam001- 55 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1fluids, filters, batteries for internal combustion engine 2vehicles, bulbs, brake pads, rotors, nuts, bolts, or 3fasteners; (ii) the replacement of or work on tires or wheels, 4including wheel alignments and tire and wheel rotations; and 5(iii) the installation of an accessory. No motor vehicle 6franchiser shall require a motor vehicle franchisee to 7establish average percentage markup by a methodology, or by 8requiring information, that is unduly burdensome or time 9consuming to provide, including, but not limited to, part by 10part or transaction by transaction calculations. A motor 11vehicle franchisee shall not request a change in the average 12percentage markup more than twice in one calendar year.13    (e) If a motor vehicle franchiser supplies a part or parts 14for use in a repair rendered under a warranty other than by 15sale of that part or parts to the motor vehicle franchisee, the 16motor vehicle franchisee shall be entitled to compensation 17equivalent to the motor vehicle franchisee's average 18percentage markup on the part or parts, as if the part or parts 19had been sold to the motor vehicle franchisee by the motor 20vehicle franchiser. The requirements of this subsection (e) 21shall not apply to entire engine assemblies, propulsion engine 22assemblies, including electric vehicle batteries, and entire 23transmission assemblies. In the case of those assemblies, the 24motor vehicle franchiser shall reimburse the motor vehicle 25franchisee up to and including 30% of what the motor vehicle 26franchisee would have paid the motor vehicle franchiser for   10400SB1939sam001- 56 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1the assembly if the assembly had not been supplied by the 2franchiser other than by the sale of that assembly to the motor 3vehicle franchisee. 4    (f) The obligations imposed on motor vehicle franchisers 5by this Section shall apply to any parent, subsidiary, 6affiliate, or agent of the motor vehicle franchiser, any 7person under common ownership or control, any employee of the 8motor vehicle franchiser, and any person holding 1% or more of 9the shares of any class of securities or other ownership 10interest in the motor vehicle franchiser, if a warranty or 11service or repair plan is issued by that person instead of or 12in addition to one issued by the motor vehicle franchiser.13    (g) (Blank).14(Source: P.A. 102-232, eff. 1-1-22; 102-669, eff. 11-16-21.)".

The reasonable facilities requirement 9    set forth in item (ii) of subsection (d)(8) shall not 10    include any requirement that a franchisee establish or 11    maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display 12    space. Any decision by a motor vehicle dealer to sell 13    additional makes or lines at the motor vehicle dealer's 14    facility shall be presumed to be reasonable, and the 15    manufacturer shall have the burden to overcome that 16    presumption. A motor vehicle dealer must provide a written 17    notification of its intent to add a make or line of new 18    motor vehicles to the manufacturer. If the manufacturer 19    does not respond to the motor vehicle dealer, in writing, 20    objecting to the addition of the make or line within 60 21    days after the date that the motor vehicle dealer sends 22    the written notification, then the manufacturer shall be 23    deemed to have approved the addition of the make or line; 24        (9) to use or consider the performance of a motor 25    vehicle dealer relating to the sale of the manufacturer's, 26    distributor's, or wholesaler's vehicles or the motor   10400SB1939sam001- 18 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    vehicle dealer's ability to satisfy any minimum sales or 2    market share quota or responsibility relating to the sale 3    of the manufacturer's, distributor's, or wholesaler's new 4    vehicles in determining:5            (A) the motor vehicle dealer's eligibility to 6        purchase program, certified, or other used motor 7        vehicles from the manufacturer, distributor, or 8        wholesaler;9            (B) the volume, type, or model of program, 10        certified, or other used motor vehicles that a motor 11        vehicle dealer is eligible to purchase from the 12        manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler;13            (C) the price of any program, certified, or other 14        used motor vehicle that the dealer is eligible to 15        purchase from the manufacturer, distributor, or 16        wholesaler; or17            (D) the availability or amount of any discount, 18        credit, rebate, or sales incentive that the dealer is 19        eligible to receive from the manufacturer, 20        distributor, or wholesaler for the purchase of any 21        program, certified, or other used motor vehicle 22        offered for sale by the manufacturer, distributor, or 23        wholesaler;24        (10) to take any adverse action against a dealer 25    pursuant to an export or sale-for-resale prohibition 26    because the dealer sold or leased a vehicle to a customer   10400SB1939sam001- 19 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    who either exported the vehicle to a foreign country or 2    resold the vehicle in violation of the prohibition, unless 3    the export or sale-for-resale prohibition policy was 4    provided to the dealer in writing either electronically or 5    on paper, prior to the sale or lease, and the dealer knew 6    or reasonably should have known of the customer's intent 7    to export or resell the vehicle in violation of the 8    prohibition at the time of the sale or lease. If the dealer 9    causes the vehicle to be registered and titled in this or 10    any other state, and collects or causes to be collected 11    any applicable sales or use tax to this State, a 12    rebuttable presumption is established that the dealer did 13    not have reason to know of the customer's intent to resell 14    the vehicle;15        (11) to coerce or require any dealer to construct 16    improvements to his or her facilities or to install new 17    signs or other franchiser image elements that replace or 18    substantially alter those improvements, signs, or 19    franchiser image elements completed within the past 10 20    years that were required and approved by the manufacturer 21    or one of its affiliates. The 10-year period under this 22    paragraph (11) begins to run for a dealer, including that 23    dealer's successors and assigns, on the date that the 24    manufacturer gives final written approval of the facility 25    improvements or installation of signs or other franchiser 26    image elements or the date that the dealer receives a   10400SB1939sam001- 20 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    certificate of occupancy, whichever is later. For the 2    purpose of this paragraph (11), the term "substantially 3    alter" does not include routine maintenance, including, 4    but not limited to, interior painting, that is reasonably 5    necessary to keep a dealer facility in attractive 6    condition; or 7        (12) to require a dealer to purchase goods or services 8    to make improvements to the dealer's facilities from a 9    vendor selected, identified, or designated by a 10    manufacturer or one of its affiliates by agreement, 11    program, incentive provision, or otherwise without making 12    available to the dealer the option to obtain the goods or 13    services of substantially similar quality and overall 14    design from a vendor chosen by the dealer and approved by 15    the manufacturer; however, approval by the manufacturer 16    shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the dealer's 17    option to select a vendor shall not be available if the 18    manufacturer provides substantial reimbursement for the 19    goods or services offered. "Substantial reimbursement" 20    means an amount equal to or greater than the cost savings 21    that would result if the dealer were to utilize a vendor of 22    the dealer's own selection instead of using the vendor 23    identified by the manufacturer. For the purpose of this 24    paragraph (12), the term "goods" does not include movable 25    displays, brochures, and promotional materials containing 26    material subject to the intellectual property rights of a   10400SB1939sam001- 21 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    manufacturer. If signs, other than signs containing the 2    manufacturer's brand or logo or free-standing signs that 3    are not directly attached to a building, or other 4    franchiser image or design elements or trade dress are to 5    be leased to the dealer by a vendor selected, identified, 6    or designated by the manufacturer, the dealer has the 7    right to purchase the signs or other franchiser image or 8    design elements or trade dress of substantially similar 9    quality and design from a vendor selected by the dealer if 10    the signs, franchiser image or design elements, or trade 11    dress are approved by the manufacturer.

This 20    paragraph (12) shall not be construed to permit a dealer 21    to erect or maintain signs that do not conform to the 22    manufacturer's intellectual property rights or trademark 23    or trade dress usage guidelines. 24        (13) to establish or utilize any common entity, 25    affiliate, or spin-off company to sell, lease, or 26    otherwise distribute new motor vehicles directly to   10400SB1939sam001- 22 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    consumers or to circumvent the manufacturer's new motor 2    vehicle distribution obligations under this Act, if the 3    manufacturer, including any common entities, subsidiaries, 4    or affiliates, currently or previously maintained a 5    franchise or selling agreement with a motor vehicle dealer 6    for the retail sale of motor vehicles in this State. 7    (e) It shall be deemed a violation for a manufacturer, a 8distributor, a wholesaler, a distributor branch or division or 9officer, agent or other representative thereof:10        (1) to resort to or use any false or misleading 11    advertisement in connection with his business as such 12    manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch 13    or division or officer, agent or other representative 14    thereof;15        (2) to offer to sell or lease, or to sell or lease, any 16    new motor vehicle to any motor vehicle dealer at a lower 17    actual price therefor than the actual price offered to any 18    other motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle 19    similarly equipped or to utilize any device including, but 20    not limited to, sales promotion plans or programs which 21    result in such lesser actual price or fail to make 22    available to any motor vehicle dealer any preferential 23    pricing, incentive, rebate, finance rate, or low interest 24    loan program offered to competing motor vehicle dealers in 25    other contiguous states. However, the provisions of this 26    paragraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle   10400SB1939sam001- 23 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    dealer for resale to any unit of the United States 2    Government, the State or any of its political 3    subdivisions;4        (3) to offer to sell or lease, or to sell or lease, any 5    new motor vehicle to any person, except a wholesaler, 6    distributor or manufacturer's employees at a lower actual 7    price therefor than the actual price offered and charged 8    to a motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle 9    similarly equipped or to utilize any device which results 10    in such lesser actual price. However, the provisions of 11    this paragraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle 12    dealer for resale to any unit of the United States 13    Government, the State or any of its political 14    subdivisions;15        (4) to prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or 16    otherwise any motor vehicle dealer or franchisee from 17    changing the executive management control of the motor 18    vehicle dealer or franchisee unless the franchiser, having 19    the burden of proof, proves that such change of executive 20    management will result in executive management control by 21    a person or persons who are not of good moral character or 22    who do not meet the franchiser's existing and, with 23    consideration given to the volume of sales and service of 24    the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 25    experience standards in the market area. However, where 26    the manufacturer rejects a proposed change in executive   10400SB1939sam001- 24 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    management control, the manufacturer shall give written 2    notice of his reasons to the dealer within 60 days of 3    notice to the manufacturer by the dealer of the proposed 4    change. If the manufacturer does not send a letter to the 5    franchisee by certified mail, return receipt requested, 6    within 60 days from receipt by the manufacturer of the 7    proposed change, then the change of the executive 8    management control of the franchisee shall be deemed 9    accepted as proposed by the franchisee, and the 10    manufacturer shall give immediate effect to such change;11        (5) to prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or 12    otherwise any motor vehicle dealer from establishing or 13    changing the capital structure of his dealership or the 14    means by or through which he finances the operation 15    thereof; provided the dealer meets any reasonable capital 16    standards agreed to between the dealer and the 17    manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler, who may require 18    that the sources, method and manner by which the dealer 19    finances or intends to finance its operation, equipment or 20    facilities be fully disclosed; 21        (6) to refuse to give effect to or prevent or attempt 22    to prevent by contract or otherwise any motor vehicle 23    dealer or any officer, partner or stockholder of any motor 24    vehicle dealer from selling or transferring any part of 25    the interest of any of them to any other person or persons 26    or party or parties unless such sale or transfer is to a   10400SB1939sam001- 25 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    transferee who would not otherwise qualify for a new motor 2    vehicle dealers license under the Illinois Vehicle Code or 3    unless the franchiser, having the burden of proof, proves 4    that such sale or transfer is to a person or party who is 5    not of good moral character or does not meet the 6    franchiser's existing and reasonable capital standards 7    and, with consideration given to the volume of sales and 8    service of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum 9    business experience standards in the market area. However, 10    nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a franchiser 11    from implementing affirmative action programs providing 12    business opportunities for minorities or from complying 13    with applicable federal, State or local law:14            (A) If the manufacturer intends to refuse to 15        approve the sale or transfer of all or a part of the 16        interest, then it shall, within 60 days from receipt 17        of the completed application forms generally utilized 18        by a manufacturer to conduct its review and a copy of 19        all agreements regarding the proposed transfer, send a 20        letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, 21        advising the franchisee of any refusal to approve the 22        sale or transfer of all or part of the interest and 23        shall state that the dealer only has 30 days from the 24        receipt of the notice to file with the Motor Vehicle 25        Review Board a written protest against the proposed 26        action. The notice shall set forth specific criteria   10400SB1939sam001- 26 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        used to evaluate the prospective transferee and the 2        grounds for refusing to approve the sale or transfer 3        to that transferee. Within 30 days from the 4        franchisee's receipt of the manufacturer's notice, the 5        franchisee may file with the Board a written protest 6        against the proposed action.7            When a protest has been timely filed, the Board 8        shall enter an order, fixing the date (within 60 days 9        of the date of such order), time, and place of a 10        hearing on the protest, required under Sections 12 and 11        29 of this Act, and send by certified mail, return 12        receipt requested, a copy of the order to the 13        manufacturer that filed notice of intention of the 14        proposed action and to the protesting franchisee.15            The manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to 16        establish that good cause exists to refuse to approve 17        the sale or transfer to the transferee. The 18        determination whether good cause exists to refuse to 19        approve the sale or transfer shall be made by the Board 20        under subdivisions (6)(B). The manufacturer shall not 21        refuse to approve the sale or transfer by a dealer or 22        an officer, partner, or stockholder of a franchise or 23        any part of the interest to any person or persons 24        before the hearing process is concluded as prescribed 25        by this Act, and thereafter if the Board determines 26        that the manufacturer has failed to meet its burden of   10400SB1939sam001- 27 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        proof and that good cause does not exist to refuse to 2        approve the sale or transfer to the transferee.3            (B) Good cause to refuse to approve such sale or 4        transfer under this Section is established when such 5        sale or transfer is to a transferee who would not 6        otherwise qualify for a new motor vehicle dealers 7        license under the Illinois Vehicle Code or such sale 8        or transfer is to a person or party who is not of good 9        moral character or does not meet the franchiser's 10        existing and reasonable capital standards and, with 11        consideration given to the volume of sales and service 12        of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 13        experience standards in the market area.14        (7) to obtain money, goods, services, anything of 15    value, or any other benefit from any other person with 16    whom the motor vehicle dealer does business, on account of 17    or in relation to the transactions between the dealer and 18    the other person as compensation, except for services 19    actually rendered, unless such benefit is promptly 20    accounted for and transmitted to the motor vehicle dealer;21        (8) to grant an additional franchise in the relevant 22    market area of an existing franchise of the same line make 23    or to relocate an existing motor vehicle dealership within 24    or into a relevant market area of an existing franchise of 25    the same line make. However, if the manufacturer wishes to 26    grant such an additional franchise to an independent   10400SB1939sam001- 28 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    person in a bona fide relationship in which such person is 2    prepared to make a significant investment subject to loss 3    in such a dealership, or if the manufacturer wishes to 4    relocate an existing motor vehicle dealership, then the 5    manufacturer shall send a letter by certified mail, return 6    receipt requested, to each existing dealer or dealers of 7    the same line make whose relevant market area includes the 8    proposed location of the additional or relocated franchise 9    at least 60 days before the manufacturer grants an 10    additional franchise or relocates an existing franchise of 11    the same line make within or into the relevant market area 12    of an existing franchisee of the same line make. Each 13    notice shall set forth the specific grounds for the 14    proposed grant of an additional or relocation of an 15    existing franchise and shall state that the dealer has 16    only 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice to file 17    with the Motor Vehicle Review Board a written protest 18    against the proposed action. Unless the parties agree upon 19    the grant or establishment of the additional or relocated 20    franchise within 30 days from the date the notice was 21    received by the existing franchisee of the same line make 22    or any person entitled to receive such notice, the 23    franchisee or other person may file with the Board a 24    written protest against the grant or establishment of the 25    proposed additional or relocated franchise.26        When a protest has been timely filed, the Board shall   10400SB1939sam001- 29 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    enter an order fixing a date (within 60 days of the date of 2    the order), time, and place of a hearing on the protest, 3    required under Sections 12 and 29 of this Act, and send by 4    certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, a 5    copy of the order to the manufacturer that filed the 6    notice of intention to grant or establish the proposed 7    additional or relocated franchise and to the protesting 8    dealer or dealers of the same line make whose relevant 9    market area includes the proposed location of the 10    additional or relocated franchise. 11        When more than one protest is filed against the grant 12    or establishment of the additional or relocated franchise 13    of the same line make, the Board may consolidate the 14    hearings to expedite disposition of the matter. The 15    manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to establish 16    that good cause exists to allow the grant or establishment 17    of the additional or relocated franchise. The manufacturer 18    may not grant or establish the additional franchise or 19    relocate the existing franchise before the hearing process 20    is concluded as prescribed by this Act, and thereafter if 21    the Board determines that the manufacturer has failed to 22    meet its burden of proof and that good cause does not exist 23    to allow the grant or establishment of the additional 24    franchise or relocation of the existing franchise.25        The determination whether good cause exists for 26    allowing the grant or establishment of an additional   10400SB1939sam001- 30 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    franchise or relocated existing franchise, shall be made 2    by the Board under subsection (c) of Section 12 of this 3    Act. If the manufacturer seeks to enter into a contract, 4    agreement or other arrangement with any person, 5    establishing any additional motor vehicle dealership or 6    other facility, limited to the sale of factory repurchase 7    vehicles or late model vehicles, then the manufacturer 8    shall follow the notice procedures set forth in this 9    Section and the determination whether good cause exists 10    for allowing the proposed agreement shall be made by the 11    Board under subsection (c) of Section 12, with the 12    manufacturer having the burden of proof.13            A. (Blank).14            B. For the purposes of this Section, appointment 15        of a successor motor vehicle dealer at the same 16        location as its predecessor, or within 2 miles of such 17        location, or the relocation of an existing dealer or 18        franchise within 2 miles of the relocating dealer's or 19        franchisee's existing location, shall not be construed 20        as a grant, establishment or the entering into of an 21        additional franchise or selling agreement, or a 22        relocation of an existing franchise. The reopening of 23        a motor vehicle dealership that has not been in 24        operation for 18 months or more shall be deemed the 25        grant of an additional franchise or selling agreement.26            C. This Section does not apply to the relocation   10400SB1939sam001- 31 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        of an existing dealership or franchise in a county 2        having a population of more than 300,000 persons when 3        the new location is within the dealer's current 4        relevant market area, provided the new location is 5        more than 7 miles from the nearest dealer of the same 6        line make. This Section does not apply to the 7        relocation of an existing dealership or franchise in a 8        county having a population of less than 300,000 9        persons when the new location is within the dealer's 10        current relevant market area, provided the new 11        location is more than 12 miles from the nearest dealer 12        of the same line make. A dealer that would be farther 13        away from the new location of an existing dealership 14        or franchise of the same line make after a relocation 15        may not file a written protest against the relocation 16        with the Motor Vehicle Review Board.17            D. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to 18        prevent a franchiser from implementing affirmative 19        action programs providing business opportunities for 20        minorities or from complying with applicable federal, 21        State or local law;22        (9) to require a motor vehicle dealer to assent to a 23    release, assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which 24    would relieve any person from liability imposed by this 25    Act;26        (10) to prevent or refuse to give effect to the   10400SB1939sam001- 32 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    succession to the ownership or management control of a 2    dealership by any legatee under the will of a dealer or to 3    an heir under the laws of descent and distribution of this 4    State unless the franchisee has designated a successor to 5    the ownership or management control under the succession 6    provisions of the franchise. Unless the franchiser, having 7    the burden of proof, proves that the successor is a person 8    who is not of good moral character or does not meet the 9    franchiser's existing and reasonable capital standards 10    and, with consideration given to the volume of sales and 11    service of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum 12    business experience standards in the market area, any 13    designated successor of a dealer or franchisee may succeed 14    to the ownership or management control of a dealership 15    under the existing franchise if:16                (i) The designated successor gives the 17            franchiser written notice by certified mail, 18            return receipt requested, of his or her intention 19            to succeed to the ownership of the dealer within 20            60 days of the dealer's death or incapacity; and21                (ii) The designated successor agrees to be 22            bound by all the terms and conditions of the 23            existing franchise.24        Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the motor 25    vehicle dealer or franchisee and manufacturer have duly 26    executed an agreement concerning succession rights prior   10400SB1939sam001- 33 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    to the dealer's death or incapacitation, the agreement 2    shall be observed.3            (A) If the franchiser intends to refuse to honor 4        the successor to the ownership of a deceased or 5        incapacitated dealer or franchisee under an existing 6        franchise agreement, the franchiser shall send a 7        letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, to 8        the designated successor within 60 days from receipt 9        of a proposal advising of its intent to refuse to honor 10        the succession and to discontinue the existing 11        franchise agreement and shall state that the 12        designated successor only has 30 days from the receipt 13        of the notice to file with the Motor Vehicle Review 14        Board a written protest against the proposed action. 15        The notice shall set forth the specific grounds for 16        the refusal to honor the succession and discontinue 17        the existing franchise agreement.18            If notice of refusal is not timely served upon the 19        designated successor, the franchise agreement shall 20        continue in effect subject to termination only as 21        otherwise permitted by paragraph (6) of subsection (d) 22        of Section 4 of this Act.23            Within 30 days from the date the notice was 24        received by the designated successor or any other 25        person entitled to notice, the designee or other 26        person may file with the Board a written protest   10400SB1939sam001- 34 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        against the proposed action.2            When a protest has been timely filed, the Board 3        shall enter an order, fixing a date (within 60 days of 4        the date of the order), time, and place of a hearing on 5        the protest, required under Sections 12 and 29 of this 6        Act, and send by certified mail, return receipt 7        requested, a copy of the order to the franchiser that 8        filed the notice of intention of the proposed action 9        and to the protesting designee or such other person.10            The manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to 11        establish that good cause exists to refuse to honor 12        the succession and discontinue the existing franchise 13        agreement. The determination whether good cause exists 14        to refuse to honor the succession shall be made by the 15        Board under subdivision (B) of this paragraph (10). 16        The manufacturer shall not refuse to honor the 17        succession or discontinue the existing franchise 18        agreement before the hearing process is concluded as 19        prescribed by this Act, and thereafter if the Board 20        determines that it has failed to meet its burden of 21        proof and that good cause does not exist to refuse to 22        honor the succession and discontinue the existing 23        franchise agreement.24            (B) No manufacturer shall impose any conditions 25        upon honoring the succession and continuing the 26        existing franchise agreement with the designated   10400SB1939sam001- 35 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        successor other than that the franchisee has 2        designated a successor to the ownership or management 3        control under the succession provisions of the 4        franchise, or that the designated successor is of good 5        moral character or meets the reasonable capital 6        standards and, with consideration given to the volume 7        of sales and service of the dealership, uniformly 8        applied minimum business experience standards in the 9        market area;10        (11) to prevent or refuse to approve a proposal to 11    establish a successor franchise at a location previously 12    approved by the franchiser when submitted with the 13    voluntary termination by the existing franchisee unless 14    the successor franchisee would not otherwise qualify for a 15    new motor vehicle dealer's license under the Illinois 16    Vehicle Code or unless the franchiser, having the burden 17    of proof, proves that such proposed successor is not of 18    good moral character or does not meet the franchiser's 19    existing and reasonable capital standards and, with 20    consideration given to the volume of sales and service of 21    the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 22    experience standards in the market area. However, when 23    such a rejection of a proposal is made, the manufacturer 24    shall give written notice of its reasons to the franchisee 25    within 60 days of receipt by the manufacturer of the 26    proposal. However, nothing herein shall be construed to   10400SB1939sam001- 36 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    prevent a franchiser from implementing affirmative action 2    programs providing business opportunities for minorities, 3    or from complying with applicable federal, State or local 4    law;5        (12) to prevent or refuse to grant a franchise to a 6    person because such person owns, has investment in or 7    participates in the management of or holds a franchise for 8    the sale of another make or line of motor vehicles within 7 9    miles of the proposed franchise location in a county 10    having a population of more than 300,000 persons, or 11    within 12 miles of the proposed franchise location in a 12    county having a population of less than 300,000 persons;13        (13) to prevent or attempt to prevent any new motor 14    vehicle dealer from establishing any additional motor 15    vehicle dealership or other facility limited to the sale 16    of factory repurchase vehicles or late model vehicles or 17    otherwise offering for sale factory repurchase vehicles of 18    the same line make at an existing franchise by failing to 19    make available any contract, agreement or other 20    arrangement which is made available or otherwise offered 21    to any person; or22        (14) to exercise a right of first refusal or other 23    right to acquire a franchise from a dealer, unless the 24    manufacturer:25            (A) notifies the dealer in writing that it intends 26        to exercise its right to acquire the franchise not   10400SB1939sam001- 37 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        later than 60 days after the manufacturer's or 2        distributor's receipt of a notice of the proposed 3        transfer from the dealer and all information and 4        documents reasonably and customarily required by the 5        manufacturer or distributor supporting the proposed 6        transfer;7            (B) pays to the dealer the same or greater 8        consideration as the dealer has contracted to receive 9        in connection with the proposed transfer or sale of 10        all or substantially all of the dealership assets, 11        stock, or other ownership interest, including the 12        purchase or lease of all real property, leasehold, or 13        improvements related to the transfer or sale of the 14        dealership. Upon exercise of the right of first 15        refusal or such other right, the manufacturer or 16        distributor shall have the right to assign the lease 17        or to convey the real property;18            (C) assumes all of the duties, obligations, and 19        liabilities contained in the agreements that were to 20        be assumed by the proposed transferee and with respect 21        to which the manufacturer or distributor exercised the 22        right of first refusal or other right to acquire the 23        franchise;24            (D) reimburses the proposed transferee for all 25        reasonable expenses incurred in evaluating, 26        investigating, and negotiating the transfer of the   10400SB1939sam001- 38 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1        dealership prior to the manufacturer's or 2        distributor's exercise of its right of first refusal 3        or other right to acquire the dealership.

The 18    determination of whether the successor manufacturer would 19    have had good cause to terminate the franchise agreement 20    of the former franchisee, or the successor of the former 21    franchisee, shall be made by the Board under subsection 22    (d) of Section 12. A successor manufacturer that seeks to 23    assert that it would have had good cause to terminate a 24    former franchisee, or the successor of the former 25    franchisee, must file a petition seeking a hearing on this 26    issue before the Board and shall have the burden of   10400SB1939sam001- 48 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1    proving that it would have had good cause to terminate the 2    former franchisee or the successor of the former 3    franchisee. No successor dealer, other than the former 4    franchisee, may be appointed or franchised by the 5    successor manufacturer within the relevant market area of 6    the former franchisee until the Board has held a hearing 7    and rendered a determination on the issue of whether the 8    successor manufacturer would have had good cause to 9    terminate the former franchisee. 10    In the event that a successor manufacturer attempts to 11enter into a same line make franchise with any person or to 12permit the relocation of any existing line make franchise 13under this subsection (h) at a location that is within the 14relevant market area of 2 or more former franchisees, then the 15successor manufacturer may not offer it to any person other 16than one of those former franchisees unless the successor 17manufacturer can prove that at least one of the 3 exceptions in 18items (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection (h) applies to each 19of those former franchisees. 20    (i) It shall be deemed a violation of this Section for any 21manufacturer with an established franchise dealer network in 22this State, either directly or indirectly, through any parent, 23subsidiary, affiliate, or agent of the manufacturer, any 24person under common ownership or control, or common entity, to 25engage in the sale, lease, or warranty servicing of new motor 26vehicles in a manner that bypasses or competes with the   10400SB1939sam001- 49 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1manufacturer's existing franchisee network, including, but not 2limited to:3        (1) engaging in practices intended to circumvent, 4    evade, or undermine the rights, obligations, or 5    protections afforded to franchisees under this Act; or6        (2) establishing or using newly branded entities, 7    spin-offs, or affiliated or subsidiary entities to conduct 8    retail operations outside the franchise system.9    (j) A manufacturer or distributor shall not engage in the 10sale of new motor vehicles directly to the general public in 11this State unless the manufacturer or distributor was lawfully 12licensed to sell new motor vehicles directly to consumers in 13this State before January 1, 2022.14(Source: P.A. 102-433, eff. 1-1-22.) 15    (815 ILCS 710/6)  (from Ch. 121 1/2, par. 756)16    Sec. 6. Warranty agreements; claims; approval; payment; 17written disapproval.18    (a) Every manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, 19distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or 20wholesale branch or division shall properly fulfill any 21warranty agreement and adequately and fairly compensate each 22of its motor vehicle dealers for labor and parts.23    (b) Adequate and fair compensation requires the 24manufacturer to pay each dealer no less than the amount the 25retail customer pays for the same services with regard to rate   10400SB1939sam001- 50 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1and time.2    Any time guide previously agreed to by the manufacturer 3and the dealer for extended warranty repairs may be used in 4lieu of actual time expended. In the event that a time guide 5has not been agreed to for warranty repairs, or said time guide 6does not define time for an applicable warranty repair, the 7manufacturer's time guide shall be used, multiplied by 1.5. 8    In no event shall such compensation fail to include full 9compensation for diagnostic work, as well as repair service, 10labor, and parts. Time allowances for the diagnosis and 11performance of warranty work and service shall be no less than 12charged to retail customers for the same work to be performed.13    No warranty or factory compensated repairs shall be 14excluded from this requirement, including recalls or other 15voluntary stop-sell repairs required by the manufacturer. If a 16manufacturer is required to issue a recall, the dealer will be 17compensated for labor time as above stated.18    Furthermore, manufacturers shall pay the dealer the same 19effective labor rate (using the 100 sequential repair orders 20chosen and submitted by the dealer less simple maintenance 21repair orders) that the dealer receives for customer-pay 22repairs. This requirement includes vehicle diagnostic times 23for all warranty repairs. Additionally, if a technician is 24required to communicate with a Technical Assistance 25Center/Engineering/or some external manufacturer source in 26order to provide a warranty repair, the manufacturer shall pay   10400SB1939sam001- 51 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1for the time from start of communications (including hold 2time) until the communication is complete.3    The dealer may submit a request to the manufacturer for 4warranty labor rate increases a maximum of once per calendar 5year.6    A claim made by a franchised motor vehicle dealer for 7compensation under this Section shall be either approved or 8disapproved within 30 days after the claim is submitted to the 9manufacturer in the manner and on the forms the manufacturer 10reasonably prescribes. An approved claim shall be paid within 1130 days after its approval. If a claim is not specifically 12disapproved in writing or by electronic transmission within 30 13days after the date on which the manufacturer receives it, the 14claim shall be considered to be approved and payment shall 15follow within 30 days. 16    In no event shall compensation to a motor vehicle dealer 17for labor times and labor rates be less than the rates charged 18by such dealer for like service to retail customers for 19nonwarranty service and repairs. Additionally, the 20manufacturer shall reimburse the dealer for any parts provided 21in satisfaction of a warranty at the prevailing retail price 22charged by that dealer for the same parts when not provided in 23satisfaction of a warranty; provided that such dealer's 24prevailing retail price is not unreasonable when compared with 25that of the holders of motor vehicle franchises of from the 26same line make manufacturer for identical parts in the   10400SB1939sam001- 52 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1geographic area in which the dealer is engaged in business.2    There shall be no reduction in payments due to 3preestablished market norms or market averages. Manufacturers 4are prohibited from establishing restrictions or limitations 5of customer repair frequency due to failure rate indexes or 6national failure averages.7    No debit reduction or charge back of any item on a warranty 8repair order may be made absent a finding of fraud or illegal 9actions by the dealer.10    A warranty claim timely made shall not be deemed invalid 11solely because unavailable parts cause additional use and 12mileage on the vehicle.13    If a manufacturer imposes a recall or stop sale on any new 14vehicle in a dealer's inventory that prevents the sale of the 15vehicle, the manufacturer shall compensate the dealer for any 16interest and storage until the vehicle is repaired and made 17ready for sale.18    Manufacturers are not permitted to impose any form of cost 19recovery fees or surcharges against a franchised auto 20dealership for payments made in accordance with this Section. 21    All claims, either original or resubmitted, made by motor 22vehicle dealers hereunder and under Section 5 for such labor 23and parts shall be either approved or disapproved within 30 24days following their submission. All approved claims shall be 25paid within 30 days following their approval. The motor 26vehicle dealer who submits a claim which is disapproved shall   10400SB1939sam001- 53 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1be notified in writing of the disapproval within the same 2period, and each such notice shall state the specific grounds 3upon which the disapproval is based. The motor vehicle dealer 4shall be permitted to correct and resubmit such disapproved 5claims within 30 days of receipt of disapproval. Any claims 6not specifically disapproved in writing within 30 days from 7their submission shall be deemed approved and payment shall 8follow within 30 days. The manufacturer or franchiser shall 9have the right to require reasonable documentation for claims 10and to audit such claims within a one year period from the date 11the claim was paid or credit issued by the manufacturer or 12franchiser, and to charge back any false or unsubstantiated 13claims. The audit and charge back provisions of this Section 14also apply to all other incentive and reimbursement programs 15for a period of one year after the date the claim was paid or 16credit issued by the manufacturer or franchiser. However, the 17manufacturer retains the right to charge back any fraudulent 18claim if the manufacturer establishes in a court of competent 19jurisdiction in this State that the claim is fraudulent.20    (c) The motor vehicle franchiser shall not, by agreement, 21by restrictions upon reimbursement, or otherwise, restrict the 22nature and extent of services to be rendered or parts to be 23provided so that such restriction prevents the motor vehicle 24franchisee from satisfying the warranty by rendering services 25in a good and workmanlike manner and providing parts which are 26required in accordance with generally accepted standards. Any   10400SB1939sam001- 54 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1such restriction shall constitute a prohibited practice.2    (d) For the purposes of this Section, the "prevailing 3retail price charged by that dealer for the same parts" means 4the price paid by the motor vehicle franchisee for parts, 5including all shipping and other charges, multiplied by the 6sum of 1.0 and the franchisee's average percentage markup over 7the price paid by the motor vehicle franchisee for parts 8purchased by the motor vehicle franchisee from the motor 9vehicle franchiser and sold at retail. The motor vehicle 10franchisee may establish average percentage markup under this 11Section by submitting to the motor vehicle franchiser 100 12sequential customer paid service repair orders or 90 days of 13customer paid service repair orders, whichever is less, 14covering repairs made no more than 180 days before the 15submission, and declaring what the average percentage markup 16is. The average percentage markup so declared shall go into 17effect 30 days following the declaration, subject to audit of 18the submitted repair orders by the motor vehicle franchiser 19and adjustment of the average percentage markup based on that 20audit. Any audit must be conducted within 30 days following 21the declaration. Only retail sales not involving warranty 22repairs, parts covered by subsection (e) of this Section, or 23parts supplied for routine vehicle maintenance, shall be 24considered in calculating average percentage markup. For the 25purpose of this subsection, "routine maintenance" includes, 26but is not limited to: (i) the replacement of oil or other   10400SB1939sam001- 55 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1fluids, filters, batteries for internal combustion engine 2vehicles, bulbs, brake pads, rotors, nuts, bolts, or 3fasteners; (ii) the replacement of or work on tires or wheels, 4including wheel alignments and tire and wheel rotations; and 5(iii) the installation of an accessory. No motor vehicle 6franchiser shall require a motor vehicle franchisee to 7establish average percentage markup by a methodology, or by 8requiring information, that is unduly burdensome or time 9consuming to provide, including, but not limited to, part by 10part or transaction by transaction calculations. A motor 11vehicle franchisee shall not request a change in the average 12percentage markup more than twice in one calendar year.13    (e) If a motor vehicle franchiser supplies a part or parts 14for use in a repair rendered under a warranty other than by 15sale of that part or parts to the motor vehicle franchisee, the 16motor vehicle franchisee shall be entitled to compensation 17equivalent to the motor vehicle franchisee's average 18percentage markup on the part or parts, as if the part or parts 19had been sold to the motor vehicle franchisee by the motor 20vehicle franchiser. The requirements of this subsection (e) 21shall not apply to entire engine assemblies, propulsion engine 22assemblies, including electric vehicle batteries, and entire 23transmission assemblies. In the case of those assemblies, the 24motor vehicle franchiser shall reimburse the motor vehicle 25franchisee up to and including 30% of what the motor vehicle 26franchisee would have paid the motor vehicle franchiser for   10400SB1939sam001- 56 -LRB104 12083 SPS 24940 a1the assembly if the assembly had not been supplied by the 2franchiser other than by the sale of that assembly to the motor 3vehicle franchisee. 4    (f) The obligations imposed on motor vehicle franchisers 5by this Section shall apply to any parent, subsidiary, 6affiliate, or agent of the motor vehicle franchiser, any 7person under common ownership or control, any employee of the 8motor vehicle franchiser, and any person holding 1% or more of 9the shares of any class of securities or other ownership 10interest in the motor vehicle franchiser, if a warranty or 11service or repair plan is issued by that person instead of or 12in addition to one issued by the motor vehicle franchiser.13    (g) (Blank).14(Source: P.A. 102-232, eff. 1-1-22; 102-669, eff. 11-16-21.)".
