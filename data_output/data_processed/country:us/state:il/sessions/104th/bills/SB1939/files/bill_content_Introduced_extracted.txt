The reasonable facilities requirement 4    set forth in item (ii) of subsection (d)(8) shall not 5    include any requirement that a franchisee establish or 6    maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display 7    space.

A motor vehicle dealer must provide a written 12    notification of its intent to add a make or line of new 13    motor vehicles to the manufacturer. If the manufacturer 14    does not respond to the motor vehicle dealer, in writing, 15    objecting to the addition of the make or line within 60 16    days after the date that the motor vehicle dealer sends 17    the written notification, then the manufacturer shall be 18    deemed to have approved the addition of the make or line; 19        (9) to use or consider the performance of a motor 20    vehicle dealer relating to the sale of the manufacturer's, 21    distributor's, or wholesaler's vehicles or the motor 22    vehicle dealer's ability to satisfy any minimum sales or 23    market share quota or responsibility relating to the sale 24    of the manufacturer's, distributor's, or wholesaler's new 25    vehicles in determining:26            (A) the motor vehicle dealer's eligibility to   SB1939- 18 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        purchase program, certified, or other used motor 2        vehicles from the manufacturer, distributor, or 3        wholesaler;4            (B) the volume, type, or model of program, 5        certified, or other used motor vehicles that a motor 6        vehicle dealer is eligible to purchase from the 7        manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler;8            (C) the price of any program, certified, or other 9        used motor vehicle that the dealer is eligible to 10        purchase from the manufacturer, distributor, or 11        wholesaler; or12            (D) the availability or amount of any discount, 13        credit, rebate, or sales incentive that the dealer is 14        eligible to receive from the manufacturer, 15        distributor, or wholesaler for the purchase of any 16        program, certified, or other used motor vehicle 17        offered for sale by the manufacturer, distributor, or 18        wholesaler;19        (10) to take any adverse action against a dealer 20    pursuant to an export or sale-for-resale prohibition 21    because the dealer sold or leased a vehicle to a customer 22    who either exported the vehicle to a foreign country or 23    resold the vehicle in violation of the prohibition, unless 24    the export or sale-for-resale prohibition policy was 25    provided to the dealer in writing either electronically or 26    on paper, prior to the sale or lease, and the dealer knew   SB1939- 19 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    or reasonably should have known of the customer's intent 2    to export or resell the vehicle in violation of the 3    prohibition at the time of the sale or lease. If the dealer 4    causes the vehicle to be registered and titled in this or 5    any other state, and collects or causes to be collected 6    any applicable sales or use tax to this State, a 7    rebuttable presumption is established that the dealer did 8    not have reason to know of the customer's intent to resell 9    the vehicle;10        (11) to coerce or require any dealer to construct 11    improvements to his or her facilities or to install new 12    signs or other franchiser image elements that replace or 13    substantially alter those improvements, signs, or 14    franchiser image elements completed within the past 10 15    years that were required and approved by the manufacturer 16    or one of its affiliates. The 10-year period under this 17    paragraph (11) begins to run for a dealer, including that 18    dealer's successors and assigns, on the date that the 19    manufacturer gives final written approval of the facility 20    improvements or installation of signs or other franchiser 21    image elements or the date that the dealer receives a 22    certificate of occupancy, whichever is later. For the 23    purpose of this paragraph (11), the term "substantially 24    alter" does not include routine maintenance, including, 25    but not limited to, interior painting, that is reasonably 26    necessary to keep a dealer facility in attractive   SB1939- 20 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    condition; or 2        (12) to require a dealer to purchase goods or services 3    to make improvements to the dealer's facilities from a 4    vendor selected, identified, or designated by a 5    manufacturer or one of its affiliates by agreement, 6    program, incentive provision, or otherwise without making 7    available to the dealer the option to obtain the goods or 8    services of substantially similar quality and overall 9    design from a vendor chosen by the dealer and approved by 10    the manufacturer; however, approval by the manufacturer 11    shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the dealer's 12    option to select a vendor shall not be available if the 13    manufacturer provides substantial reimbursement for the 14    goods or services offered. "Substantial reimbursement" 15    means an amount equal to or greater than the cost savings 16    that would result if the dealer were to utilize a vendor of 17    the dealer's own selection instead of using the vendor 18    identified by the manufacturer. For the purpose of this 19    paragraph (12), the term "goods" does not include movable 20    displays, brochures, and promotional materials containing 21    material subject to the intellectual property rights of a 22    manufacturer. If signs, other than signs containing the 23    manufacturer's brand or logo or free-standing signs that 24    are not directly attached to a building, or other 25    franchiser image or design elements or trade dress are to 26    be leased to the dealer by a vendor selected, identified,   SB1939- 21 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    or designated by the manufacturer, the dealer has the 2    right to purchase the signs or other franchiser image or 3    design elements or trade dress of substantially similar 4    quality and design from a vendor selected by the dealer if 5    the signs, franchiser image or design elements, or trade 6    dress are approved by the manufacturer. Approval by the 7    manufacturer shall not be unreasonably withheld. This 8    paragraph (12) shall not be construed to allow a dealer or 9    vendor to impair, infringe upon, or eliminate, directly or 10    indirectly, the intellectual property rights of the 11    manufacturer, including, but not limited to, the 12    manufacturer's intellectual property rights in any 13    trademarks or trade dress, or other intellectual property 14    interests owned or controlled by the manufacturer. This 15    paragraph (12) shall not be construed to permit a dealer 16    to erect or maintain signs that do not conform to the 17    manufacturer's intellectual property rights or trademark 18    or trade dress usage guidelines. 19        (13) to establish or utilize any common entity, 20    affiliate, or spin-off company to sell, lease, or 21    otherwise distribute new motor vehicles directly to 22    consumers or to circumvent franchise distribution 23    obligations under this Act, where the manufacturer, 24    including any common entities, subsidiaries, or 25    affiliates, currently or previously maintained a franchise 26    agreement for the retail sale of motor vehicles in this   SB1939- 22 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    State. 2    (e) It shall be deemed a violation for a manufacturer, any 3parent, subsidiary, affiliate, agent, or entity under common 4ownership or control of the manufacturer, a distributor, a 5wholesaler, a distributor branch or division or officer, agent 6or other representative thereof:7        (1) to resort to or use any false or misleading 8    advertisement in connection with his business as such 9    manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch 10    or division or officer, agent or other representative 11    thereof;12        (2) to offer to sell or lease, or to sell or lease, any 13    new motor vehicle to any motor vehicle dealer at a lower 14    actual price therefor than the actual price offered to any 15    other motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle 16    similarly equipped or to utilize any device including, but 17    not limited to, sales promotion plans or programs which 18    result in such lesser actual price or fail to make 19    available to any motor vehicle dealer any preferential 20    pricing, incentive, rebate, finance rate, or low interest 21    loan program offered to competing motor vehicle dealers in 22    other contiguous states. However, the provisions of this 23    paragraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle 24    dealer for resale to any unit of the United States 25    Government, the State or any of its political 26    subdivisions;  SB1939- 23 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        (3) to offer to sell or lease, or to sell or lease, any 2    new motor vehicle to any person, except a wholesaler, 3    distributor or manufacturer's employees at a lower actual 4    price therefor than the actual price offered and charged 5    to a motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle 6    similarly equipped or to utilize any device which results 7    in such lesser actual price. However, the provisions of 8    this paragraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle 9    dealer for resale to any unit of the United States 10    Government, the State or any of its political 11    subdivisions;12        (4) to prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or 13    otherwise any motor vehicle dealer or franchisee from 14    changing the executive management control of the motor 15    vehicle dealer or franchisee unless the franchiser, having 16    the burden of proof, proves that such change of executive 17    management will result in executive management control by 18    a person or persons who are not of good moral character or 19    who do not meet the franchiser's existing and, with 20    consideration given to the volume of sales and service of 21    the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 22    experience standards in the market area. However, where 23    the manufacturer rejects a proposed change in executive 24    management control, the manufacturer shall give written 25    notice of his reasons to the dealer within 60 days of 26    notice to the manufacturer by the dealer of the proposed   SB1939- 24 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    change. If the manufacturer does not send a letter to the 2    franchisee by certified mail, return receipt requested, 3    within 60 days from receipt by the manufacturer of the 4    proposed change, then the change of the executive 5    management control of the franchisee shall be deemed 6    accepted as proposed by the franchisee, and the 7    manufacturer shall give immediate effect to such change;8        (5) to prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or 9    otherwise any motor vehicle dealer from establishing or 10    changing the capital structure of his dealership or the 11    means by or through which he finances the operation 12    thereof; provided the dealer meets any reasonable capital 13    standards agreed to between the dealer and the 14    manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler, who may require 15    that the sources, method and manner by which the dealer 16    finances or intends to finance its operation, equipment or 17    facilities be fully disclosed; 18        (6) to refuse to give effect to or prevent or attempt 19    to prevent by contract or otherwise any motor vehicle 20    dealer or any officer, partner or stockholder of any motor 21    vehicle dealer from selling or transferring any part of 22    the interest of any of them to any other person or persons 23    or party or parties unless such sale or transfer is to a 24    transferee who would not otherwise qualify for a new motor 25    vehicle dealers license under the Illinois Vehicle Code or 26    unless the franchiser, having the burden of proof, proves   SB1939- 25 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    that such sale or transfer is to a person or party who is 2    not of good moral character or does not meet the 3    franchiser's existing and reasonable capital standards 4    and, with consideration given to the volume of sales and 5    service of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum 6    business experience standards in the market area. However, 7    nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a franchiser 8    from implementing affirmative action programs providing 9    business opportunities for minorities or from complying 10    with applicable federal, State or local law:11            (A) If the manufacturer intends to refuse to 12        approve the sale or transfer of all or a part of the 13        interest, then it shall, within 60 days from receipt 14        of the completed application forms generally utilized 15        by a manufacturer to conduct its review and a copy of 16        all agreements regarding the proposed transfer, send a 17        letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, 18        advising the franchisee of any refusal to approve the 19        sale or transfer of all or part of the interest and 20        shall state that the dealer only has 30 days from the 21        receipt of the notice to file with the Motor Vehicle 22        Review Board a written protest against the proposed 23        action. The notice shall set forth specific criteria 24        used to evaluate the prospective transferee and the 25        grounds for refusing to approve the sale or transfer 26        to that transferee. Within 30 days from the   SB1939- 26 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        franchisee's receipt of the manufacturer's notice, the 2        franchisee may file with the Board a written protest 3        against the proposed action.4            When a protest has been timely filed, the Board 5        shall enter an order, fixing the date (within 60 days 6        of the date of such order), time, and place of a 7        hearing on the protest, required under Sections 12 and 8        29 of this Act, and send by certified mail, return 9        receipt requested, a copy of the order to the 10        manufacturer that filed notice of intention of the 11        proposed action and to the protesting franchisee.12            The manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to 13        establish that good cause exists to refuse to approve 14        the sale or transfer to the transferee. The 15        determination whether good cause exists to refuse to 16        approve the sale or transfer shall be made by the Board 17        under subdivisions (6)(B). The manufacturer shall not 18        refuse to approve the sale or transfer by a dealer or 19        an officer, partner, or stockholder of a franchise or 20        any part of the interest to any person or persons 21        before the hearing process is concluded as prescribed 22        by this Act, and thereafter if the Board determines 23        that the manufacturer has failed to meet its burden of 24        proof and that good cause does not exist to refuse to 25        approve the sale or transfer to the transferee.26            (B) Good cause to refuse to approve such sale or   SB1939- 27 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        transfer under this Section is established when such 2        sale or transfer is to a transferee who would not 3        otherwise qualify for a new motor vehicle dealers 4        license under the Illinois Vehicle Code or such sale 5        or transfer is to a person or party who is not of good 6        moral character or does not meet the franchiser's 7        existing and reasonable capital standards and, with 8        consideration given to the volume of sales and service 9        of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 10        experience standards in the market area.11        (7) to obtain money, goods, services, anything of 12    value, or any other benefit from any other person with 13    whom the motor vehicle dealer does business, on account of 14    or in relation to the transactions between the dealer and 15    the other person as compensation, except for services 16    actually rendered, unless such benefit is promptly 17    accounted for and transmitted to the motor vehicle dealer;18        (8) to grant an additional franchise in the relevant 19    market area of an existing franchise of the same line make 20    or to relocate an existing motor vehicle dealership within 21    or into a relevant market area of an existing franchise of 22    the same line make. However, if the manufacturer wishes to 23    grant such an additional franchise to an independent 24    person in a bona fide relationship in which such person is 25    prepared to make a significant investment subject to loss 26    in such a dealership, or if the manufacturer wishes to   SB1939- 28 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    relocate an existing motor vehicle dealership, then the 2    manufacturer shall send a letter by certified mail, return 3    receipt requested, to each existing dealer or dealers of 4    the same line make whose relevant market area includes the 5    proposed location of the additional or relocated franchise 6    at least 60 days before the manufacturer grants an 7    additional franchise or relocates an existing franchise of 8    the same line make within or into the relevant market area 9    of an existing franchisee of the same line make. Each 10    notice shall set forth the specific grounds for the 11    proposed grant of an additional or relocation of an 12    existing franchise and shall state that the dealer has 13    only 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice to file 14    with the Motor Vehicle Review Board a written protest 15    against the proposed action. Unless the parties agree upon 16    the grant or establishment of the additional or relocated 17    franchise within 30 days from the date the notice was 18    received by the existing franchisee of the same line make 19    or any person entitled to receive such notice, the 20    franchisee or other person may file with the Board a 21    written protest against the grant or establishment of the 22    proposed additional or relocated franchise.23        When a protest has been timely filed, the Board shall 24    enter an order fixing a date (within 60 days of the date of 25    the order), time, and place of a hearing on the protest, 26    required under Sections 12 and 29 of this Act, and send by   SB1939- 29 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, a 2    copy of the order to the manufacturer that filed the 3    notice of intention to grant or establish the proposed 4    additional or relocated franchise and to the protesting 5    dealer or dealers of the same line make whose relevant 6    market area includes the proposed location of the 7    additional or relocated franchise. 8        When more than one protest is filed against the grant 9    or establishment of the additional or relocated franchise 10    of the same line make, the Board may consolidate the 11    hearings to expedite disposition of the matter. The 12    manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to establish 13    that good cause exists to allow the grant or establishment 14    of the additional or relocated franchise. The manufacturer 15    may not grant or establish the additional franchise or 16    relocate the existing franchise before the hearing process 17    is concluded as prescribed by this Act, and thereafter if 18    the Board determines that the manufacturer has failed to 19    meet its burden of proof and that good cause does not exist 20    to allow the grant or establishment of the additional 21    franchise or relocation of the existing franchise.22        The determination whether good cause exists for 23    allowing the grant or establishment of an additional 24    franchise or relocated existing franchise, shall be made 25    by the Board under subsection (c) of Section 12 of this 26    Act. If the manufacturer seeks to enter into a contract,   SB1939- 30 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    agreement or other arrangement with any person, 2    establishing any additional motor vehicle dealership or 3    other facility, limited to the sale of factory repurchase 4    vehicles or late model vehicles, then the manufacturer 5    shall follow the notice procedures set forth in this 6    Section and the determination whether good cause exists 7    for allowing the proposed agreement shall be made by the 8    Board under subsection (c) of Section 12, with the 9    manufacturer having the burden of proof.10            A. (Blank).11            B. For the purposes of this Section, appointment 12        of a successor motor vehicle dealer at the same 13        location as its predecessor, or within 2 miles of such 14        location, or the relocation of an existing dealer or 15        franchise within 2 miles of the relocating dealer's or 16        franchisee's existing location, shall not be construed 17        as a grant, establishment or the entering into of an 18        additional franchise or selling agreement, or a 19        relocation of an existing franchise. The reopening of 20        a motor vehicle dealership that has not been in 21        operation for 18 months or more shall be deemed the 22        grant of an additional franchise or selling agreement.23            C. This Section does not apply to the relocation 24        of an existing dealership or franchise in a county 25        having a population of more than 300,000 persons when 26        the new location is within the dealer's current   SB1939- 31 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        relevant market area, provided the new location is 2        more than 7 miles from the nearest dealer of the same 3        line make. This Section does not apply to the 4        relocation of an existing dealership or franchise in a 5        county having a population of less than 300,000 6        persons when the new location is within the dealer's 7        current relevant market area, provided the new 8        location is more than 12 miles from the nearest dealer 9        of the same line make. A dealer that would be farther 10        away from the new location of an existing dealership 11        or franchise of the same line make after a relocation 12        may not file a written protest against the relocation 13        with the Motor Vehicle Review Board.14            D. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to 15        prevent a franchiser from implementing affirmative 16        action programs providing business opportunities for 17        minorities or from complying with applicable federal, 18        State or local law;19        (9) to require a motor vehicle dealer to assent to a 20    release, assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which 21    would relieve any person from liability imposed by this 22    Act;23        (10) to prevent or refuse to give effect to the 24    succession to the ownership or management control of a 25    dealership by any legatee under the will of a dealer or to 26    an heir under the laws of descent and distribution of this   SB1939- 32 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    State unless the franchisee has designated a successor to 2    the ownership or management control under the succession 3    provisions of the franchise. Unless the franchiser, having 4    the burden of proof, proves that the successor is a person 5    who is not of good moral character or does not meet the 6    franchiser's existing and reasonable capital standards 7    and, with consideration given to the volume of sales and 8    service of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum 9    business experience standards in the market area, any 10    designated successor of a dealer or franchisee may succeed 11    to the ownership or management control of a dealership 12    under the existing franchise if:13                (i) The designated successor gives the 14            franchiser written notice by certified mail, 15            return receipt requested, of his or her intention 16            to succeed to the ownership of the dealer within 17            60 days of the dealer's death or incapacity; and18                (ii) The designated successor agrees to be 19            bound by all the terms and conditions of the 20            existing franchise.21        Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the motor 22    vehicle dealer or franchisee and manufacturer have duly 23    executed an agreement concerning succession rights prior 24    to the dealer's death or incapacitation, the agreement 25    shall be observed.26            (A) If the franchiser intends to refuse to honor   SB1939- 33 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        the successor to the ownership of a deceased or 2        incapacitated dealer or franchisee under an existing 3        franchise agreement, the franchiser shall send a 4        letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, to 5        the designated successor within 60 days from receipt 6        of a proposal advising of its intent to refuse to honor 7        the succession and to discontinue the existing 8        franchise agreement and shall state that the 9        designated successor only has 30 days from the receipt 10        of the notice to file with the Motor Vehicle Review 11        Board a written protest against the proposed action. 12        The notice shall set forth the specific grounds for 13        the refusal to honor the succession and discontinue 14        the existing franchise agreement.15            If notice of refusal is not timely served upon the 16        designated successor, the franchise agreement shall 17        continue in effect subject to termination only as 18        otherwise permitted by paragraph (6) of subsection (d) 19        of Section 4 of this Act.20            Within 30 days from the date the notice was 21        received by the designated successor or any other 22        person entitled to notice, the designee or other 23        person may file with the Board a written protest 24        against the proposed action.25            When a protest has been timely filed, the Board 26        shall enter an order, fixing a date (within 60 days of   SB1939- 34 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        the date of the order), time, and place of a hearing on 2        the protest, required under Sections 12 and 29 of this 3        Act, and send by certified mail, return receipt 4        requested, a copy of the order to the franchiser that 5        filed the notice of intention of the proposed action 6        and to the protesting designee or such other person.7            The manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to 8        establish that good cause exists to refuse to honor 9        the succession and discontinue the existing franchise 10        agreement. The determination whether good cause exists 11        to refuse to honor the succession shall be made by the 12        Board under subdivision (B) of this paragraph (10). 13        The manufacturer shall not refuse to honor the 14        succession or discontinue the existing franchise 15        agreement before the hearing process is concluded as 16        prescribed by this Act, and thereafter if the Board 17        determines that it has failed to meet its burden of 18        proof and that good cause does not exist to refuse to 19        honor the succession and discontinue the existing 20        franchise agreement.21            (B) No manufacturer shall impose any conditions 22        upon honoring the succession and continuing the 23        existing franchise agreement with the designated 24        successor other than that the franchisee has 25        designated a successor to the ownership or management 26        control under the succession provisions of the   SB1939- 35 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        franchise, or that the designated successor is of good 2        moral character or meets the reasonable capital 3        standards and, with consideration given to the volume 4        of sales and service of the dealership, uniformly 5        applied minimum business experience standards in the 6        market area;7        (11) to prevent or refuse to approve a proposal to 8    establish a successor franchise at a location previously 9    approved by the franchiser when submitted with the 10    voluntary termination by the existing franchisee unless 11    the successor franchisee would not otherwise qualify for a 12    new motor vehicle dealer's license under the Illinois 13    Vehicle Code or unless the franchiser, having the burden 14    of proof, proves that such proposed successor is not of 15    good moral character or does not meet the franchiser's 16    existing and reasonable capital standards and, with 17    consideration given to the volume of sales and service of 18    the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 19    experience standards in the market area. However, when 20    such a rejection of a proposal is made, the manufacturer 21    shall give written notice of its reasons to the franchisee 22    within 60 days of receipt by the manufacturer of the 23    proposal. However, nothing herein shall be construed to 24    prevent a franchiser from implementing affirmative action 25    programs providing business opportunities for minorities, 26    or from complying with applicable federal, State or local   SB1939- 36 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    law;2        (12) to prevent or refuse to grant a franchise to a 3    person because such person owns, has investment in or 4    participates in the management of or holds a franchise for 5    the sale of another make or line of motor vehicles within 7 6    miles of the proposed franchise location in a county 7    having a population of more than 300,000 persons, or 8    within 12 miles of the proposed franchise location in a 9    county having a population of less than 300,000 persons;10        (13) to prevent or attempt to prevent any new motor 11    vehicle dealer from establishing any additional motor 12    vehicle dealership or other facility limited to the sale 13    of factory repurchase vehicles or late model vehicles or 14    otherwise offering for sale factory repurchase vehicles of 15    the same line make at an existing franchise by failing to 16    make available any contract, agreement or other 17    arrangement which is made available or otherwise offered 18    to any person; or19        (14) to exercise a right of first refusal or other 20    right to acquire a franchise from a dealer, unless the 21    manufacturer: (i) notifies the dealer in writing that it 22    intends to exercise a right of first refusal no later than 23    60 days after the manufacturer receives a notice of the 24    proposed transfer from the dealer; and (ii) having the 25    burden of proof, proves that the dealer's proposed 26    transferee is a person who is not of good moral character   SB1939- 37 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    or does not meet the manufacturer's existing and 2    reasonable capital standards, and with consideration given 3    to the volume of sales and service of the dealership, 4    uniformly applied minimum business experience standards in 5    the market area.6        Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to 7    prevent a manufacturer from exercising the right of first 8    refusal for the purpose of implementing an affirmative 9    action program or providing business opportunities for 10    minorities, or from complying with applicable federal, 11    State or local law, provided: (i) the manufacturer has a 12    formal written program for increasing minority 13    representation in its dealer network; (ii) the right of 14    first refusal ensures that a minority dealer will acquire 15    at least 51% ownership and control of the dealership's 16    assets after the transfer; and (iii) the manufacturer 17    fulfills this obligation in good faith and does not 18    subsequently rescind, assign, or abandon the affirmative 19    action-based transfer.20        If a manufacturer satisfies the requirements of this 21    paragraph and exercises a right of first refusal, the 22    manufacturer shall:23            (A) notify notifies the dealer in writing that it 24        intends to exercise its right to acquire the franchise 25        not later than 60 days after the manufacturer's or 26        distributor's receipt of a notice of the proposed   SB1939- 38 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        transfer from the dealer and all information and 2        documents reasonably and customarily required by the 3        manufacturer or distributor supporting the proposed 4        transfer;5            (B) pay pays to the dealer the same or greater 6        consideration as the dealer has contracted to receive 7        in connection with the proposed transfer or sale of 8        all or substantially all of the dealership assets, 9        stock, or other ownership interest, including the 10        purchase or lease of all real property, leasehold, or 11        improvements related to the transfer or sale of the 12        dealership. Upon exercise of the right of first 13        refusal or such other right, the manufacturer or 14        distributor shall have the right to assign the lease 15        or to convey the real property;16            (C) assume assumes all of the duties, obligations, 17        and liabilities contained in the agreements that were 18        to be assumed by the proposed transferee and with 19        respect to which the manufacturer or distributor 20        exercised the right of first refusal or other right to 21        acquire the franchise;22            (D) reimburse reimburses the proposed transferee 23        for all reasonable expenses incurred in evaluating, 24        investigating, and negotiating the transfer of the 25        dealership prior to the manufacturer's or 26        distributor's exercise of its right of first refusal   SB1939- 39 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        or other right to acquire the dealership.

(ii) the last day that 20a former franchisee is authorized to remain in business as a 21franchised dealer with respect to a particular franchise under 22a termination agreement or deferred termination agreement with 23a predecessor or successor manufacturer; (iii) the last day 24that a former franchisee that was cancelled, terminated, 25nonrenewed, noncontinued, rejected, nonassumed, or otherwise 26ended by a predecessor or successor manufacturer is authorized   SB1939- 47 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1to remain in business as a franchised dealer with respect to a 2particular franchise; or (iv) November 25, 2009 (the effective 3date of Public Act 96-824), whichever is latest, it shall be 4unlawful for such successor manufacturer to enter into a same 5line make franchise with any person or to permit the 6relocation of any existing same line make franchise, for a 7line make of the predecessor manufacturer that would be 8located or relocated within the relevant market area of a 9former franchisee who owned or leased a dealership facility in 10that relevant market area without first offering the 11additional or relocated franchise to the former franchisee, or 12the designated successor of such former franchisee in the 13event the former franchisee is deceased or a person with a 14disability, at no cost and without any requirements or 15restrictions other than those imposed generally on the 16manufacturer's other franchisees at that time, unless one of 17the following applies: 18        (1) As a result of the former franchisee's 19    cancellation, termination, noncontinuance, or nonrenewal 20    of the franchise, the predecessor manufacturer had 21    consolidated the line make with another of its line makes 22    for which the predecessor manufacturer had a franchisee 23    with a then-existing dealership facility located within 24    that relevant market area.25        (2) The successor manufacturer has paid the former 26    franchisee, or the designated successor of such former   SB1939- 48 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    franchisee in the event the former franchisee is deceased 2    or a person with a disability, the fair market value of the 3    former franchisee's franchise on (i) the date the 4    franchiser announces the action which results in the 5    termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal; or (ii) the date 6    the action which results in termination, cancellation, or 7    nonrenewal first became general knowledge; or (iii) the 8    day 12 months prior to the date on which the notice of 9    termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal is issued, 10    whichever amount is higher. Payment is due within 90 days 11    of the effective date of the termination, cancellation, or 12    nonrenewal. If the termination, cancellation, or 13    nonrenewal is due to a manufacturer's change in 14    distributors, the manufacturer may avoid paying fair 15    market value to the dealer if the new distributor or the 16    manufacturer offers the dealer a franchise agreement with 17    terms acceptable to the dealer.18        (3) The successor manufacturer proves that it would 19    have had good cause to terminate the franchise agreement 20    of the former franchisee, or the successor of the former 21    franchisee under item (e)(10) in the event that the former 22    franchisee is deceased or a person with a disability. The 23    determination of whether the successor manufacturer would 24    have had good cause to terminate the franchise agreement 25    of the former franchisee, or the successor of the former 26    franchisee, shall be made by the Board under subsection   SB1939- 49 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    (d) of Section 12. A successor manufacturer that seeks to 2    assert that it would have had good cause to terminate a 3    former franchisee, or the successor of the former 4    franchisee, must file a petition seeking a hearing on this 5    issue before the Board and shall have the burden of 6    proving that it would have had good cause to terminate the 7    former franchisee or the successor of the former 8    franchisee. No successor dealer, other than the former 9    franchisee, may be appointed or franchised by the 10    successor manufacturer within the relevant market area of 11    the former franchisee until the Board has held a hearing 12    and rendered a determination on the issue of whether the 13    successor manufacturer would have had good cause to 14    terminate the former franchisee. 15    In the event that a successor manufacturer attempts to 16enter into a same line make franchise with any person or to 17permit the relocation of any existing line make franchise 18under this subsection (h) at a location that is within the 19relevant market area of 2 or more former franchisees, then the 20successor manufacturer may not offer it to any person other 21than one of those former franchisees unless the successor 22manufacturer can prove that at least one of the 3 exceptions in 23items (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection (h) applies to each 24of those former franchisees. 25    (i) It shall be deemed a violation of this Section for any 26manufacturer with an established franchise dealer network in   SB1939- 50 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1this State, either directly or indirectly, through any parent, 2subsidiary, affiliate, or agent of the manufacturer, any 3person under common ownership or control, or common entity, to 4engage in the sale, lease, or servicing of new motor vehicles 5in a manner that bypasses or competes with the manufacturer's 6existing franchisee network, including, but not limited to:7        (1) engaging in practices intended to circumvent, 8    evade, or undermine the rights, obligations, or 9    protections afforded to franchisees under this Act; or10        (2) establishing or using newly branded entities, 11    spin-offs, or affiliated or subsidiary entities to conduct 12    retail operations outside the franchise system.13    (j) A manufacturer or distributor shall not engage in the 14sale of new motor vehicles directly to the general public in 15this State unless the manufacturer or distributor was lawfully 16licensed to sell new motor vehicles directly to consumers in 17this State before January 1, 2022.18(Source: P.A. 102-433, eff. 1-1-22.) 19    (815 ILCS 710/6)  (from Ch. 121 1/2, par. 756)20    Sec. 6. Warranty agreements; claims; approval; payment; 21written disapproval.22    (a) Every manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, 23distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or 24wholesale branch or division shall properly fulfill any 25warranty agreement and adequately and fairly compensate each   SB1939- 51 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1of its motor vehicle dealers for labor and parts.2    (b) Adequate and fair compensation requires the 3manufacturer to pay each dealer no less than the amount the 4retail customer pays for the same services with regard to rate 5and time.6    Any time guide previously agreed to by the manufacturer 7and the dealer for extended warranty repairs may be used in 8lieu of actual time expended. In the event that a time guide 9has not been agreed to for warranty repairs, or said time guide 10does not define time for an applicable warranty repair, the 11manufacturer's time guide shall be used, multiplied by 1.5. 12    In no event shall such compensation fail to include full 13compensation for diagnostic work, as well as repair service, 14labor, and parts. Time allowances for the diagnosis and 15performance of warranty work and service shall be no less than 16charged to retail customers for the same work to be performed.17    No warranty or factory compensated repairs shall be 18excluded from this requirement, including recalls or other 19voluntary stop-sell repairs required by the manufacturer. If a 20manufacturer is required to issue a recall, the dealer will be 21compensated for labor time as above stated.22    Furthermore, manufacturers shall pay the dealer the same 23effective labor rate (using the 100 sequential repair orders 24chosen and submitted by the dealer less simple maintenance 25repair orders) that the dealer receives for customer-pay 26repairs. This requirement includes vehicle diagnostic times   SB1939- 52 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1for all warranty repairs. Additionally, if a technician is 2required to communicate with a Technical Assistance 3Center/Engineering/or some external manufacturer source in 4order to provide a warranty repair, the manufacturer shall pay 5for the time from start of communications (including hold 6time) until the communication is complete.7    The dealer may submit a request to the manufacturer for 8warranty labor rate increases a maximum of once per calendar 9year; provided that if the manufacturer denies any request for 10warranty labor rate increase the dealer may resubmit a new 11request in the same calendar year.12    A claim made by a franchised motor vehicle dealer for 13compensation under this Section shall be either approved or 14disapproved within 30 days after the claim is submitted to the 15manufacturer in the manner and on the forms the manufacturer 16reasonably prescribes. An approved claim shall be paid within 1730 days after its approval. If a claim is not specifically 18disapproved in writing or by electronic transmission within 30 19days after the date on which the manufacturer receives it, the 20claim shall be considered to be approved and payment shall 21follow within 30 days. 22    In no event shall compensation to a motor vehicle dealer 23for labor times and labor rates be less than the rates charged 24by such dealer for like service to retail customers for 25nonwarranty service and repairs. Additionally, the 26manufacturer shall reimburse the dealer for any parts provided   SB1939- 53 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1in satisfaction of a warranty at the prevailing retail price 2charged by that dealer for the same parts when not provided in 3satisfaction of a warranty; provided that such dealer's 4prevailing retail price is not unreasonable when compared with 5that of the holders of motor vehicle franchises from the same 6manufacturer for identical parts in the geographic area in 7which the dealer is engaged in business.8    There shall be no reduction in payments due to 9preestablished market norms or market averages. Manufacturers 10are prohibited from establishing restrictions or limitations 11of customer repair frequency due to failure rate indexes or 12national failure averages.13    No debit reduction or charge back of any item on a warranty 14repair order may be made absent a finding of fraud or illegal 15actions by the dealer.16    A warranty claim timely made shall not be deemed invalid 17solely because unavailable parts cause additional use and 18mileage on the vehicle.19    If a manufacturer imposes a recall or stop sale on any new 20vehicle in a dealer's inventory that prevents the sale of the 21vehicle, the manufacturer shall compensate the dealer for any 22interest and storage until the vehicle is repaired and made 23ready for sale.24    Manufacturers are not permitted to impose any form of cost 25recovery fees or surcharges against a franchised auto 26dealership for payments made in accordance with this Section.   SB1939- 54 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    All claims, either original or resubmitted, made by motor 2vehicle dealers hereunder and under Section 5 for such labor 3and parts shall be either approved or disapproved within 30 4days following their submission. All approved claims shall be 5paid within 30 days following their approval. The motor 6vehicle dealer who submits a claim which is disapproved shall 7be notified in writing of the disapproval within the same 8period, and each such notice shall state the specific grounds 9upon which the disapproval is based. The motor vehicle dealer 10shall be permitted to correct and resubmit such disapproved 11claims within 30 days of receipt of disapproval. Any claims 12not specifically disapproved in writing within 30 days from 13their submission shall be deemed approved and payment shall 14follow within 30 days. The manufacturer or franchiser shall 15have the right to require reasonable documentation for claims 16and to audit such claims within a one year period from the date 17the claim was paid or credit issued by the manufacturer or 18franchiser, and to charge back any false or unsubstantiated 19claims. The audit and charge back provisions of this Section 20also apply to all other incentive and reimbursement programs 21for a period of one year after the date the claim was paid or 22credit issued by the manufacturer or franchiser. However, the 23manufacturer retains the right to charge back any fraudulent 24claim if the manufacturer establishes in a court of competent 25jurisdiction in this State that the claim is fraudulent.26    (c) The motor vehicle franchiser shall not, by agreement,   SB1939- 55 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1by restrictions upon reimbursement, or otherwise, restrict the 2nature and extent of services to be rendered or parts to be 3provided so that such restriction prevents the motor vehicle 4franchisee from satisfying the warranty by rendering services 5in a good and workmanlike manner and providing parts which are 6required in accordance with generally accepted standards. Any 7such restriction shall constitute a prohibited practice.8    (d) For the purposes of this Section, the "prevailing 9retail price charged by that dealer for the same parts" means 10the price paid by the motor vehicle franchisee for parts, 11including all shipping and other charges, multiplied by the 12sum of 1.0 and the franchisee's average percentage markup over 13the price paid by the motor vehicle franchisee for parts 14purchased by the motor vehicle franchisee from the motor 15vehicle franchiser and sold at retail. The motor vehicle 16franchisee may establish average percentage markup under this 17Section by submitting to the motor vehicle franchiser 100 18sequential customer paid service repair orders or 90 days of 19customer paid service repair orders, whichever is less, 20covering repairs made no more than 180 days before the 21submission, and declaring what the average percentage markup 22is. The average percentage markup so declared shall go into 23effect 30 days following the declaration, subject to audit of 24the submitted repair orders by the motor vehicle franchiser 25and adjustment of the average percentage markup based on that 26audit. Any audit must be conducted within 30 days following   SB1939- 56 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1the declaration. Only retail sales not involving warranty 2repairs, parts covered by subsection (e) of this Section, or 3parts supplied for routine vehicle maintenance, shall be 4considered in calculating average percentage markup. For the 5purpose of this subsection, "routine maintenance" includes, 6but is not limited to: (i) the replacement of oil or other 7fluids, filters, batteries for internal combustion engine 8vehicles, bulbs, brake pads, rotors, nuts, bolts, or 9fasteners; (ii) the replacement of or work on tires or wheels, 10including wheel alignments and tire and wheel rotations; and 11(iii) the installation of an accessory. No motor vehicle 12franchiser shall require a motor vehicle franchisee to 13establish average percentage markup by a methodology, or by 14requiring information, that is unduly burdensome or time 15consuming to provide, including, but not limited to, part by 16part or transaction by transaction calculations. A motor 17vehicle franchisee shall not request a change in the average 18percentage markup more than twice in one calendar year; 19provided that, for any request that is not approved, a dealer 20may resubmit an additional request for a change in the average 21percentage markup.22    (e) If a motor vehicle franchiser supplies a part or parts 23for use in a repair rendered under a warranty other than by 24sale of that part or parts to the motor vehicle franchisee, the 25motor vehicle franchisee shall be entitled to compensation 26equivalent to the motor vehicle franchisee's average   SB1939- 57 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1percentage markup on the part or parts, as if the part or parts 2had been sold to the motor vehicle franchisee by the motor 3vehicle franchiser. The requirements of this subsection (e) 4shall not apply to entire engine assemblies, propulsion engine 5assemblies, including electric vehicle batteries, and entire 6transmission assemblies. In the case of those assemblies, the 7motor vehicle franchiser shall reimburse the motor vehicle 8franchisee up to and including 30% of what the motor vehicle 9franchisee would have paid the motor vehicle franchiser for 10the assembly if the assembly had not been supplied by the 11franchiser other than by the sale of that assembly to the motor 12vehicle franchisee. 13    (f) The obligations imposed on motor vehicle franchisers 14by this Section shall apply to any parent, subsidiary, 15affiliate, or agent of the motor vehicle franchiser, any 16person under common ownership or control, any employee of the 17motor vehicle franchiser, and any person holding 1% or more of 18the shares of any class of securities or other ownership 19interest in the motor vehicle franchiser, if a warranty or 20service or repair plan is issued by that person instead of or 21in addition to one issued by the motor vehicle franchiser.22    (g) (Blank).23(Source: P.A. 102-232, eff. 1-1-22; 102-669, eff. 11-16-21.)

The reasonable facilities requirement 4    set forth in item (ii) of subsection (d)(8) shall not 5    include any requirement that a franchisee establish or 6    maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display 7    space. Any decision by a motor vehicle dealer to sell 8    additional makes or lines at the motor vehicle dealer's 9    facility shall be presumed to be reasonable, and the 10    manufacturer shall have the burden to overcome that 11    presumption. A motor vehicle dealer must provide a written 12    notification of its intent to add a make or line of new 13    motor vehicles to the manufacturer. If the manufacturer 14    does not respond to the motor vehicle dealer, in writing, 15    objecting to the addition of the make or line within 60 16    days after the date that the motor vehicle dealer sends 17    the written notification, then the manufacturer shall be 18    deemed to have approved the addition of the make or line; 19        (9) to use or consider the performance of a motor 20    vehicle dealer relating to the sale of the manufacturer's, 21    distributor's, or wholesaler's vehicles or the motor 22    vehicle dealer's ability to satisfy any minimum sales or 23    market share quota or responsibility relating to the sale 24    of the manufacturer's, distributor's, or wholesaler's new 25    vehicles in determining:26            (A) the motor vehicle dealer's eligibility to   SB1939- 18 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        purchase program, certified, or other used motor 2        vehicles from the manufacturer, distributor, or 3        wholesaler;4            (B) the volume, type, or model of program, 5        certified, or other used motor vehicles that a motor 6        vehicle dealer is eligible to purchase from the 7        manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler;8            (C) the price of any program, certified, or other 9        used motor vehicle that the dealer is eligible to 10        purchase from the manufacturer, distributor, or 11        wholesaler; or12            (D) the availability or amount of any discount, 13        credit, rebate, or sales incentive that the dealer is 14        eligible to receive from the manufacturer, 15        distributor, or wholesaler for the purchase of any 16        program, certified, or other used motor vehicle 17        offered for sale by the manufacturer, distributor, or 18        wholesaler;19        (10) to take any adverse action against a dealer 20    pursuant to an export or sale-for-resale prohibition 21    because the dealer sold or leased a vehicle to a customer 22    who either exported the vehicle to a foreign country or 23    resold the vehicle in violation of the prohibition, unless 24    the export or sale-for-resale prohibition policy was 25    provided to the dealer in writing either electronically or 26    on paper, prior to the sale or lease, and the dealer knew   SB1939- 19 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    or reasonably should have known of the customer's intent 2    to export or resell the vehicle in violation of the 3    prohibition at the time of the sale or lease. If the dealer 4    causes the vehicle to be registered and titled in this or 5    any other state, and collects or causes to be collected 6    any applicable sales or use tax to this State, a 7    rebuttable presumption is established that the dealer did 8    not have reason to know of the customer's intent to resell 9    the vehicle;10        (11) to coerce or require any dealer to construct 11    improvements to his or her facilities or to install new 12    signs or other franchiser image elements that replace or 13    substantially alter those improvements, signs, or 14    franchiser image elements completed within the past 10 15    years that were required and approved by the manufacturer 16    or one of its affiliates. The 10-year period under this 17    paragraph (11) begins to run for a dealer, including that 18    dealer's successors and assigns, on the date that the 19    manufacturer gives final written approval of the facility 20    improvements or installation of signs or other franchiser 21    image elements or the date that the dealer receives a 22    certificate of occupancy, whichever is later. For the 23    purpose of this paragraph (11), the term "substantially 24    alter" does not include routine maintenance, including, 25    but not limited to, interior painting, that is reasonably 26    necessary to keep a dealer facility in attractive   SB1939- 20 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    condition; or 2        (12) to require a dealer to purchase goods or services 3    to make improvements to the dealer's facilities from a 4    vendor selected, identified, or designated by a 5    manufacturer or one of its affiliates by agreement, 6    program, incentive provision, or otherwise without making 7    available to the dealer the option to obtain the goods or 8    services of substantially similar quality and overall 9    design from a vendor chosen by the dealer and approved by 10    the manufacturer; however, approval by the manufacturer 11    shall not be unreasonably withheld, and the dealer's 12    option to select a vendor shall not be available if the 13    manufacturer provides substantial reimbursement for the 14    goods or services offered. "Substantial reimbursement" 15    means an amount equal to or greater than the cost savings 16    that would result if the dealer were to utilize a vendor of 17    the dealer's own selection instead of using the vendor 18    identified by the manufacturer. For the purpose of this 19    paragraph (12), the term "goods" does not include movable 20    displays, brochures, and promotional materials containing 21    material subject to the intellectual property rights of a 22    manufacturer. If signs, other than signs containing the 23    manufacturer's brand or logo or free-standing signs that 24    are not directly attached to a building, or other 25    franchiser image or design elements or trade dress are to 26    be leased to the dealer by a vendor selected, identified,   SB1939- 21 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    or designated by the manufacturer, the dealer has the 2    right to purchase the signs or other franchiser image or 3    design elements or trade dress of substantially similar 4    quality and design from a vendor selected by the dealer if 5    the signs, franchiser image or design elements, or trade 6    dress are approved by the manufacturer. Approval by the 7    manufacturer shall not be unreasonably withheld. This 8    paragraph (12) shall not be construed to allow a dealer or 9    vendor to impair, infringe upon, or eliminate, directly or 10    indirectly, the intellectual property rights of the 11    manufacturer, including, but not limited to, the 12    manufacturer's intellectual property rights in any 13    trademarks or trade dress, or other intellectual property 14    interests owned or controlled by the manufacturer. This 15    paragraph (12) shall not be construed to permit a dealer 16    to erect or maintain signs that do not conform to the 17    manufacturer's intellectual property rights or trademark 18    or trade dress usage guidelines. 19        (13) to establish or utilize any common entity, 20    affiliate, or spin-off company to sell, lease, or 21    otherwise distribute new motor vehicles directly to 22    consumers or to circumvent franchise distribution 23    obligations under this Act, where the manufacturer, 24    including any common entities, subsidiaries, or 25    affiliates, currently or previously maintained a franchise 26    agreement for the retail sale of motor vehicles in this   SB1939- 22 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    State. 2    (e) It shall be deemed a violation for a manufacturer, any 3parent, subsidiary, affiliate, agent, or entity under common 4ownership or control of the manufacturer, a distributor, a 5wholesaler, a distributor branch or division or officer, agent 6or other representative thereof:7        (1) to resort to or use any false or misleading 8    advertisement in connection with his business as such 9    manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, distributor branch 10    or division or officer, agent or other representative 11    thereof;12        (2) to offer to sell or lease, or to sell or lease, any 13    new motor vehicle to any motor vehicle dealer at a lower 14    actual price therefor than the actual price offered to any 15    other motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle 16    similarly equipped or to utilize any device including, but 17    not limited to, sales promotion plans or programs which 18    result in such lesser actual price or fail to make 19    available to any motor vehicle dealer any preferential 20    pricing, incentive, rebate, finance rate, or low interest 21    loan program offered to competing motor vehicle dealers in 22    other contiguous states. However, the provisions of this 23    paragraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle 24    dealer for resale to any unit of the United States 25    Government, the State or any of its political 26    subdivisions;  SB1939- 23 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        (3) to offer to sell or lease, or to sell or lease, any 2    new motor vehicle to any person, except a wholesaler, 3    distributor or manufacturer's employees at a lower actual 4    price therefor than the actual price offered and charged 5    to a motor vehicle dealer for the same model vehicle 6    similarly equipped or to utilize any device which results 7    in such lesser actual price. However, the provisions of 8    this paragraph shall not apply to sales to a motor vehicle 9    dealer for resale to any unit of the United States 10    Government, the State or any of its political 11    subdivisions;12        (4) to prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or 13    otherwise any motor vehicle dealer or franchisee from 14    changing the executive management control of the motor 15    vehicle dealer or franchisee unless the franchiser, having 16    the burden of proof, proves that such change of executive 17    management will result in executive management control by 18    a person or persons who are not of good moral character or 19    who do not meet the franchiser's existing and, with 20    consideration given to the volume of sales and service of 21    the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 22    experience standards in the market area. However, where 23    the manufacturer rejects a proposed change in executive 24    management control, the manufacturer shall give written 25    notice of his reasons to the dealer within 60 days of 26    notice to the manufacturer by the dealer of the proposed   SB1939- 24 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    change. If the manufacturer does not send a letter to the 2    franchisee by certified mail, return receipt requested, 3    within 60 days from receipt by the manufacturer of the 4    proposed change, then the change of the executive 5    management control of the franchisee shall be deemed 6    accepted as proposed by the franchisee, and the 7    manufacturer shall give immediate effect to such change;8        (5) to prevent or attempt to prevent by contract or 9    otherwise any motor vehicle dealer from establishing or 10    changing the capital structure of his dealership or the 11    means by or through which he finances the operation 12    thereof; provided the dealer meets any reasonable capital 13    standards agreed to between the dealer and the 14    manufacturer, distributor or wholesaler, who may require 15    that the sources, method and manner by which the dealer 16    finances or intends to finance its operation, equipment or 17    facilities be fully disclosed; 18        (6) to refuse to give effect to or prevent or attempt 19    to prevent by contract or otherwise any motor vehicle 20    dealer or any officer, partner or stockholder of any motor 21    vehicle dealer from selling or transferring any part of 22    the interest of any of them to any other person or persons 23    or party or parties unless such sale or transfer is to a 24    transferee who would not otherwise qualify for a new motor 25    vehicle dealers license under the Illinois Vehicle Code or 26    unless the franchiser, having the burden of proof, proves   SB1939- 25 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    that such sale or transfer is to a person or party who is 2    not of good moral character or does not meet the 3    franchiser's existing and reasonable capital standards 4    and, with consideration given to the volume of sales and 5    service of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum 6    business experience standards in the market area. However, 7    nothing herein shall be construed to prevent a franchiser 8    from implementing affirmative action programs providing 9    business opportunities for minorities or from complying 10    with applicable federal, State or local law:11            (A) If the manufacturer intends to refuse to 12        approve the sale or transfer of all or a part of the 13        interest, then it shall, within 60 days from receipt 14        of the completed application forms generally utilized 15        by a manufacturer to conduct its review and a copy of 16        all agreements regarding the proposed transfer, send a 17        letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, 18        advising the franchisee of any refusal to approve the 19        sale or transfer of all or part of the interest and 20        shall state that the dealer only has 30 days from the 21        receipt of the notice to file with the Motor Vehicle 22        Review Board a written protest against the proposed 23        action. The notice shall set forth specific criteria 24        used to evaluate the prospective transferee and the 25        grounds for refusing to approve the sale or transfer 26        to that transferee. Within 30 days from the   SB1939- 26 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        franchisee's receipt of the manufacturer's notice, the 2        franchisee may file with the Board a written protest 3        against the proposed action.4            When a protest has been timely filed, the Board 5        shall enter an order, fixing the date (within 60 days 6        of the date of such order), time, and place of a 7        hearing on the protest, required under Sections 12 and 8        29 of this Act, and send by certified mail, return 9        receipt requested, a copy of the order to the 10        manufacturer that filed notice of intention of the 11        proposed action and to the protesting franchisee.12            The manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to 13        establish that good cause exists to refuse to approve 14        the sale or transfer to the transferee. The 15        determination whether good cause exists to refuse to 16        approve the sale or transfer shall be made by the Board 17        under subdivisions (6)(B). The manufacturer shall not 18        refuse to approve the sale or transfer by a dealer or 19        an officer, partner, or stockholder of a franchise or 20        any part of the interest to any person or persons 21        before the hearing process is concluded as prescribed 22        by this Act, and thereafter if the Board determines 23        that the manufacturer has failed to meet its burden of 24        proof and that good cause does not exist to refuse to 25        approve the sale or transfer to the transferee.26            (B) Good cause to refuse to approve such sale or   SB1939- 27 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        transfer under this Section is established when such 2        sale or transfer is to a transferee who would not 3        otherwise qualify for a new motor vehicle dealers 4        license under the Illinois Vehicle Code or such sale 5        or transfer is to a person or party who is not of good 6        moral character or does not meet the franchiser's 7        existing and reasonable capital standards and, with 8        consideration given to the volume of sales and service 9        of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 10        experience standards in the market area.11        (7) to obtain money, goods, services, anything of 12    value, or any other benefit from any other person with 13    whom the motor vehicle dealer does business, on account of 14    or in relation to the transactions between the dealer and 15    the other person as compensation, except for services 16    actually rendered, unless such benefit is promptly 17    accounted for and transmitted to the motor vehicle dealer;18        (8) to grant an additional franchise in the relevant 19    market area of an existing franchise of the same line make 20    or to relocate an existing motor vehicle dealership within 21    or into a relevant market area of an existing franchise of 22    the same line make. However, if the manufacturer wishes to 23    grant such an additional franchise to an independent 24    person in a bona fide relationship in which such person is 25    prepared to make a significant investment subject to loss 26    in such a dealership, or if the manufacturer wishes to   SB1939- 28 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    relocate an existing motor vehicle dealership, then the 2    manufacturer shall send a letter by certified mail, return 3    receipt requested, to each existing dealer or dealers of 4    the same line make whose relevant market area includes the 5    proposed location of the additional or relocated franchise 6    at least 60 days before the manufacturer grants an 7    additional franchise or relocates an existing franchise of 8    the same line make within or into the relevant market area 9    of an existing franchisee of the same line make. Each 10    notice shall set forth the specific grounds for the 11    proposed grant of an additional or relocation of an 12    existing franchise and shall state that the dealer has 13    only 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice to file 14    with the Motor Vehicle Review Board a written protest 15    against the proposed action. Unless the parties agree upon 16    the grant or establishment of the additional or relocated 17    franchise within 30 days from the date the notice was 18    received by the existing franchisee of the same line make 19    or any person entitled to receive such notice, the 20    franchisee or other person may file with the Board a 21    written protest against the grant or establishment of the 22    proposed additional or relocated franchise.23        When a protest has been timely filed, the Board shall 24    enter an order fixing a date (within 60 days of the date of 25    the order), time, and place of a hearing on the protest, 26    required under Sections 12 and 29 of this Act, and send by   SB1939- 29 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, a 2    copy of the order to the manufacturer that filed the 3    notice of intention to grant or establish the proposed 4    additional or relocated franchise and to the protesting 5    dealer or dealers of the same line make whose relevant 6    market area includes the proposed location of the 7    additional or relocated franchise. 8        When more than one protest is filed against the grant 9    or establishment of the additional or relocated franchise 10    of the same line make, the Board may consolidate the 11    hearings to expedite disposition of the matter. The 12    manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to establish 13    that good cause exists to allow the grant or establishment 14    of the additional or relocated franchise. The manufacturer 15    may not grant or establish the additional franchise or 16    relocate the existing franchise before the hearing process 17    is concluded as prescribed by this Act, and thereafter if 18    the Board determines that the manufacturer has failed to 19    meet its burden of proof and that good cause does not exist 20    to allow the grant or establishment of the additional 21    franchise or relocation of the existing franchise.22        The determination whether good cause exists for 23    allowing the grant or establishment of an additional 24    franchise or relocated existing franchise, shall be made 25    by the Board under subsection (c) of Section 12 of this 26    Act. If the manufacturer seeks to enter into a contract,   SB1939- 30 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    agreement or other arrangement with any person, 2    establishing any additional motor vehicle dealership or 3    other facility, limited to the sale of factory repurchase 4    vehicles or late model vehicles, then the manufacturer 5    shall follow the notice procedures set forth in this 6    Section and the determination whether good cause exists 7    for allowing the proposed agreement shall be made by the 8    Board under subsection (c) of Section 12, with the 9    manufacturer having the burden of proof.10            A. (Blank).11            B. For the purposes of this Section, appointment 12        of a successor motor vehicle dealer at the same 13        location as its predecessor, or within 2 miles of such 14        location, or the relocation of an existing dealer or 15        franchise within 2 miles of the relocating dealer's or 16        franchisee's existing location, shall not be construed 17        as a grant, establishment or the entering into of an 18        additional franchise or selling agreement, or a 19        relocation of an existing franchise. The reopening of 20        a motor vehicle dealership that has not been in 21        operation for 18 months or more shall be deemed the 22        grant of an additional franchise or selling agreement.23            C. This Section does not apply to the relocation 24        of an existing dealership or franchise in a county 25        having a population of more than 300,000 persons when 26        the new location is within the dealer's current   SB1939- 31 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        relevant market area, provided the new location is 2        more than 7 miles from the nearest dealer of the same 3        line make. This Section does not apply to the 4        relocation of an existing dealership or franchise in a 5        county having a population of less than 300,000 6        persons when the new location is within the dealer's 7        current relevant market area, provided the new 8        location is more than 12 miles from the nearest dealer 9        of the same line make. A dealer that would be farther 10        away from the new location of an existing dealership 11        or franchise of the same line make after a relocation 12        may not file a written protest against the relocation 13        with the Motor Vehicle Review Board.14            D. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to 15        prevent a franchiser from implementing affirmative 16        action programs providing business opportunities for 17        minorities or from complying with applicable federal, 18        State or local law;19        (9) to require a motor vehicle dealer to assent to a 20    release, assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which 21    would relieve any person from liability imposed by this 22    Act;23        (10) to prevent or refuse to give effect to the 24    succession to the ownership or management control of a 25    dealership by any legatee under the will of a dealer or to 26    an heir under the laws of descent and distribution of this   SB1939- 32 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    State unless the franchisee has designated a successor to 2    the ownership or management control under the succession 3    provisions of the franchise. Unless the franchiser, having 4    the burden of proof, proves that the successor is a person 5    who is not of good moral character or does not meet the 6    franchiser's existing and reasonable capital standards 7    and, with consideration given to the volume of sales and 8    service of the dealership, uniformly applied minimum 9    business experience standards in the market area, any 10    designated successor of a dealer or franchisee may succeed 11    to the ownership or management control of a dealership 12    under the existing franchise if:13                (i) The designated successor gives the 14            franchiser written notice by certified mail, 15            return receipt requested, of his or her intention 16            to succeed to the ownership of the dealer within 17            60 days of the dealer's death or incapacity; and18                (ii) The designated successor agrees to be 19            bound by all the terms and conditions of the 20            existing franchise.21        Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the motor 22    vehicle dealer or franchisee and manufacturer have duly 23    executed an agreement concerning succession rights prior 24    to the dealer's death or incapacitation, the agreement 25    shall be observed.26            (A) If the franchiser intends to refuse to honor   SB1939- 33 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        the successor to the ownership of a deceased or 2        incapacitated dealer or franchisee under an existing 3        franchise agreement, the franchiser shall send a 4        letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, to 5        the designated successor within 60 days from receipt 6        of a proposal advising of its intent to refuse to honor 7        the succession and to discontinue the existing 8        franchise agreement and shall state that the 9        designated successor only has 30 days from the receipt 10        of the notice to file with the Motor Vehicle Review 11        Board a written protest against the proposed action. 12        The notice shall set forth the specific grounds for 13        the refusal to honor the succession and discontinue 14        the existing franchise agreement.15            If notice of refusal is not timely served upon the 16        designated successor, the franchise agreement shall 17        continue in effect subject to termination only as 18        otherwise permitted by paragraph (6) of subsection (d) 19        of Section 4 of this Act.20            Within 30 days from the date the notice was 21        received by the designated successor or any other 22        person entitled to notice, the designee or other 23        person may file with the Board a written protest 24        against the proposed action.25            When a protest has been timely filed, the Board 26        shall enter an order, fixing a date (within 60 days of   SB1939- 34 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        the date of the order), time, and place of a hearing on 2        the protest, required under Sections 12 and 29 of this 3        Act, and send by certified mail, return receipt 4        requested, a copy of the order to the franchiser that 5        filed the notice of intention of the proposed action 6        and to the protesting designee or such other person.7            The manufacturer shall have the burden of proof to 8        establish that good cause exists to refuse to honor 9        the succession and discontinue the existing franchise 10        agreement. The determination whether good cause exists 11        to refuse to honor the succession shall be made by the 12        Board under subdivision (B) of this paragraph (10). 13        The manufacturer shall not refuse to honor the 14        succession or discontinue the existing franchise 15        agreement before the hearing process is concluded as 16        prescribed by this Act, and thereafter if the Board 17        determines that it has failed to meet its burden of 18        proof and that good cause does not exist to refuse to 19        honor the succession and discontinue the existing 20        franchise agreement.21            (B) No manufacturer shall impose any conditions 22        upon honoring the succession and continuing the 23        existing franchise agreement with the designated 24        successor other than that the franchisee has 25        designated a successor to the ownership or management 26        control under the succession provisions of the   SB1939- 35 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        franchise, or that the designated successor is of good 2        moral character or meets the reasonable capital 3        standards and, with consideration given to the volume 4        of sales and service of the dealership, uniformly 5        applied minimum business experience standards in the 6        market area;7        (11) to prevent or refuse to approve a proposal to 8    establish a successor franchise at a location previously 9    approved by the franchiser when submitted with the 10    voluntary termination by the existing franchisee unless 11    the successor franchisee would not otherwise qualify for a 12    new motor vehicle dealer's license under the Illinois 13    Vehicle Code or unless the franchiser, having the burden 14    of proof, proves that such proposed successor is not of 15    good moral character or does not meet the franchiser's 16    existing and reasonable capital standards and, with 17    consideration given to the volume of sales and service of 18    the dealership, uniformly applied minimum business 19    experience standards in the market area. However, when 20    such a rejection of a proposal is made, the manufacturer 21    shall give written notice of its reasons to the franchisee 22    within 60 days of receipt by the manufacturer of the 23    proposal. However, nothing herein shall be construed to 24    prevent a franchiser from implementing affirmative action 25    programs providing business opportunities for minorities, 26    or from complying with applicable federal, State or local   SB1939- 36 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    law;2        (12) to prevent or refuse to grant a franchise to a 3    person because such person owns, has investment in or 4    participates in the management of or holds a franchise for 5    the sale of another make or line of motor vehicles within 7 6    miles of the proposed franchise location in a county 7    having a population of more than 300,000 persons, or 8    within 12 miles of the proposed franchise location in a 9    county having a population of less than 300,000 persons;10        (13) to prevent or attempt to prevent any new motor 11    vehicle dealer from establishing any additional motor 12    vehicle dealership or other facility limited to the sale 13    of factory repurchase vehicles or late model vehicles or 14    otherwise offering for sale factory repurchase vehicles of 15    the same line make at an existing franchise by failing to 16    make available any contract, agreement or other 17    arrangement which is made available or otherwise offered 18    to any person; or19        (14) to exercise a right of first refusal or other 20    right to acquire a franchise from a dealer, unless the 21    manufacturer: (i) notifies the dealer in writing that it 22    intends to exercise a right of first refusal no later than 23    60 days after the manufacturer receives a notice of the 24    proposed transfer from the dealer; and (ii) having the 25    burden of proof, proves that the dealer's proposed 26    transferee is a person who is not of good moral character   SB1939- 37 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    or does not meet the manufacturer's existing and 2    reasonable capital standards, and with consideration given 3    to the volume of sales and service of the dealership, 4    uniformly applied minimum business experience standards in 5    the market area.6        Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to 7    prevent a manufacturer from exercising the right of first 8    refusal for the purpose of implementing an affirmative 9    action program or providing business opportunities for 10    minorities, or from complying with applicable federal, 11    State or local law, provided: (i) the manufacturer has a 12    formal written program for increasing minority 13    representation in its dealer network; (ii) the right of 14    first refusal ensures that a minority dealer will acquire 15    at least 51% ownership and control of the dealership's 16    assets after the transfer; and (iii) the manufacturer 17    fulfills this obligation in good faith and does not 18    subsequently rescind, assign, or abandon the affirmative 19    action-based transfer.20        If a manufacturer satisfies the requirements of this 21    paragraph and exercises a right of first refusal, the 22    manufacturer shall:23            (A) notify notifies the dealer in writing that it 24        intends to exercise its right to acquire the franchise 25        not later than 60 days after the manufacturer's or 26        distributor's receipt of a notice of the proposed   SB1939- 38 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1        transfer from the dealer and all information and 2        documents reasonably and customarily required by the 3        manufacturer or distributor supporting the proposed 4        transfer;5            (B) pay pays to the dealer the same or greater 6        consideration as the dealer has contracted to receive 7        in connection with the proposed transfer or sale of 8        all or substantially all of the dealership assets, 9        stock, or other ownership interest, including the 10        purchase or lease of all real property, leasehold, or 11        improvements related to the transfer or sale of the 12        dealership.

(ii) the last day that 20a former franchisee is authorized to remain in business as a 21franchised dealer with respect to a particular franchise under 22a termination agreement or deferred termination agreement with 23a predecessor or successor manufacturer; (iii) the last day 24that a former franchisee that was cancelled, terminated, 25nonrenewed, noncontinued, rejected, nonassumed, or otherwise 26ended by a predecessor or successor manufacturer is authorized   SB1939- 47 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1to remain in business as a franchised dealer with respect to a 2particular franchise; or (iv) November 25, 2009 (the effective 3date of Public Act 96-824), whichever is latest, it shall be 4unlawful for such successor manufacturer to enter into a same 5line make franchise with any person or to permit the 6relocation of any existing same line make franchise, for a 7line make of the predecessor manufacturer that would be 8located or relocated within the relevant market area of a 9former franchisee who owned or leased a dealership facility in 10that relevant market area without first offering the 11additional or relocated franchise to the former franchisee, or 12the designated successor of such former franchisee in the 13event the former franchisee is deceased or a person with a 14disability, at no cost and without any requirements or 15restrictions other than those imposed generally on the 16manufacturer's other franchisees at that time, unless one of 17the following applies: 18        (1) As a result of the former franchisee's 19    cancellation, termination, noncontinuance, or nonrenewal 20    of the franchise, the predecessor manufacturer had 21    consolidated the line make with another of its line makes 22    for which the predecessor manufacturer had a franchisee 23    with a then-existing dealership facility located within 24    that relevant market area.25        (2) The successor manufacturer has paid the former 26    franchisee, or the designated successor of such former   SB1939- 48 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    franchisee in the event the former franchisee is deceased 2    or a person with a disability, the fair market value of the 3    former franchisee's franchise on (i) the date the 4    franchiser announces the action which results in the 5    termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal; or (ii) the date 6    the action which results in termination, cancellation, or 7    nonrenewal first became general knowledge; or (iii) the 8    day 12 months prior to the date on which the notice of 9    termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal is issued, 10    whichever amount is higher. Payment is due within 90 days 11    of the effective date of the termination, cancellation, or 12    nonrenewal. If the termination, cancellation, or 13    nonrenewal is due to a manufacturer's change in 14    distributors, the manufacturer may avoid paying fair 15    market value to the dealer if the new distributor or the 16    manufacturer offers the dealer a franchise agreement with 17    terms acceptable to the dealer.18        (3) The successor manufacturer proves that it would 19    have had good cause to terminate the franchise agreement 20    of the former franchisee, or the successor of the former 21    franchisee under item (e)(10) in the event that the former 22    franchisee is deceased or a person with a disability. The 23    determination of whether the successor manufacturer would 24    have had good cause to terminate the franchise agreement 25    of the former franchisee, or the successor of the former 26    franchisee, shall be made by the Board under subsection   SB1939- 49 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    (d) of Section 12. A successor manufacturer that seeks to 2    assert that it would have had good cause to terminate a 3    former franchisee, or the successor of the former 4    franchisee, must file a petition seeking a hearing on this 5    issue before the Board and shall have the burden of 6    proving that it would have had good cause to terminate the 7    former franchisee or the successor of the former 8    franchisee. No successor dealer, other than the former 9    franchisee, may be appointed or franchised by the 10    successor manufacturer within the relevant market area of 11    the former franchisee until the Board has held a hearing 12    and rendered a determination on the issue of whether the 13    successor manufacturer would have had good cause to 14    terminate the former franchisee. 15    In the event that a successor manufacturer attempts to 16enter into a same line make franchise with any person or to 17permit the relocation of any existing line make franchise 18under this subsection (h) at a location that is within the 19relevant market area of 2 or more former franchisees, then the 20successor manufacturer may not offer it to any person other 21than one of those former franchisees unless the successor 22manufacturer can prove that at least one of the 3 exceptions in 23items (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection (h) applies to each 24of those former franchisees. 25    (i) It shall be deemed a violation of this Section for any 26manufacturer with an established franchise dealer network in   SB1939- 50 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1this State, either directly or indirectly, through any parent, 2subsidiary, affiliate, or agent of the manufacturer, any 3person under common ownership or control, or common entity, to 4engage in the sale, lease, or servicing of new motor vehicles 5in a manner that bypasses or competes with the manufacturer's 6existing franchisee network, including, but not limited to:7        (1) engaging in practices intended to circumvent, 8    evade, or undermine the rights, obligations, or 9    protections afforded to franchisees under this Act; or10        (2) establishing or using newly branded entities, 11    spin-offs, or affiliated or subsidiary entities to conduct 12    retail operations outside the franchise system.13    (j) A manufacturer or distributor shall not engage in the 14sale of new motor vehicles directly to the general public in 15this State unless the manufacturer or distributor was lawfully 16licensed to sell new motor vehicles directly to consumers in 17this State before January 1, 2022.18(Source: P.A. 102-433, eff. 1-1-22.) 19    (815 ILCS 710/6)  (from Ch. 121 1/2, par. 756)20    Sec. 6. Warranty agreements; claims; approval; payment; 21written disapproval.22    (a) Every manufacturer, distributor, wholesaler, 23distributor branch or division, factory branch or division, or 24wholesale branch or division shall properly fulfill any 25warranty agreement and adequately and fairly compensate each   SB1939- 51 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1of its motor vehicle dealers for labor and parts.2    (b) Adequate and fair compensation requires the 3manufacturer to pay each dealer no less than the amount the 4retail customer pays for the same services with regard to rate 5and time.6    Any time guide previously agreed to by the manufacturer 7and the dealer for extended warranty repairs may be used in 8lieu of actual time expended. In the event that a time guide 9has not been agreed to for warranty repairs, or said time guide 10does not define time for an applicable warranty repair, the 11manufacturer's time guide shall be used, multiplied by 1.5. 12    In no event shall such compensation fail to include full 13compensation for diagnostic work, as well as repair service, 14labor, and parts. Time allowances for the diagnosis and 15performance of warranty work and service shall be no less than 16charged to retail customers for the same work to be performed.17    No warranty or factory compensated repairs shall be 18excluded from this requirement, including recalls or other 19voluntary stop-sell repairs required by the manufacturer. If a 20manufacturer is required to issue a recall, the dealer will be 21compensated for labor time as above stated.22    Furthermore, manufacturers shall pay the dealer the same 23effective labor rate (using the 100 sequential repair orders 24chosen and submitted by the dealer less simple maintenance 25repair orders) that the dealer receives for customer-pay 26repairs. This requirement includes vehicle diagnostic times   SB1939- 52 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1for all warranty repairs. Additionally, if a technician is 2required to communicate with a Technical Assistance 3Center/Engineering/or some external manufacturer source in 4order to provide a warranty repair, the manufacturer shall pay 5for the time from start of communications (including hold 6time) until the communication is complete.7    The dealer may submit a request to the manufacturer for 8warranty labor rate increases a maximum of once per calendar 9year; provided that if the manufacturer denies any request for 10warranty labor rate increase the dealer may resubmit a new 11request in the same calendar year.12    A claim made by a franchised motor vehicle dealer for 13compensation under this Section shall be either approved or 14disapproved within 30 days after the claim is submitted to the 15manufacturer in the manner and on the forms the manufacturer 16reasonably prescribes. An approved claim shall be paid within 1730 days after its approval. If a claim is not specifically 18disapproved in writing or by electronic transmission within 30 19days after the date on which the manufacturer receives it, the 20claim shall be considered to be approved and payment shall 21follow within 30 days. 22    In no event shall compensation to a motor vehicle dealer 23for labor times and labor rates be less than the rates charged 24by such dealer for like service to retail customers for 25nonwarranty service and repairs. Additionally, the 26manufacturer shall reimburse the dealer for any parts provided   SB1939- 53 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1in satisfaction of a warranty at the prevailing retail price 2charged by that dealer for the same parts when not provided in 3satisfaction of a warranty; provided that such dealer's 4prevailing retail price is not unreasonable when compared with 5that of the holders of motor vehicle franchises from the same 6manufacturer for identical parts in the geographic area in 7which the dealer is engaged in business.8    There shall be no reduction in payments due to 9preestablished market norms or market averages. Manufacturers 10are prohibited from establishing restrictions or limitations 11of customer repair frequency due to failure rate indexes or 12national failure averages.13    No debit reduction or charge back of any item on a warranty 14repair order may be made absent a finding of fraud or illegal 15actions by the dealer.16    A warranty claim timely made shall not be deemed invalid 17solely because unavailable parts cause additional use and 18mileage on the vehicle.19    If a manufacturer imposes a recall or stop sale on any new 20vehicle in a dealer's inventory that prevents the sale of the 21vehicle, the manufacturer shall compensate the dealer for any 22interest and storage until the vehicle is repaired and made 23ready for sale.24    Manufacturers are not permitted to impose any form of cost 25recovery fees or surcharges against a franchised auto 26dealership for payments made in accordance with this Section.   SB1939- 54 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1    All claims, either original or resubmitted, made by motor 2vehicle dealers hereunder and under Section 5 for such labor 3and parts shall be either approved or disapproved within 30 4days following their submission. All approved claims shall be 5paid within 30 days following their approval. The motor 6vehicle dealer who submits a claim which is disapproved shall 7be notified in writing of the disapproval within the same 8period, and each such notice shall state the specific grounds 9upon which the disapproval is based. The motor vehicle dealer 10shall be permitted to correct and resubmit such disapproved 11claims within 30 days of receipt of disapproval. Any claims 12not specifically disapproved in writing within 30 days from 13their submission shall be deemed approved and payment shall 14follow within 30 days. The manufacturer or franchiser shall 15have the right to require reasonable documentation for claims 16and to audit such claims within a one year period from the date 17the claim was paid or credit issued by the manufacturer or 18franchiser, and to charge back any false or unsubstantiated 19claims. The audit and charge back provisions of this Section 20also apply to all other incentive and reimbursement programs 21for a period of one year after the date the claim was paid or 22credit issued by the manufacturer or franchiser. However, the 23manufacturer retains the right to charge back any fraudulent 24claim if the manufacturer establishes in a court of competent 25jurisdiction in this State that the claim is fraudulent.26    (c) The motor vehicle franchiser shall not, by agreement,   SB1939- 55 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1by restrictions upon reimbursement, or otherwise, restrict the 2nature and extent of services to be rendered or parts to be 3provided so that such restriction prevents the motor vehicle 4franchisee from satisfying the warranty by rendering services 5in a good and workmanlike manner and providing parts which are 6required in accordance with generally accepted standards. Any 7such restriction shall constitute a prohibited practice.8    (d) For the purposes of this Section, the "prevailing 9retail price charged by that dealer for the same parts" means 10the price paid by the motor vehicle franchisee for parts, 11including all shipping and other charges, multiplied by the 12sum of 1.0 and the franchisee's average percentage markup over 13the price paid by the motor vehicle franchisee for parts 14purchased by the motor vehicle franchisee from the motor 15vehicle franchiser and sold at retail. The motor vehicle 16franchisee may establish average percentage markup under this 17Section by submitting to the motor vehicle franchiser 100 18sequential customer paid service repair orders or 90 days of 19customer paid service repair orders, whichever is less, 20covering repairs made no more than 180 days before the 21submission, and declaring what the average percentage markup 22is. The average percentage markup so declared shall go into 23effect 30 days following the declaration, subject to audit of 24the submitted repair orders by the motor vehicle franchiser 25and adjustment of the average percentage markup based on that 26audit. Any audit must be conducted within 30 days following   SB1939- 56 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1the declaration. Only retail sales not involving warranty 2repairs, parts covered by subsection (e) of this Section, or 3parts supplied for routine vehicle maintenance, shall be 4considered in calculating average percentage markup. For the 5purpose of this subsection, "routine maintenance" includes, 6but is not limited to: (i) the replacement of oil or other 7fluids, filters, batteries for internal combustion engine 8vehicles, bulbs, brake pads, rotors, nuts, bolts, or 9fasteners; (ii) the replacement of or work on tires or wheels, 10including wheel alignments and tire and wheel rotations; and 11(iii) the installation of an accessory. No motor vehicle 12franchiser shall require a motor vehicle franchisee to 13establish average percentage markup by a methodology, or by 14requiring information, that is unduly burdensome or time 15consuming to provide, including, but not limited to, part by 16part or transaction by transaction calculations. A motor 17vehicle franchisee shall not request a change in the average 18percentage markup more than twice in one calendar year; 19provided that, for any request that is not approved, a dealer 20may resubmit an additional request for a change in the average 21percentage markup.22    (e) If a motor vehicle franchiser supplies a part or parts 23for use in a repair rendered under a warranty other than by 24sale of that part or parts to the motor vehicle franchisee, the 25motor vehicle franchisee shall be entitled to compensation 26equivalent to the motor vehicle franchisee's average   SB1939- 57 -LRB104 12083 SPS 22180 b1percentage markup on the part or parts, as if the part or parts 2had been sold to the motor vehicle franchisee by the motor 3vehicle franchiser. The requirements of this subsection (e) 4shall not apply to entire engine assemblies, propulsion engine 5assemblies, including electric vehicle batteries, and entire 6transmission assemblies. In the case of those assemblies, the 7motor vehicle franchiser shall reimburse the motor vehicle 8franchisee up to and including 30% of what the motor vehicle 9franchisee would have paid the motor vehicle franchiser for 10the assembly if the assembly had not been supplied by the 11franchiser other than by the sale of that assembly to the motor 12vehicle franchisee. 13    (f) The obligations imposed on motor vehicle franchisers 14by this Section shall apply to any parent, subsidiary, 15affiliate, or agent of the motor vehicle franchiser, any 16person under common ownership or control, any employee of the 17motor vehicle franchiser, and any person holding 1% or more of 18the shares of any class of securities or other ownership 19interest in the motor vehicle franchiser, if a warranty or 20service or repair plan is issued by that person instead of or 21in addition to one issued by the motor vehicle franchiser.22    (g) (Blank).23(Source: P.A. 102-232, eff. 1-1-22; 102-669, eff. 11-16-21.)
