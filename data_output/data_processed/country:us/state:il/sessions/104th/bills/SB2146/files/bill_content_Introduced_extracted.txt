Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Advancing Federally Regulated Illinois Transmission Projects 6Act. 7    Section 5. Legislative findings. The General Assembly 8finds that federally regulated interconnection procedures 9delay and impair infrastructure necessary for the resilience, 10reliability, and clean energy transition envisioned in Public 11Act 102-662 (the "Climate and Equitable Jobs Act") and other 12Acts. The General Assembly further finds that the State's 13leading role in quantum computing, data centers, battery 14manufacturing, and other new economic initiatives requires 15resilient and reliable electric systems. The General Assembly 16further finds that the Department is uniquely situated to 17reduce those delays and impairments for specific electricity 18transmission infrastructure located partially or wholly within 19the Illinois footprint of PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. by 20initiating and managing on behalf of the State the State 21Agreement Approach for transmission expansion that addresses 22Illinois public policy requirements.

Such cost allocation proposed by the Department 13to PJM for acceptance by FERC shall provide that all costs 14related to the Project shall be recovered from customers 15located in the State of Illinois and may not include customers 16in any other state unless such other state voluntarily agrees 17to be responsible for such cost allocation. The Department 18shall coordinate with the Project as necessary. 19    Section 25. Department filings.
