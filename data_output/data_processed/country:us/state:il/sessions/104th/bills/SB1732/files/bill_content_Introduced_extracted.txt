Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Journalism Preservation Act. 6    Section 5. Findings.7    (a) A free and diverse fourth estate was critical in the 8founding of our democracy and continues to be the lifeblood 9for a functioning democracy.10    (b) Every day, journalism plays an essential role in 11Illinois and in local communities, and the ability of local 12news organizations to continue to provide the public with 13critical information about their communities and enabling 14publishers to receive fair market value for their content that 15is used by others will preserve and ensure the sustainability 16of local and diverse news outlets.17    (c) Communities without newspapers lose touch with 18government, business, education, and neighbors. They operate 19without journalists working to keep them informed, uncover 20truth, expose corruption, and share common goals and 21experiences.22    (d) Over the past 10 years, newspaper advertising has 23decreased 66%, and newsroom staff has declined 44%.  SB1732- 2 -LRB104 09901 SPS 19971 b1    (e) Ethnic media has long been a distinctive genre of 2journalism and communications, informing, engaging, and 3advocating on behalf of communities underserved by both the 4for-profit and not-for-profit general media market. It plays a 5unique role in upholding the fourth estate in our democracy by 6facilitating cross-racial and cross-ethnic communications to 7facilitate social integration, promote civic engagement, and 8address inequalities among all of the underserved communities.9    (f) Given the important role of ethnic media, it is 10critical to advance State policy that ensures their publishers 11are justly compensated for the content they create and 12distribute. An example is the historic preamble, "We Wish to 13Plead Our Own Cause," a document penned by the 14African-American journalist and abolitionist Samuel Cornish in 151827. It marked a significant milestone in the history of the 16Black press as it highlighted the urgent need for African 17Americans to have their own platform to voice their 18grievances, advocate for their rights, and challenge racial 19inequality. This call to action spurred the establishment of 20numerous Black-owned newspapers and publications, solidifying 21the role of the Black press as a powerful tool for empowerment 22and social change, and laid the groundwork in our country for 23other ethnic media to plead their own cause.24    (g) Quality local journalism is key to sustaining civic 25society, strengthening communal ties, and providing 26information at a deeper level that national outlets cannot   SB1732- 3 -LRB104 09901 SPS 19971 b1match.2    (h) When surveyed, 73% of adults in the United States say 3they have confidence in their local newspaper. 4    Section 10.

Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Journalism Preservation Act. 6    Section 5. Findings.7    (a) A free and diverse fourth estate was critical in the 8founding of our democracy and continues to be the lifeblood 9for a functioning democracy.10    (b) Every day, journalism plays an essential role in 11Illinois and in local communities, and the ability of local 12news organizations to continue to provide the public with 13critical information about their communities and enabling 14publishers to receive fair market value for their content that 15is used by others will preserve and ensure the sustainability 16of local and diverse news outlets.17    (c) Communities without newspapers lose touch with 18government, business, education, and neighbors. They operate 19without journalists working to keep them informed, uncover 20truth, expose corruption, and share common goals and 21experiences.22    (d) Over the past 10 years, newspaper advertising has 23decreased 66%, and newsroom staff has declined 44%.  SB1732- 2 -LRB104 09901 SPS 19971 b1    (e) Ethnic media has long been a distinctive genre of 2journalism and communications, informing, engaging, and 3advocating on behalf of communities underserved by both the 4for-profit and not-for-profit general media market. It plays a 5unique role in upholding the fourth estate in our democracy by 6facilitating cross-racial and cross-ethnic communications to 7facilitate social integration, promote civic engagement, and 8address inequalities among all of the underserved communities.9    (f) Given the important role of ethnic media, it is 10critical to advance State policy that ensures their publishers 11are justly compensated for the content they create and 12distribute. An example is the historic preamble, "We Wish to 13Plead Our Own Cause," a document penned by the 14African-American journalist and abolitionist Samuel Cornish in 151827. It marked a significant milestone in the history of the 16Black press as it highlighted the urgent need for African 17Americans to have their own platform to voice their 18grievances, advocate for their rights, and challenge racial 19inequality. This call to action spurred the establishment of 20numerous Black-owned newspapers and publications, solidifying 21the role of the Black press as a powerful tool for empowerment 22and social change, and laid the groundwork in our country for 23other ethnic media to plead their own cause.24    (g) Quality local journalism is key to sustaining civic 25society, strengthening communal ties, and providing 26information at a deeper level that national outlets cannot   SB1732- 3 -LRB104 09901 SPS 19971 b1match.2    (h) When surveyed, 73% of adults in the United States say 3they have confidence in their local newspaper. 4    Section 10.
