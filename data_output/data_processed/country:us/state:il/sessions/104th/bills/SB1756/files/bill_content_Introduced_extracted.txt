The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law 21in each Member State, provided however that where the Rules of 22the Commission conflict with the laws of the Member State that 23establish the Member State's scope of practice as held by a 24court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission   SB1756- 32 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the 2conflict.3    C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers 4pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the 5Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding as of the 6date specified by the Commission for each Rule.7    D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States 8rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute 9or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact 10within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then 11such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Member 12State or to any State applying to participate in the Compact.13    E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting 14of the Commission.15    F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission 16shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral 17and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.18    G.

Rules may be grouped for the 25convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this 26article.  SB1756- 34 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all 2Commissioners, take final action on the proposed Rule based on 3the Rulemaking record.4        1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed 5    Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original 6    purpose of the proposed Rule.7        2.

Public 10notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the 11Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any 12person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The 13revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision 14results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be 15made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to the 16end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision 17will take effect without further action. If the revision is 18challenged, the revision may not take effect without the 19approval of the Commission.20    N. No Member State's rulemaking requirements shall apply 21under this Compact. 22    ARTICLE 11-OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT 23    A. Oversight24        1.

Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or 5    against the Commission shall be brought solely and 6    exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the 7    principal office of the Commission is located.

Nothing herein 11    shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue 12    in any action against a Licensee for professional 13    malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.14        3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 15    of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 16    interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to 17    intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure 18    to provide the Commission service of process shall render 19    a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this 20    Compact, or promulgated Rules.21    B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination22        1. If the Commission determines that a Member State 23    has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 24    responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated 25    Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the 26    defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the   SB1756- 37 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any 2    other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer 3    training and specific technical assistance regarding the 4    default.5        2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice 6    of default to the other Member States.7    C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the 8defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an 9affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member 10States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on 11that State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective 12date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 13offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during 14the period of default.15    D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be 16imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have 17been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall 18be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and 19minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the 20defaulting State's State Licensing Authority and each of the 21Member States' State Licensing Authority.22    E.

The terminated State shall continue to 4recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a 5minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of said 6notice of termination.7    G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a 8State that is found to be in default or that has been 9terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing 10between the Commission and the defaulting State.11    H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the 12Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the 13District of Columbia or the federal district where the 14Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party 15shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 16reasonable attorney's fees.17    I. Dispute Resolution18        1.

By majority vote as provided by Commission Rule, 4    the Commission may initiate legal action against a Member 5    State in default in the United States District Court for 6    the District of Columbia or the federal district where the 7    Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance 8    with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated 9    Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive 10    relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is 11    necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs 12    of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. 13    The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of 14    the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other 15    remedies available under federal or the defaulting Member 16    State's law.17        3. A Member State may initiate legal action against 18    the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District 19    of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission 20    has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the 21    provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The 22    relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 23    damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 24    the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 25    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.26        4. No individual or entity other than a Member State   SB1756- 40 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    may enforce this Compact against the Commission. 2    ARTICLE 12-EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT 3    A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which 4the Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member 5State.6        1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the 7    Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each 8    of the Charter Member States to determine if the statute 9    enacted by each such Charter Member State is materially 10    different than the model Compact statute.11            a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found 12        to be materially different from the model Compact 13        statute shall be entitled to the default process set 14        forth in Article 11.15            b. If any Member State is later found to be in 16        default, or is terminated or withdraws from the 17        Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and 18        the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number 19        of Member States should be less than seven (7).20        2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to 21    the Charter Member States shall be subject to the process 22    set forth in Article 8.C.23 to determine if their 23    enactments are materially different from the model Compact 24    statute and whether they qualify for participation in the   SB1756- 41 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    Compact.2        3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission 3    or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of 4    the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or 5    the Commission coming into existence shall be considered 6    to be actions of the Commission unless specifically 7    repudiated by the Commission.8        4. Any State that joins the Compact shall be subject 9    to the Commission's Rules and bylaws as they exist on the 10    date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any 11    Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission 12    shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the 13    Compact becomes law in that State.14    B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by 15enacting a statute repealing that State's enactment of the 16Compact.17        1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect 18    until one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the 19    repealing statute.20        2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing 21    requirement of the withdrawing State's Licensing Authority 22    to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action 23    reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the 24    effective date of withdrawal.25        3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from 26    this Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of   SB1756- 42 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State. 2    Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the 3    contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to 4    recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact 5    for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of 6    withdrawal.7    C.

This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No 13amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding 14upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all 15Member States. 16    ARTICLE 13-CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY 17    A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority 18shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, 19and the implementation and administration of the Compact. 20Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring 21the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the 22Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.23    B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and 24if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact   SB1756- 43 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to 2the constitution of any Member State, a State seeking 3participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the 4applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or 5circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 6competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this 7Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 8agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.9    C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this article, the 10Commission may deny a State's participation in the Compact or, 11in accordance with the requirements of Article 11.B, terminate 12a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it 13determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State 14is a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this 15Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any 16Member State, the Compact shall remain in full force and 17effect as to the remaining Member States and in full force and 18effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable 19matters. 20    ARTICLE 14-CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE 21LAWS 22    Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of 23any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with 24the Compact.  SB1756- 44 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal 2requirements in a Member State in conflict with the Compact 3are superseded to the extent of the conflict.4    All permissible agreements between the Commission and the 5Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.

The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in 12order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer 13the purposes and provisions of the Compact. A Rule shall be 14invalid and have no force or effect only if a court of 15competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because 16the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner 17that is beyond the scope and purposes of the Compact, or the 18powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable 19standard of review.20    B. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law 21in each Member State, provided however that where the Rules of 22the Commission conflict with the laws of the Member State that 23establish the Member State's scope of practice as held by a 24court of competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission   SB1756- 32 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1shall be ineffective in that State to the extent of the 2conflict.3    C. The Commission shall exercise its Rulemaking powers 4pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the 5Rules adopted thereunder. Rules shall become binding as of the 6date specified by the Commission for each Rule.7    D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Member States 8rejects a Rule or portion of a Rule, by enactment of a statute 9or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the Compact 10within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then 11such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any Member 12State or to any State applying to participate in the Compact.13    E. Rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting 14of the Commission.15    F. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission 16shall hold a public hearing and allow persons to provide oral 17and written comments, data, facts, opinions, and arguments.18    G.

Nothing in this article shall be construed as requiring 24a separate hearing on each Rule. Rules may be grouped for the 25convenience of the Commission at hearings required by this 26article.  SB1756- 34 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all 2Commissioners, take final action on the proposed Rule based on 3the Rulemaking record.4        1. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed 5    Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original 6    purpose of the proposed Rule.7        2. The Commission shall provide an explanation of the 8    reasons for substantive changes made to the proposed Rule 9    as well as reasons for substantive changes not made that 10    were recommended by commenters.11        3. The Commission shall determine a reasonable 12    effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as 13    provided in subsection L, the effective date of the Rule 14    shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days after the 15    Commission issuing the notice that it adopted or amended 16    the Rule.17    L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 18Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 24 19hours notice, provided that the usual Rulemaking procedures 20provided in the Compact and in this article shall be 21retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably 22possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the 23effective date of the Rule.

Public 10notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the 11Commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any 12person for a period of thirty (30) days after posting. The 13revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision 14results in a material change to a Rule. A challenge shall be 15made in writing and delivered to the Commission prior to the 16end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision 17will take effect without further action. If the revision is 18challenged, the revision may not take effect without the 19approval of the Commission.20    N. No Member State's rulemaking requirements shall apply 21under this Compact. 22    ARTICLE 11-OVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT 23    A. Oversight24        1. The executive and judicial branches of State   SB1756- 36 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    government in each Member State shall enforce this Compact 2    and take all actions necessary and appropriate to 3    implement the Compact.4        2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or 5    against the Commission shall be brought solely and 6    exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the 7    principal office of the Commission is located. The 8    Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to 9    the extent it adopts or consents to participate in 10    alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein 11    shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue 12    in any action against a Licensee for professional 13    malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.14        3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 15    of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 16    interpretation of the Compact and shall have standing to 17    intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes. Failure 18    to provide the Commission service of process shall render 19    a judgment or order void as to the Commission, this 20    Compact, or promulgated Rules.21    B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination22        1. If the Commission determines that a Member State 23    has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 24    responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated 25    Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the 26    defaulting State. The notice of default shall describe the   SB1756- 37 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any 2    other action that the Commission may take, and shall offer 3    training and specific technical assistance regarding the 4    default.5        2. The Commission shall provide a copy of the notice 6    of default to the other Member States.7    C. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the 8defaulting State may be terminated from the Compact upon an 9affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the Member 10States, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred on 11that State by this Compact may be terminated on the effective 12date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the 13offending State of obligations or liabilities incurred during 14the period of default.15    D. Termination of membership in the Compact shall be 16imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have 17been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall 18be given by the Commission to the governor, the majority and 19minority leaders of the defaulting State's legislature, the 20defaulting State's State Licensing Authority and each of the 21Member States' State Licensing Authority.22    E. A State that has been terminated is responsible for all 23assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the 24effective date of termination, including obligations that 25extend beyond the effective date of termination.26    F. Upon the termination of a State's membership from this   SB1756- 38 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1Compact, that State shall immediately provide notice to all 2Licensees who hold a Multistate License within that State of 3such termination. The terminated State shall continue to 4recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a 5minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of said 6notice of termination.7    G. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to a 8State that is found to be in default or that has been 9terminated from the Compact, unless agreed upon in writing 10between the Commission and the defaulting State.11    H. The defaulting State may appeal the action of the 12Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the 13District of Columbia or the federal district where the 14Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party 15shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 16reasonable attorney's fees.17    I. Dispute Resolution18        1. Upon request by a Member State, the Commission 19    shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact 20    that arise among Member States and between Member and 21    non-Member States.22        2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing 23    for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for 24    disputes as appropriate.25    J. Enforcement26        1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its   SB1756- 39 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact 2    and the Commission's Rules.3        2. By majority vote as provided by Commission Rule, 4    the Commission may initiate legal action against a Member 5    State in default in the United States District Court for 6    the District of Columbia or the federal district where the 7    Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance 8    with the provisions of the Compact and its promulgated 9    Rules. The relief sought may include both injunctive 10    relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is 11    necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs 12    of such litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees. 13    The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of 14    the Commission. The Commission may pursue any other 15    remedies available under federal or the defaulting Member 16    State's law.17        3. A Member State may initiate legal action against 18    the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the District 19    of Columbia or the federal district where the Commission 20    has its principal offices to enforce compliance with the 21    provisions of the Compact and its promulgated Rules. The 22    relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 23    damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 24    the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 25    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.26        4. No individual or entity other than a Member State   SB1756- 40 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    may enforce this Compact against the Commission. 2    ARTICLE 12-EFFECTIVE DATE, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENT 3    A. The Compact shall come into effect on the date on which 4the Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh Member 5State.6        1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the 7    Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each 8    of the Charter Member States to determine if the statute 9    enacted by each such Charter Member State is materially 10    different than the model Compact statute.11            a. A Charter Member State whose enactment is found 12        to be materially different from the model Compact 13        statute shall be entitled to the default process set 14        forth in Article 11.15            b. If any Member State is later found to be in 16        default, or is terminated or withdraws from the 17        Compact, the Commission shall remain in existence and 18        the Compact shall remain in effect even if the number 19        of Member States should be less than seven (7).20        2. Member States enacting the Compact subsequent to 21    the Charter Member States shall be subject to the process 22    set forth in Article 8.C.23 to determine if their 23    enactments are materially different from the model Compact 24    statute and whether they qualify for participation in the   SB1756- 41 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    Compact.2        3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission 3    or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of 4    the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or 5    the Commission coming into existence shall be considered 6    to be actions of the Commission unless specifically 7    repudiated by the Commission.8        4. Any State that joins the Compact shall be subject 9    to the Commission's Rules and bylaws as they exist on the 10    date on which the Compact becomes law in that State. Any 11    Rule that has been previously adopted by the Commission 12    shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the 13    Compact becomes law in that State.14    B. Any Member State may withdraw from this Compact by 15enacting a statute repealing that State's enactment of the 16Compact.17        1. A Member State's withdrawal shall not take effect 18    until one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment of the 19    repealing statute.20        2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing 21    requirement of the withdrawing State's Licensing Authority 22    to comply with the investigative and Adverse Action 23    reporting requirements of this Compact prior to the 24    effective date of withdrawal.25        3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing from 26    this Compact, a State shall immediately provide notice of   SB1756- 42 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    such withdrawal to all Licensees within that State. 2    Notwithstanding any subsequent statutory enactment to the 3    contrary, such withdrawing State shall continue to 4    recognize all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact 5    for a minimum of 180 days after the date of such notice of 6    withdrawal.7    C.

This Compact may be amended by the Member States. No 13amendment to this Compact shall become effective and binding 14upon any Member State until it is enacted into the laws of all 15Member States. 16    ARTICLE 13-CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY 17    A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority 18shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes, 19and the implementation and administration of the Compact. 20Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring 21the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the 22Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes.23    B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and 24if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact   SB1756- 43 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to 2the constitution of any Member State, a State seeking 3participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the 4applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or 5circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 6competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this 7Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 8agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.9    C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this article, the 10Commission may deny a State's participation in the Compact or, 11in accordance with the requirements of Article 11.B, terminate 12a Member State's participation in the Compact, if it 13determines that a constitutional requirement of a Member State 14is a material departure from the Compact. Otherwise, if this 15Compact shall be held to be contrary to the constitution of any 16Member State, the Compact shall remain in full force and 17effect as to the remaining Member States and in full force and 18effect as to the Member State affected as to all severable 19matters. 20    ARTICLE 14-CONSISTENT EFFECT AND CONFLICT WITH OTHER STATE 21LAWS 22    Nothing herein shall prevent or inhibit the enforcement of 23any other law of a Member State that is not inconsistent with 24the Compact.  SB1756- 44 -LRB104 10001 RTM 20071 b1    Any laws, statutes, regulations, or other legal 2requirements in a Member State in conflict with the Compact 3are superseded to the extent of the conflict.4    All permissible agreements between the Commission and the 5Member States are binding in accordance with their terms.
