This performance 20goal shall be used to provide additional reimbursement in the 21form of a quality performance bonus to primary care providers 22who meet that goal.23    The Department shall devise a means of case-managing or 24patient navigation for beneficiaries diagnosed with breast 25cancer. This program shall initially operate as a pilot 26program in areas of the State with the highest incidence of   SB1743- 58 -LRB104 11917 AAS 22009 b1mortality related to breast cancer. At least one pilot program 2site shall be in the metropolitan Chicago area and at least one 3site shall be outside the metropolitan Chicago area. On or 4after July 1, 2016, the pilot program shall be expanded to 5include one site in western Illinois, one site in southern 6Illinois, one site in central Illinois, and 4 sites within 7metropolitan Chicago.
