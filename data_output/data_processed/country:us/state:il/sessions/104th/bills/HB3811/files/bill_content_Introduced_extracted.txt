Reliance upon this list by a hospital shall 6satisfy compliance with this requirement. The procedure may 7also include a waiver for any case in which a discharge notice 8is not feasible due to a short length of stay in the hospital 9by the patient, or for any case in which the patient 10voluntarily desires to leave the hospital before the 11expiration of the 24 hour period.12    (c) At least 24 hours prior to discharge from the 13hospital, the patient shall receive written information on the 14patient's right to appeal the discharge pursuant to the 15federal Medicare program, including the steps to follow to 16appeal the discharge and the appropriate telephone number to 17call in case the patient intends to appeal the discharge.18    (d) Before transfer of a patient to a long term care 19facility licensed under the Nursing Home Care Act where 20elderly persons reside, a hospital shall as soon as 21practicable initiate a name-based criminal history background 22check by electronic submission to the Illinois State Police 23for all persons between the ages of 18 and 70 years; provided, 24however, that a hospital shall be required to initiate such a 25background check only with respect to patients who:26        (1) are transferring to a long term care facility for   HB3811- 10 -LRB104 10924 BAB 21006 b1    the first time;2        (2) have been in the hospital more than 5 days;3        (3) are reasonably expected to remain at the long term 4    care facility for more than 30 days;5        (4) have a known history of serious mental illness or 6    substance abuse; and7        (5) are independently ambulatory or mobile for more 8    than a temporary period of time.9    A hospital may also request a criminal history background 10check for a patient who does not meet any of the criteria set 11forth in items (1) through (5).12    A hospital shall notify a long term care facility if the 13hospital has initiated a criminal history background check on 14a patient being discharged to that facility. In all 15circumstances in which the hospital is required by this 16subsection to initiate the criminal history background check, 17the transfer to the long term care facility may proceed 18regardless of the availability of criminal history results. 19Upon receipt of the results, the hospital shall promptly 20forward the results to the appropriate long term care 21facility. If the results of the background check are 22inconclusive, the hospital shall have no additional duty or 23obligation to seek additional information from, or about, the 24patient. 25    (e) If a physician determines that an adult patient is so 26disabled as to be unable to consent to discharge or placement   HB3811- 11 -LRB104 10924 BAB 21006 b1in a facility or a physician reasonably believes an adult 2patient is a person with a disability in need of a guardian in 3accordance with the Probate Act of 1975 and there is no family, 4surrogate decision maker, agent under a power of attorney, 5trustee, or other close friend who is ready willing and able to 6assist that adult patient, then the hospital shall notify the 7Office of State Guardian and the public guardian of the county 8where the patient resides. 9(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21; 103-102, eff. 1-1-24.) 10    Section 15.
