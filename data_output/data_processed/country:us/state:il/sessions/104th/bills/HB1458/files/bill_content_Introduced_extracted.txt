Transactions whereby the possession of the 10property is transferred but the seller retains the title as 11security for payment of the selling price are sales.12    "Sale at retail" shall also be construed to include any 13Illinois florist's sales transaction in which the purchase 14order is received in Illinois by a florist and the sale is for 15use or consumption, but the Illinois florist has a florist in 16another state deliver the property to the purchaser or the 17purchaser's donee in such other state.18    Nonreusable tangible personal property that is used by 19persons engaged in the business of operating a restaurant, 20cafeteria, or drive-in is a sale for resale when it is 21transferred to customers in the ordinary course of business as 22part of the sale of food or beverages and is used to deliver, 23package, or consume food or beverages, regardless of where 24consumption of the food or beverages occurs.

Effective December 1, 1985, 12"selling price" shall include charges that are added to prices 13by sellers on account of the seller's tax liability under the 14Cigarette Tax Act, on account of the seller's duty to collect, 15from the purchaser, the tax imposed under the Cigarette Use 16Tax Act, and on account of the seller's duty to collect, from 17the purchaser, any cigarette tax imposed by a home rule unit.18    The provisions of this paragraph, which provides only for 19an alternative meaning of "selling price" with respect to the 20sale of certain motor vehicles incident to the contemporaneous 21lease of those motor vehicles, continue in effect and are not 22changed by the tax on leases implemented by Public Act 103-592 23this amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 24Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for any motor 25vehicle, as defined in Section 1-146 of the Vehicle Code, that 26is sold on or after January 1, 2015 for the purpose of leasing   HB1458- 7 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1the vehicle for a defined period that is longer than one year 2and (1) is a motor vehicle of the second division that: (A) is 3a self-contained motor vehicle designed or permanently 4converted to provide living quarters for recreational, 5camping, or travel use, with direct walk through access to the 6living quarters from the driver's seat; (B) is of the van 7configuration designed for the transportation of not less than 87 nor more than 16 passengers; or (C) has a gross vehicle 9weight rating of 8,000 pounds or less or (2) is a motor vehicle 10of the first division, "selling price" or "amount of sale" 11means the consideration received by the lessor pursuant to the 12lease contract, including amounts due at lease signing and all 13monthly or other regular payments charged over the term of the 14lease. Also included in the selling price is any amount 15received by the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle 16that is not calculated at the time the lease is executed, 17including, but not limited to, excess mileage charges and 18charges for excess wear and tear. For sales that occur in 19Illinois, with respect to any amount received by the lessor 20from the lessee for the leased vehicle that is not calculated 21at the time the lease is executed, the lessor who purchased the 22motor vehicle does not incur the tax imposed by the Use Tax Act 23on those amounts, and the retailer who makes the retail sale of 24the motor vehicle to the lessor is not required to collect the 25tax imposed by this Act or to pay the tax imposed by the 26Retailers' Occupation Tax Act on those amounts. However, the   HB1458- 8 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1lessor who purchased the motor vehicle assumes the liability 2for reporting and paying the tax on those amounts directly to 3the Department in the same form (Illinois Retailers' 4Occupation Tax, and local retailers' occupation taxes, if 5applicable) in which the retailer would have reported and paid 6such tax if the retailer had accounted for the tax to the 7Department. For amounts received by the lessor from the lessee 8that are not calculated at the time the lease is executed, the 9lessor must file the return and pay the tax to the Department 10by the due date otherwise required by this Act for returns 11other than transaction returns. If the retailer is entitled 12under this Act to a discount for collecting and remitting the 13tax imposed under this Act to the Department with respect to 14the sale of the motor vehicle to the lessor, then the right to 15the discount provided in this Act shall be transferred to the 16lessor with respect to the tax paid by the lessor for any 17amount received by the lessor from the lessee for the leased 18vehicle that is not calculated at the time the lease is 19executed; provided that the discount is only allowed if the 20return is timely filed and for amounts timely paid. The 21"selling price" of a motor vehicle that is sold on or after 22January 1, 2015 for the purpose of leasing for a defined period 23of longer than one year shall not be reduced by the value of or 24credit given for traded-in tangible personal property owned by 25the lessor, nor shall it be reduced by the value of or credit 26given for traded-in tangible personal property owned by the   HB1458- 9 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1lessee, regardless of whether the trade-in value thereof is 2assigned by the lessee to the lessor. In the case of a motor 3vehicle that is sold for the purpose of leasing for a defined 4period of longer than one year, the sale occurs at the time of 5the delivery of the vehicle, regardless of the due date of any 6lease payments. A lessor who incurs a Retailers' Occupation 7Tax liability on the sale of a motor vehicle coming off lease 8may not take a credit against that liability for the Use Tax 9the lessor paid upon the purchase of the motor vehicle (or for 10any tax the lessor paid with respect to any amount received by 11the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle that was not 12calculated at the time the lease was executed) if the selling 13price of the motor vehicle at the time of purchase was 14calculated using the definition of "selling price" as defined 15in this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 16Act to the contrary, lessors shall file all returns and make 17all payments required under this paragraph to the Department 18by electronic means in the manner and form as required by the 19Department. This paragraph does not apply to leases of motor 20vehicles for which, at the time the lease is entered into, the 21term of the lease is not a defined period, including leases 22with a defined initial period with the option to continue the 23lease on a month-to-month or other basis beyond the initial 24defined period. 25    The phrase "like kind and character" shall be liberally 26construed (including, but not limited to, any form of motor   HB1458- 10 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1vehicle for any form of motor vehicle, or any kind of farm or 2agricultural implement for any other kind of farm or 3agricultural implement), while not including a kind of item 4which, if sold at retail by that retailer, would be exempt from 5retailers' occupation tax and use tax as an isolated or 6occasional sale.7    "Department" means the Department of Revenue.8    "Person" means any natural individual, firm, partnership, 9association, joint stock company, joint adventure, public or 10private corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, 11executor, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed 12by order of any court.13    "Retailer" means and includes every person engaged in the 14business of making sales, including, on and after January 1, 152025, leases, at retail as defined in this Section. With 16respect to leases, a "retailer" also means a "lessor", except 17as otherwise provided in this Act. 18    A person who holds himself or herself out as being engaged 19(or who habitually engages) in selling tangible personal 20property at retail is a retailer hereunder with respect to 21such sales (and not primarily in a service occupation) 22notwithstanding the fact that such person designs and produces 23such tangible personal property on special order for the 24purchaser and in such a way as to render the property of value 25only to such purchaser, if such tangible personal property so 26produced on special order serves substantially the same   HB1458- 11 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1function as stock or standard items of tangible personal 2property that are sold at retail.3    A person whose activities are organized and conducted 4primarily as a not-for-profit service enterprise, and who 5engages in selling tangible personal property at retail 6(whether to the public or merely to members and their guests) 7is a retailer with respect to such transactions, excepting 8only a person organized and operated exclusively for 9charitable, religious or educational purposes either (1), to 10the extent of sales by such person to its members, students, 11patients, or inmates of tangible personal property to be used 12primarily for the purposes of such person, or (2), to the 13extent of sales by such person of tangible personal property 14which is not sold or offered for sale by persons organized for 15profit. The selling of school books and school supplies by 16schools at retail to students is not "primarily for the 17purposes of" the school which does such selling. This 18paragraph does not apply to nor subject to taxation occasional 19dinners, social, or similar activities of a person organized 20and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, or 21educational purposes, whether or not such activities are open 22to the public.23    A person who is the recipient of a grant or contract under 24Title VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (P.L. 92-258) and 25serves meals to participants in the federal Nutrition Program 26for the Elderly in return for contributions established in   HB1458- 12 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1amount by the individual participant pursuant to a schedule of 2suggested fees as provided for in the federal Act is not a 3retailer under this Act with respect to such transactions.4    Persons who engage in the business of transferring 5tangible personal property upon the redemption of trading 6stamps are retailers hereunder when engaged in such business.7    The isolated or occasional sale of tangible personal 8property at retail by a person who does not hold himself out as 9being engaged (or who does not habitually engage) in selling 10such tangible personal property at retail or a sale through a 11bulk vending machine does not make such person a retailer 12hereunder. However, any person who is engaged in a business 13which is not subject to the tax imposed by the Retailers' 14Occupation Tax Act because of involving the sale of or a 15contract to sell real estate or a construction contract to 16improve real estate, but who, in the course of conducting such 17business, transfers tangible personal property to users or 18consumers in the finished form in which it was purchased, and 19which does not become real estate, under any provision of a 20construction contract or real estate sale or real estate sales 21agreement entered into with some other person arising out of 22or because of such nontaxable business, is a retailer to the 23extent of the value of the tangible personal property so 24transferred. If, in such transaction, a separate charge is 25made for the tangible personal property so transferred, the 26value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, is the   HB1458- 13 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1amount so separately charged, but not less than the cost of 2such property to the transferor; if no separate charge is 3made, the value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, 4is the cost to the transferor of such tangible personal 5property.6    "Retailer maintaining a place of business in this State", 7or any like term, means and includes any of the following 8retailers:9        (1) A retailer having or maintaining within this 10    State, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, 11    distribution house, sales house, warehouse, or other place 12    of business, or any agent or other representative 13    operating within this State under the authority of the 14    retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such 15    place of business or agent or other representative is 16    located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such 17    retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this 18    State. However, the ownership of property that is located 19    at the premises of a printer with which the retailer has 20    contracted for printing and that consists of the final 21    printed product, property that becomes a part of the final 22    printed product, or copy from which the printed product is 23    produced shall not result in the retailer being deemed to 24    have or maintain an office, distribution house, sales 25    house, warehouse, or other place of business within this 26    State.  HB1458- 14 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1        (1.1) A retailer having a contract with a person 2    located in this State under which the person, for a 3    commission or other consideration based upon the sale of 4    tangible personal property by the retailer, directly or 5    indirectly refers potential customers to the retailer by 6    providing to the potential customers a promotional code or 7    other mechanism that allows the retailer to track 8    purchases referred by such persons. Examples of mechanisms 9    that allow the retailer to track purchases referred by 10    such persons include, but are not limited to, the use of a 11    link on the person's Internet website, promotional codes 12    distributed through the person's hand-delivered or mailed 13    material, and promotional codes distributed by the person 14    through radio or other broadcast media. The provisions of 15    this paragraph (1.1) shall apply only if the cumulative 16    gross receipts from sales of tangible personal property by 17    the retailer to customers who are referred to the retailer 18    by all persons in this State under such contracts exceed 19    $10,000 during the preceding 4 quarterly periods ending on 20    the last day of March, June, September, and December. A 21    retailer meeting the requirements of this paragraph (1.1) 22    shall be presumed to be maintaining a place of business in 23    this State but may rebut this presumption by submitting 24    proof that the referrals or other activities pursued 25    within this State by such persons were not sufficient to 26    meet the nexus standards of the United States Constitution   HB1458- 15 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1    during the preceding 4 quarterly periods.2        (1.2) Beginning July 1, 2011, a retailer having a 3    contract with a person located in this State under which:4            (A) the retailer sells the same or substantially 5        similar line of products as the person located in this 6        State and does so using an identical or substantially 7        similar name, trade name, or trademark as the person 8        located in this State; and9            (B) the retailer provides a commission or other 10        consideration to the person located in this State 11        based upon the sale of tangible personal property by 12        the retailer.13        The provisions of this paragraph (1.2) shall apply 14    only if the cumulative gross receipts from sales of 15    tangible personal property by the retailer to customers in 16    this State under all such contracts exceed $10,000 during 17    the preceding 4 quarterly periods ending on the last day 18    of March, June, September, and December.19        (2) (Blank).20        (3) (Blank).21        (4) (Blank).22        (5) (Blank).23        (6) (Blank).24        (7) (Blank).25        (8) (Blank).26        (9) Beginning October 1, 2018, a retailer making sales   HB1458- 16 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1    of tangible personal property to purchasers in Illinois 2    from outside of Illinois if: 3            (A) the cumulative gross receipts from sales of 4        tangible personal property to purchasers in Illinois 5        are $100,000 or more; or 6            (B) the retailer enters into 200 or more separate 7        transactions for the sale of tangible personal 8        property to purchasers in Illinois. 9        The retailer shall determine on a quarterly basis, 10    ending on the last day of March, June, September, and 11    December, whether he or she meets the criteria of either 12    subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph (9) for the 13    preceding 12-month period. If the retailer meets the 14    threshold of either subparagraph (A) or (B) for a 12-month 15    period, he or she is considered a retailer maintaining a 16    place of business in this State and is required to collect 17    and remit the tax imposed under this Act and file returns 18    for one year. At the end of that one-year period, the 19    retailer shall determine whether he or she met the 20    threshold of either subparagraph (A) or (B) during the 21    preceding 12-month period.

In the case of a motor 3vehicle that is sold for the purpose of leasing for a defined 4period of longer than one year, the sale occurs at the time of 5the delivery of the vehicle, regardless of the due date of any 6lease payments. A lessor who incurs a Retailers' Occupation 7Tax liability on the sale of a motor vehicle coming off lease 8may not take a credit against that liability for the Use Tax 9the lessor paid upon the purchase of the motor vehicle (or for 10any tax the lessor paid with respect to any amount received by 11the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle that was not 12calculated at the time the lease was executed) if the selling 13price of the motor vehicle at the time of purchase was 14calculated using the definition of "selling price" as defined 15in this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 16Act to the contrary, lessors shall file all returns and make 17all payments required under this paragraph to the Department 18by electronic means in the manner and form as required by the 19Department. This paragraph does not apply to leases of motor 20vehicles for which, at the time the lease is entered into, the 21term of the lease is not a defined period, including leases 22with a defined initial period with the option to continue the 23lease on a month-to-month or other basis beyond the initial 24defined period. 25    The phrase "like kind and character" shall be liberally 26construed (including, but not limited to, any form of motor   HB1458- 10 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1vehicle for any form of motor vehicle, or any kind of farm or 2agricultural implement for any other kind of farm or 3agricultural implement), while not including a kind of item 4which, if sold at retail by that retailer, would be exempt from 5retailers' occupation tax and use tax as an isolated or 6occasional sale.7    "Department" means the Department of Revenue.8    "Person" means any natural individual, firm, partnership, 9association, joint stock company, joint adventure, public or 10private corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, 11executor, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed 12by order of any court.13    "Retailer" means and includes every person engaged in the 14business of making sales, including, on and after January 1, 152025, leases, at retail as defined in this Section. With 16respect to leases, a "retailer" also means a "lessor", except 17as otherwise provided in this Act. 18    A person who holds himself or herself out as being engaged 19(or who habitually engages) in selling tangible personal 20property at retail is a retailer hereunder with respect to 21such sales (and not primarily in a service occupation) 22notwithstanding the fact that such person designs and produces 23such tangible personal property on special order for the 24purchaser and in such a way as to render the property of value 25only to such purchaser, if such tangible personal property so 26produced on special order serves substantially the same   HB1458- 11 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1function as stock or standard items of tangible personal 2property that are sold at retail.3    A person whose activities are organized and conducted 4primarily as a not-for-profit service enterprise, and who 5engages in selling tangible personal property at retail 6(whether to the public or merely to members and their guests) 7is a retailer with respect to such transactions, excepting 8only a person organized and operated exclusively for 9charitable, religious or educational purposes either (1), to 10the extent of sales by such person to its members, students, 11patients, or inmates of tangible personal property to be used 12primarily for the purposes of such person, or (2), to the 13extent of sales by such person of tangible personal property 14which is not sold or offered for sale by persons organized for 15profit. The selling of school books and school supplies by 16schools at retail to students is not "primarily for the 17purposes of" the school which does such selling. This 18paragraph does not apply to nor subject to taxation occasional 19dinners, social, or similar activities of a person organized 20and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, or 21educational purposes, whether or not such activities are open 22to the public.23    A person who is the recipient of a grant or contract under 24Title VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (P.L. 92-258) and 25serves meals to participants in the federal Nutrition Program 26for the Elderly in return for contributions established in   HB1458- 12 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1amount by the individual participant pursuant to a schedule of 2suggested fees as provided for in the federal Act is not a 3retailer under this Act with respect to such transactions.4    Persons who engage in the business of transferring 5tangible personal property upon the redemption of trading 6stamps are retailers hereunder when engaged in such business.7    The isolated or occasional sale of tangible personal 8property at retail by a person who does not hold himself out as 9being engaged (or who does not habitually engage) in selling 10such tangible personal property at retail or a sale through a 11bulk vending machine does not make such person a retailer 12hereunder. However, any person who is engaged in a business 13which is not subject to the tax imposed by the Retailers' 14Occupation Tax Act because of involving the sale of or a 15contract to sell real estate or a construction contract to 16improve real estate, but who, in the course of conducting such 17business, transfers tangible personal property to users or 18consumers in the finished form in which it was purchased, and 19which does not become real estate, under any provision of a 20construction contract or real estate sale or real estate sales 21agreement entered into with some other person arising out of 22or because of such nontaxable business, is a retailer to the 23extent of the value of the tangible personal property so 24transferred. If, in such transaction, a separate charge is 25made for the tangible personal property so transferred, the 26value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, is the   HB1458- 13 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1amount so separately charged, but not less than the cost of 2such property to the transferor; if no separate charge is 3made, the value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, 4is the cost to the transferor of such tangible personal 5property.6    "Retailer maintaining a place of business in this State", 7or any like term, means and includes any of the following 8retailers:9        (1) A retailer having or maintaining within this 10    State, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, 11    distribution house, sales house, warehouse, or other place 12    of business, or any agent or other representative 13    operating within this State under the authority of the 14    retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such 15    place of business or agent or other representative is 16    located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such 17    retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this 18    State. However, the ownership of property that is located 19    at the premises of a printer with which the retailer has 20    contracted for printing and that consists of the final 21    printed product, property that becomes a part of the final 22    printed product, or copy from which the printed product is 23    produced shall not result in the retailer being deemed to 24    have or maintain an office, distribution house, sales 25    house, warehouse, or other place of business within this 26    State.  HB1458- 14 -LRB104 03259 HLH 13281 b1        (1.1) A retailer having a contract with a person 2    located in this State under which the person, for a 3    commission or other consideration based upon the sale of 4    tangible personal property by the retailer, directly or 5    indirectly refers potential customers to the retailer by 6    providing to the potential customers a promotional code or 7    other mechanism that allows the retailer to track 8    purchases referred by such persons.
