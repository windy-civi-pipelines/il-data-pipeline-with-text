The Court may deny or 11    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 12    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 13    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 14    filing of the petition and the hearing.15    (d) Contents of petition.16        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 17    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 18    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 19    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 20    persons or the community, based on the specific 21    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.22        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 23    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 24    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 25    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 26    filing of the previous petition.  HB3425- 9 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 2for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 3proving by clear and convincing evidence that:4        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 5    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 6    subsection (a), and7        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 8    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 9    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 10    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 11    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 12    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 13    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 14    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 15    1986, and16        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 17    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 18    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 19    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 20    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 21    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 22    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 23    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and24        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 25    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 26    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or   HB3425- 10 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 2    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 3    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 4    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 5    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 6    appear in court as required.7    (f) Conduct of the hearings.8        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 9    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 10    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 11    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 12    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 13    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 14    hearing.15        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 16    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.17        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 18    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 19    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 20    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 21    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 22    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 23    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 24    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 25    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 26    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate   HB3425- 11 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 2    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 3    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 4    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 5    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 6        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 7    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 8    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 9    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 10    court determines that the physical health and safety of 11    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 12    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 13    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 14    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 15    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 16    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 17    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 18    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 19    Courts every 6 months. 20        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 21    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 22    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 23    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 24    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 25    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 26    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining   HB3425- 12 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 2    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 3    the court shall state on the record the reason for 4    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 5    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 6    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 7    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 8    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 9    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 10    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 11    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 12    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 13    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 14    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 15    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 16    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 17    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 18    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 19    criminal history, if available, and any written or 20    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 21    statements made by any person, if in the State's 22    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 23        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 24    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 25    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 26    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted   HB3425- 13 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 2    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 3    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 4    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 5    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.6        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 7    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 8    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 9    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 10    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 11    the defendant.12        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 13    release, and detention prior to trial must be 14    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 15    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 16    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 17    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 18dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 19defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 20person or persons or the community, based on the specific 21articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 22limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:23        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 24    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 25    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.26        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant   HB3425- 14 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    including:2            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 3        history indicative of violent, abusive, or assaultive 4        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 5        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 6        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 7        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.8            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 9        psychiatric or other similar social history which 10        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 11        nature, or lack of any such history.12        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 13    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 14    nature of the threat.15        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 16    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 17    them.18        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.19        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 20    complaining witness. 21        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 22    access to any weapon or weapons.23        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 24    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 25    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release, 26    or other release from custody pending trial, sentencing,   HB3425- 15 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under 2    federal or State state law.3        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 4    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 5    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 6    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 7    or lack of such behavior.8    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 9detention:10        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 11    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 12    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 13    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 14    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 15    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 16    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;17        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 18    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 19    pending trial;20        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 21    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 22    communication with others of his or her choice by 23    visitation, mail and telephone; and24        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 25    required for appearances in connection with court 26    proceedings.  HB3425- 16 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 2detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 3Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 4offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 5on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 6is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 7the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 8release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 9any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 10the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 11from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 12good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.13    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 14before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 15is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 16of any person or persons or the community, based on the 17specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 18defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 19    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 20entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 21denying his or her pretrial release.22    (k) Appeal. The State may appeal any order entered under 23this Section denying any motion for denial of pretrial 24release.25    (l) Presumption of innocence. Nothing in this Section 26shall be construed as modifying or limiting in any way the   HB3425- 17 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1defendant's presumption of innocence in further criminal 2proceedings.3    (m) Interest of victims. 4        (1) Crime victims shall be given notice by the State's 5    Attorney's office of this hearing as required in paragraph 6    (1) of subsection (b) of Section 4.5 of the Rights of Crime 7    Victims and Witnesses Act and shall be informed of their 8    opportunity at this hearing to obtain a protective order. 9        (2) If the defendant is denied pretrial release, the 10    court may impose a no contact provision with the victim or 11    other interested party that shall be enforced while the 12    defendant remains in custody. 13(Source: P.A. 102-1104, eff. 1-1-23; 103-822, eff. 1-1-25; 14revised 10-23-24.)

The Court may deny or 11    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 12    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 13    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 14    filing of the petition and the hearing.15    (d) Contents of petition.16        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 17    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 18    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 19    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 20    persons or the community, based on the specific 21    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.22        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 23    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 24    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 25    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 26    filing of the previous petition.  HB3425- 9 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 2for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 3proving by clear and convincing evidence that:4        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 5    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 6    subsection (a), and7        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 8    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 9    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 10    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 11    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 12    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 13    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 14    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 15    1986, and16        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 17    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 18    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 19    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 20    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 21    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 22    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 23    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and24        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 25    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 26    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or   HB3425- 10 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 2    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 3    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 4    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 5    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 6    appear in court as required.7    (f) Conduct of the hearings.8        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 9    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 10    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 11    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 12    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 13    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 14    hearing.15        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 16    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.17        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 18    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 19    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 20    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 21    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 22    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 23    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 24    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 25    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 26    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate   HB3425- 11 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 2    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 3    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 4    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 5    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 6        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 7    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 8    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 9    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 10    court determines that the physical health and safety of 11    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 12    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 13    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 14    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 15    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 16    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 17    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 18    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 19    Courts every 6 months. 20        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 21    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 22    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 23    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 24    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 25    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 26    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining   HB3425- 12 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 2    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 3    the court shall state on the record the reason for 4    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 5    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 6    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 7    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 8    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 9    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 10    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 11    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 12    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 13    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 14    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 15    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 16    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 17    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 18    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 19    criminal history, if available, and any written or 20    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 21    statements made by any person, if in the State's 22    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 23        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 24    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 25    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 26    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted   HB3425- 13 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 2    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 3    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 4    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 5    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.6        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 7    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 8    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 9    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 10    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 11    the defendant.12        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 13    release, and detention prior to trial must be 14    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 15    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 16    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 17    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 18dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 19defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 20person or persons or the community, based on the specific 21articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 22limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:23        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 24    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 25    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.26        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant   HB3425- 14 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    including:2            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 3        history indicative of violent, abusive, or assaultive 4        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 5        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 6        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 7        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.8            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 9        psychiatric or other similar social history which 10        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 11        nature, or lack of any such history.12        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 13    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 14    nature of the threat.15        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 16    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 17    them.18        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.19        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 20    complaining witness. 21        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 22    access to any weapon or weapons.23        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 24    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 25    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release, 26    or other release from custody pending trial, sentencing,   HB3425- 15 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under 2    federal or State state law.3        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 4    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 5    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 6    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 7    or lack of such behavior.8    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 9detention:10        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 11    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 12    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 13    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 14    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 15    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 16    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;17        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 18    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 19    pending trial;20        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 21    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 22    communication with others of his or her choice by 23    visitation, mail and telephone; and24        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 25    required for appearances in connection with court 26    proceedings.  HB3425- 16 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 2detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 3Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 4offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 5on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 6is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 7the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 8release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 9any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 10the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 11from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 12good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.13    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 14before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 15is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 16of any person or persons or the community, based on the 17specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 18defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 19    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 20entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 21denying his or her pretrial release.22    (k) Appeal. The State may appeal any order entered under 23this Section denying any motion for denial of pretrial 24release.25    (l) Presumption of innocence. Nothing in this Section 26shall be construed as modifying or limiting in any way the   HB3425- 17 -LRB104 10625 RLC 20701 b1defendant's presumption of innocence in further criminal 2proceedings.3    (m) Interest of victims. 4        (1) Crime victims shall be given notice by the State's 5    Attorney's office of this hearing as required in paragraph 6    (1) of subsection (b) of Section 4.5 of the Rights of Crime 7    Victims and Witnesses Act and shall be informed of their 8    opportunity at this hearing to obtain a protective order. 9        (2) If the defendant is denied pretrial release, the 10    court may impose a no contact provision with the victim or 11    other interested party that shall be enforced while the 12    defendant remains in custody. 13(Source: P.A. 102-1104, eff. 1-1-23; 103-822, eff. 1-1-25; 14revised 10-23-24.)
