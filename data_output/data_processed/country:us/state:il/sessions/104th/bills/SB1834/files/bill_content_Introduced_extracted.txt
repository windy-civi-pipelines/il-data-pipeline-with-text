A new qualified employee is 11deemed to have earned the required minimum wage in the 12preceding reporting period.13    "Reporting period" means the quarter for which a return is 14required to be filed under subsection (b) of this Section. 15    (j) For reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 162023, if a private employer grants all of its employees the 17option of taking a paid leave of absence of at least 30 days 18for the purpose of serving as an organ donor or bone marrow 19donor, then the private employer may take a credit against the 20payments due under this Section in an amount equal to the 21amount withheld under this Section with respect to wages paid 22while the employee is on organ donation leave, not to exceed 23$1,000 in withholdings for each employee who takes organ 24donation leave. To be eligible for the credit, such a leave of 25absence must be taken without loss of pay, vacation time, 26compensatory time, personal days, or sick time for at least   SB1834- 19 -LRB104 03836 HLH 13860 b1the first 30 days of the leave of absence. The private employer 2shall adopt rules governing organ donation leave, including 3rules that (i) establish conditions and procedures for 4requesting and approving leave and (ii) require medical 5documentation of the proposed organ or bone marrow donation 6before leave is approved by the private employer. A private 7employer must provide, in the manner required by the 8Department, documentation from the employee's medical 9provider, which the private employer receives from the 10employee, that verifies the employee's organ donation. The 11private employer must also provide, in the manner required by 12the Department, documentation that shows that a qualifying 13organ donor leave policy was in place and offered to all 14qualifying employees at the time the leave was taken. For the 15private employer to receive the tax credit, the employee 16taking organ donor leave must allow for the applicable medical 17records to be disclosed to the Department. If the private 18employer cannot provide the required documentation to the 19Department, then the private employer is ineligible for the 20credit under this Section. A private employer must also 21provide, in the form required by the Department, any 22additional documentation or information required by the 23Department to administer the credit under this Section. The 24credit under this subsection (j) shall be taken within one 25year after the date upon which the organ donation leave 26begins.

A new qualified employee is 11deemed to have earned the required minimum wage in the 12preceding reporting period.13    "Reporting period" means the quarter for which a return is 14required to be filed under subsection (b) of this Section. 15    (j) For reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 162023, if a private employer grants all of its employees the 17option of taking a paid leave of absence of at least 30 days 18for the purpose of serving as an organ donor or bone marrow 19donor, then the private employer may take a credit against the 20payments due under this Section in an amount equal to the 21amount withheld under this Section with respect to wages paid 22while the employee is on organ donation leave, not to exceed 23$1,000 in withholdings for each employee who takes organ 24donation leave. To be eligible for the credit, such a leave of 25absence must be taken without loss of pay, vacation time, 26compensatory time, personal days, or sick time for at least   SB1834- 19 -LRB104 03836 HLH 13860 b1the first 30 days of the leave of absence. The private employer 2shall adopt rules governing organ donation leave, including 3rules that (i) establish conditions and procedures for 4requesting and approving leave and (ii) require medical 5documentation of the proposed organ or bone marrow donation 6before leave is approved by the private employer. A private 7employer must provide, in the manner required by the 8Department, documentation from the employee's medical 9provider, which the private employer receives from the 10employee, that verifies the employee's organ donation. The 11private employer must also provide, in the manner required by 12the Department, documentation that shows that a qualifying 13organ donor leave policy was in place and offered to all 14qualifying employees at the time the leave was taken. For the 15private employer to receive the tax credit, the employee 16taking organ donor leave must allow for the applicable medical 17records to be disclosed to the Department. If the private 18employer cannot provide the required documentation to the 19Department, then the private employer is ineligible for the 20credit under this Section. A private employer must also 21provide, in the form required by the Department, any 22additional documentation or information required by the 23Department to administer the credit under this Section. The 24credit under this subsection (j) shall be taken within one 25year after the date upon which the organ donation leave 26begins. If the leave taken spans into a second tax year, the   SB1834- 20 -LRB104 03836 HLH 13860 b1employer qualifies for the allowable credit in the later of 2the 2 years. If the amount of credit exceeds the tax liability 3for the year, the excess may be carried and applied to the tax 4liability for the 3 taxable years following the excess credit 5year. The tax credit shall be applied to the earliest year for 6which there is a tax liability. If there are credits for more 7than one year that are available to offset liability, the 8earlier credit shall be applied first. 9    Nothing in this subsection (j) prohibits a private 10employer from providing an unpaid leave of absence to its 11employees for the purpose of serving as an organ donor or bone 12marrow donor; however, if the employer's policy provides for 13fewer than 30 days of paid leave for organ or bone marrow 14donation, then the employer shall not be eligible for the 15credit under this Section. 16    As used in this subsection (j):17    "Organ" means any biological tissue of the human body that 18may be donated by a living donor, including, but not limited 19to, the kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, intestine, bone, skin, 20or any subpart of those organs. 21    "Organ donor" means a person from whose body an organ is 22taken to be transferred to the body of another person. 23    "Private employer" means a sole proprietorship, 24corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other 25entity with one or more employees. "Private employer" does not 26include a municipality, county, State agency, or other public   SB1834- 21 -LRB104 03836 HLH 13860 b1employer. 2    This subsection (j) is exempt from the provisions of 3Section 250 of this Act.4    (k) For reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 52025 and before January 1, 2027, an employer may claim a credit 6against payments due under this Section for amounts withheld 7during the first reporting period to occur after the date on 8which a tax credit certificate is issued for a non-profit 9theater production under Section 10 of the Live Theater 10Production Tax Credit Act. The credit shall be equal to the 11amount shown on the certificate, but may not reduce the 12taxpayer's obligation for any payment due under this Article 13to less than zero. If the amount of the credit exceeds the 14total amount due under this Article with respect to amounts 15withheld during the first reporting period to occur after the 16date on which a tax credit certificate is issued, the excess 17may be carried forward and applied against the taxpayer's 18liability under this Section for reporting periods that occur 19in the 5 succeeding calendar years. The excess credit shall be 20applied to the earliest reporting period for which there is a 21payment due under this Article. If there are credits from more 22than one reporting period that are available to offset a 23liability, the earlier credit shall be applied first. The 24Department of Revenue, in cooperation with the Department of 25Commerce and Economic Opportunity, shall adopt rules to 26enforce and administer the provisions of this subsection.   SB1834- 22 -LRB104 03836 HLH 13860 b1    (l) (k) A taxpayer who is issued a certificate under the 2Local Journalism Sustainability Act for a taxable year shall 3be allowed a credit against payments due under this Section as 4provided in that Act. 5    (m) An employer may claim a credit against payments due 6under this Section for amounts withheld during the first 7calendar year ending after the date on which a certificate of 8exemption was issued under the Job Creation Zone Pilot Program 9Act. The credit shall be equal to the amount shown on the 10certificate but may not reduce the taxpayer's obligation for 11any payment due under this Section to less than zero. If the 12amount of the credit exceeds the total payments due under this 13Section with respect to amounts withheld during the calendar 14year, the excess may be carried forward and applied against 15the taxpayer's liability under this Section in the 5 16succeeding calendar years. The credit shall be applied to the 17earliest year for which there is a tax liability. If there are 18credits from more than one calendar year that are available to 19offset a liability, the earlier credit shall be applied first. 20This subsection (k) is exempt from the provisions of Section 21250 of this Act. 22(Source: P.A. 102-669, eff. 11-16-21; 102-700, Article 30, 23Section 30-5, eff. 4-19-22; 102-700, Article 110, Section 24110-905, eff. 4-19-22; 102-1125, eff. 2-3-23; 103-592, Article 2540, Section 40-900, eff. 6-7-24; 103-592, Article 45, Section 2645-10, eff. 6-7-24; revised 7-9-24.)   SB1834- 23 -LRB104 03836 HLH 13860 b1    Section 999.
