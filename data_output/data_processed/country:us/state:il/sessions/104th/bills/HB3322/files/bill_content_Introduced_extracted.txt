Customer self-generation of electricity.18    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that municipal 19utility systems and electric cooperatives shall continue to be 20governed by their respective governing bodies, but that such 21governing bodies should recognize and implement policies to 22provide the opportunity for their residential and small 23commercial customers who wish to self-generate electricity and 24for reasonable credits to customers for excess electricity,   HB3322- 9 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1balanced against the rights of the other non-self-generating 2customers. This includes creating consistent, fair policies 3that are accessible to all customers and transparent, fair 4processes for raising and addressing any concerns.5    (b) Customers have the right to install renewable 6generating facilities to be located on the customer's premises 7or customer's side of the billing meter and that are intended 8primarily to offset the customer's own electrical requirements 9and produce, consume, and store their own renewable energy 10without discriminatory repercussions from an electric 11cooperative or municipal utility system. This includes a 12customer's rights to:13        (1) generate, consume, and deliver excess renewable 14    energy to the distribution grid and reduce his or her use 15    of electricity obtained from the grid;16        (2) use technology to store energy at his or her 17    residence;18        (3) interconnect his or her electrical system that 19    generates renewable energy, stores energy, or any 20    combination thereof, with the electricity meter on the 21    customer's premises that is provided by an electric 22    cooperative or municipal utility system:23            (A) in a timely manner;24            (B) in accordance with requirements established by 25        the electric cooperative or municipal utility system 26        to ensure the safety of utility workers; and  HB3322- 10 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1            (C) after providing written notice to the electric 2        cooperative or municipal utility system providing 3        service in the service territory, installing a 4        nomenclature plate on the electrical meter panel and 5        meeting all applicable State and local safety and 6        electrical code requirements associated with 7        installing a parallel distributed generation system; 8        and9        (4) receive fair credit for excess energy delivered to 10    the distribution grid; and 11        (5) for residential and small commercial customers, 12    interconnect renewable energy systems sized up to and 13    including 25 kW AC.14    (c) The policies of municipal systems and electric 15cooperatives regarding self-generation and credits for excess 16electricity may reasonably differ from those required of other 17entities by Article XVI of the Public Utilities Act or other 18Acts. The credits must recognize the value of self-generation 19to the distribution grid and benefits to other customers. 20    (c-5) The policies of municipal utility systems and 21electrical cooperatives regarding self-generation and credits 22for excess electricity shall be consistent with following:23        (1) The credit for excess energy delivered to the 24    distribution grid shall be at least equal to the average 25    price to compare for the relevant regional transmission 26    organization area reflecting the electric supply charge   HB3322- 11 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1    and transmission service charge published by the Illinois 2    Commerce Commission for the most recent 12 months ending 3    March 31 to be effective for the 12 months beginning June 4    1.5        (2) The billing periods for crediting purposes must be 6    monthly. The municipal utility system or electric 7    cooperative shall carry over any unused credits earned by 8    the customer and apply those credits to subsequent billing 9    periods to offset usage-based energy and delivery charges 10    on the customer's subsequent bills until the end of the 11    annual period. The annual period shall end each year in 12    March.13        (3) Renewable generating facilities shall be sized 14    based on the alternating current rather than direct 15    current.16        (4) Customers shall not be required to name the 17    municipal utility system or electric cooperative as an 18    additional insured on the customer's insurance policies or 19    have any minimum liability limit requirement in connection 20    with the installation and operation of the renewable 21    generating facilities, provided that the renewable 22    generating facilities meet the safety standards listed in 23    the applicable interconnection agreement and the 24    contractor utilized to install the facilities is licensed 25    and possesses commercial general liability insurance 26    coverage of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence and   HB3322- 12 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1    $2,000,000 in aggregate per year.2        (5) Customers may install renewable generating 3    facilities under a lease or power purchase agreement.4        (6) For renewable generating facilities energized on 5    or after September 15, 2021, customers shall not be 6    adversely affected by changes to tariff terms and 7    conditions specific to renewable generating facilities or 8    the operation thereof for a period of 25 years from the 9    energization date. For renewable generating facilities 10    energized after September 15, 2021 but before the 11    effective date of this amendment, each municipal utility 12    system or electric cooperative has the discretion to 13    credit customers for diminished value for excess energy 14    delivered to the distribution grid prior to this 15    amendment.16        (7) For renewable generating facilities 25 kW AC or 17    less, a municipal utility system or electric cooperative 18    may charge an interconnection application fee of up to 19    $500 for application review, a new meter, site inspection, 20    or interconnection study.21        (8) For renewable generating facilities 25 kW AC or 22    less, if an interconnection study indicates that new 23    utility facilities are necessary to accommodate 24    interconnection, then a municipal utility system or 25    electric cooperative shall charge the customer the lesser 26    of $500 or the actual cost for any new utility facilities.  HB3322- 13 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1        (9) Within 15 business days of receiving a complete 2    application to interconnect a renewable generating 3    facility 25 kW AC or less, the municipal utility system or 4    electric cooperative shall approve or deny the 5    application. An applicant may agree to a reasonable 6    extension if requested in writing by the municipal utility 7    system or electric cooperative. Any request for extension 8    must specify the reason for the requested extension and 9    inform the applicant of the 15 business day limit provided 10    for under this paragraph (9). Any denial of the 11    application must be in writing and clearly specify all 12    reasons for denial. 13    (d) Within 180 days after this amendatory Act of the 102nd 14General Assembly, each electric cooperative and municipal 15utility system shall update its policies for the 16interconnection and fair crediting of customer self-generation 17and storage if necessary, to comply with the standards of 18subsection (b) of this Section. Within 180 days after this 19amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, each electric 20cooperative and municipal utility system shall update its 21policies to comply with the standards of subsection (c-5) of 22this Section. Each electric cooperative and municipal utility 23system shall post its updated policies to a public-facing area 24of its website.25    (e) An electric cooperative or municipal utility system 26customer who produces, consumes, and stores his or her own   HB3322- 14 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1renewable energy shall not face discriminatory rate design, 2fees or charges, treatment, or excessive compliance 3requirements that would unreasonably affect that customer's 4right to self-generate electricity as provided for in this 5Section.6    (f) An electric cooperative or municipal utility system 7customer shall have a right to appeal any decision related to 8self-generation and storage that violates these rights to 9self-generation and non-discrimination pursuant to the 10provisions of this Section through a complaint under the 11Administrative Review Law or similar legal process.12(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21.) 13    Section 20.

Customer self-generation of electricity.18    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that municipal 19utility systems and electric cooperatives shall continue to be 20governed by their respective governing bodies, but that such 21governing bodies should recognize and implement policies to 22provide the opportunity for their residential and small 23commercial customers who wish to self-generate electricity and 24for reasonable credits to customers for excess electricity,   HB3322- 9 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1balanced against the rights of the other non-self-generating 2customers. This includes creating consistent, fair policies 3that are accessible to all customers and transparent, fair 4processes for raising and addressing any concerns.5    (b) Customers have the right to install renewable 6generating facilities to be located on the customer's premises 7or customer's side of the billing meter and that are intended 8primarily to offset the customer's own electrical requirements 9and produce, consume, and store their own renewable energy 10without discriminatory repercussions from an electric 11cooperative or municipal utility system. This includes a 12customer's rights to:13        (1) generate, consume, and deliver excess renewable 14    energy to the distribution grid and reduce his or her use 15    of electricity obtained from the grid;16        (2) use technology to store energy at his or her 17    residence;18        (3) interconnect his or her electrical system that 19    generates renewable energy, stores energy, or any 20    combination thereof, with the electricity meter on the 21    customer's premises that is provided by an electric 22    cooperative or municipal utility system:23            (A) in a timely manner;24            (B) in accordance with requirements established by 25        the electric cooperative or municipal utility system 26        to ensure the safety of utility workers; and  HB3322- 10 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1            (C) after providing written notice to the electric 2        cooperative or municipal utility system providing 3        service in the service territory, installing a 4        nomenclature plate on the electrical meter panel and 5        meeting all applicable State and local safety and 6        electrical code requirements associated with 7        installing a parallel distributed generation system; 8        and9        (4) receive fair credit for excess energy delivered to 10    the distribution grid; and 11        (5) for residential and small commercial customers, 12    interconnect renewable energy systems sized up to and 13    including 25 kW AC.14    (c) The policies of municipal systems and electric 15cooperatives regarding self-generation and credits for excess 16electricity may reasonably differ from those required of other 17entities by Article XVI of the Public Utilities Act or other 18Acts. The credits must recognize the value of self-generation 19to the distribution grid and benefits to other customers. 20    (c-5) The policies of municipal utility systems and 21electrical cooperatives regarding self-generation and credits 22for excess electricity shall be consistent with following:23        (1) The credit for excess energy delivered to the 24    distribution grid shall be at least equal to the average 25    price to compare for the relevant regional transmission 26    organization area reflecting the electric supply charge   HB3322- 11 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1    and transmission service charge published by the Illinois 2    Commerce Commission for the most recent 12 months ending 3    March 31 to be effective for the 12 months beginning June 4    1.5        (2) The billing periods for crediting purposes must be 6    monthly. The municipal utility system or electric 7    cooperative shall carry over any unused credits earned by 8    the customer and apply those credits to subsequent billing 9    periods to offset usage-based energy and delivery charges 10    on the customer's subsequent bills until the end of the 11    annual period. The annual period shall end each year in 12    March.13        (3) Renewable generating facilities shall be sized 14    based on the alternating current rather than direct 15    current.16        (4) Customers shall not be required to name the 17    municipal utility system or electric cooperative as an 18    additional insured on the customer's insurance policies or 19    have any minimum liability limit requirement in connection 20    with the installation and operation of the renewable 21    generating facilities, provided that the renewable 22    generating facilities meet the safety standards listed in 23    the applicable interconnection agreement and the 24    contractor utilized to install the facilities is licensed 25    and possesses commercial general liability insurance 26    coverage of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence and   HB3322- 12 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1    $2,000,000 in aggregate per year.2        (5) Customers may install renewable generating 3    facilities under a lease or power purchase agreement.4        (6) For renewable generating facilities energized on 5    or after September 15, 2021, customers shall not be 6    adversely affected by changes to tariff terms and 7    conditions specific to renewable generating facilities or 8    the operation thereof for a period of 25 years from the 9    energization date. For renewable generating facilities 10    energized after September 15, 2021 but before the 11    effective date of this amendment, each municipal utility 12    system or electric cooperative has the discretion to 13    credit customers for diminished value for excess energy 14    delivered to the distribution grid prior to this 15    amendment.16        (7) For renewable generating facilities 25 kW AC or 17    less, a municipal utility system or electric cooperative 18    may charge an interconnection application fee of up to 19    $500 for application review, a new meter, site inspection, 20    or interconnection study.21        (8) For renewable generating facilities 25 kW AC or 22    less, if an interconnection study indicates that new 23    utility facilities are necessary to accommodate 24    interconnection, then a municipal utility system or 25    electric cooperative shall charge the customer the lesser 26    of $500 or the actual cost for any new utility facilities.  HB3322- 13 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1        (9) Within 15 business days of receiving a complete 2    application to interconnect a renewable generating 3    facility 25 kW AC or less, the municipal utility system or 4    electric cooperative shall approve or deny the 5    application. An applicant may agree to a reasonable 6    extension if requested in writing by the municipal utility 7    system or electric cooperative. Any request for extension 8    must specify the reason for the requested extension and 9    inform the applicant of the 15 business day limit provided 10    for under this paragraph (9). Any denial of the 11    application must be in writing and clearly specify all 12    reasons for denial. 13    (d) Within 180 days after this amendatory Act of the 102nd 14General Assembly, each electric cooperative and municipal 15utility system shall update its policies for the 16interconnection and fair crediting of customer self-generation 17and storage if necessary, to comply with the standards of 18subsection (b) of this Section. Within 180 days after this 19amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, each electric 20cooperative and municipal utility system shall update its 21policies to comply with the standards of subsection (c-5) of 22this Section. Each electric cooperative and municipal utility 23system shall post its updated policies to a public-facing area 24of its website.25    (e) An electric cooperative or municipal utility system 26customer who produces, consumes, and stores his or her own   HB3322- 14 -LRB104 09999 RTM 20069 b1renewable energy shall not face discriminatory rate design, 2fees or charges, treatment, or excessive compliance 3requirements that would unreasonably affect that customer's 4right to self-generate electricity as provided for in this 5Section.6    (f) An electric cooperative or municipal utility system 7customer shall have a right to appeal any decision related to 8self-generation and storage that violates these rights to 9self-generation and non-discrimination pursuant to the 10provisions of this Section through a complaint under the 11Administrative Review Law or similar legal process.12(Source: P.A. 102-662, eff. 9-15-21.) 13    Section 20.
