Accordingly, the acquisition price shall be the price for 14which the system was purchased from the municipality by a 15private entity, plus the cost of actual improvement to the 16water system by the private entity, accounting for the rate of 17inflation between the time of purchase by the private entity 18and the time of acquisition by the municipality. 19(Source: P.A. 103-13, eff. 6-9-23.)
