Unless it complies with the provisions set 2forth in this Section, a municipality is not permitted to 3acquire by eminent domain that portion of a system located in 4another incorporated municipality without agreement of that 5municipality, but this provision shall not prevent the 6acquisition of that portion of the water system existing 7within the acquiring municipality. A referendum to initiate a 8process by which a municipality may acquire a system by 9eminent domain may be called by a resolution by the relevant 10corporate authorities under subsection (a-5) or by the filing 11of a petition under subsection (a-10). Any municipality may 12initiate a process to acquire a system by eminent domain under 13subsection (a-5) or (a-10). 14    (a-5) If the corporate authorities of a municipality adopt 15a resolution calling for a referendum on a proposal to acquire 16a system by eminent domain, within the time provided in the 17general election law, then the corporate authorities shall 18provide for the submission of the proposal to the electors of 19the municipality in accordance with this Section at the next 20general election held in an even-numbered year. The 21proposition shall be in substantially the following form:22        Shall the municipality of (name of municipality) 23    initiate a process to determine the feasibility of 24    acquiring (name of the public utility) and, upon 25    determining that such an acquisition is possible, 26    undertake to acquire (name of the water or sewer system)   10400SB1513sam001- 3 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1    by eminent domain?2        The votes shall be recorded as "Yes" or "No".3    If a majority of the electors voting on the referendum 4within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in 5favor of the referendum, then the municipality shall undertake 6a process to determine the feasibility of acquiring the system 7in accordance with subsection (f) and it shall, upon a finding 8that such an undertaking is feasible, initiate an acquisition 9via eminent domain in accordance with this Section. If less 10than a majority of the electors voting on the referendum 11within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in 12favor of the referendum, then the municipality shall not 13initiate a procedure to determine the feasibility of 14acquisition and shall not subsequently attempt to acquire the 15system for a period of not less than 2 years after the 16referendum.17    (a-10) Upon the filing of a petition signed by the number 18of registered voters required by this subsection (a-10) with 19the clerk of a circuit court having jurisdiction over the 20municipality, within the time provided in the general election 21law, that requests the initiation of a process by which a 22municipality may acquire a water or sewer system by eminent 23domain, the clerk of the circuit court shall transmit the 24petition to the chief judge of the circuit court who shall 25determine the sufficiency of the petition or assign the 26determination of the sufficiency of the petition to a circuit   10400SB1513sam001- 4 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1judge who shall make the determination. For a municipality 2with a population greater than or equal to 500,000, the 3petition under this subsection (a-10) shall be signed by 5% of 4the registered voters in the municipality or 10,000 5individuals, whichever is less.

If the 9judge determines that the petition is sufficient, then the 10judge shall certify the sufficiency of the petition and issue 11an order directing the county clerk and the county board to 12provide for the submission of the proposition to the electors 13of the municipality at the next general election held in an 14even-numbered year. The referendum shall be conducted in such 15a manner as is prescribed in the general election law. The 16proposition shall be in substantially the following form:17        Shall the municipality of (name of municipality) 18    initiate a process to determine the feasibility of 19    acquiring (name of the public utility) and, upon 20    determining that such an acquisition is possible, 21    undertake to acquire (name of the water or sewer system) 22    by eminent domain?23        The votes shall be recorded as "Yes" or "No".24    If a majority of the electors voting on the referendum 25within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in 26favor of the referendum, then the municipality may undergo a   10400SB1513sam001- 5 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1process to determine the feasibility of acquiring the system 2in accordance with subsection (f) and, upon a finding that 3such an undertaking is feasible, initiate an acquisition via 4eminent domain in accordance with this Section. If less than a 5majority of the electors voting on the referendum within the 6service area of the water or sewer utility vote in favor of the 7referendum, then the municipality shall not initiate a 8procedure to determine the feasibility of acquisition and 9shall not subsequently attempt to acquire the system for a 10period of not less than 2 years after the referendum. 11    (b) Where a water or sewer system that is owned by a public 12utility (as defined in the Public Utilities Act) provides 13water or sewer services to customers located in 2 or more 14municipalities, the system may be acquired by a majority of 15the municipalities by eminent domain. If the system is to be 16acquired by more than one municipality, then there must be an 17intergovernmental agreement in existence between the acquiring 18municipalities providing for the acquisition. 19    (c) If a water or sewer system that is owned by a public 20utility provides water or sewer services to customers located 21in one or more municipalities and also to customers in an 22unincorporated area and if at least 70% of the customers of the 23system or portion thereof are located within the municipality 24or municipalities, then the system, or portion thereof as 25determined by the corporate authorities, may be acquired, 26using eminent domain or otherwise, by either a municipality   10400SB1513sam001- 6 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1under subsection (a) or an entity created by agreement between 2municipalities where at least 70% of the customers reside. For 3the purposes of determining "customers of the system", only 4retail customers directly billed by the company shall be 5included in the computation. The number of customers of the 6system most recently reported to the Illinois Commerce 7Commission for any calendar year preceding the year a 8resolution is passed by a municipality or municipalities 9expressing preliminary intent to purchase the water system or 10portion thereof shall be presumed to be the total number of 11customers within the system. The public utility shall provide 12information relative to the number of customers within each 13municipality and within the system within 60 days after any 14such request by a municipality.15    (d) In the case of acquisition by a municipality or 16municipalities or a public entity created by law to own or 17operate a water system under this Section, service and water 18supply must be provided to persons who are customers of the 19system on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 20General Assembly without discrimination based on whether the 21customer is located within or outside of the boundaries of the 22acquiring municipality or municipalities or entity, and a 23supply contract existing on the effective date of this 24amendatory Act of the 94th General Assembly must be honored by 25an acquiring municipality, municipalities, or entity according 26to the terms so long as the agreement does not conflict with   10400SB1513sam001- 7 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1any other existing agreement.2    (e) For the purposes of this Section, "system" includes 3all assets reasonably necessary to provide water or sewer 4service to a contiguous or compact geographical service area 5or to an area served by a common pipeline and include, but are 6not limited to, interests in real estate, all wells, pipes, 7treatment plants, pumps and other physical apparatus, data and 8records of facilities and customers, fire hydrants, equipment, 9or vehicles and also includes service agreements and 10obligations derived from use of the assets, whether or not the 11assets are contiguous to the municipality, municipalities, or 12entity created for the purpose of owning or operating a water 13or sewer system.14    (f) Before making a good faith offer, a municipality may 15pass a resolution of intent to study the feasibility of 16purchasing or exercising its power of eminent domain to 17acquire any water system or water works, sewer system or sewer 18works, or combined water and sewer system or works, or part 19thereof. Upon the passage of such a resolution, the 20municipality shall have the right to review and inspect all 21financial and other records, and both corporeal and 22incorporeal assets of such utility related to the condition 23and the operation of the system or works, or part thereof, as 24part of the study and determination of feasibility of the 25proposed acquisition by purchase or exercise of the power of 26eminent domain, and the utility shall make knowledgeable   10400SB1513sam001- 8 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1persons who have access to all relevant facts and information 2regarding the subject system or works available to answer 3inquiries related to the study and determination.4    The right to review and inspect shall be upon reasonable 5notice to the utility, with reasonable inspection and review 6time limitations and reasonable response times for production, 7copying, and answer. In addition, the utility may utilize a 8reasonable security protocol for personnel on the 9municipality's physical inspection team.10    In the absence of other agreement, the utility must 11respond to any notice by the municipality concerning its 12review and inspection within 21 days after receiving the 13notice. The review and inspection of the assets of the company 14shall be over such period of time and carried out in such 15manner as is reasonable under the circumstances.16    Information requested that is not privileged or protected 17from discovery under the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure but 18is reasonably claimed to be proprietary, including, without 19limitation, information that constitutes trade secrets or 20information that involves system security concerns, shall be 21provided, but shall not be considered a public record and 22shall be kept confidential by the municipality.23    In addition, the municipality must, upon request, 24reimburse the utility for the actual, reasonable costs and 25expenses, excluding attorneys' fees, incurred by the utility 26as a result of the municipality's inspection and requests for   10400SB1513sam001- 9 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1information. Upon written request, the utility shall issue a 2statement itemizing, with reasonable detail, the costs and 3expenses for which reimbursement is sought by the utility. 4Where such written request for a statement has been made, no 5payment shall be required until 30 days after receipt of the 6statement. Such reimbursement by the municipality shall be 7considered income for purposes of any rate proceeding or other 8financial request before the Illinois Commerce Commission by 9the utility.10    The municipality and the utility shall cooperate to 11resolve any dispute arising under this subsection. In the 12event the dispute under this subsection cannot be resolved, 13either party may request relief from the circuit court in any 14county in which the water system is located, with the 15prevailing party to be awarded such relief as the court deems 16appropriate under the discovery abuse sanctions currently set 17forth in the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure.18    The municipality's right to inspect physical assets and 19records in connection with the purpose of this Section shall 20not be exercised with respect to any system more than one time 21during a 5-year period, unless a substantial change in the 22size of the system or condition of the operating assets of the 23system has occurred since the previous inspection. Rights 24under franchise agreements and other agreements or statutory 25or regulatory provisions are not limited by this Section and 26are preserved.  10400SB1513sam001- 10 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1    The passage of time between an inspection of the utilities 2and physical assets and the making of a good faith offer or 3initiation of an eminent domain action because of the limit 4placed on inspections by this subsection shall not be used as a 5basis for challenging the good faith of any offer or be used as 6the basis for attacking any appraisal, expert, argument, or 7position before a court related to an acquisition by purchase 8or eminent domain. 9    (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 10Illinois Commerce Commission has no approval authority of any 11eminent domain action brought by any governmental entity or 12combination of such entities to acquire water or sewer systems 13or water works, except as is provided in subsection (h) of 14Section 10-5-10 of the Eminent Domain Act.15    (h) The provisions of this Section are severable under 16Section 1.31 of the Statute on Statutes.17    (i) This Section does not apply to any public utility 18company that, on January 1, 2006, supplied a total of 70,000 or 19fewer meter connections in the State unless and until (i) that 20public utility company receives approval from the Illinois 21Commerce Commission under Section 7-204 of the Public 22Utilities Act for the reorganization of the public utility 23company or (ii) the majority control of the company changes 24through a stock sale, a sale of assets, a merger (other than an 25internal reorganization) or otherwise.

The reasonable transaction and closing 8costs incurred by the large public utility shall be treated 9consistent with the applicable accounting standards under this 10Act. The total amount of all of the appraisers' fees to be 11included in the transaction and closing costs shall not exceed 12the greater of $15,000 or 5% of the appraised value of the 13water or sewer utility being acquired. This rate base 14treatment shall not be deemed to violate this Act, including, 15but not limited to, any Sections in Articles VIII and IX of 16this Act that might be affected by this Section. Any 17acquisition of a water or sewer utility that affects the 18cumulative base rates of the large public utility's existing 19ratepayers in the tariff group into which the water or sewer 20utility is to be combined by less than (1) 2.5% at the time of 21the acquisition for any single acquisition completed under 22this Section or (2) 5% for all acquisitions completed under 23this Section before the Commission's final order in the next 24rate case shall not be deemed to violate Section 7-204 or any 25other provision of this Act.26    In the Commission's order that approves the large public   10400SB1513sam001- 18 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 2Commission shall issue its decision establishing (1) the 3ratemaking rate base of the water or sewer utility; (2) the 4district or tariff group with which the water or sewer utility 5shall be combined for ratemaking purposes, if such combination 6has been proposed by the large public utility; and (3) the 7rates to be charged to customers in the water or sewer utility.8    (e) If the water or sewer utility being acquired is owned 9by the State or any political subdivision thereof, then the 10water or sewer utility must inform the public of the terms of 11its acquisition by the large public utility by (1) holding a 12public meeting prior to the acquisition and (2) causing to be 13published, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 14that the water or sewer utility operates, a notice setting 15forth the terms of its acquisition by the large public utility 16and options that shall be available to assist customers to pay 17their bills after the acquisition. At the election next 18following the public meeting and notice required under this 19subsection (e), a referendum, subject to the requirements of 20Section 16-7 of the Election Code, shall be placed on the 21ballot for all electors within the area where the water or 22sewer utility operates in substantially the following form:23        May the (name of large public utility) acquire the 24    (name of water or sewer utility) under the terms of 25    acquisition as published in (name of newspaper) on (date)?26        The votes shall be recorded as "Yes" or "No".  10400SB1513sam001- 19 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1    If a majority of the electors voting on the referendum 2within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in 3favor of the referendum, then the acquisition may continue as 4provided in this Section. If less than a majority of the 5electors voting on the referendum within the service area of 6the water or sewer utility vote in favor of the referendum, 7then the Commission shall deny the large public utility's 8acquisition of the water or sewer utility. 9    (f) The large public utility may recommend the district or 10tariff group of which the water or sewer utility shall, for 11ratemaking purposes, become a part after the acquisition, or 12may recommend a lesser rate for the water or sewer utility. If 13the large public utility recommends a lesser rate, it shall 14submit to the Commission its proposed rate schedule and the 15proposed final tariff group for the acquired water or sewer 16utility. The Commission's approved district or tariff group or 17rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's 18recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 19contrary to the public interest.20    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new 21rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 22next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer 23utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 24district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 25lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and 26approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided,   10400SB1513sam001- 20 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1that, if the application of such rates of the large public 2utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 3using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 4total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 5utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 6the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 7the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 8reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 9results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 10or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 11sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 12latest median household income as reported by the United 13States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 14county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 15potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained, 16a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned. These 17rates shall not be deemed to violate this Act including, but 18not limited to, Section 9-101 and any other applicable 19Sections in Articles VIII and IX of this Act. The Commission 20shall issue its decision establishing the rates effective for 21the water or sewer utility immediately following an 22acquisition in its order approving the acquisition.23    (h) In the acquiring large public utility's next rate 24case, the water or sewer utility and the district or tariff 25group ordered by the Commission and their costs of service may 26be combined under the same rate tariff.

Unless it complies with the provisions set 2forth in this Section, a municipality is not permitted to 3acquire by eminent domain that portion of a system located in 4another incorporated municipality without agreement of that 5municipality, but this provision shall not prevent the 6acquisition of that portion of the water system existing 7within the acquiring municipality. A referendum to initiate a 8process by which a municipality may acquire a system by 9eminent domain may be called by a resolution by the relevant 10corporate authorities under subsection (a-5) or by the filing 11of a petition under subsection (a-10). Any municipality may 12initiate a process to acquire a system by eminent domain under 13subsection (a-5) or (a-10). 14    (a-5) If the corporate authorities of a municipality adopt 15a resolution calling for a referendum on a proposal to acquire 16a system by eminent domain, within the time provided in the 17general election law, then the corporate authorities shall 18provide for the submission of the proposal to the electors of 19the municipality in accordance with this Section at the next 20general election held in an even-numbered year. The 21proposition shall be in substantially the following form:22        Shall the municipality of (name of municipality) 23    initiate a process to determine the feasibility of 24    acquiring (name of the public utility) and, upon 25    determining that such an acquisition is possible, 26    undertake to acquire (name of the water or sewer system)   10400SB1513sam001- 3 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1    by eminent domain?2        The votes shall be recorded as "Yes" or "No".3    If a majority of the electors voting on the referendum 4within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in 5favor of the referendum, then the municipality shall undertake 6a process to determine the feasibility of acquiring the system 7in accordance with subsection (f) and it shall, upon a finding 8that such an undertaking is feasible, initiate an acquisition 9via eminent domain in accordance with this Section. If less 10than a majority of the electors voting on the referendum 11within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in 12favor of the referendum, then the municipality shall not 13initiate a procedure to determine the feasibility of 14acquisition and shall not subsequently attempt to acquire the 15system for a period of not less than 2 years after the 16referendum.17    (a-10) Upon the filing of a petition signed by the number 18of registered voters required by this subsection (a-10) with 19the clerk of a circuit court having jurisdiction over the 20municipality, within the time provided in the general election 21law, that requests the initiation of a process by which a 22municipality may acquire a water or sewer system by eminent 23domain, the clerk of the circuit court shall transmit the 24petition to the chief judge of the circuit court who shall 25determine the sufficiency of the petition or assign the 26determination of the sufficiency of the petition to a circuit   10400SB1513sam001- 4 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1judge who shall make the determination. For a municipality 2with a population greater than or equal to 500,000, the 3petition under this subsection (a-10) shall be signed by 5% of 4the registered voters in the municipality or 10,000 5individuals, whichever is less.

The referendum shall be conducted in such 15a manner as is prescribed in the general election law. The 16proposition shall be in substantially the following form:17        Shall the municipality of (name of municipality) 18    initiate a process to determine the feasibility of 19    acquiring (name of the public utility) and, upon 20    determining that such an acquisition is possible, 21    undertake to acquire (name of the water or sewer system) 22    by eminent domain?23        The votes shall be recorded as "Yes" or "No".24    If a majority of the electors voting on the referendum 25within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in 26favor of the referendum, then the municipality may undergo a   10400SB1513sam001- 5 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1process to determine the feasibility of acquiring the system 2in accordance with subsection (f) and, upon a finding that 3such an undertaking is feasible, initiate an acquisition via 4eminent domain in accordance with this Section.

If the system is to be 16acquired by more than one municipality, then there must be an 17intergovernmental agreement in existence between the acquiring 18municipalities providing for the acquisition. 19    (c) If a water or sewer system that is owned by a public 20utility provides water or sewer services to customers located 21in one or more municipalities and also to customers in an 22unincorporated area and if at least 70% of the customers of the 23system or portion thereof are located within the municipality 24or municipalities, then the system, or portion thereof as 25determined by the corporate authorities, may be acquired, 26using eminent domain or otherwise, by either a municipality   10400SB1513sam001- 6 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1under subsection (a) or an entity created by agreement between 2municipalities where at least 70% of the customers reside. For 3the purposes of determining "customers of the system", only 4retail customers directly billed by the company shall be 5included in the computation. The number of customers of the 6system most recently reported to the Illinois Commerce 7Commission for any calendar year preceding the year a 8resolution is passed by a municipality or municipalities 9expressing preliminary intent to purchase the water system or 10portion thereof shall be presumed to be the total number of 11customers within the system. The public utility shall provide 12information relative to the number of customers within each 13municipality and within the system within 60 days after any 14such request by a municipality.15    (d) In the case of acquisition by a municipality or 16municipalities or a public entity created by law to own or 17operate a water system under this Section, service and water 18supply must be provided to persons who are customers of the 19system on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 20General Assembly without discrimination based on whether the 21customer is located within or outside of the boundaries of the 22acquiring municipality or municipalities or entity, and a 23supply contract existing on the effective date of this 24amendatory Act of the 94th General Assembly must be honored by 25an acquiring municipality, municipalities, or entity according 26to the terms so long as the agreement does not conflict with   10400SB1513sam001- 7 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1any other existing agreement.2    (e) For the purposes of this Section, "system" includes 3all assets reasonably necessary to provide water or sewer 4service to a contiguous or compact geographical service area 5or to an area served by a common pipeline and include, but are 6not limited to, interests in real estate, all wells, pipes, 7treatment plants, pumps and other physical apparatus, data and 8records of facilities and customers, fire hydrants, equipment, 9or vehicles and also includes service agreements and 10obligations derived from use of the assets, whether or not the 11assets are contiguous to the municipality, municipalities, or 12entity created for the purpose of owning or operating a water 13or sewer system.14    (f) Before making a good faith offer, a municipality may 15pass a resolution of intent to study the feasibility of 16purchasing or exercising its power of eminent domain to 17acquire any water system or water works, sewer system or sewer 18works, or combined water and sewer system or works, or part 19thereof. Upon the passage of such a resolution, the 20municipality shall have the right to review and inspect all 21financial and other records, and both corporeal and 22incorporeal assets of such utility related to the condition 23and the operation of the system or works, or part thereof, as 24part of the study and determination of feasibility of the 25proposed acquisition by purchase or exercise of the power of 26eminent domain, and the utility shall make knowledgeable   10400SB1513sam001- 8 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1persons who have access to all relevant facts and information 2regarding the subject system or works available to answer 3inquiries related to the study and determination.4    The right to review and inspect shall be upon reasonable 5notice to the utility, with reasonable inspection and review 6time limitations and reasonable response times for production, 7copying, and answer.

The review and inspection of the assets of the company 14shall be over such period of time and carried out in such 15manner as is reasonable under the circumstances.16    Information requested that is not privileged or protected 17from discovery under the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure but 18is reasonably claimed to be proprietary, including, without 19limitation, information that constitutes trade secrets or 20information that involves system security concerns, shall be 21provided, but shall not be considered a public record and 22shall be kept confidential by the municipality.23    In addition, the municipality must, upon request, 24reimburse the utility for the actual, reasonable costs and 25expenses, excluding attorneys' fees, incurred by the utility 26as a result of the municipality's inspection and requests for   10400SB1513sam001- 9 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1information. Upon written request, the utility shall issue a 2statement itemizing, with reasonable detail, the costs and 3expenses for which reimbursement is sought by the utility. 4Where such written request for a statement has been made, no 5payment shall be required until 30 days after receipt of the 6statement. Such reimbursement by the municipality shall be 7considered income for purposes of any rate proceeding or other 8financial request before the Illinois Commerce Commission by 9the utility.10    The municipality and the utility shall cooperate to 11resolve any dispute arising under this subsection. In the 12event the dispute under this subsection cannot be resolved, 13either party may request relief from the circuit court in any 14county in which the water system is located, with the 15prevailing party to be awarded such relief as the court deems 16appropriate under the discovery abuse sanctions currently set 17forth in the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure.18    The municipality's right to inspect physical assets and 19records in connection with the purpose of this Section shall 20not be exercised with respect to any system more than one time 21during a 5-year period, unless a substantial change in the 22size of the system or condition of the operating assets of the 23system has occurred since the previous inspection. Rights 24under franchise agreements and other agreements or statutory 25or regulatory provisions are not limited by this Section and 26are preserved.  10400SB1513sam001- 10 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1    The passage of time between an inspection of the utilities 2and physical assets and the making of a good faith offer or 3initiation of an eminent domain action because of the limit 4placed on inspections by this subsection shall not be used as a 5basis for challenging the good faith of any offer or be used as 6the basis for attacking any appraisal, expert, argument, or 7position before a court related to an acquisition by purchase 8or eminent domain. 9    (g) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the 10Illinois Commerce Commission has no approval authority of any 11eminent domain action brought by any governmental entity or 12combination of such entities to acquire water or sewer systems 13or water works, except as is provided in subsection (h) of 14Section 10-5-10 of the Eminent Domain Act.15    (h) The provisions of this Section are severable under 16Section 1.31 of the Statute on Statutes.17    (i) This Section does not apply to any public utility 18company that, on January 1, 2006, supplied a total of 70,000 or 19fewer meter connections in the State unless and until (i) that 20public utility company receives approval from the Illinois 21Commerce Commission under Section 7-204 of the Public 22Utilities Act for the reorganization of the public utility 23company or (ii) the majority control of the company changes 24through a stock sale, a sale of assets, a merger (other than an 25internal reorganization) or otherwise.

The reasonable transaction and closing 8costs incurred by the large public utility shall be treated 9consistent with the applicable accounting standards under this 10Act. The total amount of all of the appraisers' fees to be 11included in the transaction and closing costs shall not exceed 12the greater of $15,000 or 5% of the appraised value of the 13water or sewer utility being acquired. This rate base 14treatment shall not be deemed to violate this Act, including, 15but not limited to, any Sections in Articles VIII and IX of 16this Act that might be affected by this Section. Any 17acquisition of a water or sewer utility that affects the 18cumulative base rates of the large public utility's existing 19ratepayers in the tariff group into which the water or sewer 20utility is to be combined by less than (1) 2.5% at the time of 21the acquisition for any single acquisition completed under 22this Section or (2) 5% for all acquisitions completed under 23this Section before the Commission's final order in the next 24rate case shall not be deemed to violate Section 7-204 or any 25other provision of this Act.26    In the Commission's order that approves the large public   10400SB1513sam001- 18 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 2Commission shall issue its decision establishing (1) the 3ratemaking rate base of the water or sewer utility; (2) the 4district or tariff group with which the water or sewer utility 5shall be combined for ratemaking purposes, if such combination 6has been proposed by the large public utility; and (3) the 7rates to be charged to customers in the water or sewer utility.8    (e) If the water or sewer utility being acquired is owned 9by the State or any political subdivision thereof, then the 10water or sewer utility must inform the public of the terms of 11its acquisition by the large public utility by (1) holding a 12public meeting prior to the acquisition and (2) causing to be 13published, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 14that the water or sewer utility operates, a notice setting 15forth the terms of its acquisition by the large public utility 16and options that shall be available to assist customers to pay 17their bills after the acquisition. At the election next 18following the public meeting and notice required under this 19subsection (e), a referendum, subject to the requirements of 20Section 16-7 of the Election Code, shall be placed on the 21ballot for all electors within the area where the water or 22sewer utility operates in substantially the following form:23        May the (name of large public utility) acquire the 24    (name of water or sewer utility) under the terms of 25    acquisition as published in (name of newspaper) on (date)?26        The votes shall be recorded as "Yes" or "No".  10400SB1513sam001- 19 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1    If a majority of the electors voting on the referendum 2within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in 3favor of the referendum, then the acquisition may continue as 4provided in this Section. If less than a majority of the 5electors voting on the referendum within the service area of 6the water or sewer utility vote in favor of the referendum, 7then the Commission shall deny the large public utility's 8acquisition of the water or sewer utility. 9    (f) The large public utility may recommend the district or 10tariff group of which the water or sewer utility shall, for 11ratemaking purposes, become a part after the acquisition, or 12may recommend a lesser rate for the water or sewer utility. If 13the large public utility recommends a lesser rate, it shall 14submit to the Commission its proposed rate schedule and the 15proposed final tariff group for the acquired water or sewer 16utility. The Commission's approved district or tariff group or 17rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's 18recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 19contrary to the public interest.20    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new 21rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 22next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer 23utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 24district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 25lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and 26approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided,   10400SB1513sam001- 20 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1that, if the application of such rates of the large public 2utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 3using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 4total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 5utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 6the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 7the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 8reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 9results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 10or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 11sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 12latest median household income as reported by the United 13States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 14county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 15potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained, 16a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned. These 17rates shall not be deemed to violate this Act including, but 18not limited to, Section 9-101 and any other applicable 19Sections in Articles VIII and IX of this Act. The Commission 20shall issue its decision establishing the rates effective for 21the water or sewer utility immediately following an 22acquisition in its order approving the acquisition.23    (h) In the acquiring large public utility's next rate 24case, the water or sewer utility and the district or tariff 25group ordered by the Commission and their costs of service may 26be combined under the same rate tariff. This rate tariff shall   10400SB1513sam001- 21 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1be based on allocation of costs of service of the acquired 2water or sewer utility and the large public utility's district 3or tariff group ordered by the Commission and utilizing a rate 4design that does not distinguish among customers on the basis 5of utility service source or type. This rate tariff shall not 6be deemed to violate this Act including, but not limited to, 7Section 9-101 of this Act. In the acquiring large public 8utility's 2 rate cases after an acquisition, but in no 9subsequent rate case, the large public utility may file a rate 10tariff for a water or sewer utility acquired under this 11Section that establishes lesser rates than the district or 12tariff group into which the water or sewer utility is to be 13combined. Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 14Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 15the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's 16existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than 172.5%. 18    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 19public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 20cost for financing set at the large public utility's 21determined rate for allowance for funds used during 22construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax 23gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 24was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 25has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 26the time the rates are implemented in the large public   10400SB1513sam001- 22 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1utility's next rate case.2    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 3utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 4for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 5was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 6has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 7the time the rates are implemented in the large public 8utility's next rate case.9    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 10public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 11acquisition of water or sewer utilities. Any petitions filed 12with the Commission related to the acquisitions described in 13this Section, including petitions seeking approvals or 14certificates required by this Act, shall be deemed approved 15unless the Commission issues its final order within 11 months 16after the date the large public utility filed its initial 17petition. This Section shall only apply to utilities providing 18water or sewer service and shall not be construed in any manner 19to apply to electric corporations, natural gas corporations, 20or any other utility subject to this Act.21    (k) Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a party from 22declining to proceed with an acquisition or be deemed as 23establishing the final purchase price of an acquisition.24    (l) In the Commission's order that approves the large 25utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 26Commission shall address each aspect of the acquisition   10400SB1513sam001- 23 -LRB104 10303 RTM 23765 a1transaction for which approval is required under the Act. 2    (m) Any contractor or subcontractor that performs work on 3a water or sewer utility acquired by a large public utility 4under this Section shall be a responsible bidder as described 5in Section 30-22 of the Illinois Procurement Code. The 6contractor or subcontractor shall submit evidence of meeting 7the requirements to be a responsible bidder as described in 8Section 30-22 to the water or sewer utility. Any new water or 9sewer facility built as a result of the acquisition shall 10require the contractor to enter into a project labor 11agreement. The large public utility acquiring the water or 12sewer utility shall offer employee positions to qualified 13employees of the acquired water or sewer utility. 14    (n) This Section is repealed on June 1, 2028. 15(Source: P.A. 102-149, eff. 1-1-22.) 16    Section 15.
