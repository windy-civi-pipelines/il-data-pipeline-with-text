The State Board of Elections may select as many 22election jurisdictions as the Board deems advisable in the 23interests of the election process of this State, to order a 24special test of the automatic tabulating equipment and program 25before any regular election. The Board may order a special 26test in any election jurisdiction where, during the preceding   HB1313- 28 -LRB104 08031 SPS 18077 b112 months, computer programming errors or other errors in the 2use of System resulted in vote tabulation errors.

Within 5 days of receipt of 6the State Board of Elections' written notice of intent to 7conduct a test, the selected jurisdictions shall forward to 8the principal office of the State Board of Elections a copy of 9all specimen ballots.

If any error is detected, the cause of the error 21shall be determined and corrected, and an errorless public 22test shall be made before the automatic tabulating equipment 23is approved. Each election authority shall file a sealed copy 24of each tested program to be used within its jurisdiction at an 25election with the State Board of Elections before the 26election. The Board shall secure the program or programs of   HB1313- 29 -LRB104 08031 SPS 18077 b1each election jurisdiction so filed in its office until the 2next election of the same type (general primary, general 3election, consolidated primary, or consolidated election) for 4which the program or programs were filed. At the expiration of 5that time, if no election contest or appeal is pending in an 6election jurisdiction, the Board shall destroy the sealed 7program or programs. Except where in-precinct counting 8equipment is used, the test shall be repeated immediately 9before the start of the official counting of the ballots, in 10the same manner as set forth above. After the completion of the 11count, the test shall be re-run using the same program. 12Immediately after the re-run, all material used in testing the 13program and the programs shall be sealed and retained under 14the custody of the election authority for a period of 60 days. 15At the expiration of that time the election authority shall 16destroy the voted ballots, together with all unused ballots 17returned from the precincts. Provided, if any contest of 18election is pending at the time in which the ballots may be 19required as evidence and the election authority has notice of 20the contest, the same shall not be destroyed until after the 21contest is finally determined. If the use of back-up equipment 22becomes necessary, the same testing required for the original 23equipment shall be conducted.24(Source: P.A. 93-574, eff. 8-21-03; 94-1000, eff. 7-3-06.) 25    (10 ILCS 5/24C-16)  HB1313- 30 -LRB104 08031 SPS 18077 b1    Sec. 24C-16.
