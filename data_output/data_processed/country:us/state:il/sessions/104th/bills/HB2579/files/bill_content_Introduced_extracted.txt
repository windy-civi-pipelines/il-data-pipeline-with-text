Nothing in this Section shall 6prevent an agent acting under a power of attorney for health 7care from exercising his or her authority under the Illinois 8Power of Attorney Act without further court order, unless a 9court has acted under Section 2-10 of the Illinois Power of 10Attorney Act. If a guardian is also a health care agent for the 11ward under a valid power of attorney for health care, the 12guardian acting as agent may execute his or her authority 13under that act without further court order.14    (e) Decisions made by a guardian on behalf of a ward shall 15be made in accordance with the following standards for 16decision making. The guardian shall consider the ward's 17current preferences to the extent the ward has the ability to 18participate in decision making when those preferences are 19known or reasonably ascertainable by the guardian. Decisions 20by the guardian shall conform to the ward's current 21preferences: (1) unless the guardian reasonably believes that 22doing so would result in substantial harm to the ward's 23welfare or personal or financial interests; and (2) so long as 24such decisions give substantial weight to what the ward, if 25competent, would have done or intended under the 26circumstances, taking into account evidence that includes, but   HB2579- 9 -LRB104 11494 JRC 21583 b1is not limited to, the ward's personal, philosophical, 2religious and moral beliefs, and ethical values relative to 3the decision to be made by the guardian. Where possible, the 4guardian shall determine how the ward would have made a 5decision based on the ward's previously expressed preferences, 6and make decisions in accordance with the preferences of the 7ward. If the ward's wishes are unknown and remain unknown 8after reasonable efforts to discern them, or if the guardian 9reasonably believes that a decision made in conformity with 10the ward's preferences would result in substantial harm to the 11ward's welfare or personal or financial interests, the 12decision shall be made on the basis of the ward's best 13interests as determined by the guardian. In determining the 14ward's best interests, the guardian shall weigh the reason for 15and nature of the proposed action, the benefit or necessity of 16the action, the possible risks and other consequences of the 17proposed action, and any available alternatives and their 18risks, consequences and benefits, and shall take into account 19any other information, including the views of family and 20friends, that the guardian believes the ward would have 21considered if able to act for herself or himself.22    (f) Upon petition by any interested person (including the 23standby or short-term guardian), with such notice to 24interested persons as the court directs and a finding by the 25court that it is in the best interests of the person with a 26disability, the court may terminate or limit the authority of   HB2579- 10 -LRB104 11494 JRC 21583 b1a standby or short-term guardian or may enter such other 2orders as the court deems necessary to provide for the best 3interests of the person with a disability. The petition for 4termination or limitation of the authority of a standby or 5short-term guardian may, but need not, be combined with a 6petition to have another guardian appointed for the person 7with a disability.8    (g)(1) Unless there is a court order to the contrary, the 9guardian, consistent with the standards set forth in 10subsection (e) of this Section, shall use reasonable efforts 11to notify the ward's known adult children, who have requested 12notification and provided contact information, of the ward's 13admission to a hospital, hospice, or palliative care program, 14the ward's death, and the arrangements for the disposition of 15the ward's remains.16    (2) If a guardian unreasonably prevents an adult child, 17spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or adult sibling of the ward 18from visiting the ward, the court, upon a verified petition, 19may order the guardian to permit visitation between the ward 20and the adult child, spouse, adult grandchild, parent, or 21adult sibling. In making its determination, the court shall 22consider the standards set forth in subsection (e) of this 23Section. The court shall not allow visitation if the court 24finds that the ward has capacity to evaluate and communicate 25decisions regarding visitation and expresses a desire not to 26have visitation with the petitioner. This subsection (g) does   HB2579- 11 -LRB104 11494 JRC 21583 b1not apply to duly appointed public guardians or the Office of 2State Guardian.3(Source: P.A. 101-329, eff. 8-9-19; 102-72, eff. 1-1-22; 4102-258, eff. 8-6-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22.)
