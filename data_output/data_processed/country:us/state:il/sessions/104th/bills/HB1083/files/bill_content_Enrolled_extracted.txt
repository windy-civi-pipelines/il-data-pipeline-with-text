The first appointment shall be 14made within 90 days and not sooner than 60 days after such 15forest preserve district has been organized as provided 16herein. Each member of such board so appointed shall be a legal 17voter in such district.

In the one district 5in existence on July 1, 1977, that is managed by an appointed 6board of commissioners, the incumbent 5 commissioners shall 7complete their respective terms as originally prescribed in 8this Act. However, upon the expiration of the terms of 2 of the 9incumbent commissioners on January 1, 1978, they or their 10successors shall be appointed to hold office for terms of 3 and 115 years, and until June 30 thereafter, respectively, as 12determined and fixed by lot.

The 16members of a county board of a county under township 17organization and members of a county board of a county not 18under township organization who were elected prior to July 1, 191965, who also act as commissioners of a forest preserve 20district in counties having a population of less than 213,000,000 may receive for their services as commissioners of a 22forest preserve district a per diem fee to be fixed by such 23board, but not to exceed $36 per day, which shall be in full 24for all services rendered on such day, or an annual salary to 25be fixed by such board, but not to exceed $3,000, plus mileage 26expenses at a rate not more than the amount allowed for members   HB1083 Enrolled- 4 -LRB104 06306 JRC 16341 b1of the county board of such county, as fixed by the board, for 2each mile necessarily traveled in attending meetings of the 3board of such district, plus any expense incurred while, or in 4connection with, carrying out the business of such district 5outside the boundaries of such district, payable from the 6forest preserve district treasury.

No Forest Preserve 10Commissioner shall file for a per diem payment for services 11rendered on the same day for which the commissioner he filed 12for a per diem payment as a county supervisor. When the county 13board also acts as such commissioners, a member of the county 14board of a county under township organization and a member of 15the county board of a county not under township organization, 16who is elected prior to July 1, 1965 may, with the permission 17of the county board, work alone as such a commissioner and be 18paid in the usual manner.19    Unless otherwise qualified, the term "board", when used in 20this Act, means the board of commissioners of any forest 21preserve district, or the corporate authorities of any county, 22city, village, incorporated town, or sanitary district, when 23acting as the governing body of a forest preserve district.24(Source: P.A. 96-239, eff. 8-11-09.) 25    (70 ILCS 805/3c)  HB1083 Enrolled- 5 -LRB104 06306 JRC 16341 b1    Sec. 3c.

Such a forest preserve district is a 8separate and distinct legal entity, and its board members are 9elected separate and apart from the elected county 10commissioners. Upon its formation, or as a result of decennial 11reapportionment, such a forest preserve district shall adopt a 12district map determining the boundary lines of each district. 13That map shall be adjusted and reapportioned subject to the 14same decennial reapportionment process stated in Section 3c-1. 15No more than one commissioner shall be elected from each 16district.

The first appointment shall be 14made within 90 days and not sooner than 60 days after such 15forest preserve district has been organized as provided 16herein. Each member of such board so appointed shall be a legal 17voter in such district. The first commissioners shall be 18appointed to hold office for terms of one, 2, 3, 4, and 5 19years, and until June 30 thereafter, respectively, as 20determined and fixed by lot. Thereafter, successor 21commissioners shall be appointed in the same manner no later 22than the first day of the month in which the term of a 23commissioner expires. Except as provided in Section 3c and 3d,   HB1083 Enrolled- 2 -LRB104 06306 JRC 16341 b1a vacancy occurring otherwise than by expiration of term shall 2be filled for the unexpired term by appointment of a 3commissioner by the county board chairman with the advice and 4consent of the members of the county board. In the one district 5in existence on July 1, 1977, that is managed by an appointed 6board of commissioners, the incumbent 5 commissioners shall 7complete their respective terms as originally prescribed in 8this Act. However, upon the expiration of the terms of 2 of the 9incumbent commissioners on January 1, 1978, they or their 10successors shall be appointed to hold office for terms of 3 and 115 years, and until June 30 thereafter, respectively, as 12determined and fixed by lot.

From the time of the 21appointment of the first board of commissioners, such forest 22preserve district shall be construed in all courts to be a body 23corporate and politic by the name and style determined as 24aforesaid and by such name may sue and be sued, contract and be 25contracted with, acquire and hold real and personal estate 26necessary for its corporate purposes and adopt a seal and   HB1083 Enrolled- 3 -LRB104 06306 JRC 16341 b1alter the same at its pleasure.2    In case the boundaries of a district are co-extensive with 3the boundaries of any county, city, village, incorporated town 4or sanitary district, the corporate authorities of such county 5(until the commissioners elected under Section 3c and 3d take 6office), city, village, incorporated town or sanitary district 7shall have and exercise the powers and privileges and perform 8the duties and functions of the commissioners provided for in 9this Act and in that case no commissioner shall be appointed 10for that district. The corporate authorities, other than 11members of a county board in counties under township 12organization having a population of less than 3,000,000 and 13members of a county board in a county not under township 14organization who were elected prior to July 1, 1965, shall act 15without any other pay than that already provided by law. The 16members of a county board of a county under township 17organization and members of a county board of a county not 18under township organization who were elected prior to July 1, 191965, who also act as commissioners of a forest preserve 20district in counties having a population of less than 213,000,000 may receive for their services as commissioners of a 22forest preserve district a per diem fee to be fixed by such 23board, but not to exceed $36 per day, which shall be in full 24for all services rendered on such day, or an annual salary to 25be fixed by such board, but not to exceed $3,000, plus mileage 26expenses at a rate not more than the amount allowed for members   HB1083 Enrolled- 4 -LRB104 06306 JRC 16341 b1of the county board of such county, as fixed by the board, for 2each mile necessarily traveled in attending meetings of the 3board of such district, plus any expense incurred while, or in 4connection with, carrying out the business of such district 5outside the boundaries of such district, payable from the 6forest preserve district treasury. The president of the Board 7of Commissioners of the Forest Preserve District in counties 8of less than 3 million may receive in lieu of a per diem fee an 9annual salary to be fixed by such board. No Forest Preserve 10Commissioner shall file for a per diem payment for services 11rendered on the same day for which the commissioner he filed 12for a per diem payment as a county supervisor. When the county 13board also acts as such commissioners, a member of the county 14board of a county under township organization and a member of 15the county board of a county not under township organization, 16who is elected prior to July 1, 1965 may, with the permission 17of the county board, work alone as such a commissioner and be 18paid in the usual manner.19    Unless otherwise qualified, the term "board", when used in 20this Act, means the board of commissioners of any forest 21preserve district, or the corporate authorities of any county, 22city, village, incorporated town, or sanitary district, when 23acting as the governing body of a forest preserve district.24(Source: P.A. 96-239, eff. 8-11-09.) 25    (70 ILCS 805/3c)  HB1083 Enrolled- 5 -LRB104 06306 JRC 16341 b1    Sec. 3c.

Such a forest preserve district is a 8separate and distinct legal entity, and its board members are 9elected separate and apart from the elected county 10commissioners. Upon its formation, or as a result of decennial 11reapportionment, such a forest preserve district shall adopt a 12district map determining the boundary lines of each district. 13That map shall be adjusted and reapportioned subject to the 14same decennial reapportionment process stated in Section 3c-1. 15No more than one commissioner shall be elected from each 16district. At their first meeting after election in 2022 and at 17their first meeting after election next following each 18subsequent decennial reapportionment of the county under 19Section 3c-1, the elected commissioners shall publicly, by 20lot, divide themselves into 2 groups, as equal in size as 21possible.
