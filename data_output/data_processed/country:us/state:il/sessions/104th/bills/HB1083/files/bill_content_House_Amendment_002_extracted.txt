The first appointment shall be 14made within 90 days and not sooner than 60 days after such 15forest preserve district has been organized as provided 16herein. Each member of such board so appointed shall be a legal   10400HB1083ham002- 2 -LRB104 06306 JRC 22958 a1voter in such district. The first commissioners shall be 2appointed to hold office for terms of one, 2, 3, 4, and 5 3years, and until June 30 thereafter, respectively, as 4determined and fixed by lot.

In the one district 12in existence on July 1, 1977, that is managed by an appointed 13board of commissioners, the incumbent 5 commissioners shall 14complete their respective terms as originally prescribed in 15this Act. However, upon the expiration of the terms of 2 of the 16incumbent commissioners on January 1, 1978, they or their 17successors shall be appointed to hold office for terms of 3 and 185 years, and until June 30 thereafter, respectively, as 19determined and fixed by lot.

No Forest Preserve 17Commissioner shall file for a per diem payment for services 18rendered on the same day for which the commissioner he filed 19for a per diem payment as a county supervisor.

Such a forest preserve district is a 14separate and distinct legal entity, and its board members are 15elected separate and apart from the elected county 16commissioners. Upon its formation, or as a result of decennial 17reapportionment, such a forest preserve district shall adopt a 18district map determining the boundary lines of each district. 19That map shall be adjusted and reapportioned subject to the 20same decennial reapportionment process stated in Section 3c-1. 21No more than one commissioner shall be elected from each 22district.

The first appointment shall be 14made within 90 days and not sooner than 60 days after such 15forest preserve district has been organized as provided 16herein. Each member of such board so appointed shall be a legal   10400HB1083ham002- 2 -LRB104 06306 JRC 22958 a1voter in such district.

In the one district 12in existence on July 1, 1977, that is managed by an appointed 13board of commissioners, the incumbent 5 commissioners shall 14complete their respective terms as originally prescribed in 15this Act. However, upon the expiration of the terms of 2 of the 16incumbent commissioners on January 1, 1978, they or their 17successors shall be appointed to hold office for terms of 3 and 185 years, and until June 30 thereafter, respectively, as 19determined and fixed by lot.

No Forest Preserve 17Commissioner shall file for a per diem payment for services 18rendered on the same day for which the commissioner he filed 19for a per diem payment as a county supervisor. When the county 20board also acts as such commissioners, a member of the county 21board of a county under township organization and a member of 22the county board of a county not under township organization, 23who is elected prior to July 1, 1965 may, with the permission 24of the county board, work alone as such a commissioner and be 25paid in the usual manner.26    Unless otherwise qualified, the term "board", when used in   10400HB1083ham002- 5 -LRB104 06306 JRC 22958 a1this Act, means the board of commissioners of any forest 2preserve district, or the corporate authorities of any county, 3city, village, incorporated town, or sanitary district, when 4acting as the governing body of a forest preserve district.5(Source: P.A. 96-239, eff. 8-11-09.) 6    (70 ILCS 805/3c)7    Sec. 3c. Elected board of commissioners in certain 8counties.

Such a forest preserve district is a 14separate and distinct legal entity, and its board members are 15elected separate and apart from the elected county 16commissioners. Upon its formation, or as a result of decennial 17reapportionment, such a forest preserve district shall adopt a 18district map determining the boundary lines of each district. 19That map shall be adjusted and reapportioned subject to the 20same decennial reapportionment process stated in Section 3c-1. 21No more than one commissioner shall be elected from each 22district. At their first meeting after election in 2022 and at 23their first meeting after election next following each 24subsequent decennial reapportionment of the county under 25Section 3c-1, the elected commissioners shall publicly, by   10400HB1083ham002- 6 -LRB104 06306 JRC 22958 a1lot, divide themselves into 2 groups, as equal in size as 2possible.

No person shall seek election to both the forest 20preserve commission and the county board at the same election, 21nor shall they be eligible to hold both offices at the same 22time. The president, with the advice and consent of the board 23of commissioners shall appoint a secretary, treasurer, and 24such other officers as deemed necessary by the board of 25commissioners, which officers need not be members of the board 26of commissioners.

The appointee shall be affiliated with the same 17political party as the commissioner in whose office the 18vacancy occurred and be a resident of such district. If a 19vacancy in the office of president occurs, other than by 20expiration of the president's term, the remaining members of 21the board of commissioners shall, within 60 days after the 22vacancy, appoint one of the commissioners to serve as 23president for the remainder of the unexpired term. In that 24case, the office of the commissioner who is appointed to serve 25as president shall be deemed vacant and shall be filled within 2660 days by appointment of the president with the advice and   10400HB1083ham002- 8 -LRB104 06306 JRC 22958 a1consent of the other forest preserve district commissioners. 2The commissioner who is appointed to fill a vacancy in the 3office of president shall be affiliated with the same 4political party as the person who occupied the office of 5president prior to the vacancy. A person appointed to fill a 6vacancy in the office of president or commissioner shall 7establish the appointee's his or her party affiliation by the 8appointee's his or her record of voting in primary elections 9or by holding or having held an office in an established 10political party organization before the appointment.
