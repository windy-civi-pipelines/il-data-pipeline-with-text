Jason Plummer SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act30 ILCS 105/5.1030 new    Creates the Unmanned Aerial Systems Security Act. Provides that a government agency may use a drone only if the manufacturer of the drone meets the minimum security requirements specified in the Act. Prohibits a government agency from purchasing, acquiring, or otherwise using a drone or any related services or equipment produced by (i) a manufacturer domiciled in a country of concern or (ii) a manufacturer the government agency reasonably believes to be owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by a country of concern or by a company domiciled in a country of concern. Classifies 3 different tiers of drones, and specifies restrictions for each tier level. Requires, subject to appropriation, a government agency using a drone on January 1, 2026 that does not meet the minimum requirements for that drone's usage tier to receive a reimbursement from the Unmanned Aerial Systems Security Reimbursement Fund up to the cost of acquiring a drone that meets the minimum requirements for that drone's usage tier if specified requirements are met. Requires the Department of Transportation to identify the geographic coordinates of sensitive installations within Illinois for the purpose of prohibiting drone usage over sensitive locations. Requires a provider of flight mapping software or other program for operating a drone to geofence Illinois' sensitive locations to prevent the flight of a drone over Illinois' sensitive locations. Provides that it is a Class A misdemeanor for (i) a provider of flight mapping software to allow a user to fly a drone over a sensitive location unless the user is a law enforcement agency or officer; or (ii) a user of a drone not using flight mapping software to fly a drone over a sensitive location without permission from the governmental agency in charge of the sensitive location. Limits the concurrent exercise of home rule powers. Contains a severability clause. Amends the State Finance Act to create the Unmanned Aerial Systems Security Reimbursement Fund.
