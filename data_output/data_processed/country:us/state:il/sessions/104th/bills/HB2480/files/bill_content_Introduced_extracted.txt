If any 2person refuses to obey a subpoena, or refuses to be sworn or to 3testify, or if any witness, party or attorney is guilty of any 4contempt while in attendance at any hearing, the arbitration 5panel may, or the attorney general if requested shall, invoke 6the aid of any circuit court within the jurisdiction in which 7the hearing is being held, which court shall issue an 8appropriate order. Any failure to obey the order may be 9punished by the court as contempt.10    (f) At any time before the rendering of an award, the 11chairman of the arbitration panel, if he is of the opinion that 12it would be useful or beneficial to do so, may remand the 13dispute to the parties for further collective bargaining for a 14period not to exceed 2 weeks.

The 25determination of the arbitration panel as to the issues in 26dispute and as to which of these issues are economic shall be   HB2480- 6 -LRB104 08612 BDA 18664 b1conclusive. The arbitration panel, within 30 days after the 2conclusion of the hearing, or such further additional periods 3to which the parties may agree, shall make written findings of 4fact and promulgate a written opinion and shall mail or 5otherwise deliver a true copy thereof to the parties and their 6representatives and to the Board.

The findings, opinions and order as to all other issues 11shall be based upon the applicable factors prescribed in 12subsection (h).13    (h) Where there is no agreement between the parties, or 14where there is an agreement but the parties have begun 15negotiations or discussions looking to a new agreement or 16amendment of the existing agreement, and wage rates or other 17conditions of employment under the proposed new or amended 18agreement are in dispute, the arbitration panel shall base its 19findings, opinions and order upon the following factors, as 20applicable:21        (1) The lawful authority of the employer.22        (2) Stipulations of the parties.23        (3) The interests and welfare of the public and the 24    financial ability of the unit of government to meet those 25    costs.26        (4) Comparison of the wages, hours and conditions of   HB2480- 7 -LRB104 08612 BDA 18664 b1    employment of the employees involved in the arbitration 2    proceeding with the wages, hours and conditions of 3    employment of other employees performing similar services 4    and with other employees generally:5            (A) In public employment in comparable 6        communities.7            (B) In private employment in comparable 8        communities.9        (5) The average consumer prices for goods and 10    services, commonly known as the cost of living.11        (6) The overall compensation presently received by the 12    employees, including direct wage compensation, vacations, 13    holidays and other excused time, insurance and pensions, 14    medical and hospitalization benefits, the continuity and 15    stability of employment and all other benefits received.16        (7) Changes in any of the foregoing circumstances 17    during the pendency of the arbitration proceedings.18        (8) Such other factors, not confined to the foregoing, 19    which are normally or traditionally taken into 20    consideration in the determination of wages, hours and 21    conditions of employment through voluntary collective 22    bargaining, mediation, fact-finding, arbitration or 23    otherwise between the parties, in the public service or in 24    private employment.25    (i) In the case of peace officers, the arbitration 26decision shall be limited to wages, hours, and conditions of   HB2480- 8 -LRB104 08612 BDA 18664 b1employment (which may include residency requirements in 2municipalities with a population under 1,000,000 100,000, but 3those residency requirements shall not allow residency outside 4of Illinois) and shall not include the following: i) residency 5requirements in municipalities with a population of at least 61,000,000 100,000; ii) the type of equipment, other than 7uniforms, issued or used; iii) manning; iv) the total number 8of employees employed by the department; v) mutual aid and 9assistance agreements to other units of government; and vi) 10the criterion pursuant to which force, including deadly force, 11can be used; provided, nothing herein shall preclude an 12arbitration decision regarding equipment or manning levels if 13such decision is based on a finding that the equipment or 14manning considerations in a specific work assignment involve a 15serious risk to the safety of a peace officer beyond that which 16is inherent in the normal performance of police duties. 17Limitation of the terms of the arbitration decision pursuant 18to this subsection shall not be construed to limit the factors 19upon which the decision may be based, as set forth in 20subsection (h).21    In the case of fire fighter, and fire department or fire 22district paramedic matters, the arbitration decision shall be 23limited to wages, hours, and conditions of employment 24(including manning and also including residency requirements 25in municipalities with a population under 1,000,000, but those 26residency requirements shall not allow residency outside of   HB2480- 9 -LRB104 08612 BDA 18664 b1Illinois) and shall not include the following matters: i) 2residency requirements in municipalities with a population of 3at least 1,000,000; ii) the type of equipment (other than 4uniforms and fire fighter turnout gear) issued or used; iii) 5the total number of employees employed by the department; iv) 6mutual aid and assistance agreements to other units of 7government; and v) the criterion pursuant to which force, 8including deadly force, can be used; provided, however, 9nothing herein shall preclude an arbitration decision 10regarding equipment levels if such decision is based on a 11finding that the equipment considerations in a specific work 12assignment involve a serious risk to the safety of a fire 13fighter beyond that which is inherent in the normal 14performance of fire fighter duties. Limitation of the terms of 15the arbitration decision pursuant to this subsection shall not 16be construed to limit the facts upon which the decision may be 17based, as set forth in subsection (h).18    The changes to this subsection (i) made by Public Act 1990-385 (relating to residency requirements) do not apply to 20persons who are employed by a combined department that 21performs both police and firefighting services; these persons 22shall be governed by the provisions of this subsection (i) 23relating to peace officers, as they existed before the 24amendment by Public Act 90-385.25    To preserve historical bargaining rights, this subsection 26shall not apply to any provision of a fire fighter collective   HB2480- 10 -LRB104 08612 BDA 18664 b1bargaining agreement in effect and applicable on the effective 2date of this Act; provided, however, nothing herein shall 3preclude arbitration with respect to any such provision.4    (j) Arbitration procedures shall be deemed to be initiated 5by the filing of a letter requesting mediation as required 6under subsection (a) of this Section. The commencement of a 7new municipal fiscal year after the initiation of arbitration 8procedures under this Act, but before the arbitration 9decision, or its enforcement, shall not be deemed to render a 10dispute moot, or to otherwise impair the jurisdiction or 11authority of the arbitration panel or its decision. Increases 12in rates of compensation awarded by the arbitration panel may 13be effective only at the start of the fiscal year next 14commencing after the date of the arbitration award. If a new 15fiscal year has commenced either since the initiation of 16arbitration procedures under this Act or since any mutually 17agreed extension of the statutorily required period of 18mediation under this Act by the parties to the labor dispute 19causing a delay in the initiation of arbitration, the 20foregoing limitations shall be inapplicable, and such awarded 21increases may be retroactive to the commencement of the fiscal 22year, any other statute or charter provisions to the contrary, 23notwithstanding. At any time the parties, by stipulation, may 24amend or modify an award of arbitration.25    (k) Orders of the arbitration panel shall be reviewable, 26upon appropriate petition by either the public employer or the   HB2480- 11 -LRB104 08612 BDA 18664 b1exclusive bargaining representative, by the circuit court for 2the county in which the dispute arose or in which a majority of 3the affected employees reside, but only for reasons that the 4arbitration panel was without or exceeded its statutory 5authority; the order is arbitrary, or capricious; or the order 6was procured by fraud, collusion or other similar and unlawful 7means. Such petitions for review must be filed with the 8appropriate circuit court within 90 days following the 9issuance of the arbitration order. The pendency of such 10proceeding for review shall not automatically stay the order 11of the arbitration panel. The party against whom the final 12decision of any such court shall be adverse, if such court 13finds such appeal or petition to be frivolous, shall pay 14reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to the successful party 15as determined by said court in its discretion. If said court's 16decision affirms the award of money, such award, if 17retroactive, shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per 18annum from the effective retroactive date.19    (l) During the pendency of proceedings before the 20arbitration panel, existing wages, hours, and other conditions 21of employment shall not be changed by action of either party 22without the consent of the other but a party may so consent 23without prejudice to his rights or position under this Act. 24The proceedings are deemed to be pending before the 25arbitration panel upon the initiation of arbitration 26procedures under this Act.  HB2480- 12 -LRB104 08612 BDA 18664 b1    (m) Security officers of public employers, and Peace 2Officers, Fire Fighters and fire department and fire 3protection district paramedics, covered by this Section may 4not withhold services, nor may public employers lock out or 5prevent such employees from performing services at any time.6    (n) All of the terms decided upon by the arbitration panel 7shall be included in an agreement to be submitted to the public 8employer's governing body for ratification and adoption by 9law, ordinance or the equivalent appropriate means.10    The governing body shall review each term decided by the 11arbitration panel. If the governing body fails to reject one 12or more terms of the arbitration panel's decision by a 3/5 vote 13of those duly elected and qualified members of the governing 14body, within 20 days of issuance, or in the case of 15firefighters employed by a state university, at the next 16regularly scheduled meeting of the governing body after 17issuance, such term or terms shall become a part of the 18collective bargaining agreement of the parties. If the 19governing body affirmatively rejects one or more terms of the 20arbitration panel's decision, it must provide reasons for such 21rejection with respect to each term so rejected, within 20 22days of such rejection and the parties shall return to the 23arbitration panel for further proceedings and issuance of a 24supplemental decision with respect to the rejected terms. Any 25supplemental decision by an arbitration panel or other 26decision maker agreed to by the parties shall be submitted to   HB2480- 13 -LRB104 08612 BDA 18664 b1the governing body for ratification and adoption in accordance 2with the procedures and voting requirements set forth in this 3Section. The voting requirements of this subsection shall 4apply to all disputes submitted to arbitration pursuant to 5this Section notwithstanding any contrary voting requirements 6contained in any existing collective bargaining agreement 7between the parties.8    (o) If the governing body of the employer votes to reject 9the panel's decision, the parties shall return to the panel 10within 30 days from the issuance of the reasons for rejection 11for further proceedings and issuance of a supplemental 12decision. All reasonable costs of such supplemental proceeding 13including the exclusive representative's reasonable attorney's 14fees, as established by the Board, shall be paid by the 15employer.16    (p) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section the 17employer and exclusive representative may agree to submit 18unresolved disputes concerning wages, hours, terms and 19conditions of employment to an alternative form of impasse 20resolution.21    The amendatory changes to this Section made by Public Act 22101-652 take effect July 1, 2022. 23(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-28, eff. 6-25-21.) 24    Section 99.

The commencement of a 7new municipal fiscal year after the initiation of arbitration 8procedures under this Act, but before the arbitration 9decision, or its enforcement, shall not be deemed to render a 10dispute moot, or to otherwise impair the jurisdiction or 11authority of the arbitration panel or its decision.

Such petitions for review must be filed with the 8appropriate circuit court within 90 days following the 9issuance of the arbitration order. The pendency of such 10proceeding for review shall not automatically stay the order 11of the arbitration panel. The party against whom the final 12decision of any such court shall be adverse, if such court 13finds such appeal or petition to be frivolous, shall pay 14reasonable attorneys' fees and costs to the successful party 15as determined by said court in its discretion. If said court's 16decision affirms the award of money, such award, if 17retroactive, shall bear interest at the rate of 12 percent per 18annum from the effective retroactive date.19    (l) During the pendency of proceedings before the 20arbitration panel, existing wages, hours, and other conditions 21of employment shall not be changed by action of either party 22without the consent of the other but a party may so consent 23without prejudice to his rights or position under this Act. 24The proceedings are deemed to be pending before the 25arbitration panel upon the initiation of arbitration 26procedures under this Act.  HB2480- 12 -LRB104 08612 BDA 18664 b1    (m) Security officers of public employers, and Peace 2Officers, Fire Fighters and fire department and fire 3protection district paramedics, covered by this Section may 4not withhold services, nor may public employers lock out or 5prevent such employees from performing services at any time.6    (n) All of the terms decided upon by the arbitration panel 7shall be included in an agreement to be submitted to the public 8employer's governing body for ratification and adoption by 9law, ordinance or the equivalent appropriate means.10    The governing body shall review each term decided by the 11arbitration panel.

If the 19governing body affirmatively rejects one or more terms of the 20arbitration panel's decision, it must provide reasons for such 21rejection with respect to each term so rejected, within 20 22days of such rejection and the parties shall return to the 23arbitration panel for further proceedings and issuance of a 24supplemental decision with respect to the rejected terms.
