The Workers' Compensation Act is amended by 5changing Section 8 as follows: 6    (820 ILCS 305/8)  (from Ch. 48, par. 138.8)7    Sec. 8. The amount of compensation which shall be paid to 8the employee for an accidental injury not resulting in death 9is:10    (a) The employer shall provide and pay the negotiated 11rate, if applicable, or the lesser of the health care 12provider's actual charges or according to a fee schedule, 13subject to Section 8.2, in effect at the time the service was 14rendered for all the necessary first aid, medical and surgical 15services, and all necessary medical, surgical and hospital 16services thereafter incurred, limited, however, to that which 17is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of 18the accidental injury, even if a health care provider sells, 19transfers, or otherwise assigns an account receivable for 20procedures, treatments, or services covered under this Act. If 21the employer does not dispute payment of first aid, medical, 22surgical, and hospital services, the employer shall make such 23payment to the provider on behalf of the employee. The   HB1255- 2 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1employer shall also pay for treatment, instruction and 2training necessary for the physical, mental and vocational 3rehabilitation of the employee, including all maintenance 4costs and expenses incidental thereto. If as a result of the 5injury the employee is unable to be self-sufficient the 6employer shall further pay for such maintenance or 7institutional care as shall be required.8    The employee may at any time elect to secure his own 9physician, surgeon and hospital services at the employer's 10expense, or, 11    Upon agreement between the employer and the employees, or 12the employees' exclusive representative, and subject to the 13approval of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the 14employer shall maintain a list of physicians, to be known as a 15Panel of Physicians, who are accessible to the employees. The 16employer shall post this list in a place or places easily 17accessible to his employees. The employee shall have the right 18to make an alternative choice of physician from such Panel if 19he is not satisfied with the physician first selected. If, due 20to the nature of the injury or its occurrence away from the 21employer's place of business, the employee is unable to make a 22selection from the Panel, the selection process from the Panel 23shall not apply. The physician selected from the Panel may 24arrange for any consultation, referral or other specialized 25medical services outside the Panel at the employer's expense. 26Provided that, in the event the Commission shall find that a   HB1255- 3 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1doctor selected by the employee is rendering improper or 2inadequate care, the Commission may order the employee to 3select another doctor certified or qualified in the medical 4field for which treatment is required. If the employee refuses 5to make such change the Commission may relieve the employer of 6his obligation to pay the doctor's charges from the date of 7refusal to the date of compliance.8    Any vocational rehabilitation counselors who provide 9service under this Act shall have appropriate certifications 10which designate the counselor as qualified to render opinions 11relating to vocational rehabilitation. Vocational 12rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, counseling 13for job searches, supervising a job search program, and 14vocational retraining including education at an accredited 15learning institution. The employee or employer may petition to 16the Commission to decide disputes relating to vocational 17rehabilitation and the Commission shall resolve any such 18dispute, including payment of the vocational rehabilitation 19program by the employer.20    The maintenance benefit shall not be less than the 21temporary total disability rate determined for the employee. 22In addition, maintenance shall include costs and expenses 23incidental to the vocational rehabilitation program.24    When the employee is working light duty on a part-time 25basis or full-time basis and earns less than he or she would be 26earning if employed in the full capacity of the job or jobs,   HB1255- 4 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1then the employee shall be entitled to temporary partial 2disability benefits. Temporary partial disability benefits 3shall be equal to two-thirds of the difference between the 4average amount that the employee would be able to earn in the 5full performance of his or her duties in the occupation in 6which he or she was engaged at the time of accident and the 7gross amount which he or she is earning in the modified job 8provided to the employee by the employer or in any other job 9that the employee is working.10    Every hospital, physician, surgeon or other person 11rendering treatment or services in accordance with the 12provisions of this Section shall upon written request furnish 13full and complete reports thereof to, and permit their records 14to be copied by, the employer, the employee or his dependents, 15as the case may be, or any other party to any proceeding for 16compensation before the Commission, or their attorneys.17    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer's liability to 18pay for such medical services selected by the employee shall 19be limited to:20        (1) all first aid and emergency treatment; plus21        (2) all medical, surgical and hospital services 22    provided by the physician, surgeon or hospital initially 23    chosen by the employee or by any other physician, 24    consultant, expert, institution or other provider of 25    services recommended by said initial service provider or 26    any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain   HB1255- 5 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1    of referrals from said initial service provider; plus2        (3) all medical, surgical and hospital services 3    provided by any second physician, surgeon or hospital 4    subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other 5    physician, consultant, expert, institution or other 6    provider of services recommended by said second service 7    provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in 8    the chain of referrals from said second service provider. 9    Thereafter the employer shall select and pay for all 10    necessary medical, surgical and hospital treatment and the 11    employee may not select a provider of medical services at 12    the employer's expense unless the employer agrees to such 13    selection. At any time the employee may obtain any medical 14    treatment he desires at his own expense. This paragraph 15    shall not affect the duty to pay for rehabilitation 16    referred to above.17        (4) The following shall apply for injuries occurring 18    on or after June 28, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 19    97-18) and only when an employer has an approved preferred 20    provider program pursuant to Section 8.1a on the date the 21    employee sustained his or her accidental injuries:22            (A) The employer shall, in writing, on a form 23        promulgated by the Commission, inform the employee of 24        the preferred provider program;25            (B) Subsequent to the report of an injury by an 26        employee, the employee may choose in writing at any   HB1255- 6 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1        time to decline the preferred provider program, in 2        which case that would constitute one of the two 3        choices of medical providers to which the employee is 4        entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3); and5            (C) Prior to the report of an injury by an 6        employee, when an employee chooses non-emergency 7        treatment from a provider not within the preferred 8        provider program, that would constitute the employee's 9        one choice of medical providers to which the employee 10        is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3). 11    When an employer and employee so agree in writing, nothing 12in this Act prevents an employee whose injury or disability 13has been established under this Act, from relying in good 14faith, on treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone, in 15accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church 16or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner 17thereof, and having nursing services appropriate therewith, 18without suffering loss or diminution of the compensation 19benefits under this Act. However, the employee shall submit to 20all physical examinations required by this Act. The cost of 21such treatment and nursing care shall be paid by the employee 22unless the employer agrees to make such payment.23    Where the accidental injury results in the amputation of 24an arm, hand, leg or foot, or the enucleation of an eye, or the 25loss of any of the natural teeth, the employer shall furnish an 26artificial of any such members lost or damaged in accidental   HB1255- 7 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and 2shall also furnish the necessary braces in all proper and 3necessary cases.

Where the accidental injury 7accompanied by physical injury results in damage to a denture, 8eye glasses or contact eye lenses, or where the accidental 9injury results in damage to an artificial member, the employer 10shall replace or repair such denture, glasses, lenses, or 11artificial member.12    The furnishing by the employer of any such services or 13appliances is not an admission of liability on the part of the 14employer to pay compensation.15    The furnishing of any such services or appliances or the 16servicing thereof by the employer is not the payment of 17compensation.18    (b) If the period of temporary total incapacity for work 19lasts more than 3 working days, weekly compensation as 20hereinafter provided shall be paid beginning on the 4th day of 21such temporary total incapacity and continuing as long as the 22total temporary incapacity lasts.

Testicle-4            50 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 5        after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 6        94th General Assembly but before February 1, 2006. 7            54 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 8        after February 1, 2006. 9        Both testicles-10            150 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 11        after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 12        94th General Assembly but before February 1, 2006. 13            162 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 14        after February 1, 2006.15        16. For the permanent partial loss of use of a member 16    or sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, compensation 17    during that proportion of the number of weeks in the 18    foregoing schedule provided for the loss of such member or 19    sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, which the partial 20    loss of use thereof bears to the total loss of use of such 21    member, or sight of eye, or hearing of an ear.22            (a) Loss of hearing for compensation purposes 23        shall be confined to the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 24        and 3,000 cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability 25        for frequency tones above 3,000 cycles per second are 26        not to be considered as constituting disability for   HB1255- 24 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1        hearing.2            (b) The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of 3        the determination of compensation claims for 4        occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the 5        average in decibels for the thresholds of hearing for 6        the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 cycles per 7        second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric 8        instruments, approved by nationally recognized 9        authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring 10        hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 30 11        decibels or less in the 3 frequencies, such losses of 12        hearing shall not then constitute any compensable 13        hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 14        85 decibels or more in the 3 frequencies, then the same 15        shall constitute and be total or 100% compensable 16        hearing loss.17            (c) In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest 18        measured losses in each of the 3 frequencies shall be 19        added together and divided by 3 to determine the 20        average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss 21        exceeding 30 decibels an allowance of 1.82% shall be 22        made up to the maximum of 100% which is reached at 85 23        decibels.24            (d) If a hearing loss is established to have 25        existed on July 1, 1975 by audiometric testing the 26        employer shall not be liable for the previous loss so   HB1255- 25 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1        established nor shall he be liable for any loss for 2        which compensation has been paid or awarded.3            (e) No consideration shall be given to the 4        question of whether or not the ability of an employee 5        to understand speech is improved by the use of a 6        hearing aid.7            (f) No claim for loss of hearing due to industrial 8        noise shall be brought against an employer or allowed 9        unless the employee has been exposed for a period of 10        time sufficient to cause permanent impairment to noise 11        levels in excess of the following: 12Sound Level DBA13Slow ResponseHours Per Day14908159261695417973181002191021-1/2201051211101/2221151/423        This subparagraph (f) shall not be applied in cases of 24    hearing loss resulting from trauma or explosion.25        17. In computing the compensation to be paid to any 26    employee who, before the accident for which he claims   HB1255- 26 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1    compensation, had before that time sustained an injury 2    resulting in any permanency award or settlement, 3    including, without limitation, the loss by amputation or 4    partial loss by amputation of any member, including hand, 5    arm, thumb or fingers, leg, foot or any toes, the partial 6    loss of sight of an eye, or a permanency award or 7    settlement given under subparagraph 2 of paragraph (d), 8    such award or settlement loss or partial loss of any such 9    member shall be deducted from any award made for the 10    subsequent injury. If an employee received an award or 11    settlement under subparagraph 2 of paragraph (d) for a 12    shoulder injury between 2012 and the effective date of 13    this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, then 14    the award or settlement shall be converted to the 15    appropriate number of weeks for an arm and the credit 16    taken against any award or settlement shall be taken on 17    the arm. For the permanent loss of use or the permanent 18    partial loss of use of any such member or the partial loss 19    of sight of an eye, for which compensation has been paid, 20    then such loss shall be taken into consideration and 21    deducted from any award for the subsequent injury.22        18. The specific case of loss of both hands, both 23    arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any 24    two thereof, or the permanent and complete loss of the use 25    thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be 26    compensated according to the compensation fixed by   HB1255- 27 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1    paragraph (f) of this Section. These specific cases of 2    total and permanent disability do not exclude other cases.3        Any employee who has previously suffered the loss or 4    permanent and complete loss of the use of any of such 5    members, and in a subsequent independent accident loses 6    another or suffers the permanent and complete loss of the 7    use of any one of such members the employer for whom the 8    injured employee is working at the time of the last 9    independent accident is liable to pay compensation only 10    for the loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of 11    the member occasioned by the last independent accident.12        19. In a case of specific loss and the subsequent 13    death of such injured employee from other causes than such 14    injury leaving a widow, widower, or dependents surviving 15    before payment or payment in full for such injury, then 16    the amount due for such injury is payable to the widow or 17    widower and, if there be no widow or widower, then to such 18    dependents, in the proportion which such dependency bears 19    to total dependency.20    Beginning July 1, 1980, and every 6 months thereafter, the 21Commission shall examine the Second Injury Fund and when, 22after deducting all advances or loans made to such Fund, the 23amount therein is $500,000 then the amount required to be paid 24by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 25reduced by one-half. When the Second Injury Fund reaches the 26sum of $600,000 then the payments shall cease entirely.   HB1255- 28 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1However, when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to 2$400,000, payment of one-half of the amounts required by 3paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 4herein provided, and when the Second Injury Fund has been 5reduced to $300,000, payment of the full amounts required by 6paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 7herein provided. The Commission shall make the changes in 8payment effective by general order, and the changes in payment 9become immediately effective for all cases coming before the 10Commission thereafter either by settlement agreement or final 11order, irrespective of the date of the accidental injury.12    On August 1, 1996 and on February 1 and August 1 of each 13subsequent year, the Commission shall examine the special fund 14designated as the "Rate Adjustment Fund" and when, after 15deducting all advances or loans made to said fund, the amount 16therein is $4,000,000, the amount required to be paid by 17employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 18reduced by one-half. When the Rate Adjustment Fund reaches the 19sum of $5,000,000 the payment therein shall cease entirely. 20However, when said Rate Adjustment Fund has been reduced to 21$3,000,000 the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 22shall be resumed in the manner herein provided.23    (f) In case of complete disability, which renders the 24employee wholly and permanently incapable of work, or in the 25specific case of total and permanent disability as provided in 26subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section, compensation   HB1255- 29 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1shall be payable at the rate provided in subparagraph 2 of 2paragraph (b) of this Section for life.3    An employee entitled to benefits under paragraph (f) of 4this Section shall also be entitled to receive from the Rate 5Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of the 6supplementary benefits provided in paragraph (g) of this 7Section 8.8    If any employee who receives an award under this paragraph 9afterwards returns to work or is able to do so, and earns or is 10able to earn as much as before the accident, payments under 11such award shall cease. If such employee returns to work, or is 12able to do so, and earns or is able to earn part but not as 13much as before the accident, such award shall be modified so as 14to conform to an award under paragraph (d) of this Section. If 15such award is terminated or reduced under the provisions of 16this paragraph, such employees have the right at any time 17within 30 months after the date of such termination or 18reduction to file petition with the Commission for the purpose 19of determining whether any disability exists as a result of 20the original accidental injury and the extent thereof.21    Disability as enumerated in subdivision 18, paragraph (e) 22of this Section is considered complete disability.23    If an employee who had previously incurred loss or the 24permanent and complete loss of use of one member, through the 25loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one hand, 26one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent and   HB1255- 30 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1complete disability through the loss or the permanent and 2complete loss of the use of another member, he shall receive, 3in addition to the compensation payable by the employer and 4after such payments have ceased, an amount from the Second 5Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7, which, 6together with the compensation payable from the employer in 7whose employ he was when the last accidental injury was 8incurred, will equal the amount payable for permanent and 9complete disability as provided in this paragraph of this 10Section.11    The custodian of the Second Injury Fund provided for in 12paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be joined with the employer as 13a party respondent in the application for adjustment of claim. 14The application for adjustment of claim shall state briefly 15and in general terms the approximate time and place and manner 16of the loss of the first member.17    In its award the Commission or the Arbitrator shall 18specifically find the amount the injured employee shall be 19weekly paid, the number of weeks compensation which shall be 20paid by the employer, the date upon which payments begin out of 21the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of 22Section 7 of this Act, the length of time the weekly payments 23continue, the date upon which the pension payments commence 24and the monthly amount of the payments. The Commission shall 2530 days after the date upon which payments out of the Second 26Injury Fund have begun as provided in the award, and every   HB1255- 31 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1month thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Comptroller 2a voucher for payment for all compensation accrued to that 3date at the rate fixed by the Commission. The State 4Comptroller shall draw a warrant to the injured employee along 5with a receipt to be executed by the injured employee and 6returned to the Commission. The endorsed warrant and receipt 7is a full and complete acquittance to the Commission for the 8payment out of the Second Injury Fund. No other appropriation 9or warrant is necessary for payment out of the Second Injury 10Fund. The Second Injury Fund is appropriated for the purpose 11of making payments according to the terms of the awards.12    As of July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1982, all claims against and 13obligations of the Second Injury Fund shall become claims 14against and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund to the 15extent there is insufficient money in the Second Injury Fund 16to pay such claims and obligations. In that case, all 17references to "Second Injury Fund" in this Section shall also 18include the Rate Adjustment Fund.19    (g) Every award for permanent total disability entered by 20the Commission on and after July 1, 1965 under which 21compensation payments shall become due and payable after the 22effective date of this amendatory Act, and every award for 23death benefits or permanent total disability entered by the 24Commission on and after the effective date of this amendatory 25Act shall be subject to annual adjustments as to the amount of 26the compensation rate therein provided. Such adjustments shall   HB1255- 32 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1first be made on July 15, 1977, and all awards made and entered 2prior to July 1, 1975 and on July 15 of each year thereafter. 3In all other cases such adjustment shall be made on July 15 of 4the second year next following the date of the entry of the 5award and shall further be made on July 15 annually 6thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of 7the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there 8shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage 9in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 10the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately 11increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase 12in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under 13the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the 14compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring 15the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the 16prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment 17is made. Such increase shall be paid in the same manner as 18herein provided for payments under the Second Injury Fund to 19the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, 20out of the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of 21Section 7 of this Act. Payments shall be made at the same 22intervals as provided in the award or, at the option of the 23Commission, may be made in quarterly payment on the 15th day of 24January, April, July and October of each year. In the event of 25a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change 26in the then existing compensation rate. The within paragraph   HB1255- 33 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and 2in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer 3and the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may 4be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' 5Compensation Commission.6    Provided, that in cases of awards entered by the 7Commission for injuries occurring before July 1, 1975, the 8increases in the compensation rate adjusted under the 9foregoing provision of this paragraph (g) shall be limited to 10increases in the State's average weekly wage in covered 11industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act occurring 12after July 1, 1975.13    For every accident occurring on or after July 20, 2005 but 14before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 15General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General 16Assembly), the annual adjustments to the compensation rate in 17awards for death benefits or permanent total disability, as 18provided in this Act, shall be paid by the employer. The 19adjustment shall be made by the employer on July 15 of the 20second year next following the date of the entry of the award 21and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If 22during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the 23award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been 24an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 25industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the employer 26shall increase the weekly compensation rate proportionately by   HB1255- 34 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the 2State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the 3Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation 4rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total 5compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing 6maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. In 7the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall 8be no change in the then existing compensation rate. Such 9increase shall be paid by the employer in the same manner and 10at the same intervals as the payment of compensation in the 11award. This paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is 12disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum 13settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or 14his or her dependents, as the case may be, has been duly 15approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.16    The annual adjustments for every award of death benefits 17or permanent total disability involving accidents occurring 18before July 20, 2005 and accidents occurring on or after the 19effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General 20Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly) shall 21continue to be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund pursuant to 22this paragraph and Section 7(f) of this Act. 23    (h) In case death occurs from any cause before the total 24compensation to which the employee would have been entitled 25has been paid, then in case the employee leaves any widow, 26widower, child, parent (or any grandchild, grandparent or   HB1255- 35 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1other lineal heir or any collateral heir dependent at the time 2of the accident upon the earnings of the employee to the extent 3of 50% or more of total dependency) such compensation shall be 4paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased employee and 5distributed as provided in paragraph (g) of Section 7.6    (h-1) In case an injured employee is under legal 7disability at the time when any right or privilege accrues to 8him or her under this Act, a guardian may be appointed pursuant 9to law, and may, on behalf of such person under legal 10disability, claim and exercise any such right or privilege 11with the same effect as if the employee himself or herself had 12claimed or exercised the right or privilege. No limitations of 13time provided by this Act run so long as the employee who is 14under legal disability is without a conservator or guardian.15    (i) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age 16at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the 17amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 18(e) and (f) of this Section is increased 50%.19    However, where an employer has on file an employment 20certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law of 2024 or 21work permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor 22Standards Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and 23duly issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is 24conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor 25employee for the purposes of this Section.26    Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions   HB1255- 36 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1of the Child Labor Law of 2024 relating to the employment of 2minors under the age of 16 years.3    (j) 1. In the event the injured employee receives 4benefits, including medical, surgical or hospital benefits 5under any group plan covering non-occupational disabilities 6contributed to wholly or partially by the employer, which 7benefits should not have been payable if any rights of 8recovery existed under this Act, then such amounts so paid to 9the employee from any such group plan as shall be consistent 10with, and limited to, the provisions of paragraph 2 hereof, 11shall be credited to or against any compensation payment for 12temporary total incapacity for work or any medical, surgical 13or hospital benefits made or to be made under this Act. In such 14event, the period of time for giving notice of accidental 15injury and filing application for adjustment of claim does not 16commence to run until the termination of such payments. This 17paragraph does not apply to payments made under any group plan 18which would have been payable irrespective of an accidental 19injury under this Act. Any employer receiving such credit 20shall keep such employee safe and harmless from any and all 21claims or liabilities that may be made against him by reason of 22having received such payments only to the extent of such 23credit.24    Any excess benefits paid to or on behalf of a State 25employee by the State Employees' Retirement System under 26Article 14 of the Illinois Pension Code on a death claim or   HB1255- 37 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1disputed disability claim shall be credited against any 2payments made or to be made by the State of Illinois to or on 3behalf of such employee under this Act, except for payments 4for medical expenses which have already been incurred at the 5time of the award. The State of Illinois shall directly 6reimburse the State Employees' Retirement System to the extent 7of such credit.8    2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to 9give the employer or the insurance carrier the right to credit 10for any benefits or payments received by the employee other 11than compensation payments provided by this Act, and where the 12employee receives payments other than compensation payments, 13whether as full or partial salary, group insurance benefits, 14bonuses, annuities or any other payments, the employer or 15insurance carrier shall receive credit for each such payment 16only to the extent of the compensation that would have been 17payable during the period covered by such payment.18    3. The extension of time for the filing of an Application 19for Adjustment of Claim as provided in paragraph 1 above shall 20not apply to those cases where the time for such filing had 21expired prior to the date on which payments or benefits 22enumerated herein have been initiated or resumed. Provided 23however that this paragraph 3 shall apply only to cases 24wherein the payments or benefits hereinabove enumerated shall 25be received after July 1, 1969.26(Source: P.A. 103-721, eff. 1-1-25.)   HB1255- 38 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1    Section 99.

The Workers' Compensation Act is amended by 5changing Section 8 as follows: 6    (820 ILCS 305/8)  (from Ch. 48, par. 138.8)7    Sec. 8. The amount of compensation which shall be paid to 8the employee for an accidental injury not resulting in death 9is:10    (a) The employer shall provide and pay the negotiated 11rate, if applicable, or the lesser of the health care 12provider's actual charges or according to a fee schedule, 13subject to Section 8.2, in effect at the time the service was 14rendered for all the necessary first aid, medical and surgical 15services, and all necessary medical, surgical and hospital 16services thereafter incurred, limited, however, to that which 17is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of 18the accidental injury, even if a health care provider sells, 19transfers, or otherwise assigns an account receivable for 20procedures, treatments, or services covered under this Act. If 21the employer does not dispute payment of first aid, medical, 22surgical, and hospital services, the employer shall make such 23payment to the provider on behalf of the employee. The   HB1255- 2 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1employer shall also pay for treatment, instruction and 2training necessary for the physical, mental and vocational 3rehabilitation of the employee, including all maintenance 4costs and expenses incidental thereto. If as a result of the 5injury the employee is unable to be self-sufficient the 6employer shall further pay for such maintenance or 7institutional care as shall be required.8    The employee may at any time elect to secure his own 9physician, surgeon and hospital services at the employer's 10expense, or, 11    Upon agreement between the employer and the employees, or 12the employees' exclusive representative, and subject to the 13approval of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the 14employer shall maintain a list of physicians, to be known as a 15Panel of Physicians, who are accessible to the employees. The 16employer shall post this list in a place or places easily 17accessible to his employees. The employee shall have the right 18to make an alternative choice of physician from such Panel if 19he is not satisfied with the physician first selected. If, due 20to the nature of the injury or its occurrence away from the 21employer's place of business, the employee is unable to make a 22selection from the Panel, the selection process from the Panel 23shall not apply. The physician selected from the Panel may 24arrange for any consultation, referral or other specialized 25medical services outside the Panel at the employer's expense. 26Provided that, in the event the Commission shall find that a   HB1255- 3 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1doctor selected by the employee is rendering improper or 2inadequate care, the Commission may order the employee to 3select another doctor certified or qualified in the medical 4field for which treatment is required. If the employee refuses 5to make such change the Commission may relieve the employer of 6his obligation to pay the doctor's charges from the date of 7refusal to the date of compliance.8    Any vocational rehabilitation counselors who provide 9service under this Act shall have appropriate certifications 10which designate the counselor as qualified to render opinions 11relating to vocational rehabilitation. Vocational 12rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, counseling 13for job searches, supervising a job search program, and 14vocational retraining including education at an accredited 15learning institution. The employee or employer may petition to 16the Commission to decide disputes relating to vocational 17rehabilitation and the Commission shall resolve any such 18dispute, including payment of the vocational rehabilitation 19program by the employer.20    The maintenance benefit shall not be less than the 21temporary total disability rate determined for the employee. 22In addition, maintenance shall include costs and expenses 23incidental to the vocational rehabilitation program.24    When the employee is working light duty on a part-time 25basis or full-time basis and earns less than he or she would be 26earning if employed in the full capacity of the job or jobs,   HB1255- 4 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1then the employee shall be entitled to temporary partial 2disability benefits. Temporary partial disability benefits 3shall be equal to two-thirds of the difference between the 4average amount that the employee would be able to earn in the 5full performance of his or her duties in the occupation in 6which he or she was engaged at the time of accident and the 7gross amount which he or she is earning in the modified job 8provided to the employee by the employer or in any other job 9that the employee is working.10    Every hospital, physician, surgeon or other person 11rendering treatment or services in accordance with the 12provisions of this Section shall upon written request furnish 13full and complete reports thereof to, and permit their records 14to be copied by, the employer, the employee or his dependents, 15as the case may be, or any other party to any proceeding for 16compensation before the Commission, or their attorneys.17    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer's liability to 18pay for such medical services selected by the employee shall 19be limited to:20        (1) all first aid and emergency treatment; plus21        (2) all medical, surgical and hospital services 22    provided by the physician, surgeon or hospital initially 23    chosen by the employee or by any other physician, 24    consultant, expert, institution or other provider of 25    services recommended by said initial service provider or 26    any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain   HB1255- 5 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1    of referrals from said initial service provider; plus2        (3) all medical, surgical and hospital services 3    provided by any second physician, surgeon or hospital 4    subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other 5    physician, consultant, expert, institution or other 6    provider of services recommended by said second service 7    provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in 8    the chain of referrals from said second service provider. 9    Thereafter the employer shall select and pay for all 10    necessary medical, surgical and hospital treatment and the 11    employee may not select a provider of medical services at 12    the employer's expense unless the employer agrees to such 13    selection. At any time the employee may obtain any medical 14    treatment he desires at his own expense. This paragraph 15    shall not affect the duty to pay for rehabilitation 16    referred to above.17        (4) The following shall apply for injuries occurring 18    on or after June 28, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 19    97-18) and only when an employer has an approved preferred 20    provider program pursuant to Section 8.1a on the date the 21    employee sustained his or her accidental injuries:22            (A) The employer shall, in writing, on a form 23        promulgated by the Commission, inform the employee of 24        the preferred provider program;25            (B) Subsequent to the report of an injury by an 26        employee, the employee may choose in writing at any   HB1255- 6 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1        time to decline the preferred provider program, in 2        which case that would constitute one of the two 3        choices of medical providers to which the employee is 4        entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3); and5            (C) Prior to the report of an injury by an 6        employee, when an employee chooses non-emergency 7        treatment from a provider not within the preferred 8        provider program, that would constitute the employee's 9        one choice of medical providers to which the employee 10        is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3). 11    When an employer and employee so agree in writing, nothing 12in this Act prevents an employee whose injury or disability 13has been established under this Act, from relying in good 14faith, on treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone, in 15accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church 16or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner 17thereof, and having nursing services appropriate therewith, 18without suffering loss or diminution of the compensation 19benefits under this Act. However, the employee shall submit to 20all physical examinations required by this Act. The cost of 21such treatment and nursing care shall be paid by the employee 22unless the employer agrees to make such payment.23    Where the accidental injury results in the amputation of 24an arm, hand, leg or foot, or the enucleation of an eye, or the 25loss of any of the natural teeth, the employer shall furnish an 26artificial of any such members lost or damaged in accidental   HB1255- 7 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and 2shall also furnish the necessary braces in all proper and 3necessary cases. In cases of the loss of a member or members by 4amputation, the employer shall, whenever necessary, maintain 5in good repair, refit or replace the artificial limbs during 6the lifetime of the employee. Where the accidental injury 7accompanied by physical injury results in damage to a denture, 8eye glasses or contact eye lenses, or where the accidental 9injury results in damage to an artificial member, the employer 10shall replace or repair such denture, glasses, lenses, or 11artificial member.12    The furnishing by the employer of any such services or 13appliances is not an admission of liability on the part of the 14employer to pay compensation.15    The furnishing of any such services or appliances or the 16servicing thereof by the employer is not the payment of 17compensation.18    (b) If the period of temporary total incapacity for work 19lasts more than 3 working days, weekly compensation as 20hereinafter provided shall be paid beginning on the 4th day of 21such temporary total incapacity and continuing as long as the 22total temporary incapacity lasts. In cases where the temporary 23total incapacity for work continues for a period of 14 days or 24more from the day of the accident compensation shall commence 25on the day after the accident.26        1.

Testicle-4            50 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 5        after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 6        94th General Assembly but before February 1, 2006. 7            54 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 8        after February 1, 2006. 9        Both testicles-10            150 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 11        after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 12        94th General Assembly but before February 1, 2006. 13            162 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 14        after February 1, 2006.15        16. For the permanent partial loss of use of a member 16    or sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, compensation 17    during that proportion of the number of weeks in the 18    foregoing schedule provided for the loss of such member or 19    sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, which the partial 20    loss of use thereof bears to the total loss of use of such 21    member, or sight of eye, or hearing of an ear.22            (a) Loss of hearing for compensation purposes 23        shall be confined to the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 24        and 3,000 cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability 25        for frequency tones above 3,000 cycles per second are 26        not to be considered as constituting disability for   HB1255- 24 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1        hearing.2            (b) The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of 3        the determination of compensation claims for 4        occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the 5        average in decibels for the thresholds of hearing for 6        the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 cycles per 7        second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric 8        instruments, approved by nationally recognized 9        authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring 10        hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 30 11        decibels or less in the 3 frequencies, such losses of 12        hearing shall not then constitute any compensable 13        hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 14        85 decibels or more in the 3 frequencies, then the same 15        shall constitute and be total or 100% compensable 16        hearing loss.17            (c) In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest 18        measured losses in each of the 3 frequencies shall be 19        added together and divided by 3 to determine the 20        average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss 21        exceeding 30 decibels an allowance of 1.82% shall be 22        made up to the maximum of 100% which is reached at 85 23        decibels.24            (d) If a hearing loss is established to have 25        existed on July 1, 1975 by audiometric testing the 26        employer shall not be liable for the previous loss so   HB1255- 25 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1        established nor shall he be liable for any loss for 2        which compensation has been paid or awarded.3            (e) No consideration shall be given to the 4        question of whether or not the ability of an employee 5        to understand speech is improved by the use of a 6        hearing aid.7            (f) No claim for loss of hearing due to industrial 8        noise shall be brought against an employer or allowed 9        unless the employee has been exposed for a period of 10        time sufficient to cause permanent impairment to noise 11        levels in excess of the following: 12Sound Level DBA13Slow ResponseHours Per Day14908159261695417973181002191021-1/2201051211101/2221151/423        This subparagraph (f) shall not be applied in cases of 24    hearing loss resulting from trauma or explosion.25        17. In computing the compensation to be paid to any 26    employee who, before the accident for which he claims   HB1255- 26 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1    compensation, had before that time sustained an injury 2    resulting in any permanency award or settlement, 3    including, without limitation, the loss by amputation or 4    partial loss by amputation of any member, including hand, 5    arm, thumb or fingers, leg, foot or any toes, the partial 6    loss of sight of an eye, or a permanency award or 7    settlement given under subparagraph 2 of paragraph (d), 8    such award or settlement loss or partial loss of any such 9    member shall be deducted from any award made for the 10    subsequent injury. If an employee received an award or 11    settlement under subparagraph 2 of paragraph (d) for a 12    shoulder injury between 2012 and the effective date of 13    this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, then 14    the award or settlement shall be converted to the 15    appropriate number of weeks for an arm and the credit 16    taken against any award or settlement shall be taken on 17    the arm. For the permanent loss of use or the permanent 18    partial loss of use of any such member or the partial loss 19    of sight of an eye, for which compensation has been paid, 20    then such loss shall be taken into consideration and 21    deducted from any award for the subsequent injury.22        18. The specific case of loss of both hands, both 23    arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any 24    two thereof, or the permanent and complete loss of the use 25    thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be 26    compensated according to the compensation fixed by   HB1255- 27 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1    paragraph (f) of this Section. These specific cases of 2    total and permanent disability do not exclude other cases.3        Any employee who has previously suffered the loss or 4    permanent and complete loss of the use of any of such 5    members, and in a subsequent independent accident loses 6    another or suffers the permanent and complete loss of the 7    use of any one of such members the employer for whom the 8    injured employee is working at the time of the last 9    independent accident is liable to pay compensation only 10    for the loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of 11    the member occasioned by the last independent accident.12        19. In a case of specific loss and the subsequent 13    death of such injured employee from other causes than such 14    injury leaving a widow, widower, or dependents surviving 15    before payment or payment in full for such injury, then 16    the amount due for such injury is payable to the widow or 17    widower and, if there be no widow or widower, then to such 18    dependents, in the proportion which such dependency bears 19    to total dependency.20    Beginning July 1, 1980, and every 6 months thereafter, the 21Commission shall examine the Second Injury Fund and when, 22after deducting all advances or loans made to such Fund, the 23amount therein is $500,000 then the amount required to be paid 24by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 25reduced by one-half. When the Second Injury Fund reaches the 26sum of $600,000 then the payments shall cease entirely.   HB1255- 28 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1However, when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to 2$400,000, payment of one-half of the amounts required by 3paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 4herein provided, and when the Second Injury Fund has been 5reduced to $300,000, payment of the full amounts required by 6paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 7herein provided. The Commission shall make the changes in 8payment effective by general order, and the changes in payment 9become immediately effective for all cases coming before the 10Commission thereafter either by settlement agreement or final 11order, irrespective of the date of the accidental injury.12    On August 1, 1996 and on February 1 and August 1 of each 13subsequent year, the Commission shall examine the special fund 14designated as the "Rate Adjustment Fund" and when, after 15deducting all advances or loans made to said fund, the amount 16therein is $4,000,000, the amount required to be paid by 17employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 18reduced by one-half. When the Rate Adjustment Fund reaches the 19sum of $5,000,000 the payment therein shall cease entirely. 20However, when said Rate Adjustment Fund has been reduced to 21$3,000,000 the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 22shall be resumed in the manner herein provided.23    (f) In case of complete disability, which renders the 24employee wholly and permanently incapable of work, or in the 25specific case of total and permanent disability as provided in 26subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section, compensation   HB1255- 29 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1shall be payable at the rate provided in subparagraph 2 of 2paragraph (b) of this Section for life.3    An employee entitled to benefits under paragraph (f) of 4this Section shall also be entitled to receive from the Rate 5Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of the 6supplementary benefits provided in paragraph (g) of this 7Section 8.8    If any employee who receives an award under this paragraph 9afterwards returns to work or is able to do so, and earns or is 10able to earn as much as before the accident, payments under 11such award shall cease. If such employee returns to work, or is 12able to do so, and earns or is able to earn part but not as 13much as before the accident, such award shall be modified so as 14to conform to an award under paragraph (d) of this Section. If 15such award is terminated or reduced under the provisions of 16this paragraph, such employees have the right at any time 17within 30 months after the date of such termination or 18reduction to file petition with the Commission for the purpose 19of determining whether any disability exists as a result of 20the original accidental injury and the extent thereof.21    Disability as enumerated in subdivision 18, paragraph (e) 22of this Section is considered complete disability.23    If an employee who had previously incurred loss or the 24permanent and complete loss of use of one member, through the 25loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one hand, 26one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent and   HB1255- 30 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1complete disability through the loss or the permanent and 2complete loss of the use of another member, he shall receive, 3in addition to the compensation payable by the employer and 4after such payments have ceased, an amount from the Second 5Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7, which, 6together with the compensation payable from the employer in 7whose employ he was when the last accidental injury was 8incurred, will equal the amount payable for permanent and 9complete disability as provided in this paragraph of this 10Section.11    The custodian of the Second Injury Fund provided for in 12paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be joined with the employer as 13a party respondent in the application for adjustment of claim. 14The application for adjustment of claim shall state briefly 15and in general terms the approximate time and place and manner 16of the loss of the first member.17    In its award the Commission or the Arbitrator shall 18specifically find the amount the injured employee shall be 19weekly paid, the number of weeks compensation which shall be 20paid by the employer, the date upon which payments begin out of 21the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of 22Section 7 of this Act, the length of time the weekly payments 23continue, the date upon which the pension payments commence 24and the monthly amount of the payments. The Commission shall 2530 days after the date upon which payments out of the Second 26Injury Fund have begun as provided in the award, and every   HB1255- 31 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1month thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Comptroller 2a voucher for payment for all compensation accrued to that 3date at the rate fixed by the Commission. The State 4Comptroller shall draw a warrant to the injured employee along 5with a receipt to be executed by the injured employee and 6returned to the Commission. The endorsed warrant and receipt 7is a full and complete acquittance to the Commission for the 8payment out of the Second Injury Fund. No other appropriation 9or warrant is necessary for payment out of the Second Injury 10Fund. The Second Injury Fund is appropriated for the purpose 11of making payments according to the terms of the awards.12    As of July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1982, all claims against and 13obligations of the Second Injury Fund shall become claims 14against and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund to the 15extent there is insufficient money in the Second Injury Fund 16to pay such claims and obligations. In that case, all 17references to "Second Injury Fund" in this Section shall also 18include the Rate Adjustment Fund.19    (g) Every award for permanent total disability entered by 20the Commission on and after July 1, 1965 under which 21compensation payments shall become due and payable after the 22effective date of this amendatory Act, and every award for 23death benefits or permanent total disability entered by the 24Commission on and after the effective date of this amendatory 25Act shall be subject to annual adjustments as to the amount of 26the compensation rate therein provided. Such adjustments shall   HB1255- 32 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1first be made on July 15, 1977, and all awards made and entered 2prior to July 1, 1975 and on July 15 of each year thereafter. 3In all other cases such adjustment shall be made on July 15 of 4the second year next following the date of the entry of the 5award and shall further be made on July 15 annually 6thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of 7the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there 8shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage 9in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 10the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately 11increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase 12in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under 13the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the 14compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring 15the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the 16prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment 17is made. Such increase shall be paid in the same manner as 18herein provided for payments under the Second Injury Fund to 19the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, 20out of the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of 21Section 7 of this Act. Payments shall be made at the same 22intervals as provided in the award or, at the option of the 23Commission, may be made in quarterly payment on the 15th day of 24January, April, July and October of each year. In the event of 25a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change 26in the then existing compensation rate. The within paragraph   HB1255- 33 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and 2in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer 3and the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may 4be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' 5Compensation Commission.6    Provided, that in cases of awards entered by the 7Commission for injuries occurring before July 1, 1975, the 8increases in the compensation rate adjusted under the 9foregoing provision of this paragraph (g) shall be limited to 10increases in the State's average weekly wage in covered 11industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act occurring 12after July 1, 1975.13    For every accident occurring on or after July 20, 2005 but 14before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 15General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General 16Assembly), the annual adjustments to the compensation rate in 17awards for death benefits or permanent total disability, as 18provided in this Act, shall be paid by the employer. The 19adjustment shall be made by the employer on July 15 of the 20second year next following the date of the entry of the award 21and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If 22during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the 23award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been 24an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 25industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the employer 26shall increase the weekly compensation rate proportionately by   HB1255- 34 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the 2State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the 3Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation 4rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total 5compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing 6maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. In 7the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall 8be no change in the then existing compensation rate. Such 9increase shall be paid by the employer in the same manner and 10at the same intervals as the payment of compensation in the 11award. This paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is 12disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum 13settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or 14his or her dependents, as the case may be, has been duly 15approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.16    The annual adjustments for every award of death benefits 17or permanent total disability involving accidents occurring 18before July 20, 2005 and accidents occurring on or after the 19effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General 20Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly) shall 21continue to be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund pursuant to 22this paragraph and Section 7(f) of this Act. 23    (h) In case death occurs from any cause before the total 24compensation to which the employee would have been entitled 25has been paid, then in case the employee leaves any widow, 26widower, child, parent (or any grandchild, grandparent or   HB1255- 35 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1other lineal heir or any collateral heir dependent at the time 2of the accident upon the earnings of the employee to the extent 3of 50% or more of total dependency) such compensation shall be 4paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased employee and 5distributed as provided in paragraph (g) of Section 7.6    (h-1) In case an injured employee is under legal 7disability at the time when any right or privilege accrues to 8him or her under this Act, a guardian may be appointed pursuant 9to law, and may, on behalf of such person under legal 10disability, claim and exercise any such right or privilege 11with the same effect as if the employee himself or herself had 12claimed or exercised the right or privilege. No limitations of 13time provided by this Act run so long as the employee who is 14under legal disability is without a conservator or guardian.15    (i) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age 16at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the 17amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 18(e) and (f) of this Section is increased 50%.19    However, where an employer has on file an employment 20certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law of 2024 or 21work permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor 22Standards Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and 23duly issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is 24conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor 25employee for the purposes of this Section.26    Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions   HB1255- 36 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1of the Child Labor Law of 2024 relating to the employment of 2minors under the age of 16 years.3    (j) 1. In the event the injured employee receives 4benefits, including medical, surgical or hospital benefits 5under any group plan covering non-occupational disabilities 6contributed to wholly or partially by the employer, which 7benefits should not have been payable if any rights of 8recovery existed under this Act, then such amounts so paid to 9the employee from any such group plan as shall be consistent 10with, and limited to, the provisions of paragraph 2 hereof, 11shall be credited to or against any compensation payment for 12temporary total incapacity for work or any medical, surgical 13or hospital benefits made or to be made under this Act. In such 14event, the period of time for giving notice of accidental 15injury and filing application for adjustment of claim does not 16commence to run until the termination of such payments. This 17paragraph does not apply to payments made under any group plan 18which would have been payable irrespective of an accidental 19injury under this Act. Any employer receiving such credit 20shall keep such employee safe and harmless from any and all 21claims or liabilities that may be made against him by reason of 22having received such payments only to the extent of such 23credit.24    Any excess benefits paid to or on behalf of a State 25employee by the State Employees' Retirement System under 26Article 14 of the Illinois Pension Code on a death claim or   HB1255- 37 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1disputed disability claim shall be credited against any 2payments made or to be made by the State of Illinois to or on 3behalf of such employee under this Act, except for payments 4for medical expenses which have already been incurred at the 5time of the award. The State of Illinois shall directly 6reimburse the State Employees' Retirement System to the extent 7of such credit.8    2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to 9give the employer or the insurance carrier the right to credit 10for any benefits or payments received by the employee other 11than compensation payments provided by this Act, and where the 12employee receives payments other than compensation payments, 13whether as full or partial salary, group insurance benefits, 14bonuses, annuities or any other payments, the employer or 15insurance carrier shall receive credit for each such payment 16only to the extent of the compensation that would have been 17payable during the period covered by such payment.18    3. The extension of time for the filing of an Application 19for Adjustment of Claim as provided in paragraph 1 above shall 20not apply to those cases where the time for such filing had 21expired prior to the date on which payments or benefits 22enumerated herein have been initiated or resumed. Provided 23however that this paragraph 3 shall apply only to cases 24wherein the payments or benefits hereinabove enumerated shall 25be received after July 1, 1969.26(Source: P.A. 103-721, eff. 1-1-25.)   HB1255- 38 -LRB104 03228 SPS 13250 b1    Section 99.
