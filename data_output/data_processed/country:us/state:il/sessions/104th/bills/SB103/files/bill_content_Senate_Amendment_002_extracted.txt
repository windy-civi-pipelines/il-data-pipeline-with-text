In all such 22actions petitioner or his attorney shall file, at the office 23of the clerk of the court in which the action is pending, an 24affidavit showing that the defendant resides or has gone out 25of this State, or on due inquiry cannot be found, or is   10400SB0103sam002- 5 -LRB104 05884 JRC 23012 a1concealed within this State, so that process cannot be served 2upon him, and stating the place of residence of the defendant, 3if known, or that upon diligent inquiry his place of residence 4cannot be ascertained, the clerk shall cause publication to be 5made in some newspaper published in the county in which the 6action is pending.
