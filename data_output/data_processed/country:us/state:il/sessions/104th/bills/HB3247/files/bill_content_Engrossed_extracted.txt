In their efforts to promote the right to educational 16equality established in Plyler, schools must take steps to 17protect the integrity of school learning environments for all 18children, so that no parent is discouraged from sending and no 19child is discouraged from attending school, including from the 20threat of immigration enforcement or other law enforcement 21activity on a school campus.22    (b) As used in this Section:23    "Citizenship or immigration status" means all matters   HB3247 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 11044 LNS 21126 b1regarding citizenship of the United States or any other 2country or the authority or lack thereof to reside in or 3otherwise to be present in the United States, including an 4individual's nationality and country of citizenship.5    "Law enforcement agent" means an agent of federal, State, 6or local law enforcement authorized with the power to arrest 7or detain individuals or manage the custody of detained 8individuals for a law enforcement purpose, including civil 9immigration enforcement.

Denial of free education prohibited. 8    (a) The purpose of this Section is to secure the right of 9every child to equal access to a free public education and a 10school that is safe from intimidation and fear, consistent 11with the landmark United States Supreme Court decision in 12Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), as in effect on January 1, 132025, which held that it is unconstitutional for states to 14deny children a free public education based on immigration 15status. In their efforts to promote the right to educational 16equality established in Plyler, schools must take steps to 17protect the integrity of school learning environments for all 18children, so that no parent is discouraged from sending and no 19child is discouraged from attending school, including from the 20threat of immigration enforcement or other law enforcement 21activity on a school campus.22    (b) As used in this Section:23    "Citizenship or immigration status" means all matters   HB3247 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 11044 LNS 21126 b1regarding citizenship of the United States or any other 2country or the authority or lack thereof to reside in or 3otherwise to be present in the United States, including an 4individual's nationality and country of citizenship.5    "Law enforcement agent" means an agent of federal, State, 6or local law enforcement authorized with the power to arrest 7or detain individuals or manage the custody of detained 8individuals for a law enforcement purpose, including civil 9immigration enforcement.

"Nonjudicial warrant" does not 19include a criminal warrant issued upon a judicial 20determination of probable cause, in compliance with the 21requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the United States 22Constitution and Section 6 of Article I of the Illinois 23Constitution. 24    "Prevailing party" includes any party:25        (1) who obtains some of his or her requested relief 26    through a judicial judgment in his or her favor;  HB3247 Engrossed- 3 -LRB104 11044 LNS 21126 b1        (2) who obtains some of his or her requested relief 2    through a settlement agreement approved by the court; or3        (3) whose pursuit of a non-frivolous claim was a 4    catalyst for a unilateral change in position by the 5    opposing party relative to the relief sought.6    "School" means every public school, school district, and 7governing body, including a special charter district or 8charter school, organized under this Code, and its agents, 9including a contracted party.10    (c) No child may be denied a free public education through 11secondary school while in this State based on the child's 12perceived or actual immigration status or the child's parent's 13or guardian's perceived or actual citizenship or immigration 14status.15        (1) A school must not exclude a child from 16    participation in or deny a child the benefits of any 17    program or activity on the grounds of that child's 18    perceived or actual immigration status or the child's 19    parent's or guardian's actual or perceived citizenship or 20    immigration status.21        (2) A school must not use policies or procedures or 22    engage in practices that have the effect of excluding a 23    child from participation in or denying the benefits of any 24    program or activity or the effect of excluding 25    participation of the child's parent or guardian from 26    parental engagement activities or programs because of the   HB3247 Engrossed- 4 -LRB104 11044 LNS 21126 b1    child's perceived or actual immigration status or the 2    child's parent's or guardian's actual or perceived 3    immigration status.
