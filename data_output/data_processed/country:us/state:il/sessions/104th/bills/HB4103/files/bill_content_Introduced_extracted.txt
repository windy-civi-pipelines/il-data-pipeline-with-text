A defendant shall be 8given custodial credit for each day he or she was subjected to 9home confinement, at the same rate described in subsection (b) 10of Section 5-4.5-100 of the Unified Code of Corrections. The 11court may give custodial credit to a defendant for each day the 12defendant was subjected to GPS monitoring without home 13confinement or electronic monitoring without home confinement. 14    (i) If electronic monitoring, GPS monitoring, or home 15confinement is imposed, the court shall determine every 60 16days if no less restrictive condition of release or 17combination of less restrictive conditions of release would 18reasonably ensure the appearance, or continued appearance, of 19the defendant for later hearings or protect an identifiable 20person or persons from imminent threat of serious physical 21harm. If the court finds that there are less restrictive 22conditions of release, the court shall order that the 23condition be removed.

The court is not required to 22be presented with new information or a change in circumstance 23to remove pretrial conditions. 24    (g) Electronic monitoring, GPS monitoring, or home 25confinement can only be imposed as a condition of pretrial 26release if a no less restrictive condition of release or   HB4103- 8 -LRB104 14621 RLC 27763 b1combination of less restrictive condition of release would 2reasonably ensure the appearance of the defendant for later 3hearings or protect an identifiable person or persons from 4imminent threat of serious physical harm.5    (h) If the court imposes electronic monitoring, GPS 6monitoring, or home confinement, the court shall set forth in 7the record the basis for its finding. A defendant shall be 8given custodial credit for each day he or she was subjected to 9home confinement, at the same rate described in subsection (b) 10of Section 5-4.5-100 of the Unified Code of Corrections. The 11court may give custodial credit to a defendant for each day the 12defendant was subjected to GPS monitoring without home 13confinement or electronic monitoring without home confinement. 14    (i) If electronic monitoring, GPS monitoring, or home 15confinement is imposed, the court shall determine every 60 16days if no less restrictive condition of release or 17combination of less restrictive conditions of release would 18reasonably ensure the appearance, or continued appearance, of 19the defendant for later hearings or protect an identifiable 20person or persons from imminent threat of serious physical 21harm. If the court finds that there are less restrictive 22conditions of release, the court shall order that the 23condition be removed.
