Except in the case of an 20    action taken pursuant to a violation of Section 6-3, 6-5, 21    or 6-9, any action by the State Commission to suspend or 22    revoke a licensee's license may be limited to the license 23    for the specific premises where the violation occurred. An 24    action for a violation of this Act shall be commenced by 25    the State Commission within 2 years after the date the 26    State Commission becomes aware of the violation.   10400SB0618sam001- 3 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1        In lieu of suspending or revoking a license, the 2    commission may impose a fine, upon the State Commission's 3    determination and notice after hearing, that a licensee 4    has violated any provision of this Act or any rule or 5    regulation issued pursuant thereto and in effect for 30 6    days prior to such violation.7        For the purpose of this paragraph (1), when 8    determining multiple violations for the sale of alcohol to 9    a person under the age of 21, a second or subsequent 10    violation for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age 11    of 21 shall only be considered if it was committed within 5 12    years after the date when a prior violation for the sale of 13    alcohol to a person under the age of 21 was committed. 14        The fine imposed under this paragraph may not exceed 15    $500 for each violation. Each day that the activity, which 16    gave rise to the original fine, continues is a separate 17    violation.

The failure to include such 11    required documentation shall result in the dismissal of 12    the action.13        (2) To adopt such rules and regulations consistent 14    with the provisions of this Act which shall be necessary 15    to carry on its functions and duties to the end that the 16    health, safety and welfare of the People of the State of 17    Illinois shall be protected and temperance in the 18    consumption of alcoholic liquors shall be fostered and 19    promoted and to distribute copies of such rules and 20    regulations to all licensees affected thereby. 21        (3) To call upon other administrative departments of 22    the State, county and municipal governments, county and 23    city police departments and upon prosecuting officers for 24    such information and assistance as it deems necessary in 25    the performance of its duties. 26        (4) To recommend to local commissioners rules and   10400SB0618sam001- 5 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    regulations, not inconsistent with the law, for the 2    distribution and sale of alcoholic liquors throughout the 3    State. 4        (5) To inspect, or cause to be inspected, any premises 5    in this State where alcoholic liquors are manufactured, 6    distributed, warehoused, or sold.

If the State Commission 18    has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaint 19    substantially alleges a violation of this Act or rules and 20    regulations adopted pursuant to this Act, it shall conduct 21    an investigation. If, after conducting an investigation, 22    the State Commission is satisfied that the alleged 23    violation did occur, it shall proceed with disciplinary 24    action against the licensee as provided in this Act. 25        (5.4) To make arrests and issue notices of civil 26    violations where necessary for the enforcement of this   10400SB0618sam001- 7 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    Act. 2        (5.5) To investigate any and all unlicensed activity. 3        (5.6) To impose civil penalties or fines to any person 4    who, without holding a valid license, engages in conduct 5    that requires a license pursuant to this Act, in an amount 6    not to exceed $20,000 for each offense as determined by 7    the State Commission.

The State Commission may also 25    prescribe the forms of accounts to be kept by all retail 26    licensees having more than 4 employees, including, but not   10400SB0618sam001- 8 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    limited to, accounts of earnings and expenses and any 2    distribution, payment, or other distribution of earnings 3    or assets, and any other forms, records, and memoranda 4    which in the judgment of the commission may be necessary 5    or appropriate to carry out any of the provisions of this 6    Act, including, but not limited to, such forms, records, 7    and memoranda as will readily and accurately disclose at 8    all times the beneficial ownership of such retail licensed 9    business. The accounts, forms, records, and memoranda 10    shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection 11    by authorized representatives of the State Commission or 12    by any local liquor control commissioner or his or her 13    authorized representative. The commission may, from time 14    to time, alter, amend, or repeal, in whole or in part, any 15    uniform system of accounts, or the form and manner of 16    keeping accounts. 17        (8) In the conduct of any hearing authorized to be 18    held by the State Commission, to appoint, at the 19    commission's discretion, hearing officers to conduct 20    hearings involving complex issues or issues that will 21    require a protracted period of time to resolve, to 22    examine, or cause to be examined, under oath, any 23    licensee, and to examine or cause to be examined the books 24    and records of such licensee; to hear testimony and take 25    proof material for its information in the discharge of its 26    duties hereunder; to administer or cause to be   10400SB0618sam001- 9 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    administered oaths; for any such purpose to issue subpoena 2    or subpoenas to require the attendance of witnesses and 3    the production of books, which shall be effective in any 4    part of this State, and to adopt rules to implement its 5    powers under this paragraph (8). 6        Any circuit court may, by order duly entered, require 7    the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant 8    books subpoenaed by the State Commission and the court may 9    compel obedience to its order by proceedings for contempt. 10        (9) To investigate the administration of laws in 11    relation to alcoholic liquors in this and other states and 12    any foreign countries, and to recommend from time to time 13    to the Governor and through him or her to the legislature 14    of this State, such amendments to this Act, if any, as it 15    may think desirable and as will serve to further the 16    general broad purposes contained in Section 1-2 hereof. 17        (10) To adopt such rules and regulations consistent 18    with the provisions of this Act which shall be necessary 19    for the control, sale, or disposition of alcoholic liquor 20    damaged as a result of an accident, wreck, flood, fire, or 21    other similar occurrence. 22        (11) To develop industry educational programs related 23    to responsible serving and selling, particularly in the 24    areas of overserving consumers and illegal underage 25    purchasing and consumption of alcoholic beverages. 26        (11.1) To license persons providing education and   10400SB0618sam001- 10 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    training to alcohol beverage sellers and servers for 2    mandatory and non-mandatory training under the Beverage 3    Alcohol Sellers and Servers Education and Training 4    (BASSET) programs and to develop and administer a public 5    awareness program in Illinois to reduce or eliminate the 6    illegal purchase and consumption of alcoholic beverage 7    products by persons under the age of 21.

As part of its report, the State 20    Commission shall provide all of the following information:21            (A) The amount of State excise and sales tax 22        revenues generated.23            (B) The amount of licensing fees received.24            (C) The number of cases of wine shipped from 25        inside and outside of this State directly to residents 26        of this State.  10400SB0618sam001- 11 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1            (D) The number of alcohol compliance operations 2        conducted.3            (E) The number of winery shipper's licenses 4        issued.5            (F) The number of each of the following: reported 6        violations; cease and desist notices issued by the 7        Commission; notices of violations issued by the 8        Commission and to the Department of Revenue; and 9        notices and complaints of violations to law 10        enforcement officials, including, without limitation, 11        the Illinois Attorney General and the U.S. Department 12        of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade 13        Bureau.14        (15) As a means to reduce the underage consumption of 15    alcoholic liquors, the State Commission shall conduct 16    alcohol compliance operations to investigate whether 17    businesses that are soliciting, selling, and shipping wine 18    from inside or outside of this State directly to residents 19    of this State are licensed by this State or are selling or 20    attempting to sell wine to persons under 21 years of age in 21    violation of this Act.22        (16) The State Commission shall, in addition to 23    notifying any appropriate law enforcement agency, submit 24    notices of complaints or violations of Sections 6-29 and 25    6-29.1 by persons who do not hold a winery shipper's 26    license under this Act to the Illinois Attorney General   10400SB0618sam001- 12 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    and to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Alcohol and 2    Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.3        (17)(A) A person licensed to make wine under the laws 4    of another state who has a winery shipper's license under 5    this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of 6    wine or a person who has a first-class or second-class 7    wine manufacturer's license, a first-class or second-class 8    wine-maker's license, or a limited wine manufacturer's 9    license under this Act and annually produces less than 10    25,000 gallons of wine may make application to the 11    Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the 12    sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the exemption 13    holder's wine to retail licensees per year and to sell 14    cider, mead, or both cider and mead to brewers, class 1 15    brewers, class 2 brewers, and class 3 brewers that, 16    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 17    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 18    non-licensees at their breweries.19        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 20    penalty of perjury, such person shall state (1) the date 21    it was established; (2) its volume of production and sales 22    for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to 23    establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 24    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 25    marketing of its wine; and (5) that it will comply with the 26    liquor and revenue laws of the United States, this State,   10400SB0618sam001- 13 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    and any other state where it is licensed.2        (C) The State Commission shall approve the application 3    for a self-distribution exemption if such person: (1) is 4    in compliance with State revenue and liquor laws; (2) is 5    not a member of any affiliated group that produces 6    directly or indirectly more than 25,000 gallons of wine 7    per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 50,000 8    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) will not annually 9    produce for sale more than 25,000 gallons of wine, 930,000 10    gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; and (4) 11    will not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its wine 12    to retail licensees.13        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 14    annually certify to the State Commission its production of 15    wine in the previous 12 months and its anticipated 16    production and sales for the next 12 months. The State 17    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 18    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 19    that the exemption holder has made a material 20    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 21    or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000 22    gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 23    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 24    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 25    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 26    spirits.  10400SB0618sam001- 14 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 2    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 3    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 4    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 5    production and sales information of a self-distribution 6    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 7    such information to any person.8        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 9    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 10    this Section and this Act.11        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 12    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 13    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 14    licensed Illinois distributor.15        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 16    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 17    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 18    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 19    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 20    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 21    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small 22    for distributor or importing distributor business 23    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 24    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 25    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 26    integrity of the 3-tier system.   10400SB0618sam001- 15 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be 2    either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer 3    and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of 4    beer, may make application to the State Commission for a 5    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 6    than 232,500 gallons per year of the exemption holder's 7    beer to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, 8    and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of 9    Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or any 10    combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries.11        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 12    penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall 13    state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of 14    beer manufactured and sold for each year since its 15    establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor 16    relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 17    necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) 18    that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and 19    revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any 20    other state where it is licensed.21        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 22    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 23    action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 24    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 25    if the class 1 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with 26    the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is   10400SB0618sam001- 16 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    not a member of any affiliated group that manufactures, 2    directly or indirectly, more than 930,000 gallons of beer 3    per annum, 25,000 gallons of wine per annum, or 50,000 4    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) shall not annually 5    manufacture for sale more than 930,000 gallons of beer, 6    25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; (4) 7    shall not annually sell more than 232,500 gallons of its 8    beer to retail licensees and class 3 brewers and to 9    brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, 10    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 11    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 12    non-licensees at their breweries; and (5) has relinquished 13    any brew pub license held by the licensee, including any 14    ownership interest it held in the licensed brew pub.15        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 16    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 17    of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated 18    manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months. The 19    State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 20    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 21    that the exemption holder has made a material 22    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 23    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 24    manufacture of 930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of 25    wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits in any calendar year or 26    became part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than   10400SB0618sam001- 17 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 2    gallons of spirits.3        (E) The State Commission shall issue rules and 4    regulations governing self-distribution exemptions 5    consistent with this Act.6        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (18) shall prohibit a 7    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 8    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 9    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 10    If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a 11    distribution agreement and has assigned distribution 12    rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then 13    the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution 14    rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a 15    reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.16        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (18) to promote 17    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 18    that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 19    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 20    exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and 21    allow such smaller manufacturers of beer access to the 22    marketplace in order to develop a customer base without 23    impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system. 24        (19)(A) A class 1 craft distiller licensee or a 25    non-resident dealer who manufactures less than 50,000 26    gallons of distilled spirits per year may make application   10400SB0618sam001- 18 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    to the State Commission for a self-distribution exemption 2    to allow the sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the 3    exemption holder's spirits to retail licensees per year. 4        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 5    penalty of perjury, the class 1 craft distiller licensee 6    or non-resident dealer shall state (1) the date it was 7    established; (2) its volume of spirits manufactured and 8    sold for each year since its establishment; (3) its 9    efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 10    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 11    marketing of its spirits; and (5) that it will comply with 12    the alcoholic beverage and revenue laws of the United 13    States, this State, and any other state where it is 14    licensed. 15        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 16    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 17    action by the State Commission.

The State Commission may also 25    prescribe the forms of accounts to be kept by all retail 26    licensees having more than 4 employees, including, but not   10400SB0618sam001- 8 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    limited to, accounts of earnings and expenses and any 2    distribution, payment, or other distribution of earnings 3    or assets, and any other forms, records, and memoranda 4    which in the judgment of the commission may be necessary 5    or appropriate to carry out any of the provisions of this 6    Act, including, but not limited to, such forms, records, 7    and memoranda as will readily and accurately disclose at 8    all times the beneficial ownership of such retail licensed 9    business.

As part of its report, the State 20    Commission shall provide all of the following information:21            (A) The amount of State excise and sales tax 22        revenues generated.23            (B) The amount of licensing fees received.24            (C) The number of cases of wine shipped from 25        inside and outside of this State directly to residents 26        of this State.  10400SB0618sam001- 11 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1            (D) The number of alcohol compliance operations 2        conducted.3            (E) The number of winery shipper's licenses 4        issued.5            (F) The number of each of the following: reported 6        violations; cease and desist notices issued by the 7        Commission; notices of violations issued by the 8        Commission and to the Department of Revenue; and 9        notices and complaints of violations to law 10        enforcement officials, including, without limitation, 11        the Illinois Attorney General and the U.S. Department 12        of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade 13        Bureau.14        (15) As a means to reduce the underage consumption of 15    alcoholic liquors, the State Commission shall conduct 16    alcohol compliance operations to investigate whether 17    businesses that are soliciting, selling, and shipping wine 18    from inside or outside of this State directly to residents 19    of this State are licensed by this State or are selling or 20    attempting to sell wine to persons under 21 years of age in 21    violation of this Act.22        (16) The State Commission shall, in addition to 23    notifying any appropriate law enforcement agency, submit 24    notices of complaints or violations of Sections 6-29 and 25    6-29.1 by persons who do not hold a winery shipper's 26    license under this Act to the Illinois Attorney General   10400SB0618sam001- 12 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    and to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Alcohol and 2    Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.3        (17)(A) A person licensed to make wine under the laws 4    of another state who has a winery shipper's license under 5    this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of 6    wine or a person who has a first-class or second-class 7    wine manufacturer's license, a first-class or second-class 8    wine-maker's license, or a limited wine manufacturer's 9    license under this Act and annually produces less than 10    25,000 gallons of wine may make application to the 11    Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the 12    sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the exemption 13    holder's wine to retail licensees per year and to sell 14    cider, mead, or both cider and mead to brewers, class 1 15    brewers, class 2 brewers, and class 3 brewers that, 16    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 17    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 18    non-licensees at their breweries.19        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 20    penalty of perjury, such person shall state (1) the date 21    it was established; (2) its volume of production and sales 22    for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to 23    establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 24    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 25    marketing of its wine; and (5) that it will comply with the 26    liquor and revenue laws of the United States, this State,   10400SB0618sam001- 13 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    and any other state where it is licensed.2        (C) The State Commission shall approve the application 3    for a self-distribution exemption if such person: (1) is 4    in compliance with State revenue and liquor laws; (2) is 5    not a member of any affiliated group that produces 6    directly or indirectly more than 25,000 gallons of wine 7    per annum, 930,000 gallons of beer per annum, or 50,000 8    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) will not annually 9    produce for sale more than 25,000 gallons of wine, 930,000 10    gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; and (4) 11    will not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its wine 12    to retail licensees.13        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 14    annually certify to the State Commission its production of 15    wine in the previous 12 months and its anticipated 16    production and sales for the next 12 months. The State 17    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 18    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 19    that the exemption holder has made a material 20    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 21    or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000 22    gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 23    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 24    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 25    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 26    spirits.  10400SB0618sam001- 14 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 2    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 3    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 4    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 5    production and sales information of a self-distribution 6    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 7    such information to any person.8        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 9    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 10    this Section and this Act.11        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 12    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 13    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 14    licensed Illinois distributor.15        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 16    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 17    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 18    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 19    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 20    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 21    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small 22    for distributor or importing distributor business 23    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 24    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 25    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 26    integrity of the 3-tier system.   10400SB0618sam001- 15 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be 2    either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer 3    and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of 4    beer, may make application to the State Commission for a 5    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 6    than 232,500 gallons per year of the exemption holder's 7    beer to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, 8    and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of 9    Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or any 10    combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries.11        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 12    penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall 13    state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of 14    beer manufactured and sold for each year since its 15    establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor 16    relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 17    necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) 18    that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and 19    revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any 20    other state where it is licensed.21        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 22    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 23    action by the State Commission.

The 19    State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 20    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 21    that the exemption holder has made a material 22    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 23    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 24    manufacture of 930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of 25    wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits in any calendar year or 26    became part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than   10400SB0618sam001- 17 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    930,000 gallons of beer, 25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 2    gallons of spirits.3        (E) The State Commission shall issue rules and 4    regulations governing self-distribution exemptions 5    consistent with this Act.6        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (18) shall prohibit a 7    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 8    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 9    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 10    If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a 11    distribution agreement and has assigned distribution 12    rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then 13    the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution 14    rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a 15    reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.16        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (18) to promote 17    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 18    that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 19    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 20    exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and 21    allow such smaller manufacturers of beer access to the 22    marketplace in order to develop a customer base without 23    impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system. 24        (19)(A) A class 1 craft distiller licensee or a 25    non-resident dealer who manufactures less than 50,000 26    gallons of distilled spirits per year may make application   10400SB0618sam001- 18 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    to the State Commission for a self-distribution exemption 2    to allow the sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the 3    exemption holder's spirits to retail licensees per year. 4        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 5    penalty of perjury, the class 1 craft distiller licensee 6    or non-resident dealer shall state (1) the date it was 7    established; (2) its volume of spirits manufactured and 8    sold for each year since its establishment; (3) its 9    efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a 10    self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the 11    marketing of its spirits; and (5) that it will comply with 12    the alcoholic beverage and revenue laws of the United 13    States, this State, and any other state where it is 14    licensed. 15        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the 16    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 17    action by the State Commission.

The State Commission may fine, suspend, or 7    revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it 8    finds that the exemption holder has made a material 9    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 10    or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the 11    manufacture of 50,000 gallons of spirits, 930,000 gallons 12    of beer, or 25,000 gallons of wine in any calendar year, or 13    has become part of an affiliated group manufacturing more 14    than 50,000 gallons of spirits, 930,000 gallons of beer, 15    or 25,000 gallons of wine. 16        (E) The State Commission shall adopt rules governing 17    self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act. 18        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (19) shall prohibit a 19    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 20    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 21    licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. 22        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (19) to promote 23    and continue orderly markets.

The State Commission shall 8    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 9    if the class 3 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with 10    the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is 11    not a member of any affiliated group that manufacturers, 12    directly or indirectly, more than 465,000 gallons of beer 13    per annum; (3) shall not annually manufacture for sale 14    more than 465,000 gallons of beer or more than 155,000 15    gallons at any single brewery premises; and (4) shall not 16    annually sell more than 46,500 6,200 gallons of beer from 17    each in-state or out-of-state class 3 brewery premises, 18    and shall not exceed 139,500 18,600 gallons annually in 19    the aggregate, to retail licensees and class 3 brewers and 20    to brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, 21    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 22    sell beer, cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees 23    at their breweries.24        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 25    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 26    of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated   10400SB0618sam001- 22 -LRB104 06890 RPS 26802 a1    manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months.
