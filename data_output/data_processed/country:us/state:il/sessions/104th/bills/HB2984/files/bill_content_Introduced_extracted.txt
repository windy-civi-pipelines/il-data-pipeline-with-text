Defines "neural data" as information that is generated by the measurement of activity of an individual's central or peripheral nervous system, and that is not inferred from non-neural information.LRB104 09768 JRC 19834 b  A BILL FOR HB2984LRB104 09768 JRC 19834 b1    AN ACT concerning civil law. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5.

Biometric identifiers do not include writing 11samples, written signatures, photographs, human biological 12samples used for valid scientific testing or screening, 13demographic data, tattoo descriptions, or physical 14descriptions such as height, weight, hair color, or eye color. 15Biometric identifiers do not include donated organs, tissues, 16or parts as defined in the Illinois Anatomical Gift Act or 17blood or serum stored on behalf of recipients or potential 18recipients of living or cadaveric transplants and obtained or 19stored by a federally designated organ procurement agency. 20Biometric identifiers do not include biological materials 21regulated under the Genetic Information Privacy Act.
