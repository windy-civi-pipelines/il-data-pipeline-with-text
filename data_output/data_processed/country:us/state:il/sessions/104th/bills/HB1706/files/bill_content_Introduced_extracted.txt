The Nurse Practice Act is amended by adding 5Article 85 as follows: 6    (225 ILCS 65/Art. 85 heading new)7ARTICLE 85. NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT 8    (225 ILCS 65/85-5 new)9    Sec. 85-5. Nurse Licensure Compact. The State of Illinois 10ratifies and approves the following Compact: 11ARTICLE I 12Findings and Declaration of Purpose 13    a. The party states find that:14        1. The health and safety of the public are affected by 15    the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of 16    enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure 17    laws;18        2. Violations of nurse licensure and other laws 19    regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or 20    harm to the public;  HB1706- 2 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1        3. The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of 2    advanced communication technologies as part of our 3    nation's health care delivery system require greater 4    coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of 5    nurse licensure and regulation;6        4. New practice modalities and technology make 7    compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws 8    difficult and complex;9        5. The current system of duplicative licensure for 10    nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and 11    redundant for both nurses and states; and12        6. Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements 13    throughout the states promotes public safety and public 14    health benefits. 15    b. The general purposes of this Compact are to: 16        1. Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect 17    the public's health and safety;18        2. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party 19    states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;20        3. Facilitate the exchange of information between 21    party states in the areas of nurse regulation, 22    investigation and adverse actions;23        4. Promote compliance with the laws governing the 24    practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;25        5. Invest all party states with the authority to hold 26    a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in   HB1706- 3 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1    the state in which the patient is located at the time care 2    is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state 3    licenses; 4        6. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and 5    issuance of nurse licenses; and6        7. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by 7    nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.  8ARTICLE II 9Definitions 10    As used in this Compact:11        a.

The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a 22    change in primary state of residence.23        2. A multistate license shall not be issued by the new 24    home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence   HB1706- 11 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1    of a change in primary state of residence to the new home 2    state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain 3    a multistate license from the new home state.4    d. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving 5from a party state to a non-party state, the multistate 6license issued by the prior home state will convert to a 7single-state license, valid only in the former home state.  8ARTICLE V 9Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing 10Boards 11    a.

Only the home state shall have the power to take 16        adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the 17        home state.18            ii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the 19        home state licensing board shall give the same 20        priority and effect to reported conduct received from 21        a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred 22        within the home state. In so doing, the home state 23        shall apply its own state laws to determine 24        appropriate action.  HB1706- 12 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1        2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an 2    encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that 3    party state.4        3.

The issuing authority shall pay any 23    witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees 24    required by the service statutes of the state in which the 25    witnesses or evidence are located.26        5. Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure   HB1706- 13 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1    applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based 2    information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 3    criminal background checks, receive the results of the 4    Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal 5    background checks and use the results in making licensure 6    decisions.7        6. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from 8    the affected nurse the costs of investigations and 9    disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action 10    taken against that nurse.11        7. Take adverse action based on the factual findings 12    of the remote state, provided that the licensing board 13    follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.14    b. If adverse action is taken by the home state against a 15nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure 16privilege to practice in all other party states shall be 17deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the 18multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that 19impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license 20shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate 21licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during 22the pendency of the order.23    c. Nothing in this Compact shall override a party state's 24decision that participation in an alternative program may be 25used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board 26shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the   HB1706- 14 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the 2nurse's participation in an alternative program.  3ARTICLE VI 4Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of 5Information 6    a. All party states shall participate in a coordinated 7licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses 8(RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs). 9This system will include information on the licensure and 10disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party 11states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and 12enforcement efforts.13    b. The Commission, in consultation with the administrator 14of the coordinated licensure information system, shall 15formulate necessary and proper procedures for the 16identification, collection and exchange of information under 17this Compact.18    c.

Current significant investigative information and 2participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative 3programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated 4licensure information system only to party state licensing 5boards.6    e. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party 7state licensing boards contributing information to the 8coordinated licensure information system may designate 9information that may not be shared with non-party states or 10disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express 11permission of the contributing state.12    f.

Default, Technical Assistance and Termination22        1. If the Commission determines that a party state has 23    defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 24    responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated   HB1706- 30 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1    rules, the Commission shall:2            i.

Termination of membership in this Compact shall be 17    imposed only after all other means of securing compliance 18    have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or 19    terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor 20    of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of 21    the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the 22    party states.23        4.

The decision of a majority of the arbitrators 4        shall be final and binding.5    d. Enforcement6        1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its 7    discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this 8    Compact.9        2.

The relief 15    sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In 16    the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the 17    prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 18    litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.19        3.

The Nurse Practice Act is amended by adding 5Article 85 as follows: 6    (225 ILCS 65/Art. 85 heading new)7ARTICLE 85. NURSE LICENSURE COMPACT 8    (225 ILCS 65/85-5 new)9    Sec. 85-5. Nurse Licensure Compact. The State of Illinois 10ratifies and approves the following Compact: 11ARTICLE I 12Findings and Declaration of Purpose 13    a. The party states find that:14        1. The health and safety of the public are affected by 15    the degree of compliance with and the effectiveness of 16    enforcement activities related to state nurse licensure 17    laws;18        2. Violations of nurse licensure and other laws 19    regulating the practice of nursing may result in injury or 20    harm to the public;  HB1706- 2 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1        3. The expanded mobility of nurses and the use of 2    advanced communication technologies as part of our 3    nation's health care delivery system require greater 4    coordination and cooperation among states in the areas of 5    nurse licensure and regulation;6        4. New practice modalities and technology make 7    compliance with individual state nurse licensure laws 8    difficult and complex;9        5. The current system of duplicative licensure for 10    nurses practicing in multiple states is cumbersome and 11    redundant for both nurses and states; and12        6. Uniformity of nurse licensure requirements 13    throughout the states promotes public safety and public 14    health benefits. 15    b. The general purposes of this Compact are to: 16        1. Facilitate the states' responsibility to protect 17    the public's health and safety;18        2. Ensure and encourage the cooperation of party 19    states in the areas of nurse licensure and regulation;20        3. Facilitate the exchange of information between 21    party states in the areas of nurse regulation, 22    investigation and adverse actions;23        4. Promote compliance with the laws governing the 24    practice of nursing in each jurisdiction;25        5. Invest all party states with the authority to hold 26    a nurse accountable for meeting all state practice laws in   HB1706- 3 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1    the state in which the patient is located at the time care 2    is rendered through the mutual recognition of party state 3    licenses; 4        6. Decrease redundancies in the consideration and 5    issuance of nurse licenses; and6        7. Provide opportunities for interstate practice by 7    nurses who meet uniform licensure requirements.  8ARTICLE II 9Definitions 10    As used in this Compact:11        a.

"Current significant investigative information" 6    means:7            1. Investigative information that a licensing 8        board, after a preliminary inquiry that includes 9        notification and an opportunity for the nurse to 10        respond, if required by state law, has reason to 11        believe is not groundless and, if proved true, would 12        indicate more than a minor infraction; or13            2.

All party states shall be authorized, in accordance 10with existing state due process law, to take adverse action 11against a nurse's multistate licensure privilege such as 12revocation, suspension, probation or any other action that 13affects a nurse's authorization to practice under a multistate 14licensure privilege, including cease and desist actions. If a 15party state takes such action, it shall promptly notify the 16administrator of the coordinated licensure information system. 17The administrator of the coordinated licensure information 18system shall promptly notify the home state of any such 19actions by remote states.20    e. A nurse practicing in a party state must comply with the 21state practice laws of the state in which the client is located 22at the time service is provided. The practice of nursing is not 23limited to patient care, but shall include all nursing 24practice as defined by the state practice laws of the party 25state in which the client is located. The practice of nursing 26in a party state under a multistate licensure privilege will   HB1706- 9 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1subject a nurse to the jurisdiction of the licensing board, 2the courts and the laws of the party state in which the client 3is located at the time service is provided.4    f. Individuals not residing in a party state shall 5continue to be able to apply for a party state's single-state 6license as provided under the laws of each party state. 7However, the single-state license granted to these individuals 8will not be recognized as granting the privilege to practice 9nursing in any other party state. Nothing in this Compact 10shall affect the requirements established by a party state for 11the issuance of a single-state license.12    g. Any nurse holding a home state multistate license, on 13the effective date of this Compact, may retain and renew the 14multistate license issued by the nurse's then-current home 15state, provided that:16        1. A nurse, who changes primary state of residence 17    after this Compact's effective date, must meet all 18    applicable Article III.c. requirements to obtain a 19    multistate license from a new home state.20        2. A nurse who fails to satisfy the multistate 21    licensure requirements in Article III.c. due to a 22    disqualifying event occurring after this Compact's 23    effective date shall be ineligible to retain or renew a 24    multistate license, and the nurse's multistate license 25    shall be revoked or deactivated in accordance with 26    applicable rules adopted by the Interstate Commission of   HB1706- 10 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1    Nurse Licensure Compact Administrators ("Commission").  2ARTICLE IV 3Applications for Licensure in a Party State 4    a. Upon application for a multistate license, the 5licensing board in the issuing party state shall ascertain, 6through the coordinated licensure information system, whether 7the applicant has ever held, or is the holder of, a license 8issued by any other state, whether there are any encumbrances 9on any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the 10applicant, whether any adverse action has been taken against 11any license or multistate licensure privilege held by the 12applicant and whether the applicant is currently participating 13in an alternative program.14    b. A nurse may hold a multistate license, issued by the 15home state, in only one party state at a time.16    c. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving 17between two party states, the nurse must apply for licensure 18in the new home state, and the multistate license issued by the 19prior home state will be deactivated in accordance with 20applicable rules adopted by the Commission.21        1. The nurse may apply for licensure in advance of a 22    change in primary state of residence.23        2. A multistate license shall not be issued by the new 24    home state until the nurse provides satisfactory evidence   HB1706- 11 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1    of a change in primary state of residence to the new home 2    state and satisfies all applicable requirements to obtain 3    a multistate license from the new home state.4    d. If a nurse changes primary state of residence by moving 5from a party state to a non-party state, the multistate 6license issued by the prior home state will convert to a 7single-state license, valid only in the former home state.  8ARTICLE V 9Additional Authorities Invested in Party State Licensing 10Boards 11    a. In addition to the other powers conferred by state law, 12a licensing board shall have the authority to: 13        1. Take adverse action against a nurse's multistate 14    licensure privilege to practice within that party state.15            i. Only the home state shall have the power to take 16        adverse action against a nurse's license issued by the 17        home state.18            ii. For purposes of taking adverse action, the 19        home state licensing board shall give the same 20        priority and effect to reported conduct received from 21        a remote state as it would if such conduct had occurred 22        within the home state. In so doing, the home state 23        shall apply its own state laws to determine 24        appropriate action.  HB1706- 12 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1        2. Issue cease and desist orders or impose an 2    encumbrance on a nurse's authority to practice within that 3    party state.4        3. Complete any pending investigations of a nurse who 5    changes primary state of residence during the course of 6    such investigations. The licensing board shall also have 7    the authority to take appropriate action(s) and shall 8    promptly report the conclusions of such investigations to 9    the administrator of the coordinated licensure information 10    system. The administrator of the coordinated licensure 11    information system shall promptly notify the new home 12    state of any such actions.13        4. Issue subpoenas for both hearings and 14    investigations that require the attendance and testimony 15    of witnesses, as well as, the production of evidence. 16    Subpoenas issued by a licensing board in a party state for 17    the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the 18    production of evidence from another party state shall be 19    enforced in the latter state by any court of competent 20    jurisdiction, according to the practice and procedure of 21    that court applicable to subpoenas issued in proceedings 22    pending before it. The issuing authority shall pay any 23    witness fees, travel expenses, mileage and other fees 24    required by the service statutes of the state in which the 25    witnesses or evidence are located.26        5. Obtain and submit, for each nurse licensure   HB1706- 13 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1    applicant, fingerprint or other biometric-based 2    information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 3    criminal background checks, receive the results of the 4    Federal Bureau of Investigation record search on criminal 5    background checks and use the results in making licensure 6    decisions.7        6. If otherwise permitted by state law, recover from 8    the affected nurse the costs of investigations and 9    disposition of cases resulting from any adverse action 10    taken against that nurse.11        7. Take adverse action based on the factual findings 12    of the remote state, provided that the licensing board 13    follows its own procedures for taking such adverse action.14    b. If adverse action is taken by the home state against a 15nurse's multistate license, the nurse's multistate licensure 16privilege to practice in all other party states shall be 17deactivated until all encumbrances have been removed from the 18multistate license. All home state disciplinary orders that 19impose adverse action against a nurse's multistate license 20shall include a statement that the nurse's multistate 21licensure privilege is deactivated in all party states during 22the pendency of the order.23    c. Nothing in this Compact shall override a party state's 24decision that participation in an alternative program may be 25used in lieu of adverse action. The home state licensing board 26shall deactivate the multistate licensure privilege under the   HB1706- 14 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1multistate license of any nurse for the duration of the 2nurse's participation in an alternative program.  3ARTICLE VI 4Coordinated Licensure Information System and Exchange of 5Information 6    a. All party states shall participate in a coordinated 7licensure information system of all licensed registered nurses 8(RNs) and licensed practical/vocational nurses (LPNs/VNs). 9This system will include information on the licensure and 10disciplinary history of each nurse, as submitted by party 11states, to assist in the coordination of nurse licensure and 12enforcement efforts.13    b. The Commission, in consultation with the administrator 14of the coordinated licensure information system, shall 15formulate necessary and proper procedures for the 16identification, collection and exchange of information under 17this Compact.18    c. All licensing boards shall promptly report to the 19coordinated licensure information system any adverse action, 20any current significant investigative information, denials of 21applications (with the reasons for such denials) and nurse 22participation in alternative programs known to the licensing 23board regardless of whether such participation is deemed 24nonpublic or confidential under state law.  HB1706- 15 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1    d. Current significant investigative information and 2participation in nonpublic or confidential alternative 3programs shall be transmitted through the coordinated 4licensure information system only to party state licensing 5boards.6    e. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all party 7state licensing boards contributing information to the 8coordinated licensure information system may designate 9information that may not be shared with non-party states or 10disclosed to other entities or individuals without the express 11permission of the contributing state.12    f. Any personally identifiable information obtained from 13the coordinated licensure information system by a party state 14licensing board shall not be shared with non-party states or 15disclosed to other entities or individuals except to the 16extent permitted by the laws of the party state contributing 17the information.18    g. Any information contributed to the coordinated 19licensure information system that is subsequently required to 20be expunged by the laws of the party state contributing that 21information shall also be expunged from the coordinated 22licensure information system.23    h. The Compact administrator of each party state shall 24furnish a uniform data set to the Compact administrator of 25each other party state, which shall include, at a minimum:26        1. Identifying information;  HB1706- 16 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1        2. Licensure data;2        3. Information related to alternative program 3    participation; and4        4.

The party states hereby create and establish a joint 14public entity known as the Interstate Commission of Nurse 15Licensure Compact Administrators.16        1. The Commission is an instrumentality of the party 17    states.18        2. Venue is proper, and judicial proceedings by or 19    against the Commission shall be brought solely and 20    exclusively, in a court of competent jurisdiction where 21    the principal office of the Commission is located. The 22    Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to 23    the extent it adopts or consents to participate in 24    alternative dispute resolution proceedings.  HB1706- 17 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1        3.

Each party state shall enforce this Compact and 11    take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate 12    this Compact's purposes and intent.13        2. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 14    of process in any proceeding that may affect the powers, 15    responsibilities or actions of the Commission, and shall 16    have standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all 17    purposes. Failure to provide service of process in such 18    proceeding to the Commission shall render a judgment or 19    order void as to the Commission, this Compact or 20    promulgated rules.21    b. Default, Technical Assistance and Termination22        1. If the Commission determines that a party state has 23    defaulted in the performance of its obligations or 24    responsibilities under this Compact or the promulgated   HB1706- 30 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1    rules, the Commission shall:2            i. Provide written notice to the defaulting state 3        and other party states of the nature of the default, 4        the proposed means of curing the default or any other 5        action to be taken by the Commission; and6            ii. Provide remedial training and specific 7        technical assistance regarding the default.8        2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the 9    defaulting state's membership in this Compact may be 10    terminated upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the 11    administrators, and all rights, privileges and benefits 12    conferred by this Compact may be terminated on the 13    effective date of termination. A cure of the default does 14    not relieve the offending state of obligations or 15    liabilities incurred during the period of default.16        3. Termination of membership in this Compact shall be 17    imposed only after all other means of securing compliance 18    have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or 19    terminate shall be given by the Commission to the governor 20    of the defaulting state and to the executive officer of 21    the defaulting state's licensing board and each of the 22    party states.23        4. A state whose membership in this Compact has been 24    terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations 25    and liabilities incurred through the effective date of 26    termination, including obligations that extend beyond the   HB1706- 31 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1    effective date of termination.2        5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to 3    a state that is found to be in default or whose membership 4    in this Compact has been terminated unless agreed upon in 5    writing between the Commission and the defaulting state.6        6. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the 7    Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the 8    District of Columbia or the federal district in which the 9    Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party 10    shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including 11    reasonable attorneys' fees.12    c. Dispute Resolution13        1. Upon request by a party state, the Commission shall 14    attempt to resolve disputes related to the Compact that 15    arise among party states and between party and non-party 16    states.17        2. The Commission shall promulgate a rule providing 18    for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for 19    disputes, as appropriate.20        3. In the event the Commission cannot resolve disputes 21    among party states arising under this Compact:22            i. The party states may submit the issues in 23        dispute to an arbitration panel, which will be 24        comprised of individuals appointed by the Compact 25        administrator in each of the affected party states and 26        an individual mutually agreed upon by the Compact   HB1706- 32 -LRB104 07287 AAS 17326 b1        administrators of all the party states involved in the 2        dispute.3            ii. The decision of a majority of the arbitrators 4        shall be final and binding.5    d. Enforcement6        1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its 7    discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this 8    Compact.9        2. By majority vote, the Commission may initiate legal 10    action in the U.S. District Court for the District of 11    Columbia or the federal district in which the Commission 12    has its principal offices against a party state that is in 13    default to enforce compliance with the provisions of this 14    Compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief 15    sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In 16    the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the 17    prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 18    litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.19        3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive 20    remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any 21    other remedies available under federal or state law.  22ARTICLE X 23Effective Date, Withdrawal and Amendment 24    a.
