If the unadjusted percentage change 22        in the consumer price index-u for a 12-month period 23        ending in September is zero or, when compared with the 24        preceding period, decreases, then the annuity shall 25        not be increased.26            For the purposes of this Section, "consumer price   SB1187- 9 -LRB104 07434 RPS 17475 b1        index-u" means the index published by the Bureau of 2        Labor Statistics of the United States Department of 3        Labor that measures the average change in prices of 4        goods and services purchased by all urban consumers, 5        United States city average, all items, 1982-84 = 100. 6        The new amount resulting from each annual adjustment 7        shall be determined by the Public Pension Division of 8        the Department of Insurance and made available to the 9        boards of the pension funds.10            (F) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this 11        paragraph (1), for a qualified surviving spouse who is 12        entitled to a Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity under 13        subdivision (A), (B), (C), or (D) of this paragraph 14        (1), that Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity shall not 15        be less than the amount of the minimum widow's annuity 16        established from time to time under Section 5-167.4.17        (2) Surviving children of a deceased policeman subject 18    to this Section who would otherwise meet the eligibility 19    requirements for a child's annuity set forth in Sections 20    5-151 and 5-152 shall be deemed qualified to receive a 21    Tier 2 child's annuity under this subsection (c), which 22    shall be in lieu of, but in the same amount and paid in the 23    same manner as, the child's annuity provided under those 24    Sections; except that any salary used for computing a Tier 25    2 child's annuity shall be subject to the Tier 2 salary cap 26    provided under subsection (b) of this Section. For   SB1187- 10 -LRB104 07434 RPS 17475 b1    purposes of determining any pro rata reduction in child's 2    annuities under this subsection (c), references in Section 3    5-152 to the combined annuities of the family shall be 4    deemed to refer to the combined Tier 2 surviving spouse's 5    annuity, if any, and the Tier 2 child's annuities payable 6    under this subsection (c).7        (3) Surviving parents of a deceased policeman subject 8    to this Section who would otherwise meet the eligibility 9    requirements for a parent's annuity set forth in Section 10    5-152 shall be deemed qualified to receive a Tier 2 11    parent's annuity under this subsection (c), which shall be 12    in lieu of, but in the same amount and paid in the same 13    manner as, the parent's annuity provided under Section 14    5-152.1; except that any salary used for computing a Tier 15    2 parent's annuity shall be subject to the Tier 2 salary 16    cap provided under subsection (b) of this Section. For the 17    purposes of this Section, a reference to "annuity" in 18    Section 5-152.1 includes: (i) in the context of a widow, a 19    Tier 2 surviving spouse's annuity and (ii) in the context 20    of a child, a Tier 2 child's annuity.21    Notwithstanding Section 1-103.1, the changes made to this 22subsection by this amendatory Act of the 104th General 23Assembly apply without regard to whether the deceased 24policeman was in service on or after the effective date of this 25amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly.
