Award of State contracts. 16    (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), not less than 1730% of the total dollar amount of State contracts, as defined 18by the Secretary of the Council and approved by the Council, 19shall be established as an aspirational goal to be awarded to 20businesses owned by minorities, women, and persons with 21disabilities; provided, however, that of the total amount of 22all State contracts awarded to businesses owned by minorities, 23women, and persons with disabilities pursuant to this Section, 24contracts representing at least 16% shall be awarded to 25businesses owned by minorities, contracts representing at   SB2653- 3 -LRB104 09811 HLH 22568 b1least 10% shall be awarded to women-owned businesses, and 2contracts representing at least 4% shall be awarded to 3businesses owned by persons with disabilities.4    (a-5) In addition to the aspirational goals in awarding 5State contracts set under subsection (a), the Commission shall 6by rule further establish targeted efforts to encourage the 7participation of businesses owned by minorities, women, and 8persons with disabilities on State contracts. Such efforts 9shall include, but not be limited to, further concerted 10outreach efforts to businesses owned by minorities, women, and 11persons with disabilities. 12    The above percentage relates to the total dollar amount of 13State contracts during each State fiscal year, calculated by 14examining independently each type of contract for each agency 15or public institutions of higher education which lets such 16contracts. Only that percentage of arrangements which 17represents the participation of businesses owned by 18minorities, women, and persons with disabilities on such 19contracts shall be included. State contracts subject to the 20requirements of this Act shall include the requirement that 21only expenditures to businesses owned by minorities, women, 22and persons with disabilities that perform a commercially 23useful function may be counted toward the goals set forth by 24this Act. Contracts shall include a definition of 25"commercially useful function" that is consistent with 49 CFR 2626.55(c).  SB2653- 4 -LRB104 09811 HLH 22568 b1    (b) Not less than 20% of the total dollar amount of State 2construction contracts is established as an aspirational goal 3to be awarded to businesses owned by minorities, women, and 4persons with disabilities; provided that, contracts 5representing at least 11% of the total dollar amount of State 6construction contracts shall be awarded to businesses owned by 7minorities; contracts representing at least 7% of the total 8dollar amount of State construction contracts shall be awarded 9to women-owned businesses; and contracts representing at least 102% of the total dollar amount of State construction contracts 11shall be awarded to businesses owned by persons with 12disabilities.13    (c) (Blank). 14    (c-5) All goals established under this Section shall be 15contingent upon the results of the most recent disparity study 16conducted by the State. 17    (d) By December 31, 2028, the Commission on Equity and 18Inclusion shall conduct a new social scientific study that 19measures the impact of discrimination on minority and women 20business development in Illinois. By June 30, 2029, the 21Commission shall issue a report of its findings and any 22recommendations on whether to adjust the goals for minority 23and women participation established in this Act. Copies of 24this report and the social scientific study shall be filed 25with the Governor and the General Assembly.

Utilization plans 8are due at the time of bid or offer submission. Failure to 9complete and include a utilization plan, including 10documentation demonstrating good faith efforts when requesting 11a waiver, shall render the bid or offer non-responsive. 12    Except as permitted under this Act or as otherwise 13mandated by federal regulation, a bidder or offeror whose bid 14or offer is accepted and who included in that bid a completed 15utilization plan but who fails to meet the goals set forth in 16the plan shall be notified of the deficiency by the 17contracting agency or public institution of higher education 18and shall be given a period of 10 business calendar days to 19cure the deficiency by contracting with additional 20subcontractors who are certified by the Business Enterprise 21Program or by increasing the work to be performed by 22previously identified vendors certified by the Business 23Enterprise Program.24    Deficiencies that may be cured include, but are not 25limited to: (i) failure to contract with sufficient 26subcontractors that are certified by the Business Enterprise   SB2653- 6 -LRB104 09811 HLH 22568 b1Program to meet the stated contract goals; (ii) failure to 2allocate sufficient work to be performed by previously 3identified subcontractors certified by the Business Enterprise 4Program to meet the stated contract goals; (iii) mistakes in 5the utilization plan, such as scrivener's errors, such as 6transposed numbers; (ii) information submitted in an incorrect 7form or format, and ; (iii) mistakes resulting from failure to 8follow instructions or to identify and adequately document 9good faith efforts taken to comply with the utilization plan; 10or (iv) a proposal to use a firm whose Business Enterprise 11Program certification has lapsed or is not yet recognized. 12Cure is not authorized if the bidder or offeror submits a blank 13utilization plan, a utilization plan that shows a lack of 14reasonable effort to complete the form on time, or a 15utilization plan that states the contract will be 16self-performed, by a non-certified vendor, without showing 17good faith efforts or a request for a waiver. All cure activity 18shall address the deficiencies identified by the purchasing 19agency or public institution of higher education and shall 20require clear documentation, including that of good faith 21efforts, to address those deficiencies. Any increase in cost 22to a contract for the addition of a subcontractor to cure a 23bid's deficiency shall not affect the bid price and shall not 24be used in the request for an exemption under this Act, and, in 25no case, shall an identified subcontractor with a Business 26Enterprise Program certification made under this Act be   SB2653- 7 -LRB104 09811 HLH 22568 b1terminated from a contract without the written consent of the 2State agency or public institution of higher education 3entering into the contract. The purchasing agency or public 4institution of higher education shall make the determination 5whether the cure is adequate.6    Vendors certified with the Business Enterprise Program at 7the time and date submittals are due and who do not submit a 8utilization plan or have utilization plan deficiencies shall 9have 10 business days to submit a utilization plan or to 10correct the utilization plan deficiencies.11    (f) (Blank).12    (g) (Blank). 13    (h) State agencies and public institutions of higher 14education shall notify the Commission on Equity and Inclusion 15of all non-responsive bids or proposals for State contracts 16deemed non-responsive due to deficient utilization plan 17submissions. 18(Source: P.A. 102-29, eff. 6-25-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 19102-1119, eff. 1-23-23; 103-961, eff. 8-9-24.) 20    (30 ILCS 575/7)  (from Ch. 127, par. 132.607)21    (Section scheduled to be repealed on June 30, 2029)22    Sec. 7.
