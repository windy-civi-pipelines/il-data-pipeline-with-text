The legal effectiveness, 16    validity, or enforceability of any contract executed by a 17    consumer shall not be denied solely because of the failure 18    to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent by 19    that consumer in accordance with paragraph (1)(C)(ii).20        (4) Prospective effect. Withdrawal of consent by a 21    consumer shall not affect the legal effectiveness, 22    validity, or enforceability of electronic records provided 23    or made available to that consumer in accordance with 24    paragraph (1) prior to implementation of the consumer's 25    withdrawal of consent. A consumer's withdrawal of consent 26    shall be effective within a reasonable period of time   SB1777 Enrolled- 55 -LRB104 09558 JRC 19621 b1    after receipt of the withdrawal by the provider of the 2    record.

This subsection does not apply to 6    any records that are provided or made available to a 7    consumer who has consented prior to the effective date of 8    this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly to 9    receive the records in electronic form as permitted by any 10    statute, regulation, or other rule of law.11        (6) Oral communications. An oral communication or a 12    recording of an oral communication shall not qualify as an 13    electronic record for purposes of this subsection (c), 14    except as otherwise provided under applicable law. 15(Source: P.A. 94-458, eff. 8-4-05; 95-77, eff. 8-13-07.) 16    Section 30.

The legal effectiveness, 16    validity, or enforceability of any contract executed by a 17    consumer shall not be denied solely because of the failure 18    to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent by 19    that consumer in accordance with paragraph (1)(C)(ii).20        (4) Prospective effect. Withdrawal of consent by a 21    consumer shall not affect the legal effectiveness, 22    validity, or enforceability of electronic records provided 23    or made available to that consumer in accordance with 24    paragraph (1) prior to implementation of the consumer's 25    withdrawal of consent. A consumer's withdrawal of consent 26    shall be effective within a reasonable period of time   SB1777 Enrolled- 55 -LRB104 09558 JRC 19621 b1    after receipt of the withdrawal by the provider of the 2    record. Failure to comply with paragraph (1)(D) may, at 3    the election of the consumer, be treated as a withdrawal 4    of consent for purposes of this paragraph.5        (5) Prior consent. This subsection does not apply to 6    any records that are provided or made available to a 7    consumer who has consented prior to the effective date of 8    this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly to 9    receive the records in electronic form as permitted by any 10    statute, regulation, or other rule of law.11        (6) Oral communications. An oral communication or a 12    recording of an oral communication shall not qualify as an 13    electronic record for purposes of this subsection (c), 14    except as otherwise provided under applicable law. 15(Source: P.A. 94-458, eff. 8-4-05; 95-77, eff. 8-13-07.) 16    Section 30.
