The legal effectiveness, 16    validity, or enforceability of any contract executed by a 17    consumer shall not be denied solely because of the failure 18    to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent by 19    that consumer in accordance with paragraph (1)(C)(ii).20        (4) Prospective effect. Withdrawal of consent by a 21    consumer shall not affect the legal effectiveness, 22    validity, or enforceability of electronic records provided 23    or made available to that consumer in accordance with 24    paragraph (1) prior to implementation of the consumer's 25    withdrawal of consent. A consumer's withdrawal of consent 26    shall be effective within a reasonable period of time   SB1777 Engrossed- 55 -LRB104 09558 JRC 19621 b1    after receipt of the withdrawal by the provider of the 2    record.

This subsection does not apply to 6    any records that are provided or made available to a 7    consumer who has consented prior to the effective date of 8    this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly to 9    receive the records in electronic form as permitted by any 10    statute, regulation, or other rule of law.11        (6) Oral communications. An oral communication or a 12    recording of an oral communication shall not qualify as an 13    electronic record for purposes of this subsection (c), 14    except as otherwise provided under applicable law. 15(Source: P.A. 94-458, eff. 8-4-05; 95-77, eff. 8-13-07.) 16    Section 30.

If a statute, 3    regulation, or other rule of law requires that information 4    relating to a transaction or transactions in or affecting 5    intrastate commerce in this State be provided or made 6    available by a financial institution to a consumer in 7    writing, the use of an electronic record to provide or 8    make available that information satisfies the requirement 9    that the information be in writing if:10            (A) the consumer has affirmatively consented to 11        the use of an electronic record to provide or make 12        available that information and has not withdrawn 13        consent;14            (B) the consumer, prior to consenting, is provided 15        with a clear and conspicuous statement:16                (i) informing the consumer of:17                    (I) any right or option of the consumer to 18                have the record provided or made available on 19                paper or in nonelectronic form, and20                    (II) the right of the consumer to withdraw 21                the consent to have the record provided or 22                made available in an electronic form and of 23                any conditions, consequences (which may 24                include termination of the parties' 25                relationship), or fees in the event of a 26                withdrawal of consent;  SB1777 Engrossed- 52 -LRB104 09558 JRC 19621 b1                (ii) informing the consumer of whether the 2            consent applies:3                    (I) only to the particular transaction 4                that gave rise to the obligation to provide 5                the record, or6                    (II) to identified categories of records 7                that may be provided or made available during 8                the course of the parties' relationship;9                (iii) describing the procedures the consumer 10            must use to withdraw consent, as provided in 11            clause (i), and to update information needed to 12            contact the consumer electronically; and13                (iv) informing the consumer:14                    (I) how, after the consent, the consumer 15                may, upon request, obtain a paper copy of an 16                electronic record, and17                    (II) whether any fee will be charged for a 18                paper copy;19            (C) the consumer:20                (i) prior to consenting, is provided with a 21            statement of the hardware and software 22            requirements for access to and retention of the 23            electronic records; and24                (ii) consents electronically, or confirms his 25            or her consent electronically, in a manner that 26            reasonably demonstrates that the consumer can   SB1777 Engrossed- 53 -LRB104 09558 JRC 19621 b1            access information in the electronic form that 2            will be used to provide the information that is 3            the subject of the consent; and4            (D) after the consent of a consumer in accordance 5        with subparagraph (A), if a change in the hardware or 6        software requirements needed to access or retain 7        electronic records creates a material risk that the 8        consumer will not be able to access or retain a 9        subsequent electronic record that was the subject of 10        the consent, the person providing the electronic 11        record:12                (i) provides the consumer with a statement of:13                    (I) the revised hardware and software 14                requirements for access to and retention of 15                the electronic records, and16                    (II) the right to withdraw consent without 17                the imposition of any fees for the withdrawal 18                and without the imposition of any condition or 19                consequence that was not disclosed under 20                subparagraph (B)(i); and21                (ii) again complies with subparagraph (C).22        (2) Other rights.23            (A) Preservation of consumer protections.

If a law that 3        was enacted prior to this amendatory Act of the 95th 4        General Assembly expressly requires a record to be 5        provided or made available by a specified method that 6        requires verification or acknowledgment of receipt, 7        the record may be provided or made available 8        electronically only if the method used provides the 9        required verification or acknowledgment of receipt.10        (2.5) Consent to electronic transactions given by the 11    customer pursuant to the federal Electronic Signatures in 12    Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. 7001, shall 13    satisfy the consent requirements of this Act. 14        (3) Effect of failure to obtain electronic consent or 15    confirmation of consent. The legal effectiveness, 16    validity, or enforceability of any contract executed by a 17    consumer shall not be denied solely because of the failure 18    to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent by 19    that consumer in accordance with paragraph (1)(C)(ii).20        (4) Prospective effect. Withdrawal of consent by a 21    consumer shall not affect the legal effectiveness, 22    validity, or enforceability of electronic records provided 23    or made available to that consumer in accordance with 24    paragraph (1) prior to implementation of the consumer's 25    withdrawal of consent. A consumer's withdrawal of consent 26    shall be effective within a reasonable period of time   SB1777 Engrossed- 55 -LRB104 09558 JRC 19621 b1    after receipt of the withdrawal by the provider of the 2    record. Failure to comply with paragraph (1)(D) may, at 3    the election of the consumer, be treated as a withdrawal 4    of consent for purposes of this paragraph.5        (5) Prior consent. This subsection does not apply to 6    any records that are provided or made available to a 7    consumer who has consented prior to the effective date of 8    this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly to 9    receive the records in electronic form as permitted by any 10    statute, regulation, or other rule of law.11        (6) Oral communications. An oral communication or a 12    recording of an oral communication shall not qualify as an 13    electronic record for purposes of this subsection (c), 14    except as otherwise provided under applicable law. 15(Source: P.A. 94-458, eff. 8-4-05; 95-77, eff. 8-13-07.) 16    Section 30.
