If one or more 23persons opening or holding an account sign an agreement with 24the institution providing that on the death of the last   10400SB1777sam001- 48 -LRB104 09558 JRC 23872 a1surviving person designated as holder the account shall be 2paid to or held by one or more designated beneficiaries, the 3account, and any balance therein which exists from time to 4time, shall be held as a payment on death account and unless 5otherwise agreed in writing between the person or persons 6opening or holding the account and the institution:7    (a) Any holder during his or her lifetime may change any of 8the designated beneficiaries to own the account at the death 9of the last surviving holder without the knowledge or consent 10of any other holder or the designated beneficiaries by a 11written instrument accepted by the institution;12    (b) Any holder may make additional deposits to and 13withdraw any part or all of the account at any time without the 14knowledge or consent of any other holder or the designated 15beneficiaries to own the account at the death of the last 16surviving holder, subject to the bylaws and regulations of the 17institution, and all withdrawals shall constitute a revocation 18of the agreement as to the amount withdrawn; and19    (c) Upon the death of the last surviving holder of the 20account, the beneficiary designated to be the owner of the 21account (i) who is then living, if the beneficiary is a natural 22person, or (ii) that maintains a lawful existence under the 23state or federal authority pursuant to which it was organized, 24if the beneficiary is not a natural person, shall be the sole 25owner of the account.

The institution may rely on the account 9holder's written representation of the identity of the 10descendants of each beneficiary living at the time of the 11beneficiary designation. The institution may also rely on an 12affidavit executed by a natural person beneficiary or 13descendant of a natural person beneficiary of the last 14surviving holder of the account upon or after the death of the 15account holder that identifies the descendants of any 16predeceased natural person beneficiary. The total percentage 17of the account to be distributed to all beneficiaries upon the 18death of the last surviving holder of the account must equal 19100%.

The legal effectiveness, 23    validity, or enforceability of any contract executed by a 24    consumer shall not be denied solely because of the failure 25    to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent by 26    that consumer in accordance with paragraph (1)(C)(ii).  10400SB1777sam001- 55 -LRB104 09558 JRC 23872 a1        (4) Prospective effect. Withdrawal of consent by a 2    consumer shall not affect the legal effectiveness, 3    validity, or enforceability of electronic records provided 4    or made available to that consumer in accordance with 5    paragraph (1) prior to implementation of the consumer's 6    withdrawal of consent.

If one or more 23persons opening or holding an account sign an agreement with 24the institution providing that on the death of the last   10400SB1777sam001- 48 -LRB104 09558 JRC 23872 a1surviving person designated as holder the account shall be 2paid to or held by one or more designated beneficiaries, the 3account, and any balance therein which exists from time to 4time, shall be held as a payment on death account and unless 5otherwise agreed in writing between the person or persons 6opening or holding the account and the institution:7    (a) Any holder during his or her lifetime may change any of 8the designated beneficiaries to own the account at the death 9of the last surviving holder without the knowledge or consent 10of any other holder or the designated beneficiaries by a 11written instrument accepted by the institution;12    (b) Any holder may make additional deposits to and 13withdraw any part or all of the account at any time without the 14knowledge or consent of any other holder or the designated 15beneficiaries to own the account at the death of the last 16surviving holder, subject to the bylaws and regulations of the 17institution, and all withdrawals shall constitute a revocation 18of the agreement as to the amount withdrawn; and19    (c) Upon the death of the last surviving holder of the 20account, the beneficiary designated to be the owner of the 21account (i) who is then living, if the beneficiary is a natural 22person, or (ii) that maintains a lawful existence under the 23state or federal authority pursuant to which it was organized, 24if the beneficiary is not a natural person, shall be the sole 25owner of the account.

The institution may rely on the account 9holder's written representation of the identity of the 10descendants of each beneficiary living at the time of the 11beneficiary designation. The institution may also rely on an 12affidavit executed by a natural person beneficiary or 13descendant of a natural person beneficiary of the last 14surviving holder of the account upon or after the death of the 15account holder that identifies the descendants of any 16predeceased natural person beneficiary. The total percentage 17of the account to be distributed to all beneficiaries upon the 18death of the last surviving holder of the account must equal 19100%. If no beneficiary designated as the owner of the account 20on the death of the last surviving holder is then living or in 21existence, or if a per stirpes distribution has been selected 22and no descendant of a natural person beneficiary is then 23living, then the proceeds shall vest in the estate of the last 24surviving holder of the account.25(Source: P.A. 96-1151, eff. 7-21-10.)   10400SB1777sam001- 50 -LRB104 09558 JRC 23872 a1    Section 25.

The legal effectiveness, 23    validity, or enforceability of any contract executed by a 24    consumer shall not be denied solely because of the failure 25    to obtain electronic consent or confirmation of consent by 26    that consumer in accordance with paragraph (1)(C)(ii).  10400SB1777sam001- 55 -LRB104 09558 JRC 23872 a1        (4) Prospective effect.
