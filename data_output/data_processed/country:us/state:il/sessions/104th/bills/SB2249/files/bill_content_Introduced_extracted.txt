If consent is not given by the parent or if the 22parent disagrees with the findings of the evaluation, then the 23school district may initiate an impartial due process hearing 24under this Section. The school district may evaluate the child 25if that is the decision resulting from the impartial due 26process hearing and the decision is not appealed or if the   SB2249- 6 -LRB104 09498 LNS 19559 b1decision is affirmed on appeal.

Students who are not currently identified 25as functionally blind who are also entitled to Braille 26instruction include: (i) those whose vision loss is so severe   SB2249- 10 -LRB104 09498 LNS 19559 b1that they are unable to read and write at a level comparable to 2their peers solely through the use of vision, and (ii) those 3who show evidence of progressive vision loss that may result 4in functional blindness. Each student who is functionally 5blind shall be entitled to Braille reading and writing 6instruction that is sufficient to enable the student to 7communicate with the same level of proficiency as other 8students of comparable ability. Instruction should be provided 9to the extent that the student is physically and cognitively 10able to use Braille. Braille instruction may be used in 11combination with other special education services appropriate 12to the student's educational needs. The assessment of each 13student who is functionally blind for the purpose of 14developing the student's individualized education program 15shall include documentation of the student's strengths and 16weaknesses in Braille skills.

Subject to the 5limitation of the preceding sentence, placement in special 6classes, separate schools or other removal of the child with a 7disability from the regular educational environment shall 8occur only when the nature of the severity of the disability is 9such that education in the regular classes with the use of 10supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved 11satisfactorily. The placement of English learners with 12disabilities shall be in non-restrictive environments which 13provide for integration with peers who do not have 14disabilities in bilingual classrooms. Annually, each January, 15school districts shall report data on students from 16non-English speaking backgrounds receiving special education 17and related services in public and private facilities as 18prescribed in Section 2-3.30. If there is a disagreement 19between parties involved regarding the special education 20placement of any child, either in-state or out-of-state, the 21placement is subject to impartial due process procedures 22described in Article 10 of the Rules and Regulations to Govern 23the Administration and Operation of Special Education.24    (e) No child who comes from a home in which a language 25other than English is the principal language used may be 26assigned to any class or program under this Article until he   SB2249- 12 -LRB104 09498 LNS 19559 b1has been given, in the principal language used by the child and 2used in his home, tests reasonably related to his cultural 3environment. All testing and evaluation materials and 4procedures utilized for evaluation and placement shall not be 5linguistically, racially or culturally discriminatory.6    (f) Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require 7any child to undergo any physical examination or medical 8treatment whose parents object thereto on the grounds that 9such examination or treatment conflicts with his religious 10beliefs.11    (g) School boards or their designee shall provide to the 12parents of a child or, if applicable, the Department of 13Children and Family Services' Office of Education and 14Transition Services prior written notice of any decision (a) 15proposing to initiate or change, or (b) refusing to initiate 16or change, the identification, evaluation, or educational 17placement of the child or the provision of a free appropriate 18public education to their child, and the reasons therefor. For 19a parent, such written notification shall also inform the 20parent of the opportunity to present complaints with respect 21to any matter relating to the educational placement of the 22student, or the provision of a free appropriate public 23education and to have an impartial due process hearing on the 24complaint. The notice shall inform the parents in the parents' 25native language, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so, of 26their rights and all procedures available pursuant to this Act   SB2249- 13 -LRB104 09498 LNS 19559 b1and the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education 2Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-446); it shall be the 3responsibility of the State Superintendent to develop uniform 4notices setting forth the procedures available under this Act 5and the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education 6Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-446) to be used by all 7school boards.
