The 24reasonable cost of the audit shall be paid by the master 25developer. The master development agreement shall grant the 26Department of Revenue and the Illinois Auditor General the   SB2470- 46 -LRB104 09390 RTM 19449 b1right to review the records of the political subdivision 2containing the source information for the report. 3    (e) There is created in the State treasury a special fund 4to be known as the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund.

The 6offset amount shall be the amount erroneously disbursed within 7the 6 months preceding the time a misallocation is discovered.8    The corporate authorities of the political subdivision 9shall deposit the proceeds for the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund 10into a special fund of the political subdivision called the 11"(Name of political subdivision) STAR Bond District Revenue 12Fund" for the purpose of paying or reimbursing STAR bond 13project costs and obligations incurred in the payment of those 14costs. 15    If the political subdivision fails to issue STAR bonds 16within 180 days after the first distribution to the political 17subdivision from the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund, the Department 18of Revenue shall cease distribution of the State sales tax 19increment to the political subdivision, shall transfer any 20State sales tax increment in the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund to the 21General Revenue Fund, and shall cease deposits of State sales 22tax increment amounts into the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund. The 23political subdivision shall repay all of the State sales tax 24increment distributed to the political subdivision to date, 25which amounts shall be deposited into the General Revenue 26Fund. If not repaid within 90 days after notice from the State,   SB2470- 49 -LRB104 09390 RTM 19449 b1the Department of Revenue shall withhold distributions to the 2political subdivision from the Local Government Tax Fund until 3the excess amount is repaid, which withheld amounts shall be 4transferred to the General Revenue Fund. At such time as the 5political subdivision notifies the Department of Revenue in 6writing that it has issued STAR Bonds in accordance with this 7Act and provides the Department with a copy of the political 8subdivision's official statement, bond purchase agreements, 9indenture, or other evidence of bond sale, the Department of 10Revenue shall resume deposits of the State sales tax increment 11into the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund and distribution of the State 12sales tax increment to the political subdivision in accordance 13with this Section. 14    (f) As of the seventh anniversary of the first date of 15distribution of State sales tax revenues from the first STAR 16bond project in the STAR bond district, and as of every fifth 17anniversary thereafter until final maturity of all STAR bonds 18issued in a STAR bond district, the portion of the aggregate 19proceeds of STAR bonds issued to date that is derived from the 20State sales tax increment pledged to pay STAR bonds in any STAR 21bond district shall not exceed 50% of the total development 22costs in the STAR bond district to date. The Illinois Auditor 23General shall make the foregoing determination on said seventh 24anniversary and every 5 years thereafter until final maturity 25of all STAR bonds issued in a STAR bond district. If at any 26time after the seventh anniversary of the first date of   SB2470- 50 -LRB104 09390 RTM 19449 b1distribution of State sales tax revenues from the first STAR 2bond project in the STAR bond district the Illinois Auditor 3General determines that the portion of the aggregate proceeds 4of STAR bonds issued to date that is derived from the State 5sales tax increment pledged to pay STAR bonds in any STAR bond 6district has exceeded 50% of the total development costs in 7the STAR bond district, no additional STAR bonds may be issued 8in the STAR bond district until the percentage is reduced to 950% or below. When the percentage has been reduced to 50% or 10below, the master developer shall have the right, at its own 11cost, to obtain a new audit prepared by an independent 12third-party auditor verifying compliance and shall provide 13such audit to the Illinois Auditor General for review and 14approval. Upon the Illinois Auditor General's determination 15from the audit that the percentage has been reduced to 50% or 16below, STAR bonds may again be issued in the STAR bond 17district. 18    (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Tax Increment 19Allocation Redevelopment Act, if any portion of property taxes 20attributable to the increase in equalized assessed value 21within a STAR bond district are, at the time of formation of 22the STAR bond district, already subject to tax increment 23financing under the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment 24Act, then the tax increment for such portion shall be frozen at 25the base year established in accordance with this Act, and all 26future incremental increases over the base year shall not be   SB2470- 51 -LRB104 09390 RTM 19449 b1subject to tax increment financing under the Tax Increment 2Allocation Redevelopment Act. Any party otherwise entitled to 3receipt of incremental tax revenues through an existing tax 4increment financing district shall be entitled to continue to 5receive such revenues up to the amount frozen in the base year. 6Nothing in this Act shall affect the prior qualification of 7existing redevelopment project costs incurred that are 8eligible for reimbursement under the Tax Increment Allocation 9Redevelopment Act. In such event, prior to approving a STAR 10bond district, the political subdivision forming the STAR bond 11district shall take such action as is necessary, including 12amending the existing tax increment financing district 13redevelopment plan, to carry out the provisions of this Act. 14(Source: P.A. 103-8, eff. 6-7-23.) 15    (50 ILCS 470/31)16    Sec. 31.

The 24reasonable cost of the audit shall be paid by the master 25developer. The master development agreement shall grant the 26Department of Revenue and the Illinois Auditor General the   SB2470- 46 -LRB104 09390 RTM 19449 b1right to review the records of the political subdivision 2containing the source information for the report. 3    (e) There is created in the State treasury a special fund 4to be known as the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund.

The 6offset amount shall be the amount erroneously disbursed within 7the 6 months preceding the time a misallocation is discovered.8    The corporate authorities of the political subdivision 9shall deposit the proceeds for the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund 10into a special fund of the political subdivision called the 11"(Name of political subdivision) STAR Bond District Revenue 12Fund" for the purpose of paying or reimbursing STAR bond 13project costs and obligations incurred in the payment of those 14costs. 15    If the political subdivision fails to issue STAR bonds 16within 180 days after the first distribution to the political 17subdivision from the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund, the Department 18of Revenue shall cease distribution of the State sales tax 19increment to the political subdivision, shall transfer any 20State sales tax increment in the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund to the 21General Revenue Fund, and shall cease deposits of State sales 22tax increment amounts into the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund. The 23political subdivision shall repay all of the State sales tax 24increment distributed to the political subdivision to date, 25which amounts shall be deposited into the General Revenue 26Fund. If not repaid within 90 days after notice from the State,   SB2470- 49 -LRB104 09390 RTM 19449 b1the Department of Revenue shall withhold distributions to the 2political subdivision from the Local Government Tax Fund until 3the excess amount is repaid, which withheld amounts shall be 4transferred to the General Revenue Fund. At such time as the 5political subdivision notifies the Department of Revenue in 6writing that it has issued STAR Bonds in accordance with this 7Act and provides the Department with a copy of the political 8subdivision's official statement, bond purchase agreements, 9indenture, or other evidence of bond sale, the Department of 10Revenue shall resume deposits of the State sales tax increment 11into the STAR Bonds Revenue Fund and distribution of the State 12sales tax increment to the political subdivision in accordance 13with this Section. 14    (f) As of the seventh anniversary of the first date of 15distribution of State sales tax revenues from the first STAR 16bond project in the STAR bond district, and as of every fifth 17anniversary thereafter until final maturity of all STAR bonds 18issued in a STAR bond district, the portion of the aggregate 19proceeds of STAR bonds issued to date that is derived from the 20State sales tax increment pledged to pay STAR bonds in any STAR 21bond district shall not exceed 50% of the total development 22costs in the STAR bond district to date. The Illinois Auditor 23General shall make the foregoing determination on said seventh 24anniversary and every 5 years thereafter until final maturity 25of all STAR bonds issued in a STAR bond district. If at any 26time after the seventh anniversary of the first date of   SB2470- 50 -LRB104 09390 RTM 19449 b1distribution of State sales tax revenues from the first STAR 2bond project in the STAR bond district the Illinois Auditor 3General determines that the portion of the aggregate proceeds 4of STAR bonds issued to date that is derived from the State 5sales tax increment pledged to pay STAR bonds in any STAR bond 6district has exceeded 50% of the total development costs in 7the STAR bond district, no additional STAR bonds may be issued 8in the STAR bond district until the percentage is reduced to 950% or below. When the percentage has been reduced to 50% or 10below, the master developer shall have the right, at its own 11cost, to obtain a new audit prepared by an independent 12third-party auditor verifying compliance and shall provide 13such audit to the Illinois Auditor General for review and 14approval. Upon the Illinois Auditor General's determination 15from the audit that the percentage has been reduced to 50% or 16below, STAR bonds may again be issued in the STAR bond 17district. 18    (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Tax Increment 19Allocation Redevelopment Act, if any portion of property taxes 20attributable to the increase in equalized assessed value 21within a STAR bond district are, at the time of formation of 22the STAR bond district, already subject to tax increment 23financing under the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment 24Act, then the tax increment for such portion shall be frozen at 25the base year established in accordance with this Act, and all 26future incremental increases over the base year shall not be   SB2470- 51 -LRB104 09390 RTM 19449 b1subject to tax increment financing under the Tax Increment 2Allocation Redevelopment Act. Any party otherwise entitled to 3receipt of incremental tax revenues through an existing tax 4increment financing district shall be entitled to continue to 5receive such revenues up to the amount frozen in the base year. 6Nothing in this Act shall affect the prior qualification of 7existing redevelopment project costs incurred that are 8eligible for reimbursement under the Tax Increment Allocation 9Redevelopment Act. In such event, prior to approving a STAR 10bond district, the political subdivision forming the STAR bond 11district shall take such action as is necessary, including 12amending the existing tax increment financing district 13redevelopment plan, to carry out the provisions of this Act. 14(Source: P.A. 103-8, eff. 6-7-23.) 15    (50 ILCS 470/31)16    Sec. 31.

The amount paid to each school 15district within the county, or within the counties if the STAR 16bond district is located across multiple counties, shall be 17allocated proportionately, based on each qualifying school 18district's fall enrollment for the then-current school year, 19such that the school district with the largest fall enrollment 20receives the largest proportionate share of money paid out of 21the Fund or by any other method or formula that the regional 22superintendent or local superintendent of schools deems fit, 23equitable, and in the public interest. The regional 24superintendent or local superintendent may allocate moneys to 25school districts that are outside of his or her educational 26service region or to other regional superintendents.  SB2470- 70 -LRB104 09390 RTM 19449 b1    The Department shall determine the distributions under 2this Section using its best judgment and information.
