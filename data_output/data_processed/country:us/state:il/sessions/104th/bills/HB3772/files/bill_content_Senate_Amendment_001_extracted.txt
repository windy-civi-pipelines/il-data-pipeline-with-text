This report 15shall include data from all public schools within school 16districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This   10400HB3772sam001- 2 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1report must be posted on the Internet website of the State 2Board of Education. The report shall include data on the 3issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and 4removals to alternative settings in lieu of another 5disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, 6gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English 7learner, incident type, and discipline duration. On or before 8July 31, 2026 and on or before each July 31 thereafter, each 9school district, including a State-authorized charter school, 10shall report this data to the State Board of Education in the 11form and manner prescribed by the State Board of Education. 12    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data 13under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and 14determine the top 20% of school districts for the following 15metrics:16        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided 17    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 18    September for the year in which the data was collected, 19    multiplied by 100.20        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided 21    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 22    September for the year in which the data was collected, 23    multiplied by 100.24        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the 25    overrepresentation of students of color or white students 26    in comparison to the total number of students of color or   10400HB3772sam001- 3 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1    white students on October 1st of the school year in which 2    data are collected, with respect to the use of 3    out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be 4    calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of 5    Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.6    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 7consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school 8year.9    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board 10of Education shall require each of the school districts that 11are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described 12in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan 13identifying the strategies the school district will implement 14to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or 15racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School 16districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 17the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 18years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 19    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 20required under federal or State law.21    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 22described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 23districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 24charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10 25out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is 26applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top   10400HB3772sam001- 4 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a120% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 2subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an 3enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 4students of color.5    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 6and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 7one year after being identified, the school district shall 8submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 9district's Internet website a progress report describing the 10implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 11(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 12100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 13    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)14    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)15    Sec. 10-22.6.

Expulsion shall take place only after the parents 22have been requested to appear at a meeting of the board, or 23with a hearing officer appointed by it, to discuss their 24child's behavior. Such request shall be made by registered or 25certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of   10400HB3772sam001- 5 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 2at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 3date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 4hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 5shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 6heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 7as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 8the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 9reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 10is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 11shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 12the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 13transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 14in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 15denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 16which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 17of students or staff in the alternative program. 18    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 19superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 20principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 21students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 22suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 23the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 24subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 25shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 26policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the   10400HB3772sam001- 6 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 2school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 3to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 4gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 5may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 6reasons. 7    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 8parents or guardian of a student along with a full statement of 9the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right to 10a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 11notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 12suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardian, 13the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 14review such action of the superintendent or principal, 15assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 16parents or guardian of the student may appear and discuss the 17suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 18officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 19a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 20its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 21hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 22appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 23subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 24decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 25misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 26suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the   10400HB3772sam001- 7 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1specific duration of the suspension. 2    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 3and consequences available to school officials, school 4exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 5are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 6and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 7extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 8only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 9students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 10recommended that school officials consider forms of 11non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 12suspensions or expulsions. 13    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 14Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 15by which school administrators are required to suspend or 16expel students for particular behaviors.17    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 18used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 19pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 20students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 21subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 22other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 23a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 24School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 25such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 26length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.  10400HB3772sam001- 8 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 2out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 3and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 4only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 5disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 6student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 7a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 8the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 9interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 10this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 11students, staff, or members of the school community" and 12"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 13operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 14basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 15(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 16available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 17exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 18shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 19address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 20exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 21suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 22Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 23of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 24interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 25there were no other appropriate and available interventions.26    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer   10400HB3772sam001- 9 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 2support services during the period of their suspension. For 3purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 4support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 5Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 6this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 7to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 8such appropriate and available services. 9    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 10appropriate and available support services.11    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 12re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 13expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 14consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 15Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 16and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 17suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 18alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 19Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 20    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 21suspended students, including those students suspended from 22the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 23school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 24equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 25a student's parent or guardian to notify school officials that 26a student suspended from the school bus does not have   10400HB3772sam001- 10 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1alternate transportation to school. 2    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 3local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 4meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 5the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.6    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 7provide ongoing professional development to all school 8personnel, school board members, and school resource officers, 9on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 10adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 11involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 12culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 13environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 14the appropriate and available supportive services for the 15promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 16developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 17positive and healthy school climates. 18    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 19time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 20case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 21brought one of the following objects to school, any 22school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 23that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 24expelled for a period of not less than one year:25        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 26    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined   10400HB3772sam001- 11 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 2    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 3    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 4    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period 5    under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the 6    superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may 7    be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.8        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon 9    regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other 10    object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily 11    harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in 12    subdivision (1) of this subsection (d).

A student who is subject to suspension or 19expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 20transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 21Article 13A of the School Code.22    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 23superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 24principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 25student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 26a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2   10400HB3772sam001- 12 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 2that student has been determined to have made an explicit 3threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 4student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 5website through which the threat was made is a site that was 6accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 7was available to third parties who worked or studied within 8the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 9the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 10the safety and security of the threatened individual because 11of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 12student inside the school. 13    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 14authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 15lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 16equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 17personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 18without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 19search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 20Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 21privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 22left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 23the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 24conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 25lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 26controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other   10400HB3772sam001- 13 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 2searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 3If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 4evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 5the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 6such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 7disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also 8turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.9    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or 10expulsion from school and all school activities and a 11prohibition from being present on school grounds.12    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if 13a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any 14public or private school in this or any other state, the 15student must complete the entire term of the suspension or 16expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A 17of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program 18under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the 19school district if there is no threat to the safety of students 20or staff in the alternative program.21    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 22students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 23difficulties.24    (i) A student may not be issued a monetary fine or fee as a 25disciplinary consequence, though this shall not preclude 26requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, stolen,   10400HB3772sam001- 14 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1or damaged property.2    (j) Subsections (a) through (i) of this Section shall 3apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter schools, 4special charter districts, and school districts organized 5under Article 34 of this Code. 6    (k) The expulsion of students enrolled in programs funded 7under Section 1C-2 of this Code is subject to the requirements 8under paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 2-3.71 of 9this Code. 10    (l) An in-school suspension program provided by a school 11district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may 12focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and 13positive interaction with other students and school personnel. 14A school district may employ a school social worker or a 15licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school 16suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12. 17(Source: P.A. 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 18103-594, eff. 6-25-24; 103-896, eff. 8-9-24; revised 9-25-24.) 19    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 102-466)20    Sec. 10-22.6.

If the board 16acts to expel a student, the written expulsion decision shall 17detail the specific reasons why removing the student from the 18learning environment is in the best interest of the school. 19The expulsion decision shall also include a rationale as to 20the specific duration of the expulsion. An expelled student 21may be immediately transferred to an alternative program in 22the manner provided in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A 23student must not be denied transfer because of the expulsion, 24except in cases in which such transfer is deemed to cause a 25threat to the safety of students or staff in the alternative 26program.   10400HB3772sam001- 16 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 2superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 3principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 4students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 5suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 6the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 7subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 8shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 9policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 10principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 11school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 12to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 13gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 14may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 15reasons. The superintendent of the school district shall be 16required to provide verbal or written approval to suspend a 17student in kindergarten through grade 2 for longer than 3 18days. If superintendent approval is not received by the third 19day, the student shall return to school by the fourth day. The 20length of the suspension for any student in kindergarten 21through grade 2 may not be for longer than the number of days 22required by the district to develop and implement a behavior 23intervention plan or safety plan. 24    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 25parents or guardians of a student along with a full statement 26of the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right   10400HB3772sam001- 17 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1to a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 2notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 3suspension length.

The 17suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 18specific duration of the suspension. 19    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 20and consequences available to school officials, school 21exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 22are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 23and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 24extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 25only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 26students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is   10400HB3772sam001- 18 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1recommended that school officials consider forms of 2non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 3suspensions or expulsions. 4    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by subsection (d) federal 5law or this Code, school boards may not institute 6zero-tolerance policies by which school administrators are 7required to suspend or expel students for particular 8behaviors.9    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 10used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 11pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 12students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 13subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 14other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 15a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 16School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 17such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 18length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.19    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 20out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions 21for students in grades 3 through 12 or, if required by 22subsection (d), expulsions for students in kindergarten 23through grade 2, and disciplinary removals to alternative 24schools for students who meet the grade-level restrictions set 25forth in Articles 13A and 13B may be used only if other 26appropriate and available behavioral and disciplinary   10400HB3772sam001- 19 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1interventions have been exhausted and the student's continuing 2presence in school would either (i) pose a threat to the safety 3of other students, staff, or members of the school community 4or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 5operation of the school. For purposes of this subsection 6(b-20), "threat to the safety of other students, staff, or 7members of the school community" and "substantially disrupt, 8impede, or interfere with the operation of the school" shall 9be determined on a case-by-case basis by school officials. For 10purposes of this subsection (b-20), the determination of 11whether "appropriate and available behavioral and disciplinary 12interventions have been exhausted" shall be made by school 13officials. School officials shall make all reasonable efforts 14to resolve such threats, address such disruptions, and 15minimize the length of student exclusions to the greatest 16extent practicable. Within the suspension decision described 17in subsection (b) of this Section or the expulsion decision 18described in subsection (a) of this Section, it shall be 19documented whether other interventions were attempted or 20whether it was determined that there were no other appropriate 21and available interventions.22    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 23than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 24support services during the period of their suspension. For 25purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 26support services" shall be determined by school authorities.   10400HB3772sam001- 20 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 2this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 3to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 4such appropriate and available services. The superintendent of 5the school district shall be required to provide verbal or 6written approval to suspend a student in kindergarten through 7grade 2 for longer than 3 days. If superintendent approval is 8not received by the third day, the student shall return to 9school by the fourth day. 10    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 11appropriate and available support services.12    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 13re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 14expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 15consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 16Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 17and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 18suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 19alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 20Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 21    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 22suspended students, including those students suspended from 23the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 24school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 25equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 26a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials   10400HB3772sam001- 21 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 2alternate transportation to school. 3    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 4subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 5subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be 6considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 7parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 8violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 9parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 10emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 11throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 12its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 13student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 14emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany 15the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 16representative or support person must comply with any rules of 17the school district's hearing process. If the representative 18or support person violates the rules or engages in behavior or 19advocacy that harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a 20witness, or anyone else in attendance at the hearing, the 21representative or support person may be prohibited from 22further participation in the hearing or proceeding. A 23suspension or expulsion proceeding under this subsection 24(b-35) must be conducted independently from any ongoing 25criminal investigation or proceeding, and an absence of 26pending or possible criminal charges, criminal investigations,   10400HB3772sam001- 22 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1or proceedings may not be a factor in school disciplinary 2decisions.3    (b-40) During a suspension review hearing conducted under 4subsection (b) or an expulsion hearing conducted under 5subsection (a) that involves allegations of sexual violence by 6the student who is subject to discipline, neither the student 7nor his or her representative shall directly question nor have 8direct contact with the alleged victim. The student who is 9subject to discipline or his or her representative may, at the 10discretion and direction of the school board or its appointed 11hearing officer, suggest questions to be posed by the school 12board or its appointed hearing officer to the alleged victim. 13    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 14local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 15meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 16the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.17    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 18provide ongoing professional development to all school 19personnel, school board members, and school resource officers 20on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 21adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 22involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 23culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 24environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 25the appropriate and available supportive services for the 26promotion of student attendance and engagement, and   10400HB3772sam001- 23 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25690 a1developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 2positive and healthy school climates. 3    (d) The board may expel a student in grades 3 through 12 4for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 calendar years, 5as determined on a case-by-case basis.
