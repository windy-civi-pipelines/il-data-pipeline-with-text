School 7districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 8the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 9years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 10    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 11required under federal or State law.12    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 13described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 14districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 15charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10 16out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is 17applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 1820% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 19subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an 20enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 21students of color.22    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 23and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 24one year after being identified, the school district shall 25submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 26district's Internet website a progress report describing the   HB3772- 18 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 2(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 3100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 4    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)5    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)6    Sec. 10-22.6.

This report 14shall include data from all public schools within school 15districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This 16report must be posted on the Internet website of the State 17Board of Education. The report shall include data on the 18issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and 19removals to alternative settings in lieu of another 20disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, 21gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English 22learner, incident type, and discipline duration. Such data 23shall be reported to the State Board of Education annually by 24all school districts in this State, including State-authorized 25charter schools, in a form and manner as specified by the State   HB3772- 16 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1Board of Education, no later than July 31 for the previous 2school year, and by July 31 of each year thereafter. 3    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data 4under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and 5determine the top 20% of school districts for the following 6metrics:7        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided 8    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 9    September for the year in which the data was collected, 10    multiplied by 100.11        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided 12    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 13    September for the year in which the data was collected, 14    multiplied by 100.15        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the 16    overrepresentation of students of color or white students 17    in comparison to the total number of students of color or 18    white students on October 1st of the school year in which 19    data are collected, with respect to the use of 20    out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be 21    calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of 22    Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.23    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 24consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school 25year.26    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board   HB3772- 17 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1of Education shall require each of the school districts that 2are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described 3in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan 4identifying the strategies the school district will implement 5to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or 6racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School 7districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 8the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 9years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 10    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 11required under federal or State law.12    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 13described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 14districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 15charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10 16out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is 17applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 1820% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 19subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an 20enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 21students of color.22    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 23and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 24one year after being identified, the school district shall 25submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 26district's Internet website a progress report describing the   HB3772- 18 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 2(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 3100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 4    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)5    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)6    Sec. 10-22.6.

Such request shall be made by registered or 16certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 17the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 18at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 19date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 20hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 21shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 22heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 23as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 24the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 25reasons why removing the student from the learning environment   HB3772- 19 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 2shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 3the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 4transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 5in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 6denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 7which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 8of students or staff in the alternative program. 9    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 10superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 11principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 12students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 13suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 14the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 15subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 16shall lie against them for such suspension.

The 17suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 18specific duration of the suspension. 19    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 20and consequences available to school officials, school 21exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 22are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 23and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 24extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 25only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 26students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is   HB3772- 21 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1recommended that school officials consider forms of 2non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 3suspensions or expulsions. 4    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 5Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 6by which school administrators are required to suspend or 7expel students for particular behaviors.8    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 9used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 10pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 11students' learning opportunities.

A student shall not be denied 16transfer because of the suspension, except in cases in which 17such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety of 18students or staff in the alternative program. 19    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 20and consequences available to school officials, school 21exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 22are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 23and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 24extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 25only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 26students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is   HB3772- 32 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1recommended that school officials consider forms of 2non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 3suspensions or expulsions. 4    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 5Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 6by which school administrators are required to suspend or 7expel students for particular behaviors.8    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 9used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 10pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 11students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 12subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 13other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 14a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 15School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 16such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 17length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.18    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 19out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions 20for students in grades 3 through 12 or, if required by federal 21or State law, expulsions for students in kindergarten through 22grade 2, and disciplinary removals to alternative schools for 23students who meet the grade level restrictions set forth in 24Articles 13A and 13B may be used only if other appropriate and 25available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 26exhausted and the student's continuing presence in school   HB3772- 33 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1would either (i) pose a threat to the safety of other students, 2staff, or members of the school community or (ii) 3substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the operation 4of the school. For purposes of this subsection (b-20), "threat 5to the safety of other students, staff, or members of the 6school community" and "substantially disrupt, impede, or 7interfere with the operation of the school" shall be 8determined on a case-by-case basis by school officials. For 9purposes of this subsection (b-20), the determination of 10whether "appropriate and available behavioral and disciplinary 11interventions have been exhausted" shall be made by school 12officials. School officials shall make all reasonable efforts 13to resolve such threats, address such disruptions, and 14minimize the length of student exclusions to the greatest 15extent practicable. Within the suspension decision described 16in subsection (b) of this Section or the expulsion decision 17described in subsection (a) of this Section, it shall be 18documented whether other interventions were attempted or 19whether it was determined that there were no other appropriate 20and available interventions.21    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 22than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 23support services during the period of their suspension. For 24purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 25support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 26Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of   HB3772- 34 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 2to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 3such appropriate and available services. 4    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 5appropriate and available support services.6    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 7re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 8expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 9consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 10Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 11and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 12suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 13alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 14Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 15    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 16suspended students, including those students suspended from 17the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 18school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 19equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 20a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 21that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 22alternate transportation to school. 23    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 24subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 25subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be 26considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a   HB3772- 35 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 2violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 3parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 4emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 5throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 6its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 7student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 8emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany 9the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 10representative or support person must comply with any rules of 11the school district's hearing process. If the representative 12or support person violates the rules or engages in behavior or 13advocacy that harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a 14witness, or anyone else in attendance at the hearing, the 15representative or support person may be prohibited from 16further participation in the hearing or proceeding. A 17suspension or expulsion proceeding under this subsection 18(b-35) must be conducted independently from any ongoing 19criminal investigation or proceeding, and an absence of 20pending or possible criminal charges, criminal investigations, 21or proceedings may not be a factor in school disciplinary 22decisions.23    (b-40) During a suspension review hearing conducted under 24subsection (b) or an expulsion hearing conducted under 25subsection (a) that involves allegations of sexual violence by 26the student who is subject to discipline, neither the student   HB3772- 36 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1nor his or her representative shall directly question nor have 2direct contact with the alleged victim. The student who is 3subject to discipline or his or her representative may, at the 4discretion and direction of the school board or its appointed 5hearing officer, suggest questions to be posed by the school 6board or its appointed hearing officer to the alleged victim. 7    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 8local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 9meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 10the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.11    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 12provide ongoing professional development to all school 13personnel, school board members, and school resource officers 14on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 15adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 16involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 17culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 18environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 19the appropriate and available supportive services for the 20promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 21developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 22positive and healthy school climates. 23    (d) The board may expel a student in grades 3 through 12 24or, if required by federal or State law, a student in 25kindergarten through grade 2 for a definite period of time not 26to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case   HB3772- 37 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1basis. A student who is determined to have brought one of the 2following objects to school, any school-sponsored activity or 3event, or any activity or event that bears a reasonable 4relationship to school shall be expelled for a period of not 5less than one year:6        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 7    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 8    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 9    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 10    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 11    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period 12    under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the 13    superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may 14    be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.15        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon 16    regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other 17    object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily 18    harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in 19    subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). The expulsion 20    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 21    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 22    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 23Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 24consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 25Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 26expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a   HB3772- 38 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 2Article 13A of the School Code.3    (d-5) For a student in grades 3 through 12, the The board 4may suspend or by regulation authorize the superintendent of 5the district or the principal, assistant principal, or dean of 6students of any school to suspendor, for a student in 7kindergarten through grade 2, the board may suspend or by 8regulation authorize the superintendent of the district to 9suspend a student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or 10may expel a student in grades 3 through 12 or, if required by 11federal or State law, a student in kindergarten through grade 122 for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 calendar years, 13as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) that student has 14been determined to have made an explicit threat on an Internet 15website against a school employee, a student, or any 16school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet website through 17which the threat was made is a site that was accessible within 18the school at the time the threat was made or was available to 19third parties who worked or studied within the school grounds 20at the time the threat was made, and (iii) the threat could be 21reasonably interpreted as threatening to the safety and 22security of the threatened individual because of the 23individual's duties or employment status or status as a 24student inside the school. 25    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 26authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as   HB3772- 39 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 2equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 3personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 4without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 5search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 6Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 7privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 8left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 9the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 10conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 11lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 12controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 13illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 14searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 15If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 16evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 17the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 18such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 19disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also 20turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.21    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or 22expulsion from school and all school activities and a 23prohibition from being present on school grounds.24    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if 25a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any 26public or private school in this or any other state, the   HB3772- 40 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1student must complete the entire term of the suspension or 2expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A 3of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program 4under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the 5school district if there is no threat to the safety of students 6or staff in the alternative program. A school district that 7adopts a policy under this subsection (g) must include a 8provision allowing for consideration of any mitigating 9factors, including, but not limited to, a student's status as 10a parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 11violence, as defined in Article 26A. 12    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 13students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 14difficulties.15    (i) A student may not be issued a monetary fine or fee as a 16disciplinary consequence, though this shall not preclude 17requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, stolen, 18or damaged property.19    (j) Subsections (a) through (i) of this Section shall 20apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter schools, 21special charter districts, and school districts organized 22under Article 34 of this Code. 23    (k) Through June 30, 2026, the expulsion of students 24enrolled in programs funded under Section 1C-2 of this Code is 25subject to the requirements under paragraph (7) of subsection 26(a) of Section 2-3.71 of this Code.   HB3772- 41 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1    (k-5) On and after July 1, 2026, the expulsion of children 2enrolled in programs funded under Section 15-25 of the 3Department of Early Childhood Act is subject to the 4requirements of paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 515-30 of the Department of Early Childhood Act.
