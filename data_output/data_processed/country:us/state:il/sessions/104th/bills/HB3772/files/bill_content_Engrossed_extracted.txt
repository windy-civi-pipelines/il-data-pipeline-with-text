Communication with the parent or legal 3        guardian shall take place in a culturally and 4        linguistically competent manner.5            (C) If there is documented evidence that all 6        available interventions and supports recommended by a 7        qualified professional have been exhausted and the 8        program determines in its professional judgment that 9        transitioning a child to another program is necessary 10        for the well-being of the child or his or her peers and 11        staff, with parent or legal guardian permission, both 12        the current and pending programs shall create a 13        transition plan designed to ensure continuity of 14        services and the comprehensive development of the 15        child. Communication with families shall occur in a 16        culturally and linguistically competent manner.17            (D) Nothing in this paragraph (7) shall preclude a 18        parent's or legal guardian's right to voluntarily 19        withdraw his or her child from an early childhood 20        program.

Student discipline report; school discipline 8improvement plan. 9    (a) On or before October 31, 2015 and on or before October 1031 of each subsequent year, the State Board of Education, 11through the State Superintendent of Education, shall prepare a 12report on student discipline in all school districts in this 13State, including State-authorized charter schools. This report 14shall include data from all public schools within school 15districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This 16report must be posted on the Internet website of the State 17Board of Education. The report shall include data on the 18issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and 19removals to alternative settings in lieu of another 20disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, 21gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English 22learner, incident type, and discipline duration. On or before 23July 31, 2026, and on or before each July 31 thereafter, each 24school district in the State, including State-authorized 25charter schools shall report this data to the State Board of   HB3772 Engrossed- 16 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1Education in the form and manner prescribed by the State Board 2of Education. 3    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data 4under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and 5determine the top 20% of school districts for the following 6metrics:7        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided 8    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 9    September for the year in which the data was collected, 10    multiplied by 100.11        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided 12    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 13    September for the year in which the data was collected, 14    multiplied by 100.15        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the 16    overrepresentation of students of color or white students 17    in comparison to the total number of students of color or 18    white students on October 1st of the school year in which 19    data are collected, with respect to the use of 20    out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be 21    calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of 22    Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.23    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 24consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school 25year.26    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board   HB3772 Engrossed- 17 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1of Education shall require each of the school districts that 2are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described 3in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan 4identifying the strategies the school district will implement 5to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or 6racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School 7districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 8the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 9years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 10    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 11required under federal or State law.12    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 13described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 14districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 15charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10 16out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is 17applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 1820% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 19subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an 20enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 21students of color.22    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 23and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 24one year after being identified, the school district shall 25submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 26district's Internet website a progress report describing the   HB3772 Engrossed- 18 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 2(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 3100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 4    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)5    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)6    Sec. 10-22.6. Suspension or expulsion of students; school 7searches. 8    (a) To expel students guilty of gross disobedience or 9misconduct, including gross disobedience or misconduct 10perpetuated by electronic means, pursuant to subsection (b-20) 11of this Section, and no action shall lie against them for such 12expulsion. Expulsion shall take place only after the parents 13have been requested to appear at a meeting of the board, or 14with a hearing officer appointed by it, to discuss their 15child's behavior. Such request shall be made by registered or 16certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 17the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 18at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 19date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 20hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 21shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 22heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 23as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 24the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 25reasons why removing the student from the learning environment   HB3772 Engrossed- 19 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 2shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 3the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 4transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 5in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 6denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 7which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 8of students or staff in the alternative program. 9    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 10superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 11principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 12students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 13suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 14the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 15subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 16shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 17policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 18principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 19school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 20to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 21gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 22may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 23reasons. 24    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 25parents or guardian of a student along with a full statement of 26the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right to   HB3772 Engrossed- 20 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 2notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 3suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardian, 4the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 5review such action of the superintendent or principal, 6assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 7parents or guardian of the student may appear and discuss the 8suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 9officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 10a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 11its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 12hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 13appropriate.

The Department of Early Childhood shall 5    encourage local school districts and other eligible 6    entities to evaluate the population of preschool children 7    in their communities and provide preschool programs, 8    pursuant to this subsection, where appropriate. 9        (6) Through June 30, 2026, the State Board of 10    Education shall report to the General Assembly by November 11    1, 2018 and every 2 years thereafter on the results and 12    progress of students who were enrolled in preschool 13    educational programs, including an assessment of which 14    programs have been most successful in promoting academic 15    excellence and alleviating academic failure. Through June 16    30, 2026, the State Board of Education shall assess the 17    academic progress of all students who have been enrolled 18    in preschool educational programs.19        Through fiscal year 2026, on or before November 1 of 20    each fiscal year in which the General Assembly provides 21    funding for new programs under paragraph (4.5) of this 22    Section, the State Board of Education shall report to the 23    General Assembly on what percentage of new funding was 24    provided to programs serving primarily at-risk children, 25    what percentage of new funding was provided to programs 26    serving primarily children with a family income of less   HB3772 Engrossed- 8 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1    than 4 times the federal poverty level, and what 2    percentage of new funding was provided to other programs. 3        (6.1) On and after July 1, 2026, the Department of 4    Early Childhood shall report to the General Assembly by 5    November 1, 2026 and every 2 years thereafter on the 6    results and progress of students who were enrolled in 7    preschool educational programs, including an assessment of 8    which programs have been most successful in promoting 9    academic excellence and alleviating academic failure. On 10    and after July 1, 2026, the Department of Early Childhood 11    shall assess the academic progress of all students who 12    have been enrolled in preschool educational programs. 13    Beginning in fiscal year 2027, on or before November 1 of 14    each fiscal year in which the General Assembly provides 15    funding for new programs under paragraph (4.5) of this 16    Section, the Department of Early Childhood shall report to 17    the General Assembly on what percentage of new funding was 18    provided to programs serving primarily at-risk children, 19    what percentage of new funding was provided to programs 20    serving primarily children with a family income of less 21    than 4 times the federal poverty level, and what 22    percentage of new funding was provided to other programs. 23        (7) Due to evidence that expulsion practices in the 24    preschool years are linked to poor child outcomes and are 25    employed inconsistently across racial and gender groups, 26    early childhood programs receiving State funds under this   HB3772 Engrossed- 9 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1    subsection (a) shall prohibit expulsions. Planned 2    transitions to settings that are able to better meet a 3    child's needs are not considered expulsion under this 4    paragraph (7).5            (A) When persistent and serious challenging 6        behaviors emerge, the early childhood program shall 7        document steps taken to ensure that the child can 8        participate safely in the program; including 9        observations of initial and ongoing challenging 10        behaviors, strategies for remediation and intervention 11        plans to address the behaviors, and communication with 12        the parent or legal guardian, including participation 13        of the parent or legal guardian in planning and 14        decision-making.15            (B) The early childhood program shall, with 16        parental or legal guardian consent as required, 17        utilize a range of community resources, if available 18        and deemed necessary, including, but not limited to, 19        developmental screenings, referrals to programs and 20        services administered by a local educational agency or 21        early intervention agency under Parts B and C of the 22        federal Individual with Disabilities Education Act, 23        and consultation with infant and early childhood 24        mental health consultants and the child's health care 25        provider. The program shall document attempts to 26        engage these resources, including parent or legal   HB3772 Engrossed- 10 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1        guardian participation and consent attempted and 2        obtained. Communication with the parent or legal 3        guardian shall take place in a culturally and 4        linguistically competent manner.5            (C) If there is documented evidence that all 6        available interventions and supports recommended by a 7        qualified professional have been exhausted and the 8        program determines in its professional judgment that 9        transitioning a child to another program is necessary 10        for the well-being of the child or his or her peers and 11        staff, with parent or legal guardian permission, both 12        the current and pending programs shall create a 13        transition plan designed to ensure continuity of 14        services and the comprehensive development of the 15        child. Communication with families shall occur in a 16        culturally and linguistically competent manner.17            (D) Nothing in this paragraph (7) shall preclude a 18        parent's or legal guardian's right to voluntarily 19        withdraw his or her child from an early childhood 20        program. Early childhood programs shall request and 21        keep on file, when received, a written statement from 22        the parent or legal guardian stating the reason for 23        his or her decision to withdraw his or her child.24            (E) In the case of the determination of a serious 25        safety threat to a child or others or in the case of 26        behaviors listed in subsection (d) of Section 10-22.6   HB3772 Engrossed- 11 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1        of this Code, the temporary removal of a child from 2        attendance in group settings may be used. Temporary 3        removal of a child from attendance in a group setting 4        shall trigger the process detailed in subparagraphs 5        (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph (7), with the child 6        placed back in a group setting as quickly as possible.7            (F) Early childhood programs may utilize and the 8        Department of Early Childhood, State Board of 9        Education, the Department of Human Services, and the 10        Department of Children and Family Services shall 11        recommend training, technical support, and 12        professional development resources to improve the 13        ability of teachers, administrators, program 14        directors, and other staff to promote social-emotional 15        development and behavioral health, to address 16        challenging behaviors, and to understand trauma and 17        trauma-informed care, cultural competence, family 18        engagement with diverse populations, the impact of 19        implicit bias on adult behavior, and the use of 20        reflective practice techniques. Support shall include 21        the availability of resources to contract with infant 22        and early childhood mental health consultants.23            (G) Through June 30, 2026, early childhood 24        programs shall annually report to the State Board of 25        Education, and, beginning in fiscal year 2020, the 26        State Board of Education shall make available on a   HB3772 Engrossed- 12 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1        biennial basis, in an existing report, all of the 2        following data for children from birth to age 5 who are 3        served by the program:4                (i) Total number served over the course of the 5            program year and the total number of children who 6            left the program during the program year.7                (ii) Number of planned transitions to another 8            program due to children's behavior, by children's 9            race, gender, disability, language, class/group 10            size, teacher-child ratio, and length of program 11            day.12                (iii) Number of temporary removals of a child 13            from attendance in group settings due to a serious 14            safety threat under subparagraph (E) of this 15            paragraph (7), by children's race, gender, 16            disability, language, class/group size, 17            teacher-child ratio, and length of program day.18                (iv) Hours of infant and early childhood 19            mental health consultant contact with program 20            leaders, staff, and families over the program 21            year.22            (G-5) On and after July 1, 2026, early childhood 23        programs shall annually report to the Department of 24        Early Childhood, and beginning in fiscal year 2028, 25        the Department of Early Childhood shall make available 26        on a biennial basis, in a report, all of the following   HB3772 Engrossed- 13 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1        data for children from birth to age 5 who are served by 2        the program:3                (i) Total number served over the course of the 4            program year and the total number of children who 5            left the program during the program year.6                (ii) Number of planned transitions to another 7            program due to children's behavior, by children's 8            race, gender, disability, language, class/group 9            size, teacher-child ratio, and length of program 10            day.11                (iii) Number of temporary removals of a child 12            from attendance in group settings due to a serious 13            safety threat under subparagraph (E) of this 14            paragraph (7), by children's race, gender, 15            disability, language, class/group size, 16            teacher-child ratio, and length of program day.17                (iv) Hours of infant and early childhood 18            mental health consultant contact with program 19            leaders, staff, and families over the program 20            year. 21            (H) Changes to services for children with an 22        individualized education program or individual family 23        service plan shall be construed in a manner consistent 24        with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 25        Education Act.26        The Department of Early Childhood, in consultation   HB3772 Engrossed- 14 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1    with the Department of Children and Family Services, shall 2    adopt rules to administer this paragraph (7). 3        (8) Due to evidence that suspension practices in the 4    preschool years are linked to poor child outcomes and are 5    employed inconsistently across racial and gender groups, 6    early childhood programs that receive State funds under 7    this subsection (a) shall restrict suspensions as provided 8    in this paragraph (8). Planned transitions to settings 9    that are able to better meet a child's needs are not 10    considered a suspension for purposes of this paragraph 11    (8). The decision to suspend a student in preschool for 4 12    or more days may be made only by the superintendent of the 13    school district, the director of an early childhood 14    program, or an individual with comparable supervisory 15    authority, and the length of the suspension of a student 16    in preschool may not exceed the number of days required by 17    the school district or early childhood program to develop 18    and implement a behavior intervention plan or safety plan. 19    (b) (Blank).20    (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, 21grantees may serve children ages 0 to 12 of essential workers 22if the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health 23emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency 24Management Agency Act. For the purposes of this subsection, 25essential workers include those outlined in Executive Order 2620-8 and school employees. The State Board of Education shall   HB3772 Engrossed- 15 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1adopt rules to administer this subsection. 2    (d) Paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(1.5), (a)(4.5), (a)(5), 3(a)(5.1), (a)(6), (a)(6.1), and (a)(7) and subsection (c) of 4this Section are inoperative on and after July 1, 2026. 5(Source: P.A. 103-111, eff. 6-29-23; 103-594, eff. 6-25-24.) 6    (105 ILCS 5/2-3.162)7    Sec. 2-3.162. Student discipline report; school discipline 8improvement plan. 9    (a) On or before October 31, 2015 and on or before October 1031 of each subsequent year, the State Board of Education, 11through the State Superintendent of Education, shall prepare a 12report on student discipline in all school districts in this 13State, including State-authorized charter schools. This report 14shall include data from all public schools within school 15districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This 16report must be posted on the Internet website of the State 17Board of Education. The report shall include data on the 18issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and 19removals to alternative settings in lieu of another 20disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, 21gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English 22learner, incident type, and discipline duration. On or before 23July 31, 2026, and on or before each July 31 thereafter, each 24school district in the State, including State-authorized 25charter schools shall report this data to the State Board of   HB3772 Engrossed- 16 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1Education in the form and manner prescribed by the State Board 2of Education. 3    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data 4under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and 5determine the top 20% of school districts for the following 6metrics:7        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided 8    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 9    September for the year in which the data was collected, 10    multiplied by 100.11        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided 12    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 13    September for the year in which the data was collected, 14    multiplied by 100.15        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the 16    overrepresentation of students of color or white students 17    in comparison to the total number of students of color or 18    white students on October 1st of the school year in which 19    data are collected, with respect to the use of 20    out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be 21    calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of 22    Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.23    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 24consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school 25year.26    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board   HB3772 Engrossed- 17 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1of Education shall require each of the school districts that 2are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described 3in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan 4identifying the strategies the school district will implement 5to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or 6racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School 7districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 8the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 9years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 10    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 11required under federal or State law.12    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 13described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 14districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 15charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10 16out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is 17applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 1820% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 19subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an 20enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 21students of color.22    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 23and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 24one year after being identified, the school district shall 25submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 26district's Internet website a progress report describing the   HB3772 Engrossed- 18 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 2(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 3100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 4    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)5    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)6    Sec. 10-22.6. Suspension or expulsion of students; school 7searches. 8    (a) To expel students guilty of gross disobedience or 9misconduct, including gross disobedience or misconduct 10perpetuated by electronic means, pursuant to subsection (b-20) 11of this Section, and no action shall lie against them for such 12expulsion. Expulsion shall take place only after the parents 13have been requested to appear at a meeting of the board, or 14with a hearing officer appointed by it, to discuss their 15child's behavior. Such request shall be made by registered or 16certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 17the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 18at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 19date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 20hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 21shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 22heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 23as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 24the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 25reasons why removing the student from the learning environment   HB3772 Engrossed- 19 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 2shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 3the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 4transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 5in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 6denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 7which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 8of students or staff in the alternative program. 9    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 10superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 11principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 12students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 13suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 14the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 15subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 16shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 17policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 18principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 19school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 20to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 21gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 22may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 23reasons. 24    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 25parents or guardian of a student along with a full statement of 26the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right to   HB3772 Engrossed- 20 -LRB104 10321 LNS 20395 b1a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 2notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 3suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardian, 4the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 5review such action of the superintendent or principal, 6assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 7parents or guardian of the student may appear and discuss the 8suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 9officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 10a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 11its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 12hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 13appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 14subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 15decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 16misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 17suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 18specific duration of the suspension. 19    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 20and consequences available to school officials, school 21exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 22are the most serious.
