Planned 9    transitions to settings that are able to better meet a 10    child's needs are not considered expulsion under this 11    paragraph (7).12            (A) When persistent and serious challenging 13        behaviors emerge, the early childhood program shall 14        document steps taken to ensure that the child can 15        participate safely in the program; including 16        observations of initial and ongoing challenging 17        behaviors, strategies for remediation and intervention 18        plans to address the behaviors, and communication with 19        the parent or legal guardian, including participation 20        of the parent or legal guardian in planning and 21        decision-making.22            (B) The early childhood program shall, with 23        parental or legal guardian consent as required, 24        utilize a range of community resources, if available 25        and deemed necessary, including, but not limited to, 26        developmental screenings, referrals to programs and   10400HB3772ham001- 10 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1        services administered by a local educational agency or 2        early intervention agency under Parts B and C of the 3        federal Individual with Disabilities Education Act, 4        and consultation with infant and early childhood 5        mental health consultants and the child's health care 6        provider.

The State Board of 6    Education shall compile all such written notices and make 7    them available to the public. On and after July 1, 2026, if 8    the appropriate local Head Start agency is unable or 9    unwilling to enter into a memorandum of understanding as 10    required under this paragraph (4.5), the memorandum of 11    understanding requirement shall not apply and the grantee 12    under the program must notify the Department of Early 13    Childhood in writing of the Head Start agency's inability 14    or unwillingness. The Department of Early Childhood shall 15    compile all such written notices and make them available 16    to the public. 17        (5) Through June 30, 2026, the State Board of 18    Education shall develop and provide evaluation tools, 19    including tests, that school districts and other eligible 20    entities may use to evaluate children for school readiness 21    prior to age 5. The State Board of Education shall require 22    school districts and other eligible entities to obtain 23    consent from the parents or guardians of children before 24    any evaluations are conducted. The State Board of 25    Education shall encourage local school districts and other 26    eligible entities to evaluate the population of preschool   10400HB3772ham001- 7 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1    children in their communities and provide preschool 2    programs, pursuant to this subsection, where appropriate.3        (5.1) On and after July 1, 2026, the Department of 4    Early Childhood shall develop and provide evaluation 5    tools, including tests, that school districts and other 6    eligible entities may use to evaluate children for school 7    readiness prior to age 5. The Department of Early 8    Childhood shall require school districts and other 9    eligible entities to obtain consent from the parents or 10    guardians of children before any evaluations are 11    conducted. The Department of Early Childhood shall 12    encourage local school districts and other eligible 13    entities to evaluate the population of preschool children 14    in their communities and provide preschool programs, 15    pursuant to this subsection, where appropriate. 16        (6) Through June 30, 2026, the State Board of 17    Education shall report to the General Assembly by November 18    1, 2018 and every 2 years thereafter on the results and 19    progress of students who were enrolled in preschool 20    educational programs, including an assessment of which 21    programs have been most successful in promoting academic 22    excellence and alleviating academic failure. Through June 23    30, 2026, the State Board of Education shall assess the 24    academic progress of all students who have been enrolled 25    in preschool educational programs.26        Through fiscal year 2026, on or before November 1 of   10400HB3772ham001- 8 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1    each fiscal year in which the General Assembly provides 2    funding for new programs under paragraph (4.5) of this 3    Section, the State Board of Education shall report to the 4    General Assembly on what percentage of new funding was 5    provided to programs serving primarily at-risk children, 6    what percentage of new funding was provided to programs 7    serving primarily children with a family income of less 8    than 4 times the federal poverty level, and what 9    percentage of new funding was provided to other programs. 10        (6.1) On and after July 1, 2026, the Department of 11    Early Childhood shall report to the General Assembly by 12    November 1, 2026 and every 2 years thereafter on the 13    results and progress of students who were enrolled in 14    preschool educational programs, including an assessment of 15    which programs have been most successful in promoting 16    academic excellence and alleviating academic failure. On 17    and after July 1, 2026, the Department of Early Childhood 18    shall assess the academic progress of all students who 19    have been enrolled in preschool educational programs. 20    Beginning in fiscal year 2027, on or before November 1 of 21    each fiscal year in which the General Assembly provides 22    funding for new programs under paragraph (4.5) of this 23    Section, the Department of Early Childhood shall report to 24    the General Assembly on what percentage of new funding was 25    provided to programs serving primarily at-risk children, 26    what percentage of new funding was provided to programs   10400HB3772ham001- 9 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1    serving primarily children with a family income of less 2    than 4 times the federal poverty level, and what 3    percentage of new funding was provided to other programs. 4        (7) Due to evidence that expulsion practices in the 5    preschool years are linked to poor child outcomes and are 6    employed inconsistently across racial and gender groups, 7    early childhood programs receiving State funds under this 8    subsection (a) shall prohibit expulsions. Planned 9    transitions to settings that are able to better meet a 10    child's needs are not considered expulsion under this 11    paragraph (7).12            (A) When persistent and serious challenging 13        behaviors emerge, the early childhood program shall 14        document steps taken to ensure that the child can 15        participate safely in the program; including 16        observations of initial and ongoing challenging 17        behaviors, strategies for remediation and intervention 18        plans to address the behaviors, and communication with 19        the parent or legal guardian, including participation 20        of the parent or legal guardian in planning and 21        decision-making.22            (B) The early childhood program shall, with 23        parental or legal guardian consent as required, 24        utilize a range of community resources, if available 25        and deemed necessary, including, but not limited to, 26        developmental screenings, referrals to programs and   10400HB3772ham001- 10 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1        services administered by a local educational agency or 2        early intervention agency under Parts B and C of the 3        federal Individual with Disabilities Education Act, 4        and consultation with infant and early childhood 5        mental health consultants and the child's health care 6        provider. The program shall document attempts to 7        engage these resources, including parent or legal 8        guardian participation and consent attempted and 9        obtained. Communication with the parent or legal 10        guardian shall take place in a culturally and 11        linguistically competent manner.12            (C) If there is documented evidence that all 13        available interventions and supports recommended by a 14        qualified professional have been exhausted and the 15        program determines in its professional judgment that 16        transitioning a child to another program is necessary 17        for the well-being of the child or his or her peers and 18        staff, with parent or legal guardian permission, both 19        the current and pending programs shall create a 20        transition plan designed to ensure continuity of 21        services and the comprehensive development of the 22        child. Communication with families shall occur in a 23        culturally and linguistically competent manner.24            (D) Nothing in this paragraph (7) shall preclude a 25        parent's or legal guardian's right to voluntarily 26        withdraw his or her child from an early childhood   10400HB3772ham001- 11 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1        program. Early childhood programs shall request and 2        keep on file, when received, a written statement from 3        the parent or legal guardian stating the reason for 4        his or her decision to withdraw his or her child.5            (E) In the case of the determination of a serious 6        safety threat to a child or others or in the case of 7        behaviors listed in subsection (d) of Section 10-22.6 8        of this Code, the temporary removal of a child from 9        attendance in group settings may be used. Temporary 10        removal of a child from attendance in a group setting 11        shall trigger the process detailed in subparagraphs 12        (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph (7), with the child 13        placed back in a group setting as quickly as possible.14            (F) Early childhood programs may utilize and the 15        Department of Early Childhood, State Board of 16        Education, the Department of Human Services, and the 17        Department of Children and Family Services shall 18        recommend training, technical support, and 19        professional development resources to improve the 20        ability of teachers, administrators, program 21        directors, and other staff to promote social-emotional 22        development and behavioral health, to address 23        challenging behaviors, and to understand trauma and 24        trauma-informed care, cultural competence, family 25        engagement with diverse populations, the impact of 26        implicit bias on adult behavior, and the use of   10400HB3772ham001- 12 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1        reflective practice techniques. Support shall include 2        the availability of resources to contract with infant 3        and early childhood mental health consultants.4            (G) Through June 30, 2026, early childhood 5        programs shall annually report to the State Board of 6        Education, and, beginning in fiscal year 2020, the 7        State Board of Education shall make available on a 8        biennial basis, in an existing report, all of the 9        following data for children from birth to age 5 who are 10        served by the program:11                (i) Total number served over the course of the 12            program year and the total number of children who 13            left the program during the program year.14                (ii) Number of planned transitions to another 15            program due to children's behavior, by children's 16            race, gender, disability, language, class/group 17            size, teacher-child ratio, and length of program 18            day.19                (iii) Number of temporary removals of a child 20            from attendance in group settings due to a serious 21            safety threat under subparagraph (E) of this 22            paragraph (7), by children's race, gender, 23            disability, language, class/group size, 24            teacher-child ratio, and length of program day.25                (iv) Hours of infant and early childhood 26            mental health consultant contact with program   10400HB3772ham001- 13 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1            leaders, staff, and families over the program 2            year.3            (G-5) On and after July 1, 2026, early childhood 4        programs shall annually report to the Department of 5        Early Childhood, and beginning in fiscal year 2028, 6        the Department of Early Childhood shall make available 7        on a biennial basis, in a report, all of the following 8        data for children from birth to age 5 who are served by 9        the program:10                (i) Total number served over the course of the 11            program year and the total number of children who 12            left the program during the program year.13                (ii) Number of planned transitions to another 14            program due to children's behavior, by children's 15            race, gender, disability, language, class/group 16            size, teacher-child ratio, and length of program 17            day.18                (iii) Number of temporary removals of a child 19            from attendance in group settings due to a serious 20            safety threat under subparagraph (E) of this 21            paragraph (7), by children's race, gender, 22            disability, language, class/group size, 23            teacher-child ratio, and length of program day.24                (iv) Hours of infant and early childhood 25            mental health consultant contact with program 26            leaders, staff, and families over the program   10400HB3772ham001- 14 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1            year. 2            (H) Changes to services for children with an 3        individualized education program or individual family 4        service plan shall be construed in a manner consistent 5        with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 6        Education Act.7        The Department of Early Childhood, in consultation 8    with the Department of Children and Family Services, shall 9    adopt rules to administer this paragraph (7). 10        (8) Due to evidence that suspension practices in the 11    preschool years are linked to poor child outcomes and are 12    employed inconsistently across racial and gender groups, 13    early childhood programs that receive State funds under 14    this subsection (a) shall restrict suspensions as provided 15    in this paragraph (8). Planned transitions to settings 16    that are able to better meet a child's needs are not 17    considered a suspension for purposes of this paragraph 18    (8). The decision to suspend a student in preschool for 4 19    or more days may be made only by the superintendent of the 20    school district, the director of an early childhood 21    program, or an individual with comparable supervisory 22    authority, and the length of the suspension of a student 23    in preschool may not exceed the number of days required by 24    the school district or early childhood program to develop 25    and implement a behavior intervention plan or safety plan. 26    (b) (Blank).  10400HB3772ham001- 15 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1    (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, 2grantees may serve children ages 0 to 12 of essential workers 3if the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health 4emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency 5Management Agency Act.

This report 21shall include data from all public schools within school 22districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This 23report must be posted on the Internet website of the State 24Board of Education. The report shall include data on the 25issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and   10400HB3772ham001- 16 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1removals to alternative settings in lieu of another 2disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, 3gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English 4learner, incident type, and discipline duration. On or before 5July 31, 2026, and on or before each July 31 thereafter, each 6school district in the State, including State-authorized 7charter schools shall report this data to the State Board of 8Education in the form and manner prescribed by the State Board 9of Education. 10    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data 11under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and 12determine the top 20% of school districts for the following 13metrics:14        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided 15    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 16    September for the year in which the data was collected, 17    multiplied by 100.18        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided 19    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 20    September for the year in which the data was collected, 21    multiplied by 100.22        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the 23    overrepresentation of students of color or white students 24    in comparison to the total number of students of color or 25    white students on October 1st of the school year in which 26    data are collected, with respect to the use of   10400HB3772ham001- 17 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1    out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be 2    calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of 3    Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.4    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 5consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school 6year.7    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board 8of Education shall require each of the school districts that 9are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described 10in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan 11identifying the strategies the school district will implement 12to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or 13racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School 14districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 15the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 16years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 17    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 18required under federal or State law.19    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 20described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 21districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 22charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10 23out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is 24applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 2520% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 26subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an   10400HB3772ham001- 18 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 2students of color.3    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 4and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 5one year after being identified, the school district shall 6submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 7district's Internet website a progress report describing the 8implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 9(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 10100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 11    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)12    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)13    Sec. 10-22.6. Suspension or expulsion of students; school 14searches. 15    (a) To expel students guilty of gross disobedience or 16misconduct, including gross disobedience or misconduct 17perpetuated by electronic means, pursuant to subsection (b-20) 18of this Section, and no action shall lie against them for such 19expulsion. Expulsion shall take place only after the parents 20have been requested to appear at a meeting of the board, or 21with a hearing officer appointed by it, to discuss their 22child's behavior. Such request shall be made by registered or 23certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 24the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 25at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the   10400HB3772ham001- 19 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 2hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 3shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 4heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 5as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 6the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 7reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 8is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 9shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 10the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 11transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 12in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 13denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 14which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 15of students or staff in the alternative program. 16    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 17superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 18principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 19students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 20suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 21the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 22subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 23shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 24policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 25principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 26school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not   10400HB3772ham001- 20 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 2gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 3may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 4reasons. 5    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 6parents or guardian of a student along with a full statement of 7the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right to 8a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 9notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 10suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardian, 11the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 12review such action of the superintendent or principal, 13assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 14parents or guardian of the student may appear and discuss the 15suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 16officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 17a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 18its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 19hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 20appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 21subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 22decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 23misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 24suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 25specific duration of the suspension. 26    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions   10400HB3772ham001- 21 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25031 a1and consequences available to school officials, school 2exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 3are the most serious.
