This report 16shall include data from all public schools within school   10400HB3772sam004- 2 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This 2report must be posted on the Internet website of the State 3Board of Education. The report shall include data on the 4issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and 5removals to alternative settings in lieu of another 6disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, 7gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English 8learner, incident type, and discipline duration. Such data 9shall be reported to the State Board of Education annually by 10all school districts in this State, including State-authorized 11charter schools, in a form and manner specified by the State 12Board of Education, no later than July 31 for the previous 13school year and by July 31 of each year thereafter. 14    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data 15under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and 16determine the top 20% of school districts for the following 17metrics:18        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided 19    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 20    September for the year in which the data was collected, 21    multiplied by 100.22        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided 23    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 24    September for the year in which the data was collected, 25    multiplied by 100.26        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the   10400HB3772sam004- 3 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1    overrepresentation of students of color or white students 2    in comparison to the total number of students of color or 3    white students on October 1st of the school year in which 4    data are collected, with respect to the use of 5    out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be 6    calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of 7    Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.8    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 9consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school 10year.11    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board 12of Education shall require each of the school districts that 13are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described 14in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan 15identifying the strategies the school district will implement 16to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or 17racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School 18districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 19the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 20years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 21    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 22required under federal or State law.23    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 24described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 25districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 26charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10   10400HB3772sam004- 4 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is 2applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 320% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 4subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an 5enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 6students of color.7    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 8and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 9one year after being identified, the school district shall 10submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 11district's Internet website a progress report describing the 12implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 13(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 14100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 15    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)16    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)17    Sec. 10-22.6.

School officials shall limit the number 8and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 9extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 10only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 11students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 12recommended that school officials consider forms of 13non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 14suspensions or expulsions. 15    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 16Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 17by which school administrators are required to suspend or 18expel students for particular behaviors.19    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 20used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 21pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 22students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 23subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 24other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 25a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 26School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve   10400HB3772sam004- 8 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 2length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.3    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 4out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 5and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 6only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 7disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 8student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 9a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 10the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 11interfere with the operation of the school.

Student discipline report; school discipline 10improvement plan. 11    (a) On or before October 31, 2015 and on or before October 1231 of each subsequent year, the State Board of Education, 13through the State Superintendent of Education, shall prepare a 14report on student discipline in all school districts in this 15State, including State-authorized charter schools. This report 16shall include data from all public schools within school   10400HB3772sam004- 2 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This 2report must be posted on the Internet website of the State 3Board of Education. The report shall include data on the 4issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and 5removals to alternative settings in lieu of another 6disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, 7gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English 8learner, incident type, and discipline duration. Such data 9shall be reported to the State Board of Education annually by 10all school districts in this State, including State-authorized 11charter schools, in a form and manner specified by the State 12Board of Education, no later than July 31 for the previous 13school year and by July 31 of each year thereafter. 14    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data 15under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and 16determine the top 20% of school districts for the following 17metrics:18        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided 19    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 20    September for the year in which the data was collected, 21    multiplied by 100.22        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided 23    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 24    September for the year in which the data was collected, 25    multiplied by 100.26        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the   10400HB3772sam004- 3 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1    overrepresentation of students of color or white students 2    in comparison to the total number of students of color or 3    white students on October 1st of the school year in which 4    data are collected, with respect to the use of 5    out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be 6    calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of 7    Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.8    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 9consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school 10year.11    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board 12of Education shall require each of the school districts that 13are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described 14in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan 15identifying the strategies the school district will implement 16to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or 17racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School 18districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 19the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 20years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 21    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 22required under federal or State law.23    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 24described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 25districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 26charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10   10400HB3772sam004- 4 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is 2applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 320% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 4subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an 5enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 6students of color.7    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 8and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 9one year after being identified, the school district shall 10submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 11district's Internet website a progress report describing the 12implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 13(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 14100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 15    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)16    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)17    Sec. 10-22.6. Suspension or expulsion of students; school 18searches. 19    (a) To expel students guilty of gross disobedience or 20misconduct, including gross disobedience or misconduct 21perpetuated by electronic means, pursuant to subsection (b-20) 22of this Section, and no action shall lie against them for such 23expulsion. Expulsion shall take place only after the parents 24have been requested to appear at a meeting of the board, or 25with a hearing officer appointed by it, to discuss their   10400HB3772sam004- 5 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1child's behavior. Such request shall be made by registered or 2certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 3the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 4at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 5date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 6hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 7shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 8heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 9as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 10the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 11reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 12is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 13shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 14the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 15transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 16in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 17denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 18which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 19of students or staff in the alternative program. 20    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 21superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 22principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 23students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 24suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 25the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 26subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action   10400HB3772sam004- 6 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 2policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 3principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 4school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 5to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 6gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 7may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 8reasons. 9    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 10parents or guardian of a student along with a full statement of 11the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right to 12a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 13notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 14suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardian, 15the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 16review such action of the superintendent or principal, 17assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 18parents or guardian of the student may appear and discuss the 19suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 20officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 21a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 22its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 23hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 24appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 25subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 26decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or   10400HB3772sam004- 7 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 2suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 3specific duration of the suspension. 4    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 5and consequences available to school officials, school 6exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 7are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 8and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 9extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 10only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 11students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 12recommended that school officials consider forms of 13non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 14suspensions or expulsions. 15    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 16Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 17by which school administrators are required to suspend or 18expel students for particular behaviors.19    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 20used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 21pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 22students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 23subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 24other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 25a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 26School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve   10400HB3772sam004- 8 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 2length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.3    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 4out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 5and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 6only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 7disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 8student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 9a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 10the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 11interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 12this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 13students, staff, or members of the school community" and 14"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 15operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 16basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 17(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 18available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 19exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 20shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 21address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 22exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 23suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 24Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 25of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 26interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that   10400HB3772sam004- 9 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1there were no other appropriate and available interventions.2    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 3than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 4support services during the period of their suspension. For 5purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 6support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 7Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 8this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 9to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 10such appropriate and available services. 11    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 12appropriate and available support services.13    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 14re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 15expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 16consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 17Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 18and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 19suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 20alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 21Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 22    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 23suspended students, including those students suspended from 24the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 25school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 26equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of   10400HB3772sam004- 10 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1a student's parent or guardian to notify school officials that 2a student suspended from the school bus does not have 3alternate transportation to school. 4    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 5local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 6meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 7the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.8    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 9provide ongoing professional development to all school 10personnel, school board members, and school resource officers, 11on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 12adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 13involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 14culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 15environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 16the appropriate and available supportive services for the 17promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 18developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 19positive and healthy school climates. 20    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 21time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 22case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 23brought one of the following objects to school, any 24school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 25that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 26expelled for a period of not less than one year:  10400HB3772sam004- 11 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 2    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 3    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 4    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 5    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 6    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012.

The expulsion 15    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 16    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 17    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 18Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 19consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 20Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 21expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 22transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 23Article 13A of the School Code.24    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 25superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 26principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a   10400HB3772sam004- 12 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 2a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 3calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 4that student has been determined to have made an explicit 5threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 6student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 7website through which the threat was made is a site that was 8accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 9was available to third parties who worked or studied within 10the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 11the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 12the safety and security of the threatened individual because 13of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 14student inside the school. 15    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 16authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 17lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 18equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 19personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 20without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 21search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 22Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 23privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 24left in these places and areas.

Unless otherwise required by 4subsection (d), in no case may a school board expel a student 5in kindergarten through grade 2. No action may be brought 6against the school board for an expulsion in kindergarten 7through grade 2 pursuant to subsection (d). Subject to this 8grade-level restriction, expulsion Expulsion shall take place 9only after the parents or guardians have been requested to 10appear at a meeting of the board, or with a hearing officer 11appointed by it, to discuss their child's behavior.

If a hearing officer is 17appointed by the board, the hearing officer shall report to 18the board a written summary of the evidence heard at the 19meeting and the board may take such action thereon as it finds 20appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, the written 21expulsion decision shall detail the specific reasons why 22removing the student from the learning environment is in the 23best interest of the school. The expulsion decision shall also 24include a rationale as to the specific duration of the 25expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately transferred 26to an alternative program in the manner provided in Article   10400HB3772sam004- 16 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a113A or 13B of this Code.

The board may by 13policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 14principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 15school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 16to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 17gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 18may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 19reasons. The superintendent of the school district shall be 20required to provide verbal or written approval to suspend a 21student in kindergarten through grade 2 for longer than 3 22school days. If superintendent approval is not received by the 23third day, the student shall return to school by the fourth 24day. For suspensions of longer than 3 days, the length of the 25suspension for any student in kindergarten through grade 2 26shall not be for longer than the number of days required by the   10400HB3772sam004- 17 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1school district to review, amend, develop, or implement a 2behavior intervention plan or safety plan. 3    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 4parents or guardians of a student along with a full statement 5of the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right 6to a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 7notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 8suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardians, 9the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 10review such action of the superintendent or principal, 11assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 12parents or guardians of the student may appear and discuss the 13suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 14officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 15a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting.

The 22suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 23specific duration of the suspension. 24    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 25and consequences available to school officials, school 26exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions,   10400HB3772sam004- 18 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 2and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 3extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 4only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 5students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 6recommended that school officials consider forms of 7non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 8suspensions or expulsions. 9    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by subsection (d) federal 10law or this Code, school boards may not institute 11zero-tolerance policies by which school administrators are 12required to suspend or expel students for particular 13behaviors.14    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 15used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 16pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 17students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 18subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 19other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 20a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 21School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 22such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 23length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.24    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 25out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions 26for students in grades 3 through 12 or, if required by   10400HB3772sam004- 19 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1subsection (d), expulsions for students in kindergarten 2through grade 2, and disciplinary removals to alternative 3schools for students who meet the grade-level restrictions set 4forth in Articles 13A and 13B may be used only if other 5appropriate and available behavioral and disciplinary 6interventions have been exhausted and the student's continuing 7presence in school would either (i) pose a threat to the safety 8of other students, staff, or members of the school community 9or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 10operation of the school. For purposes of this subsection 11(b-20), "threat to the safety of other students, staff, or 12members of the school community" and "substantially disrupt, 13impede, or interfere with the operation of the school" shall 14be determined on a case-by-case basis by school officials. For 15purposes of this subsection (b-20), the determination of 16whether "appropriate and available behavioral and disciplinary 17interventions have been exhausted" shall be made by school 18officials. School officials shall make all reasonable efforts 19to resolve such threats, address such disruptions, and 20minimize the length of student exclusions to the greatest 21extent practicable. Within the suspension decision described 22in subsection (b) of this Section or the expulsion decision 23described in subsection (a) of this Section, it shall be 24documented whether other interventions were attempted or 25whether it was determined that there were no other appropriate 26and available interventions.  10400HB3772sam004- 20 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 2than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 3support services during the period of their suspension. For 4purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 5support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 6Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 7this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 8to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 9such appropriate and available services. The superintendent of 10the school district shall be required to provide verbal or 11written approval to suspend a student in kindergarten through 12grade 2 for longer than 3 school days. If superintendent 13approval is not received by the third day, the student shall 14return to school by the fourth day. 15    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 16appropriate and available support services.17    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 18re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 19expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 20consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 21Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 22and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 23suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 24alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 25Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 26    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which   10400HB3772sam004- 21 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1suspended students, including those students suspended from 2the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 3school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 4equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 5a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 6that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 7alternate transportation to school. 8    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 9subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 10subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be 11considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 12parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 13violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 14parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 15emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 16throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 17its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 18student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 19emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany 20the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 21representative or support person must comply with any rules of 22the school district's hearing process.

Planned 9    transitions to settings that are able to better meet a 10    child's needs are not considered expulsion under this 11    paragraph (7).12            (A) When persistent and serious challenging 13        behaviors emerge, the early childhood program shall 14        document steps taken to ensure that the child can 15        participate safely in the program; including 16        observations of initial and ongoing challenging 17        behaviors, strategies for remediation and intervention 18        plans to address the behaviors, and communication with 19        the parent or legal guardian, including participation 20        of the parent or legal guardian in planning and 21        decision-making.22            (B) The early childhood program shall, with 23        parental or legal guardian consent as required, use a 24        range of community resources, if available and deemed 25        necessary, including, but not limited to, 26        developmental screenings, referrals to programs and   10400HB3772sam004- 39 -LRB104 10321 LNS 26712 a1        services administered by a local educational agency or 2        early intervention agency under Parts B and C of the 3        federal Individual with Disabilities Education Act, 4        and consultation with infant and early childhood 5        mental health consultants and the child's health care 6        provider.
