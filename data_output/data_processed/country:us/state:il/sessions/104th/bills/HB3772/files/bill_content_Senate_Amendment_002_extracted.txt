This report 15shall include data from all public schools within school 16districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This   10400HB3772sam002- 2 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1report must be posted on the Internet website of the State 2Board of Education. The report shall include data on the 3issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and 4removals to alternative settings in lieu of another 5disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, 6gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English 7learner, incident type, and discipline duration. Such data 8shall be reported to the State Board of Education annually by 9all school districts in this State, including State-authorized 10charter schools, in a form and manner specified by the State 11Board of Education, no later than July 31 for the previous 12school year and by July 31 of each year thereafter. 13    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data 14under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and 15determine the top 20% of school districts for the following 16metrics:17        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided 18    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 19    September for the year in which the data was collected, 20    multiplied by 100.21        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided 22    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 23    September for the year in which the data was collected, 24    multiplied by 100.25        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the 26    overrepresentation of students of color or white students   10400HB3772sam002- 3 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1    in comparison to the total number of students of color or 2    white students on October 1st of the school year in which 3    data are collected, with respect to the use of 4    out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be 5    calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of 6    Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.7    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 8consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school 9year.10    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board 11of Education shall require each of the school districts that 12are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described 13in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan 14identifying the strategies the school district will implement 15to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or 16racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School 17districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 18the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 19years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 20    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 21required under federal or State law.22    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 23described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 24districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 25charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10 26out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is   10400HB3772sam002- 4 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 220% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 3subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an 4enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 5students of color.6    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 7and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 8one year after being identified, the school district shall 9submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 10district's Internet website a progress report describing the 11implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 12(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 13100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 14    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)15    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)16    Sec. 10-22.6.

If the board acts to expel a student, 9the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 10reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 11is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 12shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 13the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 14transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 15in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 16denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 17which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 18of students or staff in the alternative program. 19    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 20superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 21principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 22students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 23suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 24the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 25subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 26shall lie against them for such suspension.

School officials shall limit the number 7and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 8extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 9only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 10students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 11recommended that school officials consider forms of 12non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 13suspensions or expulsions. 14    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 15Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 16by which school administrators are required to suspend or 17expel students for particular behaviors.18    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 19used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 20pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 21students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 22subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 23other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 24a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 25School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 26such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the   10400HB3772sam002- 8 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.2    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 3out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 4and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 5only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 6disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 7student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 8a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 9the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 10interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 11this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 12students, staff, or members of the school community" and 13"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 14operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 15basis by school officials.

School officials 19shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 20address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 21exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 22suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 23Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 24of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 25interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 26there were no other appropriate and available interventions.  10400HB3772sam002- 9 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 2than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 3support services during the period of their suspension.

A student who is subject to suspension or 20expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 21transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 22Article 13A of the School Code.23    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 24superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 25principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 26student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel   10400HB3772sam002- 12 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 2calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 3that student has been determined to have made an explicit 4threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 5student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 6website through which the threat was made is a site that was 7accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 8was available to third parties who worked or studied within 9the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 10the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 11the safety and security of the threatened individual because 12of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 13student inside the school. 14    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 15authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 16lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 17equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 18personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 19without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 20search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 21Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 22privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 23left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 24the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 25conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 26lots, and other school property and equipment owned or   10400HB3772sam002- 13 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 2illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 3searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 4If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 5evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 6the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 7such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 8disciplinary action may be taken.

Student discipline report; school discipline 9improvement plan. 10    (a) On or before October 31, 2015 and on or before October 1131 of each subsequent year, the State Board of Education, 12through the State Superintendent of Education, shall prepare a 13report on student discipline in all school districts in this 14State, including State-authorized charter schools. This report 15shall include data from all public schools within school 16districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This   10400HB3772sam002- 2 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1report must be posted on the Internet website of the State 2Board of Education. The report shall include data on the 3issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and 4removals to alternative settings in lieu of another 5disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, 6gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English 7learner, incident type, and discipline duration. Such data 8shall be reported to the State Board of Education annually by 9all school districts in this State, including State-authorized 10charter schools, in a form and manner specified by the State 11Board of Education, no later than July 31 for the previous 12school year and by July 31 of each year thereafter. 13    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data 14under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and 15determine the top 20% of school districts for the following 16metrics:17        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided 18    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 19    September for the year in which the data was collected, 20    multiplied by 100.21        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided 22    by the total district enrollment by the last school day in 23    September for the year in which the data was collected, 24    multiplied by 100.25        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the 26    overrepresentation of students of color or white students   10400HB3772sam002- 3 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1    in comparison to the total number of students of color or 2    white students on October 1st of the school year in which 3    data are collected, with respect to the use of 4    out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be 5    calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of 6    Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.7    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 8consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school 9year.10    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board 11of Education shall require each of the school districts that 12are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described 13in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan 14identifying the strategies the school district will implement 15to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or 16racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School 17districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of 18the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive 19years shall no longer be required to submit a plan. 20    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans 21required under federal or State law.22    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics 23described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school 24districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special 25charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10 26out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is   10400HB3772sam002- 4 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 220% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this 3subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an 4enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 5students of color.6    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting 7and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within 8one year after being identified, the school district shall 9submit to the State Board of Education and post on the 10district's Internet website a progress report describing the 11implementation of the plan and the results achieved. 12(Source: P.A. 99-30, eff. 7-10-15; 99-78, eff. 7-20-15; 13100-863, eff. 8-14-18.) 14    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)15    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)16    Sec. 10-22.6. Suspension or expulsion of students; school 17searches. 18    (a) To expel students guilty of gross disobedience or 19misconduct, including gross disobedience or misconduct 20perpetuated by electronic means, pursuant to subsection (b-20) 21of this Section, and no action shall lie against them for such 22expulsion. Expulsion shall take place only after the parents 23have been requested to appear at a meeting of the board, or 24with a hearing officer appointed by it, to discuss their 25child's behavior. Such request shall be made by registered or   10400HB3772sam002- 5 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 2the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 3at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 4date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 5hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 6shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 7heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 8as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 9the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 10reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 11is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision 12shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 13the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 14transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 15in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 16denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 17which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 18of students or staff in the alternative program. 19    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 20superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 21principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 22students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 23suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 24the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 25subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 26shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by   10400HB3772sam002- 6 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 2principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 3school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 4to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 5gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 6may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 7reasons. 8    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 9parents or guardian of a student along with a full statement of 10the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right to 11a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 12notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 13suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardian, 14the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 15review such action of the superintendent or principal, 16assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 17parents or guardian of the student may appear and discuss the 18suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 19officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 20a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 21its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 22hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 23appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 24subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 25decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 26misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The   10400HB3772sam002- 7 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 2specific duration of the suspension. 3    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 4and consequences available to school officials, school 5exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 6are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 7and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 8extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 9only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 10students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 11recommended that school officials consider forms of 12non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 13suspensions or expulsions. 14    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 15Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 16by which school administrators are required to suspend or 17expel students for particular behaviors.18    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 19used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 20pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 21students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 22subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 23other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 24a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 25School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 26such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the   10400HB3772sam002- 8 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.2    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 3out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 4and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 5only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 6disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 7student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 8a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 9the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 10interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 11this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 12students, staff, or members of the school community" and 13"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 14operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 15basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 16(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 17available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 18exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 19shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 20address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 21exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 22suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 23Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 24of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 25interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 26there were no other appropriate and available interventions.  10400HB3772sam002- 9 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 2than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 3support services during the period of their suspension. For 4purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 5support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 6Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 7this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 8to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 9such appropriate and available services. 10    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 11appropriate and available support services.12    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 13re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 14expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 15consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 16Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 17and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 18suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 19alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 20Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 21    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 22suspended students, including those students suspended from 23the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 24school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 25equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 26a student's parent or guardian to notify school officials that   10400HB3772sam002- 10 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1a student suspended from the school bus does not have 2alternate transportation to school. 3    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 4local mental health agency to consult with the board at the 5meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 6the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.7    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 8provide ongoing professional development to all school 9personnel, school board members, and school resource officers, 10on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 11adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 12involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 13culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 14environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 15the appropriate and available supportive services for the 16promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 17developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 18positive and healthy school climates. 19    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 20time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 21case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 22brought one of the following objects to school, any 23school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 24that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 25expelled for a period of not less than one year:26        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section,   10400HB3772sam002- 11 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 2    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 3    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 4    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 5    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period 6    under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the 7    superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may 8    be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.9        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon 10    regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other 11    object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily 12    harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in 13    subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). The expulsion 14    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 15    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 16    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 17Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 18consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 19Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 20expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 21transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 22Article 13A of the School Code.23    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 24superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 25principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 26student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel   10400HB3772sam002- 12 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 2calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 3that student has been determined to have made an explicit 4threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 5student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 6website through which the threat was made is a site that was 7accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 8was available to third parties who worked or studied within 9the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 10the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 11the safety and security of the threatened individual because 12of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 13student inside the school. 14    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 15authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 16lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 17equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 18personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 19without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 20search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 21Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 22privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 23left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 24the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 25conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 26lots, and other school property and equipment owned or   10400HB3772sam002- 13 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 2illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 3searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 4If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 5evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 6the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 7such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 8disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also 9turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.10    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or 11expulsion from school and all school activities and a 12prohibition from being present on school grounds.13    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if 14a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any 15public or private school in this or any other state, the 16student must complete the entire term of the suspension or 17expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A 18of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program 19under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the 20school district if there is no threat to the safety of students 21or staff in the alternative program.22    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 23students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 24difficulties.25    (i) A student may not be issued a monetary fine or fee as a 26disciplinary consequence, though this shall not preclude   10400HB3772sam002- 14 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, stolen, 2or damaged property.3    (j) Subsections (a) through (i) of this Section shall 4apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter schools, 5special charter districts, and school districts organized 6under Article 34 of this Code. 7    (k) The expulsion of students enrolled in programs funded 8under Section 1C-2 of this Code is subject to the requirements 9under paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 2-3.71 of 10this Code. 11    (l) An in-school suspension program provided by a school 12district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may 13focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and 14positive interaction with other students and school personnel. 15A school district may employ a school social worker or a 16licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school 17suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12. 18(Source: P.A. 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 19103-594, eff. 6-25-24; 103-896, eff. 8-9-24; revised 9-25-24.) 20    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 102-466)21    Sec. 10-22.6.

If a hearing officer is 16appointed by the board, the hearing officer shall report to 17the board a written summary of the evidence heard at the 18meeting and the board may take such action thereon as it finds 19appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, the written 20expulsion decision shall detail the specific reasons why 21removing the student from the learning environment is in the 22best interest of the school. The expulsion decision shall also 23include a rationale as to the specific duration of the 24expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately transferred 25to an alternative program in the manner provided in Article 2613A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be denied transfer   10400HB3772sam002- 16 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1because of the expulsion, except in cases in which such 2transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety of students 3or staff in the alternative program. 4    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 5superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 6principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 7students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 8suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 9the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 10subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 11shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 12policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 13principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 14school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 15to exceed 10 school days.

To ensure that 3students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 4recommended that school officials consider forms of 5non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 6suspensions or expulsions. 7    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by subsection (d) federal 8law or this Code, school boards may not institute 9zero-tolerance policies by which school administrators are 10required to suspend or expel students for particular 11behaviors.12    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 13used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 14pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 15students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 16subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 17other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 18a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 19School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 20such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 21length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.22    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 23out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions 24for students in grades 3 through 12 or, if required by 25subsection (d), expulsions for students in kindergarten 26through grade 2, and disciplinary removals to alternative   10400HB3772sam002- 19 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1schools for students who meet the grade-level restrictions set 2forth in Articles 13A and 13B may be used only if other 3appropriate and available behavioral and disciplinary 4interventions have been exhausted and the student's continuing 5presence in school would either (i) pose a threat to the safety 6of other students, staff, or members of the school community 7or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 8operation of the school. For purposes of this subsection 9(b-20), "threat to the safety of other students, staff, or 10members of the school community" and "substantially disrupt, 11impede, or interfere with the operation of the school" shall 12be determined on a case-by-case basis by school officials. For 13purposes of this subsection (b-20), the determination of 14whether "appropriate and available behavioral and disciplinary 15interventions have been exhausted" shall be made by school 16officials. School officials shall make all reasonable efforts 17to resolve such threats, address such disruptions, and 18minimize the length of student exclusions to the greatest 19extent practicable. Within the suspension decision described 20in subsection (b) of this Section or the expulsion decision 21described in subsection (a) of this Section, it shall be 22documented whether other interventions were attempted or 23whether it was determined that there were no other appropriate 24and available interventions.25    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 26than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available   10400HB3772sam002- 20 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1support services during the period of their suspension. For 2purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 3support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 4Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 5this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 6to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 7such appropriate and available services. The superintendent of 8the school district shall be required to provide verbal or 9written approval to suspend a student in kindergarten through 10grade 2 for longer than 3 school days. If superintendent 11approval is not received by the third day, the student shall 12return to school by the fourth day. 13    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 14appropriate and available support services.15    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 16re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 17expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 18consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 19Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 20and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 21suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 22alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 23Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 24    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 25suspended students, including those students suspended from 26the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to   10400HB3772sam002- 21 -LRB104 10321 LNS 25848 a1school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 2equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 3a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 4that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 5alternate transportation to school. 6    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 7subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 8subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be 9considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 10parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 11violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 12parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 13emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 14throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 15its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 16student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 17emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany 18the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 19representative or support person must comply with any rules of 20the school district's hearing process.
