The need for   10400HB3081sam001- 2 -LRB104 10878 LNS 26517 a1this policy is based on the following legislative findings:2        (1) The General Assembly finds that youth who are 3    engaged in quality out-of-school time programs and 4    community schools are more likely to succeed in academics, 5    employment, and civic affairs than youth who do not 6    participate in those programs. Youth with high levels of 7    participation in quality out-of-school time programs miss 8    fewer days of school, have lower drop-out rates, and 9    higher rates of graduation.

that is unique and responsive to its 8community; and that includes integrated student support, 9expanded learning opportunities, family engagement, and 10collaborative leadership.11    "Out-of-school time programs" means positive youth 12development activities provided to youth between the ages of 6 13and 19 during the hours before or after school, during the 14school year and summer recess from school, or during the 15weekends, including, but not limited to, programs that provide 16any one or more of the following: academic support;
