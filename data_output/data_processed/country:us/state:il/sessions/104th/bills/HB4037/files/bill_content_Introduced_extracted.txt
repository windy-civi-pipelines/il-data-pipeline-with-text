Effective December 1, 1985, 22"selling price" shall include charges that are added to prices 23by sellers on account of the seller's tax liability under the 24Cigarette Tax Act, on account of the seller's duty to collect, 25from the purchaser, the tax imposed under the Cigarette Use 26Tax Act, and on account of the seller's duty to collect, from   HB4037- 7 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1the purchaser, any cigarette tax imposed by a home rule unit.2    The provisions of this paragraph, which provides only for 3an alternative meaning of "selling price" with respect to the 4sale of certain motor vehicles incident to the contemporaneous 5lease of those motor vehicles, continue in effect and are not 6changed by the tax on leases implemented by Public Act 103-592 7this amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 8Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for any motor 9vehicle, as defined in Section 1-146 of the Vehicle Code, that 10is sold on or after January 1, 2015 for the purpose of leasing 11the vehicle for a defined period that is longer than one year 12and (1) is a motor vehicle of the second division that: (A) is 13a self-contained motor vehicle designed or permanently 14converted to provide living quarters for recreational, 15camping, or travel use, with direct walk through access to the 16living quarters from the driver's seat; (B) is of the van 17configuration designed for the transportation of not less than 187 nor more than 16 passengers; or (C) has a gross vehicle 19weight rating of 8,000 pounds or less or (2) is a motor vehicle 20of the first division, "selling price" or "amount of sale" 21means the consideration received by the lessor pursuant to the 22lease contract, including amounts due at lease signing and all 23monthly or other regular payments charged over the term of the 24lease. Also included in the selling price is any amount 25received by the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle 26that is not calculated at the time the lease is executed,   HB4037- 8 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1including, but not limited to, excess mileage charges and 2charges for excess wear and tear. For sales that occur in 3Illinois, with respect to any amount received by the lessor 4from the lessee for the leased vehicle that is not calculated 5at the time the lease is executed, the lessor who purchased the 6motor vehicle does not incur the tax imposed by the Use Tax Act 7on those amounts, and the retailer who makes the retail sale of 8the motor vehicle to the lessor is not required to collect the 9tax imposed by this Act or to pay the tax imposed by the 10Retailers' Occupation Tax Act on those amounts. However, the 11lessor who purchased the motor vehicle assumes the liability 12for reporting and paying the tax on those amounts directly to 13the Department in the same form (Illinois Retailers' 14Occupation Tax, and local retailers' occupation taxes, if 15applicable) in which the retailer would have reported and paid 16such tax if the retailer had accounted for the tax to the 17Department. For amounts received by the lessor from the lessee 18that are not calculated at the time the lease is executed, the 19lessor must file the return and pay the tax to the Department 20by the due date otherwise required by this Act for returns 21other than transaction returns. If the retailer is entitled 22under this Act to a discount for collecting and remitting the 23tax imposed under this Act to the Department with respect to 24the sale of the motor vehicle to the lessor, then the right to 25the discount provided in this Act shall be transferred to the 26lessor with respect to the tax paid by the lessor for any   HB4037- 9 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1amount received by the lessor from the lessee for the leased 2vehicle that is not calculated at the time the lease is 3executed; provided that the discount is only allowed if the 4return is timely filed and for amounts timely paid. The 5"selling price" of a motor vehicle that is sold on or after 6January 1, 2015 for the purpose of leasing for a defined period 7of longer than one year shall not be reduced by the value of or 8credit given for traded-in tangible personal property owned by 9the lessor, nor shall it be reduced by the value of or credit 10given for traded-in tangible personal property owned by the 11lessee, regardless of whether the trade-in value thereof is 12assigned by the lessee to the lessor. In the case of a motor 13vehicle that is sold for the purpose of leasing for a defined 14period of longer than one year, the sale occurs at the time of 15the delivery of the vehicle, regardless of the due date of any 16lease payments. A lessor who incurs a Retailers' Occupation 17Tax liability on the sale of a motor vehicle coming off lease 18may not take a credit against that liability for the Use Tax 19the lessor paid upon the purchase of the motor vehicle (or for 20any tax the lessor paid with respect to any amount received by 21the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle that was not 22calculated at the time the lease was executed) if the selling 23price of the motor vehicle at the time of purchase was 24calculated using the definition of "selling price" as defined 25in this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 26Act to the contrary, lessors shall file all returns and make   HB4037- 10 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1all payments required under this paragraph to the Department 2by electronic means in the manner and form as required by the 3Department. This paragraph does not apply to leases of motor 4vehicles for which, at the time the lease is entered into, the 5term of the lease is not a defined period, including leases 6with a defined initial period with the option to continue the 7lease on a month-to-month or other basis beyond the initial 8defined period. 9    The phrase "like kind and character" shall be liberally 10construed (including, but not limited to, any form of motor 11vehicle for any form of motor vehicle, or any kind of farm or 12agricultural implement for any other kind of farm or 13agricultural implement), while not including a kind of item 14which, if sold at retail by that retailer, would be exempt from 15retailers' occupation tax and use tax as an isolated or 16occasional sale.17    "Department" means the Department of Revenue.18    "Person" means any natural individual, firm, partnership, 19association, joint stock company, joint adventure, public or 20private corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, 21executor, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed 22by order of any court.23    "Retailer" means and includes every person engaged in the 24business of making sales, including, on and after January 1, 252025, leases, at retail as defined in this Section. With 26respect to leases, a "retailer" also means a "lessor", except   HB4037- 11 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1as otherwise provided in this Act. 2    A person who holds himself or herself out as being engaged 3(or who habitually engages) in selling tangible personal 4property at retail is a retailer hereunder with respect to 5such sales (and not primarily in a service occupation) 6notwithstanding the fact that such person designs and produces 7such tangible personal property on special order for the 8purchaser and in such a way as to render the property of value 9only to such purchaser, if such tangible personal property so 10produced on special order serves substantially the same 11function as stock or standard items of tangible personal 12property that are sold at retail.13    A person whose activities are organized and conducted 14primarily as a not-for-profit service enterprise, and who 15engages in selling tangible personal property at retail 16(whether to the public or merely to members and their guests) 17is a retailer with respect to such transactions, excepting 18only a person organized and operated exclusively for 19charitable, religious or educational purposes either (1), to 20the extent of sales by such person to its members, students, 21patients, or inmates of tangible personal property to be used 22primarily for the purposes of such person, or (2), to the 23extent of sales by such person of tangible personal property 24which is not sold or offered for sale by persons organized for 25profit. The selling of school books and school supplies by 26schools at retail to students is not "primarily for the   HB4037- 12 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1purposes of" the school which does such selling.

However, any person who is engaged in a business 23which is not subject to the tax imposed by the Retailers' 24Occupation Tax Act because of involving the sale of or a 25contract to sell real estate or a construction contract to 26improve real estate, but who, in the course of conducting such   HB4037- 13 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1business, transfers tangible personal property to users or 2consumers in the finished form in which it was purchased, and 3which does not become real estate, under any provision of a 4construction contract or real estate sale or real estate sales 5agreement entered into with some other person arising out of 6or because of such nontaxable business, is a retailer to the 7extent of the value of the tangible personal property so 8transferred. If, in such transaction, a separate charge is 9made for the tangible personal property so transferred, the 10value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, is the 11amount so separately charged, but not less than the cost of 12such property to the transferor; if no separate charge is 13made, the value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, 14is the cost to the transferor of such tangible personal 15property.16    "Retailer maintaining a place of business in this State", 17or any like term, means and includes any of the following 18retailers:19        (1) A retailer having or maintaining within this 20    State, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, 21    distribution house, sales house, warehouse, or other place 22    of business, or any agent or other representative 23    operating within this State under the authority of the 24    retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such 25    place of business or agent or other representative is 26    located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such   HB4037- 14 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1    retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this 2    State. However, the ownership of property that is located 3    at the premises of a printer with which the retailer has 4    contracted for printing and that consists of the final 5    printed product, property that becomes a part of the final 6    printed product, or copy from which the printed product is 7    produced shall not result in the retailer being deemed to 8    have or maintain an office, distribution house, sales 9    house, warehouse, or other place of business within this 10    State.11        (1.1) A retailer having a contract with a person 12    located in this State under which the person, for a 13    commission or other consideration based upon the sale of 14    tangible personal property by the retailer, directly or 15    indirectly refers potential customers to the retailer by 16    providing to the potential customers a promotional code or 17    other mechanism that allows the retailer to track 18    purchases referred by such persons. Examples of mechanisms 19    that allow the retailer to track purchases referred by 20    such persons include, but are not limited to, the use of a 21    link on the person's Internet website, promotional codes 22    distributed through the person's hand-delivered or mailed 23    material, and promotional codes distributed by the person 24    through radio or other broadcast media. The provisions of 25    this paragraph (1.1) shall apply only if the cumulative 26    gross receipts from sales of tangible personal property by   HB4037- 15 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1    the retailer to customers who are referred to the retailer 2    by all persons in this State under such contracts exceed 3    $10,000 during the preceding 4 quarterly periods ending on 4    the last day of March, June, September, and December. A 5    retailer meeting the requirements of this paragraph (1.1) 6    shall be presumed to be maintaining a place of business in 7    this State but may rebut this presumption by submitting 8    proof that the referrals or other activities pursued 9    within this State by such persons were not sufficient to 10    meet the nexus standards of the United States Constitution 11    during the preceding 4 quarterly periods.12        (1.2) Beginning July 1, 2011, a retailer having a 13    contract with a person located in this State under which:14            (A) the retailer sells the same or substantially 15        similar line of products as the person located in this 16        State and does so using an identical or substantially 17        similar name, trade name, or trademark as the person 18        located in this State; and19            (B) the retailer provides a commission or other 20        consideration to the person located in this State 21        based upon the sale of tangible personal property by 22        the retailer.23        The provisions of this paragraph (1.2) shall apply 24    only if the cumulative gross receipts from sales of 25    tangible personal property by the retailer to customers in 26    this State under all such contracts exceed $10,000 during   HB4037- 16 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1    the preceding 4 quarterly periods ending on the last day 2    of March, June, September, and December.3        (2) (Blank).4        (3) (Blank).5        (4) (Blank).6        (5) (Blank).7        (6) (Blank).8        (7) (Blank).9        (8) (Blank).10        (9) Beginning October 1, 2018, a retailer making sales 11    of tangible personal property to purchasers in Illinois 12    from outside of Illinois if: 13            (A) the cumulative gross receipts from sales of 14        tangible personal property to purchasers in Illinois 15        are $100,000 or more; or 16            (B) the retailer enters into 200 or more separate 17        transactions for the sale of tangible personal 18        property to purchasers in Illinois. 19        The retailer shall determine on a quarterly basis, 20    ending on the last day of March, June, September, and 21    December, whether he or she meets the criteria of either 22    subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph (9) for the 23    preceding 12-month period. If the retailer meets the 24    threshold of either subparagraph (A) or (B) for a 12-month 25    period, he or she is considered a retailer maintaining a 26    place of business in this State and is required to collect   HB4037- 17 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1    and remit the tax imposed under this Act and file returns 2    for one year.

Examples of those 9items include, but are not limited to nonreusable, paper and 10plastic cups, plates, baskets, boxes, sleeves, buckets or 11other containers, utensils, straws, placemats, napkins, doggie 12bags, and wrapping or packaging materials that are transferred 13to customers as part of the sale of food or beverages in the 14ordinary course of business.15    The purchase, employment, and transfer of such tangible 16personal property as newsprint and ink for the primary purpose 17of conveying news (with or without other information) is not a 18purchase, use, or sale of tangible personal property.19    "Selling price" means the consideration for a sale valued 20in money whether received in money or otherwise, including 21cash, credits, property other than as hereinafter provided, 22and services, but, prior to January 1, 2020 and beginning 23again on January 1, 2022, not including the value of or credit 24given for traded-in tangible personal property where the item 25that is traded-in is of like kind and character as that which 26is being sold; beginning January 1, 2020 and until January 1,   HB4037- 6 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b12022, "selling price" includes the portion of the value of or 2credit given for traded-in motor vehicles of the First 3Division as defined in Section 1-146 of the Illinois Vehicle 4Code of like kind and character as that which is being sold 5that exceeds $10,000. "Selling price" shall be determined 6without any deduction on account of the cost of the property 7sold, the cost of materials used, labor or service cost, or any 8other expense whatsoever, but does not include interest or 9finance charges which appear as separate items on the bill of 10sale or sales contract nor charges that are added to prices by 11sellers on account of the seller's tax liability under the 12Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, or on account of the seller's 13duty to collect, from the purchaser, the tax that is imposed by 14this Act, or, except as otherwise provided with respect to any 15cigarette tax imposed by a home rule unit, on account of the 16seller's tax liability under any local occupation tax 17administered by the Department, or, except as otherwise 18provided with respect to any cigarette tax imposed by a home 19rule unit on account of the seller's duty to collect, from the 20purchasers, the tax that is imposed under any local use tax 21administered by the Department. Effective December 1, 1985, 22"selling price" shall include charges that are added to prices 23by sellers on account of the seller's tax liability under the 24Cigarette Tax Act, on account of the seller's duty to collect, 25from the purchaser, the tax imposed under the Cigarette Use 26Tax Act, and on account of the seller's duty to collect, from   HB4037- 7 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1the purchaser, any cigarette tax imposed by a home rule unit.2    The provisions of this paragraph, which provides only for 3an alternative meaning of "selling price" with respect to the 4sale of certain motor vehicles incident to the contemporaneous 5lease of those motor vehicles, continue in effect and are not 6changed by the tax on leases implemented by Public Act 103-592 7this amendatory Act of the 103rd General Assembly. 8Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, for any motor 9vehicle, as defined in Section 1-146 of the Vehicle Code, that 10is sold on or after January 1, 2015 for the purpose of leasing 11the vehicle for a defined period that is longer than one year 12and (1) is a motor vehicle of the second division that: (A) is 13a self-contained motor vehicle designed or permanently 14converted to provide living quarters for recreational, 15camping, or travel use, with direct walk through access to the 16living quarters from the driver's seat; (B) is of the van 17configuration designed for the transportation of not less than 187 nor more than 16 passengers; or (C) has a gross vehicle 19weight rating of 8,000 pounds or less or (2) is a motor vehicle 20of the first division, "selling price" or "amount of sale" 21means the consideration received by the lessor pursuant to the 22lease contract, including amounts due at lease signing and all 23monthly or other regular payments charged over the term of the 24lease. Also included in the selling price is any amount 25received by the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle 26that is not calculated at the time the lease is executed,   HB4037- 8 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1including, but not limited to, excess mileage charges and 2charges for excess wear and tear. For sales that occur in 3Illinois, with respect to any amount received by the lessor 4from the lessee for the leased vehicle that is not calculated 5at the time the lease is executed, the lessor who purchased the 6motor vehicle does not incur the tax imposed by the Use Tax Act 7on those amounts, and the retailer who makes the retail sale of 8the motor vehicle to the lessor is not required to collect the 9tax imposed by this Act or to pay the tax imposed by the 10Retailers' Occupation Tax Act on those amounts. However, the 11lessor who purchased the motor vehicle assumes the liability 12for reporting and paying the tax on those amounts directly to 13the Department in the same form (Illinois Retailers' 14Occupation Tax, and local retailers' occupation taxes, if 15applicable) in which the retailer would have reported and paid 16such tax if the retailer had accounted for the tax to the 17Department. For amounts received by the lessor from the lessee 18that are not calculated at the time the lease is executed, the 19lessor must file the return and pay the tax to the Department 20by the due date otherwise required by this Act for returns 21other than transaction returns. If the retailer is entitled 22under this Act to a discount for collecting and remitting the 23tax imposed under this Act to the Department with respect to 24the sale of the motor vehicle to the lessor, then the right to 25the discount provided in this Act shall be transferred to the 26lessor with respect to the tax paid by the lessor for any   HB4037- 9 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1amount received by the lessor from the lessee for the leased 2vehicle that is not calculated at the time the lease is 3executed; provided that the discount is only allowed if the 4return is timely filed and for amounts timely paid. The 5"selling price" of a motor vehicle that is sold on or after 6January 1, 2015 for the purpose of leasing for a defined period 7of longer than one year shall not be reduced by the value of or 8credit given for traded-in tangible personal property owned by 9the lessor, nor shall it be reduced by the value of or credit 10given for traded-in tangible personal property owned by the 11lessee, regardless of whether the trade-in value thereof is 12assigned by the lessee to the lessor. In the case of a motor 13vehicle that is sold for the purpose of leasing for a defined 14period of longer than one year, the sale occurs at the time of 15the delivery of the vehicle, regardless of the due date of any 16lease payments. A lessor who incurs a Retailers' Occupation 17Tax liability on the sale of a motor vehicle coming off lease 18may not take a credit against that liability for the Use Tax 19the lessor paid upon the purchase of the motor vehicle (or for 20any tax the lessor paid with respect to any amount received by 21the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle that was not 22calculated at the time the lease was executed) if the selling 23price of the motor vehicle at the time of purchase was 24calculated using the definition of "selling price" as defined 25in this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 26Act to the contrary, lessors shall file all returns and make   HB4037- 10 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1all payments required under this paragraph to the Department 2by electronic means in the manner and form as required by the 3Department. This paragraph does not apply to leases of motor 4vehicles for which, at the time the lease is entered into, the 5term of the lease is not a defined period, including leases 6with a defined initial period with the option to continue the 7lease on a month-to-month or other basis beyond the initial 8defined period. 9    The phrase "like kind and character" shall be liberally 10construed (including, but not limited to, any form of motor 11vehicle for any form of motor vehicle, or any kind of farm or 12agricultural implement for any other kind of farm or 13agricultural implement), while not including a kind of item 14which, if sold at retail by that retailer, would be exempt from 15retailers' occupation tax and use tax as an isolated or 16occasional sale.17    "Department" means the Department of Revenue.18    "Person" means any natural individual, firm, partnership, 19association, joint stock company, joint adventure, public or 20private corporation, limited liability company, or a receiver, 21executor, trustee, guardian, or other representative appointed 22by order of any court.23    "Retailer" means and includes every person engaged in the 24business of making sales, including, on and after January 1, 252025, leases, at retail as defined in this Section. With 26respect to leases, a "retailer" also means a "lessor", except   HB4037- 11 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1as otherwise provided in this Act. 2    A person who holds himself or herself out as being engaged 3(or who habitually engages) in selling tangible personal 4property at retail is a retailer hereunder with respect to 5such sales (and not primarily in a service occupation) 6notwithstanding the fact that such person designs and produces 7such tangible personal property on special order for the 8purchaser and in such a way as to render the property of value 9only to such purchaser, if such tangible personal property so 10produced on special order serves substantially the same 11function as stock or standard items of tangible personal 12property that are sold at retail.13    A person whose activities are organized and conducted 14primarily as a not-for-profit service enterprise, and who 15engages in selling tangible personal property at retail 16(whether to the public or merely to members and their guests) 17is a retailer with respect to such transactions, excepting 18only a person organized and operated exclusively for 19charitable, religious or educational purposes either (1), to 20the extent of sales by such person to its members, students, 21patients, or inmates of tangible personal property to be used 22primarily for the purposes of such person, or (2), to the 23extent of sales by such person of tangible personal property 24which is not sold or offered for sale by persons organized for 25profit. The selling of school books and school supplies by 26schools at retail to students is not "primarily for the   HB4037- 12 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1purposes of" the school which does such selling. This 2paragraph does not apply to nor subject to taxation occasional 3dinners, social, or similar activities of a person organized 4and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, or 5educational purposes, whether or not such activities are open 6to the public.7    A person who is the recipient of a grant or contract under 8Title VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (P.L. 92-258) and 9serves meals to participants in the federal Nutrition Program 10for the Elderly in return for contributions established in 11amount by the individual participant pursuant to a schedule of 12suggested fees as provided for in the federal Act is not a 13retailer under this Act with respect to such transactions.14    Persons who engage in the business of transferring 15tangible personal property upon the redemption of trading 16stamps are retailers hereunder when engaged in such business.17    The isolated or occasional sale of tangible personal 18property at retail by a person who does not hold himself out as 19being engaged (or who does not habitually engage) in selling 20such tangible personal property at retail or a sale through a 21bulk vending machine does not make such person a retailer 22hereunder. However, any person who is engaged in a business 23which is not subject to the tax imposed by the Retailers' 24Occupation Tax Act because of involving the sale of or a 25contract to sell real estate or a construction contract to 26improve real estate, but who, in the course of conducting such   HB4037- 13 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1business, transfers tangible personal property to users or 2consumers in the finished form in which it was purchased, and 3which does not become real estate, under any provision of a 4construction contract or real estate sale or real estate sales 5agreement entered into with some other person arising out of 6or because of such nontaxable business, is a retailer to the 7extent of the value of the tangible personal property so 8transferred. If, in such transaction, a separate charge is 9made for the tangible personal property so transferred, the 10value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, is the 11amount so separately charged, but not less than the cost of 12such property to the transferor; if no separate charge is 13made, the value of such property, for the purposes of this Act, 14is the cost to the transferor of such tangible personal 15property.16    "Retailer maintaining a place of business in this State", 17or any like term, means and includes any of the following 18retailers:19        (1) A retailer having or maintaining within this 20    State, directly or by a subsidiary, an office, 21    distribution house, sales house, warehouse, or other place 22    of business, or any agent or other representative 23    operating within this State under the authority of the 24    retailer or its subsidiary, irrespective of whether such 25    place of business or agent or other representative is 26    located here permanently or temporarily, or whether such   HB4037- 14 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1    retailer or subsidiary is licensed to do business in this 2    State. However, the ownership of property that is located 3    at the premises of a printer with which the retailer has 4    contracted for printing and that consists of the final 5    printed product, property that becomes a part of the final 6    printed product, or copy from which the printed product is 7    produced shall not result in the retailer being deemed to 8    have or maintain an office, distribution house, sales 9    house, warehouse, or other place of business within this 10    State.11        (1.1) A retailer having a contract with a person 12    located in this State under which the person, for a 13    commission or other consideration based upon the sale of 14    tangible personal property by the retailer, directly or 15    indirectly refers potential customers to the retailer by 16    providing to the potential customers a promotional code or 17    other mechanism that allows the retailer to track 18    purchases referred by such persons. Examples of mechanisms 19    that allow the retailer to track purchases referred by 20    such persons include, but are not limited to, the use of a 21    link on the person's Internet website, promotional codes 22    distributed through the person's hand-delivered or mailed 23    material, and promotional codes distributed by the person 24    through radio or other broadcast media. The provisions of 25    this paragraph (1.1) shall apply only if the cumulative 26    gross receipts from sales of tangible personal property by   HB4037- 15 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1    the retailer to customers who are referred to the retailer 2    by all persons in this State under such contracts exceed 3    $10,000 during the preceding 4 quarterly periods ending on 4    the last day of March, June, September, and December. A 5    retailer meeting the requirements of this paragraph (1.1) 6    shall be presumed to be maintaining a place of business in 7    this State but may rebut this presumption by submitting 8    proof that the referrals or other activities pursued 9    within this State by such persons were not sufficient to 10    meet the nexus standards of the United States Constitution 11    during the preceding 4 quarterly periods.12        (1.2) Beginning July 1, 2011, a retailer having a 13    contract with a person located in this State under which:14            (A) the retailer sells the same or substantially 15        similar line of products as the person located in this 16        State and does so using an identical or substantially 17        similar name, trade name, or trademark as the person 18        located in this State; and19            (B) the retailer provides a commission or other 20        consideration to the person located in this State 21        based upon the sale of tangible personal property by 22        the retailer.23        The provisions of this paragraph (1.2) shall apply 24    only if the cumulative gross receipts from sales of 25    tangible personal property by the retailer to customers in 26    this State under all such contracts exceed $10,000 during   HB4037- 16 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1    the preceding 4 quarterly periods ending on the last day 2    of March, June, September, and December.3        (2) (Blank).4        (3) (Blank).5        (4) (Blank).6        (5) (Blank).7        (6) (Blank).8        (7) (Blank).9        (8) (Blank).10        (9) Beginning October 1, 2018, a retailer making sales 11    of tangible personal property to purchasers in Illinois 12    from outside of Illinois if: 13            (A) the cumulative gross receipts from sales of 14        tangible personal property to purchasers in Illinois 15        are $100,000 or more; or 16            (B) the retailer enters into 200 or more separate 17        transactions for the sale of tangible personal 18        property to purchasers in Illinois. 19        The retailer shall determine on a quarterly basis, 20    ending on the last day of March, June, September, and 21    December, whether he or she meets the criteria of either 22    subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph (9) for the 23    preceding 12-month period. If the retailer meets the 24    threshold of either subparagraph (A) or (B) for a 12-month 25    period, he or she is considered a retailer maintaining a 26    place of business in this State and is required to collect   HB4037- 17 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1    and remit the tax imposed under this Act and file returns 2    for one year. At the end of that one-year period, the 3    retailer shall determine whether he or she met the 4    threshold of either subparagraph (A) or (B) during the 5    preceding 12-month period.

If at 11    the end of a one-year period a retailer that was required 12    to collect and remit the tax imposed under this Act 13    determines that he or she did not meet the threshold in 14    either subparagraph (A) or (B) during the preceding 15    12-month period, the retailer shall subsequently determine 16    on a quarterly basis, ending on the last day of March, 17    June, September, and December, whether he or she meets the 18    threshold of either subparagraph (A) or (B) for the 19    preceding 12-month period. 20        Beginning January 1, 2020, neither the gross receipts 21    from nor the number of separate transactions for sales of 22    tangible personal property to purchasers in Illinois that 23    a retailer makes through a marketplace facilitator and for 24    which the retailer has received a certification from the 25    marketplace facilitator pursuant to Section 2d of this Act 26    shall be included for purposes of determining whether he   HB4037- 18 -LRB104 12740 HLH 24578 b1    or she has met the thresholds of this paragraph (9).2        (10) Beginning January 1, 2020, a marketplace 3    facilitator that meets a threshold set forth in subsection 4    (b) of Section 2d of this Act.5    "Bulk vending machine" means a vending machine, containing 6unsorted confections, nuts, toys, or other items designed 7primarily to be used or played with by children which, when a 8coin or coins of a denomination not larger than $0.50 are 9inserted, are dispensed in equal portions, at random and 10without selection by the customer.11(Source: P.A. 102-353, eff. 1-1-22; 103-592, eff. 1-1-25; 12revised 11-22-24.) 13    (35 ILCS 105/3)  (from Ch. 120, par. 439.3)14    Sec. 3.

A lessor who incurs a Retailers' Occupation 7Tax liability on the sale of a motor vehicle coming off lease 8may not take a credit against that liability for the Use Tax 9the lessor paid upon the purchase of the motor vehicle (or for 10any tax the lessor paid with respect to any amount received by 11the lessor from the lessee for the leased vehicle that was not 12calculated at the time the lease was executed) if the selling 13price of the motor vehicle at the time of purchase was 14calculated using the definition of "selling price" as defined 15in this paragraph. Notwithstanding any other provision of this 16Act to the contrary, lessors shall file all returns and make 17all payments required under this paragraph to the Department 18by electronic means in the manner and form as required by the 19Department.
