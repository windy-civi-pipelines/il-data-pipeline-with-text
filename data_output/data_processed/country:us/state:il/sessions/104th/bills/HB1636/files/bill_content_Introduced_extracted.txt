The Illinois Pension Code is amended by 5changing Sections 14-131, 14-152.1, 16-158, and 16-203 and by 6adding Sections 14-157 and 16-207 as follows: 7    (40 ILCS 5/14-131)8    Sec. 14-131. Contributions by State. 9    (a) The State shall make contributions to the System by 10appropriations of amounts which, together with other employer 11contributions from trust, federal, and other funds, employee 12contributions, investment income, and other income, will be 13sufficient to meet the cost of maintaining and administering 14the System on a 90% funded basis in accordance with actuarial 15recommendations.16    For the purposes of this Section and Section 14-135.08, 17references to State contributions refer only to employer 18contributions and do not include employee contributions that 19are picked up or otherwise paid by the State or a department on 20behalf of the employee.21    (b) The Board shall determine the total amount of State 22contributions required for each fiscal year on the basis of 23the actuarial tables and other assumptions adopted by the   HB1636- 2 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1Board, using the formula in subsection (e).2    The Board shall also determine a State contribution rate 3for each fiscal year, expressed as a percentage of payroll, 4based on the total required State contribution for that fiscal 5year (less the amount received by the System from 6appropriations under Section 8.12 of the State Finance Act and 7Section 1 of the State Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation 8Act, if any, for the fiscal year ending on the June 30 9immediately preceding the applicable November 15 certification 10deadline), the estimated payroll (including all forms of 11compensation) for personal services rendered by eligible 12employees, and the recommendations of the actuary.13    For the purposes of this Section and Section 14.1 of the 14State Finance Act, the term "eligible employees" includes 15employees who participate in the System, persons who may elect 16to participate in the System but have not so elected, persons 17who are serving a qualifying period that is required for 18participation, and annuitants employed by a department as 19described in subdivision (a)(1) or (a)(2) of Section 14-111.20    (c) Contributions shall be made by the several departments 21for each pay period by warrants drawn by the State Comptroller 22against their respective funds or appropriations based upon 23vouchers stating the amount to be so contributed. These 24amounts shall be based on the full rate certified by the Board 25under Section 14-135.08 for that fiscal year. From March 5, 262004 (the effective date of Public Act 93-665) through the   HB1636- 3 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1payment of the final payroll from fiscal year 2004 2appropriations, the several departments shall not make 3contributions for the remainder of fiscal year 2004 but shall 4instead make payments as required under subsection (a-1) of 5Section 14.1 of the State Finance Act. The several departments 6shall resume those contributions at the commencement of fiscal 7year 2005.8    (c-1) Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this Section, for 9fiscal years 2010, 2012, and each fiscal year thereafter, 10contributions by the several departments are not required to 11be made for General Revenue Funds payrolls processed by the 12Comptroller. Payrolls paid by the several departments from all 13other State funds must continue to be processed pursuant to 14subsection (c) of this Section.15    (c-2) Unless otherwise directed by the Comptroller under 16subsection (c-3), the Board shall submit vouchers for payment 17of State contributions to the System for the applicable month 18on the 15th day of each month, or as soon thereafter as may be 19practicable. The amount vouchered for a monthly payment shall 20total one-twelfth of the fiscal year General Revenue Fund 21contribution as certified by the System pursuant to Section 2214-135.08 of this Code. 23    (c-3) Beginning in State fiscal year 2025, if the 24Comptroller requests that the Board submit, during a State 25fiscal year, vouchers for multiple monthly payments for 26advance payment of State contributions due to the System for   HB1636- 4 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1that State fiscal year, then the Board shall submit those 2additional vouchers as directed by the Comptroller, 3notwithstanding subsection (c-2). Unless an act of 4appropriations provides otherwise, nothing in this Section 5authorizes the Board to submit, in a State fiscal year, 6vouchers for the payment of State contributions to the System 7in an amount that exceeds the rate of payroll that is certified 8by the System under Section 14-135.08 for that State fiscal 9year. 10    (d) If an employee is paid from trust funds or federal 11funds, the department or other employer shall pay employer 12contributions from those funds to the System at the certified 13rate, unless the terms of the trust or the federal-State 14agreement preclude the use of the funds for that purpose, in 15which case the required employer contributions shall be paid 16by the State. 17    (e) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, the minimum 18contribution to the System to be made by the State for each 19fiscal year shall be an amount determined by the System to be 20sufficient to bring the total assets of the System up to 90% of 21the total actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of 22State fiscal year 2045. In making these determinations, the 23required State contribution shall be calculated each year as a 24level percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 25including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the 26projected unit credit actuarial cost method.  HB1636- 5 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1    For State fiscal years in which the State is required to 2contribute to participants' individual accounts in the defined 3contribution plan under Section 14-157, the minimum 4contribution to the System shall also include the amounts 5required under Section 14-157. 6    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 7increases or decreases the required State contribution and 8first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 9implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 10beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 11change first applies to the required State contribution.12    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 13increases or decreases the required State contribution and 14first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 152015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:16        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before 17    2018; and18        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 19    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 20    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 21    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 22    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 23    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 24    fiscal years in that 5-year period.25    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State 26contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable   HB1636- 6 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 2increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 3contributing at the rate required under this Section; except 4that (i) for State fiscal year 1998, for all purposes of this 5Code and any other law of this State, the certified percentage 6of the applicable employee payroll shall be 5.052% for 7employees earning eligible creditable service under Section 814-110 and 6.500% for all other employees, notwithstanding any 9contrary certification made under Section 14-135.08 before 10July 7, 1997 (the effective date of Public Act 90-65), and (ii) 11in the following specified State fiscal years, the State 12contribution to the System shall not be less than the 13following indicated percentages of the applicable employee 14payroll, even if the indicated percentage will produce a State 15contribution in excess of the amount otherwise required under 16this subsection and subsection (a): 9.8% in FY 1999; 10.0% in 17FY 2000; 10.2% in FY 2001; 10.4% in FY 2002; 10.6% in FY 2003; 18and 10.8% in FY 2004.19    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, the minimum State 20contribution for each fiscal year shall be the amount needed 21to maintain the total assets of the System at 90% of the total 22actuarial liabilities of the System.23    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 24the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 25Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 26constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State   HB1636- 7 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 2Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 3calculation of, the required State contributions under this 4Article in any future year until the System has reached a 5funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 6the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 7term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 8System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act. 9    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 10required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 11fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 12calculated under this Section and certified under Section 1314-135.08, shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount 14of the required State contribution that would have been 15calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 16System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 17Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 18portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 19fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 20purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 21the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 22the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 237.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act.24    (f) (Blank).25    (g) For purposes of determining the required State 26contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets   HB1636- 8 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 2which shall be calculated as follows:3    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 4assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 5that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 6assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 7gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 8year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 95-year period following that fiscal year. 10    (h) For purposes of determining the required State 11contribution to the System for a particular year, the 12actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 13return equal to the System's actuarially assumed rate of 14return. 15    (i) (Blank).16    (j) (Blank).17    (k) For fiscal year 2012 and each fiscal year thereafter, 18after the submission of all payments for eligible employees 19from personal services line items paid from the General 20Revenue Fund in the fiscal year have been made, the 21Comptroller shall provide to the System a certification of the 22sum of all expenditures in the fiscal year for personal 23services. Upon receipt of the certification, the System shall 24determine the amount due to the System based on the full rate 25certified by the Board under Section 14-135.08 for the fiscal 26year in order to meet the State's obligation under this   HB1636- 9 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1Section. The System shall compare this amount due to the 2amount received by the System for the fiscal year. If the 3amount due is more than the amount received, the difference 4shall be termed the "Prior Fiscal Year Shortfall" for purposes 5of this Section, and the Prior Fiscal Year Shortfall shall be 6satisfied under Section 1.2 of the State Pension Funds 7Continuing Appropriation Act. If the amount due is less than 8the amount received, the difference shall be termed the "Prior 9Fiscal Year Overpayment" for purposes of this Section, and the 10Prior Fiscal Year Overpayment shall be repaid by the System to 11the General Revenue Fund as soon as practicable after the 12certification. 13(Source: P.A. 103-588, eff. 6-5-24.) 14    (40 ILCS 5/14-152.1)15    Sec. 14-152.1. Application and expiration of new benefit 16increases.17    (a) As used in this Section, "new benefit increase" means 18an increase in the amount of any benefit provided under this 19Article, or an expansion of the conditions of eligibility for 20any benefit under this Article, that results from an amendment 21to this Code that takes effect after June 1, 2005 (the 22effective date of Public Act 94-4). "New benefit increase", 23however, does not include any benefit increase resulting from 24the changes made to Article 1 or this Article by Public Act 2596-37, Public Act 100-23, Public Act 100-587, Public Act   HB1636- 10 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1100-611, Public Act 101-10, Public Act 101-610, Public Act 2102-210, Public Act 102-856, Public Act 102-956, or this 3amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly this amendatory 4Act of the 102nd General Assembly. 5    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code or 6any subsequent amendment to this Code, every new benefit 7increase is subject to this Section and shall be deemed to be 8granted only in conformance with and contingent upon 9compliance with the provisions of this Section. 10    (c) The Public Act enacting a new benefit increase must 11identify and provide for payment to the System of additional 12funding at least sufficient to fund the resulting annual 13increase in cost to the System as it accrues.14    Every new benefit increase is contingent upon the General 15Assembly providing the additional funding required under this 16subsection. The Commission on Government Forecasting and 17Accountability shall analyze whether adequate additional 18funding has been provided for the new benefit increase and 19shall report its analysis to the Public Pension Division of 20the Department of Insurance. A new benefit increase created by 21a Public Act that does not include the additional funding 22required under this subsection is null and void. If the Public 23Pension Division determines that the additional funding 24provided for a new benefit increase under this subsection is 25or has become inadequate, it may so certify to the Governor and 26the State Comptroller and, in the absence of corrective action   HB1636- 11 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1by the General Assembly, the new benefit increase shall expire 2at the end of the fiscal year in which the certification is 3made. 4    (d) Every new benefit increase shall expire 5 years after 5its effective date or on such earlier date as may be specified 6in the language enacting the new benefit increase or provided 7under subsection (c). This does not prevent the General 8Assembly from extending or re-creating a new benefit increase 9by law.10    (e) Except as otherwise provided in the language creating 11the new benefit increase, a new benefit increase that expires 12under this Section continues to apply to persons who applied 13and qualified for the affected benefit while the new benefit 14increase was in effect and to the affected beneficiaries and 15alternate payees of such persons, but does not apply to any 16other person, including, without limitation, a person who 17continues in service after the expiration date and did not 18apply and qualify for the affected benefit while the new 19benefit increase was in effect.20(Source: P.A. 101-10, eff. 6-5-19; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 21101-610, eff. 1-1-20; 102-210, eff. 7-30-21; 102-856, eff. 221-1-23; 102-956, eff. 5-27-22.) 23    (40 ILCS 5/14-157 new)24    Sec. 14-157. Voluntary defined contribution plan.25    (a) As soon as practicable after the effective date of   HB1636- 12 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, the System 2shall develop and offer a defined contribution plan for active 3members of the System. The defined contribution plan shall 4collect optional employee contributions, employer 5contributions, and State contributions into individual 6accounts and shall offer investment options to participants. 7There shall be no maximum or minimum contribution requirements 8for participation in the defined contribution plan.9    (b) On an annual basis, the employer of a participant in 10the defined contribution plan shall deposit in the 11participant's defined contribution plan account an amount 12equal to the amount contributed by the participant during the 13preceding year and the State shall deposit in the 14participant's defined contribution plan account an amount 15equal to the amount contributed by the participant during the 16preceding year. If the State is the actual employer of the 17participant, then the State shall contribute an additional 18amount equal to the employer's contribution required under 19this subsection.20    (c) A participant in the defined contribution plan may not 21withdraw moneys from the defined contribution plan account 22while the participant is an active member of the System.23    (d) The defined contribution plan under this Section shall 24be operated in full compliance with any applicable State and 25federal laws, and the System shall use generally accepted 26practices in creating and maintaining the benefit for the best   HB1636- 13 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1interest of the participants.  2    (40 ILCS 5/16-158)  (from Ch. 108 1/2, par. 16-158)3    Sec. 16-158.

On or before January 15, 2013 and each January 315 thereafter, the Board shall certify to the Governor and the 4General Assembly the amount of the required State contribution 5for the next fiscal year. The Board's certification must note 6any deviations from the State Actuary's recommended changes, 7the reason or reasons for not following the State Actuary's 8recommended changes, and the fiscal impact of not following 9the State Actuary's recommended changes on the required State 10contribution. 11    (a-10) By November 1, 2017, the Board shall recalculate 12and recertify to the State Actuary, the Governor, and the 13General Assembly the amount of the State contribution to the 14System for State fiscal year 2018, taking into account the 15changes in required State contributions made by Public Act 16100-23. The State Actuary shall review the assumptions and 17valuations underlying the Board's revised certification and 18issue a preliminary report concerning the proposed 19recertification and identifying, if necessary, recommended 20changes in actuarial assumptions that the Board must consider 21before finalizing its certification of the required State 22contributions.

In making these determinations, the 9required State contribution shall be calculated each year as a 10level percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 11including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the 12projected unit credit actuarial cost method.13    For State fiscal years in which the State is required to 14contribute to participants' individual accounts in the defined 15contribution plan under Section 16-207, the minimum 16contribution to the System shall also include the amounts 17required under Section 16-207. 18    For each of State fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 19State shall make an additional contribution to the System 20equal to 2% of the total payroll of each employee who is deemed 21to have elected the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has 22made the election under subsection (c) of Section 1-161. 23    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 24increases or decreases the required State contribution and 25first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 26implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period   HB1636- 19 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 2change first applies to the required State contribution.3    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 4increases or decreases the required State contribution and 5first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 62015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:7        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before 8    2018; and9        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 10    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 11    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 12    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 13    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 14    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 15    fiscal years in that 5-year period.16    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State 17contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable 18employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 19increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 20contributing at the rate required under this Section; except 21that in the following specified State fiscal years, the State 22contribution to the System shall not be less than the 23following indicated percentages of the applicable employee 24payroll, even if the indicated percentage will produce a State 25contribution in excess of the amount otherwise required under 26this subsection and subsection (a), and notwithstanding any   HB1636- 20 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1contrary certification made under subsection (a-1) before May 227, 1998 (the effective date of Public Act 90-582): 10.02% in 3FY 1999; 10.77% in FY 2000; 11.47% in FY 2001; 12.16% in FY 42002; 12.86% in FY 2003; and 13.56% in FY 2004.5    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 6total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2006 7is $534,627,700. 8    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 9total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2007 10is $738,014,500. 11    For each of State fiscal years 2008 through 2009, the 12State contribution to the System, as a percentage of the 13applicable employee payroll, shall be increased in equal 14annual increments from the required State contribution for 15State fiscal year 2007, so that by State fiscal year 2011, the 16State is contributing at the rate otherwise required under 17this Section. 18    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 19total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2010 20is $2,089,268,000 and shall be made from the proceeds of bonds 21sold in fiscal year 2010 pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General 22Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale 23expenses determined by the System's share of total bond 24proceeds, (ii) any amounts received from the Common School 25Fund in fiscal year 2010, and (iii) any reduction in bond 26proceeds due to the issuance of discounted bonds, if   HB1636- 21 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1applicable. 2    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 3total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2011 4is the amount recertified by the System on or before April 1, 52011 pursuant to subsection (a-1) of this Section and shall be 6made from the proceeds of bonds sold in fiscal year 2011 7pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, 8less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale expenses determined by 9the System's share of total bond proceeds, (ii) any amounts 10received from the Common School Fund in fiscal year 2011, and 11(iii) any reduction in bond proceeds due to the issuance of 12discounted bonds, if applicable. This amount shall include, in 13addition to the amount certified by the System, an amount 14necessary to meet employer contributions required by the State 15as an employer under paragraph (e) of this Section, which may 16also be used by the System for contributions required by 17paragraph (a) of Section 16-127. 18    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, the minimum State 19contribution for each fiscal year shall be the amount needed 20to maintain the total assets of the System at 90% of the total 21actuarial liabilities of the System.22    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 23the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 24Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 25constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 26contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year.   HB1636- 22 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 2calculation of, the required State contributions under this 3Article in any future year until the System has reached a 4funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 5the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 6term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 7System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act.8    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 9required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 10fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 11calculated under this Section and certified under subsection 12(a-1), shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount of 13the required State contribution that would have been 14calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 15System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 16Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 17portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 18fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 19purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 20the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 21the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 227.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act. In determining this 23maximum for State fiscal years 2008 through 2010, however, the 24amount referred to in item (i) shall be increased, as a 25percentage of the applicable employee payroll, in equal 26increments calculated from the sum of the required State   HB1636- 23 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1contribution for State fiscal year 2007 plus the applicable 2portion of the State's total debt service payments for fiscal 3year 2007 on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 4purposes of Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, so 5that, by State fiscal year 2011, the State is contributing at 6the rate otherwise required under this Section.7    (b-4) Beginning in fiscal year 2018, each employer under 8this Article shall pay to the System a required contribution 9determined as a percentage of projected payroll and sufficient 10to produce an annual amount equal to:11        (i) for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 12    defined benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, 13    less the employee contribution, for each employee of that 14    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 15    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 16    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; for fiscal 17    year 2021 and each fiscal year thereafter, the defined 18    benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, less the 19    employee contribution, plus 2%, for each employee of that 20    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 21    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 22    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; plus23        (ii) the amount required for that fiscal year to 24    amortize any unfunded actuarial accrued liability 25    associated with the present value of liabilities 26    attributable to the employer's account under Section   HB1636- 24 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1    16-158.3, determined as a level percentage of payroll over 2    a 30-year rolling amortization period.3    In determining contributions required under item (i) of 4this subsection, the System shall determine an aggregate rate 5for all employers, expressed as a percentage of projected 6payroll. 7    In determining the contributions required under item (ii) 8of this subsection, the amount shall be computed by the System 9on the basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in 10the most recent actuarial valuation of the System that is 11available at the time of the computation. 12    The contributions required under this subsection (b-4) 13shall be paid by an employer concurrently with that employer's 14payroll payment period. The State, as the actual employer of 15an employee, shall make the required contributions under this 16subsection. 17    (c) Payment of the required State contributions and of all 18pensions, retirement annuities, death benefits, refunds, and 19other benefits granted under or assumed by this System, and 20all expenses in connection with the administration and 21operation thereof, are obligations of the State.22    If members are paid from special trust or federal funds 23which are administered by the employing unit, whether school 24district or other unit, the employing unit shall pay to the 25System from such funds the full accruing retirement costs 26based upon that service, which, beginning July 1, 2017, shall   HB1636- 25 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1be at a rate, expressed as a percentage of salary, equal to the 2total employer's normal cost, expressed as a percentage of 3payroll, as determined by the System. Employer contributions, 4based on salary paid to members from federal funds, may be 5forwarded by the distributing agency of the State of Illinois 6to the System prior to allocation, in an amount determined in 7accordance with guidelines established by such agency and the 8System. Any contribution for fiscal year 2015 collected as a 9result of the change made by Public Act 98-674 shall be 10considered a State contribution under subsection (b-3) of this 11Section. 12    (d) Effective July 1, 1986, any employer of a teacher as 13defined in paragraph (8) of Section 16-106 shall pay the 14employer's normal cost of benefits based upon the teacher's 15service, in addition to employee contributions, as determined 16by the System. Such employer contributions shall be forwarded 17monthly in accordance with guidelines established by the 18System.19    However, with respect to benefits granted under Section 2016-133.4 or 16-133.5 to a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) 21of Section 16-106, the employer's contribution shall be 12% 22(rather than 20%) of the member's highest annual salary rate 23for each year of creditable service granted, and the employer 24shall also pay the required employee contribution on behalf of 25the teacher. For the purposes of Sections 16-133.4 and 2616-133.5, a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) of Section   HB1636- 26 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b116-106 who is serving in that capacity while on leave of 2absence from another employer under this Article shall not be 3considered an employee of the employer from which the teacher 4is on leave.5    (e) Beginning July 1, 1998, every employer of a teacher 6shall pay to the System an employer contribution computed as 7follows:8        (1) Beginning July 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999, the 9    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.3% of each 10    teacher's salary.11        (2) Beginning July 1, 1999 and thereafter, the 12    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.58% of each 13    teacher's salary.14The school district or other employing unit may pay these 15employer contributions out of any source of funding available 16for that purpose and shall forward the contributions to the 17System on the schedule established for the payment of member 18contributions.19    These employer contributions are intended to offset a 20portion of the cost to the System of the increases in 21retirement benefits resulting from Public Act 90-582.22    Each employer of teachers is entitled to a credit against 23the contributions required under this subsection (e) with 24respect to salaries paid to teachers for the period January 1, 252002 through June 30, 2003, equal to the amount paid by that 26employer under subsection (a-5) of Section 6.6 of the State   HB1636- 27 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971 with respect to salaries 2paid to teachers for that period.3    The additional 1% employee contribution required under 4Section 16-152 by Public Act 90-582 is the responsibility of 5the teacher and not the teacher's employer, unless the 6employer agrees, through collective bargaining or otherwise, 7to make the contribution on behalf of the teacher.8    If an employer is required by a contract in effect on May 91, 1998 between the employer and an employee organization to 10pay, on behalf of all its full-time employees covered by this 11Article, all mandatory employee contributions required under 12this Article, then the employer shall be excused from paying 13the employer contribution required under this subsection (e) 14for the balance of the term of that contract. The employer and 15the employee organization shall jointly certify to the System 16the existence of the contractual requirement, in such form as 17the System may prescribe. This exclusion shall cease upon the 18termination, extension, or renewal of the contract at any time 19after May 1, 1998.20    (f) If the amount of a teacher's salary for any school year 21used to determine final average salary exceeds the member's 22annual full-time salary rate with the same employer for the 23previous school year by more than 6%, the teacher's employer 24shall pay to the System, in addition to all other payments 25required under this Section and in accordance with guidelines 26established by the System, the present value of the increase   HB1636- 28 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1in benefits resulting from the portion of the increase in 2salary that is in excess of 6%. This present value shall be 3computed by the System on the basis of the actuarial 4assumptions and tables used in the most recent actuarial 5valuation of the System that is available at the time of the 6computation. If a teacher's salary for the 2005-2006 school 7year is used to determine final average salary under this 8subsection (f), then the changes made to this subsection (f) 9by Public Act 94-1057 shall apply in calculating whether the 10increase in his or her salary is in excess of 6%. For the 11purposes of this Section, change in employment under Section 1210-21.12 of the School Code on or after June 1, 2005 shall 13constitute a change in employer. The System may require the 14employer to provide any pertinent information or 15documentation. The changes made to this subsection (f) by 16Public Act 94-1111 apply without regard to whether the teacher 17was in service on or after its effective date. 18    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 19required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 20amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 21The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 22amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 23may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 24System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 25specify in detail the grounds of the dispute and, if the 26employer asserts that the calculation is subject to subsection   HB1636- 29 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1(g), (g-5), (g-10), (g-15), (g-20), or (h) of this Section, 2must include an affidavit setting forth and attesting to all 3facts within the employer's knowledge that are pertinent to 4the applicability of that subsection. Upon receiving a timely 5application for recalculation, the System shall review the 6application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount due. 7    The employer contributions required under this subsection 8(f) may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 9receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 10paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 11will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 12actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 13annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 14must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 15of the bill. 16    (f-1) (Blank).17    (g) This subsection (g) applies only to payments made or 18salary increases given on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 191, 2011. The changes made by Public Act 94-1057 shall not 20require the System to refund any payments received before July 2131, 2006 (the effective date of Public Act 94-1057).22    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 23(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to 24teachers under contracts or collective bargaining agreements 25entered into, amended, or renewed before June 1, 2005. 26    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection   HB1636- 30 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to a 2teacher at a time when the teacher is 10 or more years from 3retirement eligibility under Section 16-132 or 16-133.2. 4    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 5(f), the System shall exclude salary increases resulting from 6overload work, including summer school, when the school 7district has certified to the System, and the System has 8approved the certification, that (i) the overload work is for 9the sole purpose of classroom instruction in excess of the 10standard number of classes for a full-time teacher in a school 11district during a school year and (ii) the salary increases 12are equal to or less than the rate of pay for classroom 13instruction computed on the teacher's current salary and work 14schedule. 15    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 16(f), the System shall exclude a salary increase resulting from 17a promotion (i) for which the employee is required to hold a 18certificate or supervisory endorsement issued by the State 19Teacher Certification Board that is a different certification 20or supervisory endorsement than is required for the teacher's 21previous position and (ii) to a position that has existed and 22been filled by a member for no less than one complete academic 23year and the salary increase from the promotion is an increase 24that results in an amount no greater than the lesser of the 25average salary paid for other similar positions in the 26district requiring the same certification or the amount   HB1636- 31 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1stipulated in the collective bargaining agreement for a 2similar position requiring the same certification. 3    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 4(f), the System shall exclude any payment to the teacher from 5the State of Illinois or the State Board of Education over 6which the employer does not have discretion, notwithstanding 7that the payment is included in the computation of final 8average salary. 9    (g-5) When assessing payment for any amount due under 10subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 11resulting from overload or stipend work performed in a school 12year subsequent to a school year in which the employer was 13unable to offer or allow to be conducted overload or stipend 14work due to an emergency declaration limiting such activities.15    (g-10) When assessing payment for any amount due under 16subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 17resulting from increased instructional time that exceeded the 18instructional time required during the 2019-2020 school year. 19    (g-15) When assessing payment for any amount due under 20subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 21resulting from teaching summer school on or after May 1, 2021 22and before September 15, 2022. 23    (g-20) When assessing payment for any amount due under 24subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 25necessary to bring a school board in compliance with Public 26Act 101-443 or this amendatory Act of the 103rd General   HB1636- 32 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1Assembly. 2    (h) When assessing payment for any amount due under 3subsection (f), the System shall exclude any salary increase 4described in subsection (g) of this Section given on or after 5July 1, 2011 but before July 1, 2014 under a contract or 6collective bargaining agreement entered into, amended, or 7renewed on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 1, 2011. 8Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, any 9payments made or salary increases given after June 30, 2014 10shall be used in assessing payment for any amount due under 11subsection (f) of this Section. 12    (i) The System shall prepare a report and file copies of 13the report with the Governor and the General Assembly by 14January 1, 2007 that contains all of the following 15information:16        (1) The number of recalculations required by the 17    changes made to this Section by Public Act 94-1057 for 18    each employer.19        (2) The dollar amount by which each employer's 20    contribution to the System was changed due to 21    recalculations required by Public Act 94-1057.22        (3) The total amount the System received from each 23    employer as a result of the changes made to this Section by 24    Public Act 94-4.25        (4) The increase in the required State contribution 26    resulting from the changes made to this Section by Public   HB1636- 33 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1    Act 94-1057. 2    (i-5) For school years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, 3if the amount of a participant's salary for any school year 4exceeds the amount of the salary set for the Governor, the 5participant's employer shall pay to the System, in addition to 6all other payments required under this Section and in 7accordance with guidelines established by the System, an 8amount determined by the System to be equal to the employer 9normal cost, as established by the System and expressed as a 10total percentage of payroll, multiplied by the amount of 11salary in excess of the amount of the salary set for the 12Governor. This amount shall be computed by the System on the 13basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in the most 14recent actuarial valuation of the System that is available at 15the time of the computation. The System may require the 16employer to provide any pertinent information or 17documentation.18    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 19required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 20amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 21The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 22amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 23may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 24System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 25specify in detail the grounds of the dispute. Upon receiving a 26timely application for recalculation, the System shall review   HB1636- 34 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1the application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount 2due. 3    The employer contributions required under this subsection 4may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 5receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 6paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 7will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 8actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 9annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 10must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 11of the bill. 12    (j) For purposes of determining the required State 13contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets 14shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 15which shall be calculated as follows:16    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 17assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 18that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 19assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 20gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 21year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 225-year period following that fiscal year. 23    (k) For purposes of determining the required State 24contribution to the system for a particular year, the 25actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 26return equal to the system's actuarially assumed rate of   HB1636- 35 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1return. 2(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-525, eff. 8-20-21; 3102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-515, eff. 48-11-23; 103-588, eff. 6-5-24.) 5    (40 ILCS 5/16-203)6    Sec. 16-203.

"New benefit increase", 14however, does not include any benefit increase resulting from 15the changes made to Article 1 or this Article by Public Act 1695-910, Public Act 100-23, Public Act 100-587, Public Act 17100-743, Public Act 100-769, Public Act 101-10, Public Act 18101-49, Public Act 102-16, or Public Act 102-871, or this 19amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly.20    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code or 21any subsequent amendment to this Code, every new benefit 22increase is subject to this Section and shall be deemed to be 23granted only in conformance with and contingent upon 24compliance with the provisions of this Section. 25    (c) The Public Act enacting a new benefit increase must   HB1636- 36 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1identify and provide for payment to the System of additional 2funding at least sufficient to fund the resulting annual 3increase in cost to the System as it accrues.4    Every new benefit increase is contingent upon the General 5Assembly providing the additional funding required under this 6subsection. The Commission on Government Forecasting and 7Accountability shall analyze whether adequate additional 8funding has been provided for the new benefit increase and 9shall report its analysis to the Public Pension Division of 10the Department of Insurance. A new benefit increase created by 11a Public Act that does not include the additional funding 12required under this subsection is null and void. If the Public 13Pension Division determines that the additional funding 14provided for a new benefit increase under this subsection is 15or has become inadequate, it may so certify to the Governor and 16the State Comptroller and, in the absence of corrective action 17by the General Assembly, the new benefit increase shall expire 18at the end of the fiscal year in which the certification is 19made. 20    (d) Every new benefit increase shall expire 5 years after 21its effective date or on such earlier date as may be specified 22in the language enacting the new benefit increase or provided 23under subsection (c).

The Illinois Pension Code is amended by 5changing Sections 14-131, 14-152.1, 16-158, and 16-203 and by 6adding Sections 14-157 and 16-207 as follows: 7    (40 ILCS 5/14-131)8    Sec. 14-131. Contributions by State. 9    (a) The State shall make contributions to the System by 10appropriations of amounts which, together with other employer 11contributions from trust, federal, and other funds, employee 12contributions, investment income, and other income, will be 13sufficient to meet the cost of maintaining and administering 14the System on a 90% funded basis in accordance with actuarial 15recommendations.16    For the purposes of this Section and Section 14-135.08, 17references to State contributions refer only to employer 18contributions and do not include employee contributions that 19are picked up or otherwise paid by the State or a department on 20behalf of the employee.21    (b) The Board shall determine the total amount of State 22contributions required for each fiscal year on the basis of 23the actuarial tables and other assumptions adopted by the   HB1636- 2 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1Board, using the formula in subsection (e).2    The Board shall also determine a State contribution rate 3for each fiscal year, expressed as a percentage of payroll, 4based on the total required State contribution for that fiscal 5year (less the amount received by the System from 6appropriations under Section 8.12 of the State Finance Act and 7Section 1 of the State Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation 8Act, if any, for the fiscal year ending on the June 30 9immediately preceding the applicable November 15 certification 10deadline), the estimated payroll (including all forms of 11compensation) for personal services rendered by eligible 12employees, and the recommendations of the actuary.13    For the purposes of this Section and Section 14.1 of the 14State Finance Act, the term "eligible employees" includes 15employees who participate in the System, persons who may elect 16to participate in the System but have not so elected, persons 17who are serving a qualifying period that is required for 18participation, and annuitants employed by a department as 19described in subdivision (a)(1) or (a)(2) of Section 14-111.20    (c) Contributions shall be made by the several departments 21for each pay period by warrants drawn by the State Comptroller 22against their respective funds or appropriations based upon 23vouchers stating the amount to be so contributed. These 24amounts shall be based on the full rate certified by the Board 25under Section 14-135.08 for that fiscal year. From March 5, 262004 (the effective date of Public Act 93-665) through the   HB1636- 3 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1payment of the final payroll from fiscal year 2004 2appropriations, the several departments shall not make 3contributions for the remainder of fiscal year 2004 but shall 4instead make payments as required under subsection (a-1) of 5Section 14.1 of the State Finance Act. The several departments 6shall resume those contributions at the commencement of fiscal 7year 2005.8    (c-1) Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this Section, for 9fiscal years 2010, 2012, and each fiscal year thereafter, 10contributions by the several departments are not required to 11be made for General Revenue Funds payrolls processed by the 12Comptroller. Payrolls paid by the several departments from all 13other State funds must continue to be processed pursuant to 14subsection (c) of this Section.15    (c-2) Unless otherwise directed by the Comptroller under 16subsection (c-3), the Board shall submit vouchers for payment 17of State contributions to the System for the applicable month 18on the 15th day of each month, or as soon thereafter as may be 19practicable. The amount vouchered for a monthly payment shall 20total one-twelfth of the fiscal year General Revenue Fund 21contribution as certified by the System pursuant to Section 2214-135.08 of this Code. 23    (c-3) Beginning in State fiscal year 2025, if the 24Comptroller requests that the Board submit, during a State 25fiscal year, vouchers for multiple monthly payments for 26advance payment of State contributions due to the System for   HB1636- 4 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1that State fiscal year, then the Board shall submit those 2additional vouchers as directed by the Comptroller, 3notwithstanding subsection (c-2). Unless an act of 4appropriations provides otherwise, nothing in this Section 5authorizes the Board to submit, in a State fiscal year, 6vouchers for the payment of State contributions to the System 7in an amount that exceeds the rate of payroll that is certified 8by the System under Section 14-135.08 for that State fiscal 9year. 10    (d) If an employee is paid from trust funds or federal 11funds, the department or other employer shall pay employer 12contributions from those funds to the System at the certified 13rate, unless the terms of the trust or the federal-State 14agreement preclude the use of the funds for that purpose, in 15which case the required employer contributions shall be paid 16by the State. 17    (e) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, the minimum 18contribution to the System to be made by the State for each 19fiscal year shall be an amount determined by the System to be 20sufficient to bring the total assets of the System up to 90% of 21the total actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of 22State fiscal year 2045. In making these determinations, the 23required State contribution shall be calculated each year as a 24level percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 25including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the 26projected unit credit actuarial cost method.  HB1636- 5 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1    For State fiscal years in which the State is required to 2contribute to participants' individual accounts in the defined 3contribution plan under Section 14-157, the minimum 4contribution to the System shall also include the amounts 5required under Section 14-157. 6    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 7increases or decreases the required State contribution and 8first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 9implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 10beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 11change first applies to the required State contribution.12    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 13increases or decreases the required State contribution and 14first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 152015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:16        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before 17    2018; and18        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 19    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 20    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 21    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 22    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 23    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 24    fiscal years in that 5-year period.25    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State 26contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable   HB1636- 6 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 2increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 3contributing at the rate required under this Section; except 4that (i) for State fiscal year 1998, for all purposes of this 5Code and any other law of this State, the certified percentage 6of the applicable employee payroll shall be 5.052% for 7employees earning eligible creditable service under Section 814-110 and 6.500% for all other employees, notwithstanding any 9contrary certification made under Section 14-135.08 before 10July 7, 1997 (the effective date of Public Act 90-65), and (ii) 11in the following specified State fiscal years, the State 12contribution to the System shall not be less than the 13following indicated percentages of the applicable employee 14payroll, even if the indicated percentage will produce a State 15contribution in excess of the amount otherwise required under 16this subsection and subsection (a): 9.8% in FY 1999; 10.0% in 17FY 2000; 10.2% in FY 2001; 10.4% in FY 2002; 10.6% in FY 2003; 18and 10.8% in FY 2004.19    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, the minimum State 20contribution for each fiscal year shall be the amount needed 21to maintain the total assets of the System at 90% of the total 22actuarial liabilities of the System.23    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 24the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 25Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 26constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State   HB1636- 7 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 2Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 3calculation of, the required State contributions under this 4Article in any future year until the System has reached a 5funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 6the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 7term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 8System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act. 9    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 10required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 11fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 12calculated under this Section and certified under Section 1314-135.08, shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount 14of the required State contribution that would have been 15calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 16System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 17Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 18portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 19fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 20purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 21the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 22the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 237.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act.24    (f) (Blank).25    (g) For purposes of determining the required State 26contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets   HB1636- 8 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 2which shall be calculated as follows:3    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 4assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 5that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 6assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 7gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 8year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 95-year period following that fiscal year. 10    (h) For purposes of determining the required State 11contribution to the System for a particular year, the 12actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 13return equal to the System's actuarially assumed rate of 14return. 15    (i) (Blank).16    (j) (Blank).17    (k) For fiscal year 2012 and each fiscal year thereafter, 18after the submission of all payments for eligible employees 19from personal services line items paid from the General 20Revenue Fund in the fiscal year have been made, the 21Comptroller shall provide to the System a certification of the 22sum of all expenditures in the fiscal year for personal 23services. Upon receipt of the certification, the System shall 24determine the amount due to the System based on the full rate 25certified by the Board under Section 14-135.08 for the fiscal 26year in order to meet the State's obligation under this   HB1636- 9 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1Section. The System shall compare this amount due to the 2amount received by the System for the fiscal year. If the 3amount due is more than the amount received, the difference 4shall be termed the "Prior Fiscal Year Shortfall" for purposes 5of this Section, and the Prior Fiscal Year Shortfall shall be 6satisfied under Section 1.2 of the State Pension Funds 7Continuing Appropriation Act. If the amount due is less than 8the amount received, the difference shall be termed the "Prior 9Fiscal Year Overpayment" for purposes of this Section, and the 10Prior Fiscal Year Overpayment shall be repaid by the System to 11the General Revenue Fund as soon as practicable after the 12certification. 13(Source: P.A. 103-588, eff. 6-5-24.) 14    (40 ILCS 5/14-152.1)15    Sec. 14-152.1. Application and expiration of new benefit 16increases.17    (a) As used in this Section, "new benefit increase" means 18an increase in the amount of any benefit provided under this 19Article, or an expansion of the conditions of eligibility for 20any benefit under this Article, that results from an amendment 21to this Code that takes effect after June 1, 2005 (the 22effective date of Public Act 94-4). "New benefit increase", 23however, does not include any benefit increase resulting from 24the changes made to Article 1 or this Article by Public Act 2596-37, Public Act 100-23, Public Act 100-587, Public Act   HB1636- 10 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1100-611, Public Act 101-10, Public Act 101-610, Public Act 2102-210, Public Act 102-856, Public Act 102-956, or this 3amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly this amendatory 4Act of the 102nd General Assembly. 5    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code or 6any subsequent amendment to this Code, every new benefit 7increase is subject to this Section and shall be deemed to be 8granted only in conformance with and contingent upon 9compliance with the provisions of this Section. 10    (c) The Public Act enacting a new benefit increase must 11identify and provide for payment to the System of additional 12funding at least sufficient to fund the resulting annual 13increase in cost to the System as it accrues.14    Every new benefit increase is contingent upon the General 15Assembly providing the additional funding required under this 16subsection. The Commission on Government Forecasting and 17Accountability shall analyze whether adequate additional 18funding has been provided for the new benefit increase and 19shall report its analysis to the Public Pension Division of 20the Department of Insurance. A new benefit increase created by 21a Public Act that does not include the additional funding 22required under this subsection is null and void. If the Public 23Pension Division determines that the additional funding 24provided for a new benefit increase under this subsection is 25or has become inadequate, it may so certify to the Governor and 26the State Comptroller and, in the absence of corrective action   HB1636- 11 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1by the General Assembly, the new benefit increase shall expire 2at the end of the fiscal year in which the certification is 3made. 4    (d) Every new benefit increase shall expire 5 years after 5its effective date or on such earlier date as may be specified 6in the language enacting the new benefit increase or provided 7under subsection (c). This does not prevent the General 8Assembly from extending or re-creating a new benefit increase 9by law.10    (e) Except as otherwise provided in the language creating 11the new benefit increase, a new benefit increase that expires 12under this Section continues to apply to persons who applied 13and qualified for the affected benefit while the new benefit 14increase was in effect and to the affected beneficiaries and 15alternate payees of such persons, but does not apply to any 16other person, including, without limitation, a person who 17continues in service after the expiration date and did not 18apply and qualify for the affected benefit while the new 19benefit increase was in effect.20(Source: P.A. 101-10, eff. 6-5-19; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 21101-610, eff. 1-1-20; 102-210, eff. 7-30-21; 102-856, eff. 221-1-23; 102-956, eff. 5-27-22.) 23    (40 ILCS 5/14-157 new)24    Sec. 14-157.

The defined contribution plan shall 4collect optional employee contributions, employer 5contributions, and State contributions into individual 6accounts and shall offer investment options to participants. 7There shall be no maximum or minimum contribution requirements 8for participation in the defined contribution plan.9    (b) On an annual basis, the employer of a participant in 10the defined contribution plan shall deposit in the 11participant's defined contribution plan account an amount 12equal to the amount contributed by the participant during the 13preceding year and the State shall deposit in the 14participant's defined contribution plan account an amount 15equal to the amount contributed by the participant during the 16preceding year. If the State is the actual employer of the 17participant, then the State shall contribute an additional 18amount equal to the employer's contribution required under 19this subsection.20    (c) A participant in the defined contribution plan may not 21withdraw moneys from the defined contribution plan account 22while the participant is an active member of the System.23    (d) The defined contribution plan under this Section shall 24be operated in full compliance with any applicable State and 25federal laws, and the System shall use generally accepted 26practices in creating and maintaining the benefit for the best   HB1636- 13 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1interest of the participants.  2    (40 ILCS 5/16-158)  (from Ch. 108 1/2, par. 16-158)3    Sec. 16-158.

On or before January 1 of 23each year, beginning January 1, 2013, the State Actuary shall 24issue a preliminary report concerning the proposed 25certification and identifying, if necessary, recommended 26changes in actuarial assumptions that the Board must consider   HB1636- 15 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1before finalizing its certification of the required State 2contributions. On or before January 15, 2013 and each January 315 thereafter, the Board shall certify to the Governor and the 4General Assembly the amount of the required State contribution 5for the next fiscal year. The Board's certification must note 6any deviations from the State Actuary's recommended changes, 7the reason or reasons for not following the State Actuary's 8recommended changes, and the fiscal impact of not following 9the State Actuary's recommended changes on the required State 10contribution. 11    (a-10) By November 1, 2017, the Board shall recalculate 12and recertify to the State Actuary, the Governor, and the 13General Assembly the amount of the State contribution to the 14System for State fiscal year 2018, taking into account the 15changes in required State contributions made by Public Act 16100-23. The State Actuary shall review the assumptions and 17valuations underlying the Board's revised certification and 18issue a preliminary report concerning the proposed 19recertification and identifying, if necessary, recommended 20changes in actuarial assumptions that the Board must consider 21before finalizing its certification of the required State 22contributions. The Board's final certification must note any 23deviations from the State Actuary's recommended changes, the 24reason or reasons for not following the State Actuary's 25recommended changes, and the fiscal impact of not following 26the State Actuary's recommended changes on the required State   HB1636- 16 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1contribution. 2    (a-15) On or after June 15, 2019, but no later than June 330, 2019, the Board shall recalculate and recertify to the 4Governor and the General Assembly the amount of the State 5contribution to the System for State fiscal year 2019, taking 6into account the changes in required State contributions made 7by Public Act 100-587. The recalculation shall be made using 8assumptions adopted by the Board for the original fiscal year 92019 certification. The monthly voucher for the 12th month of 10fiscal year 2019 shall be paid by the Comptroller after the 11recertification required pursuant to this subsection is 12submitted to the Governor, Comptroller, and General Assembly. 13The recertification submitted to the General Assembly shall be 14filed with the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the 15Secretary of the Senate in electronic form only, in the manner 16that the Clerk and the Secretary shall direct. 17    (b) Through State fiscal year 1995, the State 18contributions shall be paid to the System in accordance with 19Section 18-7 of the School Code.20    (b-1) Unless otherwise directed by the Comptroller under 21subsection (b-1.1), the Board shall submit vouchers for 22payment of State contributions to the System for the 23applicable month on the 15th day of each month, or as soon 24thereafter as may be practicable. The amount vouchered for a 25monthly payment shall total one-twelfth of the required annual 26State contribution certified under subsection (a-1).   HB1636- 17 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1    (b-1.1) Beginning in State fiscal year 2025, if the 2Comptroller requests that the Board submit, during a State 3fiscal year, vouchers for multiple monthly payments for the 4advance payment of State contributions due to the System for 5that State fiscal year, then the Board shall submit those 6additional vouchers as directed by the Comptroller, 7notwithstanding subsection (b-1). Unless an act of 8appropriations provides otherwise, nothing in this Section 9authorizes the Board to submit, in a State fiscal year, 10vouchers for the payment of State contributions to the System 11in an amount that exceeds the rate of payroll that is certified 12by the System under this Section for that State fiscal year. 13    (b-1.2) The vouchers described in subsections (b-1) and 14(b-1.1) shall be paid by the State Comptroller and Treasurer 15by warrants drawn on the funds appropriated to the System for 16that fiscal year.17    If in any month the amount remaining unexpended from all 18other appropriations to the System for the applicable fiscal 19year (including the appropriations to the System under Section 208.12 of the State Finance Act and Section 1 of the State 21Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation Act) is less than the 22amount lawfully vouchered under this subsection, the 23difference shall be paid from the Common School Fund under the 24continuing appropriation authority provided in Section 1.1 of 25the State Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation Act.26    (b-2) Allocations from the Common School Fund apportioned   HB1636- 18 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1to school districts not coming under this System shall not be 2diminished or affected by the provisions of this Article.3    (b-3) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, the 4minimum contribution to the System to be made by the State for 5each fiscal year shall be an amount determined by the System to 6be sufficient to bring the total assets of the System up to 90% 7of the total actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of 8State fiscal year 2045. In making these determinations, the 9required State contribution shall be calculated each year as a 10level percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 11including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the 12projected unit credit actuarial cost method.13    For State fiscal years in which the State is required to 14contribute to participants' individual accounts in the defined 15contribution plan under Section 16-207, the minimum 16contribution to the System shall also include the amounts 17required under Section 16-207. 18    For each of State fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 19State shall make an additional contribution to the System 20equal to 2% of the total payroll of each employee who is deemed 21to have elected the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has 22made the election under subsection (c) of Section 1-161. 23    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 24increases or decreases the required State contribution and 25first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 26implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period   HB1636- 19 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 2change first applies to the required State contribution.3    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 4increases or decreases the required State contribution and 5first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 62015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:7        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before 8    2018; and9        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 10    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 11    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 12    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 13    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 14    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 15    fiscal years in that 5-year period.16    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State 17contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable 18employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 19increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 20contributing at the rate required under this Section; except 21that in the following specified State fiscal years, the State 22contribution to the System shall not be less than the 23following indicated percentages of the applicable employee 24payroll, even if the indicated percentage will produce a State 25contribution in excess of the amount otherwise required under 26this subsection and subsection (a), and notwithstanding any   HB1636- 20 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1contrary certification made under subsection (a-1) before May 227, 1998 (the effective date of Public Act 90-582): 10.02% in 3FY 1999; 10.77% in FY 2000; 11.47% in FY 2001; 12.16% in FY 42002; 12.86% in FY 2003; and 13.56% in FY 2004.5    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 6total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2006 7is $534,627,700. 8    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 9total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2007 10is $738,014,500. 11    For each of State fiscal years 2008 through 2009, the 12State contribution to the System, as a percentage of the 13applicable employee payroll, shall be increased in equal 14annual increments from the required State contribution for 15State fiscal year 2007, so that by State fiscal year 2011, the 16State is contributing at the rate otherwise required under 17this Section. 18    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 19total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2010 20is $2,089,268,000 and shall be made from the proceeds of bonds 21sold in fiscal year 2010 pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General 22Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale 23expenses determined by the System's share of total bond 24proceeds, (ii) any amounts received from the Common School 25Fund in fiscal year 2010, and (iii) any reduction in bond 26proceeds due to the issuance of discounted bonds, if   HB1636- 21 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1applicable. 2    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 3total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2011 4is the amount recertified by the System on or before April 1, 52011 pursuant to subsection (a-1) of this Section and shall be 6made from the proceeds of bonds sold in fiscal year 2011 7pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, 8less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale expenses determined by 9the System's share of total bond proceeds, (ii) any amounts 10received from the Common School Fund in fiscal year 2011, and 11(iii) any reduction in bond proceeds due to the issuance of 12discounted bonds, if applicable. This amount shall include, in 13addition to the amount certified by the System, an amount 14necessary to meet employer contributions required by the State 15as an employer under paragraph (e) of this Section, which may 16also be used by the System for contributions required by 17paragraph (a) of Section 16-127. 18    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, the minimum State 19contribution for each fiscal year shall be the amount needed 20to maintain the total assets of the System at 90% of the total 21actuarial liabilities of the System.22    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 23the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 24Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 25constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 26contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year.   HB1636- 22 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 2calculation of, the required State contributions under this 3Article in any future year until the System has reached a 4funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 5the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 6term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 7System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act.8    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 9required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 10fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 11calculated under this Section and certified under subsection 12(a-1), shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount of 13the required State contribution that would have been 14calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 15System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 16Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 17portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 18fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 19purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 20the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 21the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 227.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act. In determining this 23maximum for State fiscal years 2008 through 2010, however, the 24amount referred to in item (i) shall be increased, as a 25percentage of the applicable employee payroll, in equal 26increments calculated from the sum of the required State   HB1636- 23 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1contribution for State fiscal year 2007 plus the applicable 2portion of the State's total debt service payments for fiscal 3year 2007 on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 4purposes of Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, so 5that, by State fiscal year 2011, the State is contributing at 6the rate otherwise required under this Section.7    (b-4) Beginning in fiscal year 2018, each employer under 8this Article shall pay to the System a required contribution 9determined as a percentage of projected payroll and sufficient 10to produce an annual amount equal to:11        (i) for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 12    defined benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, 13    less the employee contribution, for each employee of that 14    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 15    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 16    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; for fiscal 17    year 2021 and each fiscal year thereafter, the defined 18    benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, less the 19    employee contribution, plus 2%, for each employee of that 20    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 21    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 22    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; plus23        (ii) the amount required for that fiscal year to 24    amortize any unfunded actuarial accrued liability 25    associated with the present value of liabilities 26    attributable to the employer's account under Section   HB1636- 24 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1    16-158.3, determined as a level percentage of payroll over 2    a 30-year rolling amortization period.3    In determining contributions required under item (i) of 4this subsection, the System shall determine an aggregate rate 5for all employers, expressed as a percentage of projected 6payroll. 7    In determining the contributions required under item (ii) 8of this subsection, the amount shall be computed by the System 9on the basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in 10the most recent actuarial valuation of the System that is 11available at the time of the computation. 12    The contributions required under this subsection (b-4) 13shall be paid by an employer concurrently with that employer's 14payroll payment period. The State, as the actual employer of 15an employee, shall make the required contributions under this 16subsection. 17    (c) Payment of the required State contributions and of all 18pensions, retirement annuities, death benefits, refunds, and 19other benefits granted under or assumed by this System, and 20all expenses in connection with the administration and 21operation thereof, are obligations of the State.22    If members are paid from special trust or federal funds 23which are administered by the employing unit, whether school 24district or other unit, the employing unit shall pay to the 25System from such funds the full accruing retirement costs 26based upon that service, which, beginning July 1, 2017, shall   HB1636- 25 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1be at a rate, expressed as a percentage of salary, equal to the 2total employer's normal cost, expressed as a percentage of 3payroll, as determined by the System. Employer contributions, 4based on salary paid to members from federal funds, may be 5forwarded by the distributing agency of the State of Illinois 6to the System prior to allocation, in an amount determined in 7accordance with guidelines established by such agency and the 8System. Any contribution for fiscal year 2015 collected as a 9result of the change made by Public Act 98-674 shall be 10considered a State contribution under subsection (b-3) of this 11Section. 12    (d) Effective July 1, 1986, any employer of a teacher as 13defined in paragraph (8) of Section 16-106 shall pay the 14employer's normal cost of benefits based upon the teacher's 15service, in addition to employee contributions, as determined 16by the System. Such employer contributions shall be forwarded 17monthly in accordance with guidelines established by the 18System.19    However, with respect to benefits granted under Section 2016-133.4 or 16-133.5 to a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) 21of Section 16-106, the employer's contribution shall be 12% 22(rather than 20%) of the member's highest annual salary rate 23for each year of creditable service granted, and the employer 24shall also pay the required employee contribution on behalf of 25the teacher. For the purposes of Sections 16-133.4 and 2616-133.5, a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) of Section   HB1636- 26 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b116-106 who is serving in that capacity while on leave of 2absence from another employer under this Article shall not be 3considered an employee of the employer from which the teacher 4is on leave.5    (e) Beginning July 1, 1998, every employer of a teacher 6shall pay to the System an employer contribution computed as 7follows:8        (1) Beginning July 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999, the 9    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.3% of each 10    teacher's salary.11        (2) Beginning July 1, 1999 and thereafter, the 12    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.58% of each 13    teacher's salary.14The school district or other employing unit may pay these 15employer contributions out of any source of funding available 16for that purpose and shall forward the contributions to the 17System on the schedule established for the payment of member 18contributions.19    These employer contributions are intended to offset a 20portion of the cost to the System of the increases in 21retirement benefits resulting from Public Act 90-582.22    Each employer of teachers is entitled to a credit against 23the contributions required under this subsection (e) with 24respect to salaries paid to teachers for the period January 1, 252002 through June 30, 2003, equal to the amount paid by that 26employer under subsection (a-5) of Section 6.6 of the State   HB1636- 27 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971 with respect to salaries 2paid to teachers for that period.3    The additional 1% employee contribution required under 4Section 16-152 by Public Act 90-582 is the responsibility of 5the teacher and not the teacher's employer, unless the 6employer agrees, through collective bargaining or otherwise, 7to make the contribution on behalf of the teacher.8    If an employer is required by a contract in effect on May 91, 1998 between the employer and an employee organization to 10pay, on behalf of all its full-time employees covered by this 11Article, all mandatory employee contributions required under 12this Article, then the employer shall be excused from paying 13the employer contribution required under this subsection (e) 14for the balance of the term of that contract. The employer and 15the employee organization shall jointly certify to the System 16the existence of the contractual requirement, in such form as 17the System may prescribe. This exclusion shall cease upon the 18termination, extension, or renewal of the contract at any time 19after May 1, 1998.20    (f) If the amount of a teacher's salary for any school year 21used to determine final average salary exceeds the member's 22annual full-time salary rate with the same employer for the 23previous school year by more than 6%, the teacher's employer 24shall pay to the System, in addition to all other payments 25required under this Section and in accordance with guidelines 26established by the System, the present value of the increase   HB1636- 28 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1in benefits resulting from the portion of the increase in 2salary that is in excess of 6%. This present value shall be 3computed by the System on the basis of the actuarial 4assumptions and tables used in the most recent actuarial 5valuation of the System that is available at the time of the 6computation. If a teacher's salary for the 2005-2006 school 7year is used to determine final average salary under this 8subsection (f), then the changes made to this subsection (f) 9by Public Act 94-1057 shall apply in calculating whether the 10increase in his or her salary is in excess of 6%. For the 11purposes of this Section, change in employment under Section 1210-21.12 of the School Code on or after June 1, 2005 shall 13constitute a change in employer. The System may require the 14employer to provide any pertinent information or 15documentation. The changes made to this subsection (f) by 16Public Act 94-1111 apply without regard to whether the teacher 17was in service on or after its effective date. 18    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 19required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 20amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 21The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 22amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 23may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 24System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 25specify in detail the grounds of the dispute and, if the 26employer asserts that the calculation is subject to subsection   HB1636- 29 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1(g), (g-5), (g-10), (g-15), (g-20), or (h) of this Section, 2must include an affidavit setting forth and attesting to all 3facts within the employer's knowledge that are pertinent to 4the applicability of that subsection. Upon receiving a timely 5application for recalculation, the System shall review the 6application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount due. 7    The employer contributions required under this subsection 8(f) may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 9receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 10paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 11will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 12actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 13annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 14must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 15of the bill. 16    (f-1) (Blank).17    (g) This subsection (g) applies only to payments made or 18salary increases given on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 191, 2011. The changes made by Public Act 94-1057 shall not 20require the System to refund any payments received before July 2131, 2006 (the effective date of Public Act 94-1057).22    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 23(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to 24teachers under contracts or collective bargaining agreements 25entered into, amended, or renewed before June 1, 2005. 26    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection   HB1636- 30 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to a 2teacher at a time when the teacher is 10 or more years from 3retirement eligibility under Section 16-132 or 16-133.2. 4    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 5(f), the System shall exclude salary increases resulting from 6overload work, including summer school, when the school 7district has certified to the System, and the System has 8approved the certification, that (i) the overload work is for 9the sole purpose of classroom instruction in excess of the 10standard number of classes for a full-time teacher in a school 11district during a school year and (ii) the salary increases 12are equal to or less than the rate of pay for classroom 13instruction computed on the teacher's current salary and work 14schedule. 15    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 16(f), the System shall exclude a salary increase resulting from 17a promotion (i) for which the employee is required to hold a 18certificate or supervisory endorsement issued by the State 19Teacher Certification Board that is a different certification 20or supervisory endorsement than is required for the teacher's 21previous position and (ii) to a position that has existed and 22been filled by a member for no less than one complete academic 23year and the salary increase from the promotion is an increase 24that results in an amount no greater than the lesser of the 25average salary paid for other similar positions in the 26district requiring the same certification or the amount   HB1636- 31 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1stipulated in the collective bargaining agreement for a 2similar position requiring the same certification. 3    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 4(f), the System shall exclude any payment to the teacher from 5the State of Illinois or the State Board of Education over 6which the employer does not have discretion, notwithstanding 7that the payment is included in the computation of final 8average salary. 9    (g-5) When assessing payment for any amount due under 10subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 11resulting from overload or stipend work performed in a school 12year subsequent to a school year in which the employer was 13unable to offer or allow to be conducted overload or stipend 14work due to an emergency declaration limiting such activities.15    (g-10) When assessing payment for any amount due under

101-443 or this amendatory Act of the 103rd General   HB1636- 32 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1Assembly. 2    (h) When assessing payment for any amount due under 3subsection (f), the System shall exclude any salary increase 4described in subsection (g) of this Section given on or after 5July 1, 2011 but before July 1, 2014 under a contract or 6collective bargaining agreement entered into, amended, or 7renewed on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 1, 2011. 8Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, any 9payments made or salary increases given after June 30, 2014 10shall be used in assessing payment for any amount due under 11subsection (f) of this Section. 12    (i) The System shall prepare a report and file copies of 13the report with the Governor and the General Assembly by 14January 1, 2007 that contains all of the following 15information:16        (1) The number of recalculations required by the 17    changes made to this Section by Public Act 94-1057 for 18    each employer.19        (2) The dollar amount by which each employer's 20    contribution to the System was changed due to 21    recalculations required by Public Act 94-1057.22        (3) The total amount the System received from each 23    employer as a result of the changes made to this Section by 24    Public Act 94-4.25        (4) The increase in the required State contribution 26    resulting from the changes made to this Section by Public   HB1636- 33 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1    Act 94-1057. 2    (i-5) For school years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, 3if the amount of a participant's salary for any school year 4exceeds the amount of the salary set for the Governor, the 5participant's employer shall pay to the System, in addition to 6all other payments required under this Section and in 7accordance with guidelines established by the System, an 8amount determined by the System to be equal to the employer 9normal cost, as established by the System and expressed as a 10total percentage of payroll, multiplied by the amount of 11salary in excess of the amount of the salary set for the 12Governor. This amount shall be computed by the System on the 13basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in the most 14recent actuarial valuation of the System that is available at 15the time of the computation. The System may require the 16employer to provide any pertinent information or 17documentation.18    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 19required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 20amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 21The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 22amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 23may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 24System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 25specify in detail the grounds of the dispute. Upon receiving a 26timely application for recalculation, the System shall review   HB1636- 34 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1the application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount 2due. 3    The employer contributions required under this subsection 4may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 5receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 6paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 7will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 8actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 9annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 10must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 11of the bill. 12    (j) For purposes of determining the required State 13contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets 14shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 15which shall be calculated as follows:16    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 17assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 18that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 19assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 20gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 21year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 225-year period following that fiscal year. 23    (k) For purposes of determining the required State 24contribution to the system for a particular year, the 25actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 26return equal to the system's actuarially assumed rate of   HB1636- 35 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1return. 2(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-525, eff. 8-20-21; 3102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-515, eff. 48-11-23; 103-588, eff. 6-5-24.) 5    (40 ILCS 5/16-203)6    Sec. 16-203. Application and expiration of new benefit 7increases.8    (a) As used in this Section, "new benefit increase" means 9an increase in the amount of any benefit provided under this 10Article, or an expansion of the conditions of eligibility for 11any benefit under this Article, that results from an amendment 12to this Code that takes effect after June 1, 2005 (the 13effective date of Public Act 94-4). "New benefit increase", 14however, does not include any benefit increase resulting from 15the changes made to Article 1 or this Article by Public Act 1695-910, Public Act 100-23, Public Act 100-587, Public Act 17100-743, Public Act 100-769, Public Act 101-10, Public Act 18101-49, Public Act 102-16, or Public Act 102-871, or this 19amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly.20    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code or 21any subsequent amendment to this Code, every new benefit 22increase is subject to this Section and shall be deemed to be 23granted only in conformance with and contingent upon 24compliance with the provisions of this Section. 25    (c) The Public Act enacting a new benefit increase must   HB1636- 36 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1identify and provide for payment to the System of additional 2funding at least sufficient to fund the resulting annual 3increase in cost to the System as it accrues.4    Every new benefit increase is contingent upon the General 5Assembly providing the additional funding required under this 6subsection. The Commission on Government Forecasting and 7Accountability shall analyze whether adequate additional 8funding has been provided for the new benefit increase and 9shall report its analysis to the Public Pension Division of 10the Department of Insurance. A new benefit increase created by 11a Public Act that does not include the additional funding 12required under this subsection is null and void. If the Public 13Pension Division determines that the additional funding 14provided for a new benefit increase under this subsection is 15or has become inadequate, it may so certify to the Governor and 16the State Comptroller and, in the absence of corrective action 17by the General Assembly, the new benefit increase shall expire 18at the end of the fiscal year in which the certification is 19made. 20    (d) Every new benefit increase shall expire 5 years after 21its effective date or on such earlier date as may be specified 22in the language enacting the new benefit increase or provided 23under subsection (c). This does not prevent the General 24Assembly from extending or re-creating a new benefit increase 25by law.26    (e) Except as otherwise provided in the language creating   HB1636- 37 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1the new benefit increase, a new benefit increase that expires 2under this Section continues to apply to persons who applied 3and qualified for the affected benefit while the new benefit 4increase was in effect and to the affected beneficiaries and 5alternate payees of such persons, but does not apply to any 6other person, including, without limitation, a person who 7continues in service after the expiration date and did not 8apply and qualify for the affected benefit while the new 9benefit increase was in effect.10(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 11102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-871, eff. 5-13-22; 103-154, eff. 126-30-23.) 13    (40 ILCS 5/16-207 new)14    Sec. 16-207. Voluntary defined contribution plan.15    (a) As soon as practicable after the effective date of 16this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, the System 17shall develop and offer a defined contribution plan for active 18members of the System. The defined contribution plan shall 19collect optional employee contributions, employer 20contributions, and State contributions into individual 21accounts and shall offer investment options to participants. 22There shall be no maximum or minimum contribution requirements 23for participation in the defined contribution plan.24    (b) On an annual basis, the employer of a participant in 25the defined contribution plan shall deposit in the   HB1636- 38 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1participant's defined contribution plan account an amount 2equal to the amount contributed by the participant during the 3preceding year and the State shall deposit in the 4participant's defined contribution plan account an amount 5equal to the amount contributed by the participant during the 6preceding year. If the State is the actual employer of the 7participant, then the State shall contribute an additional 8amount equal to the employer's contribution required under 9this subsection.10    (c) A participant in the defined contribution plan may not 11withdraw moneys from the defined contribution plan account 12while the participant is an active member of the System.13    (d) The defined contribution plan under this Section shall 14be operated in full compliance with any applicable State and 15federal laws, and the System shall use generally accepted 16practices in creating and maintaining the benefit for the best 17interest of the participants.  18    Section 90. The State Mandates Act is amended by adding 19Section 8.49 as follows: 20    (30 ILCS 805/8.49 new)21    Sec. 8.49. Exempt mandate. Notwithstanding Sections 6 and 228 of this Act, no reimbursement by the State is required for 23the implementation of any mandate created by this amendatory 24Act of the 104th General Assembly.  HB1636- 39 -LRB104 07705 RPS 17749 b1 INDEX 2 Statutes amended in order of appearance 3    40 ILCS 5/14-1314    40 ILCS 5/14-152.15    40 ILCS 5/14-157 new6    40 ILCS 5/16-158from Ch. 108 1/2, par. 16-1587    40 ILCS 5/16-2038    40 ILCS 5/16-207 new9    30 ILCS 805/8.49 new
