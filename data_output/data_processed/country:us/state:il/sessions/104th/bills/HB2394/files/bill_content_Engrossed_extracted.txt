the following: 20,000 11pounds on a single axle; 34,000 pounds on a tandem axle with no 12axle within the tandem exceeding 20,000 pounds; 80,000 pounds 13gross weight for vehicle combinations of 5 or more axles; or a 14total weight on a group of 2 or more consecutive axles in 15excess of that weight produced by the application of the 16following formula: W = 500 times the sum of (LN divided by N-1) 17+ 12N + 36, where "W" equals overall total weight on any group 18of 2 or more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds, "L" 19equals the distance measured to the nearest foot between 20extremes of any group of 2 or more consecutive axles, and "N" 21equals the number of axles in the group under consideration.22    The above formula when expressed in tabular form results 23in

This paragraph (14) shall 23    not allow a vehicle to exceed any posted weight limit on a 24    highway or structure. 25        (15) An emergency vehicle or fire apparatus that is a 26    vehicle designed to be used under emergency conditions to   HB2394 Engrossed- 13 -LRB104 08276 LNS 18326 b1    transport personnel and equipment, and used to support the 2    suppression of fires and mitigation of other hazardous 3    situations on a Class I highway, may not exceed 86,000 4    pounds gross weight, or any of the following weight 5    allowances:6            (i) 24,000 pounds on a single steering axle;7            (ii) 33,500 pounds on a single drive axle;8            (iii) 62,000 pounds on a tandem axle; or9            (iv) 52,000 pounds on a tandem rear drive steer 10        axle. 11        (16) A bus, motor coach, or recreational vehicle may 12    carry a total weight of 24,000 pounds on a single axle, but 13    may not exceed other weight provisions of this Section. 14    Gross weight limits shall not apply to the combination of 15the tow truck and vehicles being towed. The tow truck license 16plate must cover the operating empty weight of the tow truck 17only. The weight of each vehicle being towed shall be covered 18by a valid license plate issued to the owner or operator of the 19vehicle being towed and displayed on that vehicle. If no valid 20plate issued to the owner or operator of that vehicle is 21displayed on that vehicle, or the plate displayed on that 22vehicle does not cover the weight of the vehicle, the weight of 23the vehicle shall be covered by the third tow truck plate 24issued to the owner or operator of the tow truck and 25temporarily affixed to the vehicle being towed. If a roll-back 26carrier is registered and being used as a tow truck, however,   HB2394 Engrossed- 14 -LRB104 08276 LNS 18326 b1the license plate or plates for the tow truck must cover the 2gross vehicle weight, including any load carried on the bed of 3the roll-back carrier.4    The Department may by rule or regulation prescribe 5additional requirements. However, nothing in this Code shall 6prohibit a tow truck under instructions of a police officer 7from legally clearing a disabled vehicle, that may be in 8violation of weight limitations of this Chapter, from the 9roadway to the berm or shoulder of the highway. If in the 10opinion of the police officer that location is unsafe, the 11officer is authorized to have the disabled vehicle towed to 12the nearest place of safety.13    For the purpose of this subsection, gross vehicle weight 14rating, or GVWR, means the value specified by the manufacturer 15as the loaded weight of the tow truck.16    (b) As used in this Section, "recycling haul" or 17"recycling operation" means the hauling of non-hazardous, 18non-special, non-putrescible materials, such as paper, glass, 19cans, or plastic, for subsequent use in the secondary 20materials market.21    (c) No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with 22pneumatic tires shall be operated, unladen or with load, upon 23the highways of this State in violation of the provisions of 24any permit issued under the provisions of Sections 15-301 25through 15-318 of this Chapter.26    (d) No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with   HB2394 Engrossed- 15 -LRB104 08276 LNS 18326 b1other than pneumatic tires may be operated, unladen or with 2load, upon the highways of this State when the gross weight on 3the road surface through any wheel exceeds 800 pounds per inch 4width of tire tread or when the gross weight on the road 5surface through any axle exceeds 16,000 pounds.6    (e) No person shall operate a vehicle or combination of 7vehicles over a bridge or other elevated structure 8constituting part of a highway with a gross weight that is 9greater than the maximum weight permitted by the Department, 10when the structure is sign posted as provided in this Section.11    (f) The Department upon request from any local authority 12shall, or upon its own initiative may, conduct an 13investigation of any bridge or other elevated structure 14constituting a part of a highway, and if it finds that the 15structure cannot with safety to itself withstand the weight of 16vehicles otherwise permissible under this Code the Department 17shall determine and declare the maximum weight of vehicles 18that the structures can withstand, and shall cause or permit 19suitable signs stating maximum weight to be erected and 20maintained before each end of the structure. No person shall 21operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles over any 22structure with a gross weight that is greater than the posted 23maximum weight.24    (g) Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation 25of subsection (e) or (f) of this Section, proof of the 26determination of the maximum allowable weight by the   HB2394 Engrossed- 16 -LRB104 08276 LNS 18326 b1Department and the existence of the signs, constitutes 2conclusive evidence of the maximum weight that can be 3maintained with safety to the bridge or structure.4(Source: P.A. 102-124, eff. 7-23-21.)
