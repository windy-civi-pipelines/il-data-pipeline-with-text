Any 9        additional movement of the vehicles may occur only 10        upon issuance of authorization for that movement under 11        the provisions of Sections 15-301 through 15-318 of 12        this Code. The towing vehicle, however, may tow any 13        disabled vehicle to a point where repairs are actually 14        to occur. This movement shall be valid only on State 15        routes. The tower must abide by posted bridge weight 16        limits.17        (12.5) The vehicle weight limitations in this Section 18    do not apply to a covered heavy duty tow and recovery 19    vehicle.

This paragraph (14) shall 4    not allow a vehicle to exceed any posted weight limit on a 5    highway or structure. 6        (15) An emergency vehicle or fire apparatus that is a 7    vehicle designed to be used under emergency conditions to 8    transport personnel and equipment, and used to support the 9    suppression of fires and mitigation of other hazardous 10    situations on a Class I highway, may not exceed 86,000 11    pounds gross weight, or any of the following weight 12    allowances:13            (i) 24,000 pounds on a single steering axle;14            (ii) 33,500 pounds on a single drive axle;15            (iii) 62,000 pounds on a tandem axle; or16            (iv) 52,000 pounds on a tandem rear drive steer 17        axle. 18        (16) A bus, motor coach, or recreational vehicle may 19    carry a total weight of 24,000 pounds on a single axle, but 20    may not exceed other weight provisions of this Section. 21    Gross weight limits shall not apply to the combination of 22the tow truck and vehicles being towed. The tow truck license 23plate must cover the operating empty weight of the tow truck 24only. The weight of each vehicle being towed shall be covered 25by a valid license plate issued to the owner or operator of the 26vehicle being towed and displayed on that vehicle. If no valid   10400HB2394ham001- 14 -LRB104 08276 LNS 23538 a1plate issued to the owner or operator of that vehicle is 2displayed on that vehicle, or the plate displayed on that 3vehicle does not cover the weight of the vehicle, the weight of 4the vehicle shall be covered by the third tow truck plate 5issued to the owner or operator of the tow truck and 6temporarily affixed to the vehicle being towed. If a roll-back 7carrier is registered and being used as a tow truck, however, 8the license plate or plates for the tow truck must cover the 9gross vehicle weight, including any load carried on the bed of 10the roll-back carrier.11    The Department may by rule or regulation prescribe 12additional requirements. However, nothing in this Code shall 13prohibit a tow truck under instructions of a police officer 14from legally clearing a disabled vehicle, that may be in 15violation of weight limitations of this Chapter, from the 16roadway to the berm or shoulder of the highway. If in the 17opinion of the police officer that location is unsafe, the 18officer is authorized to have the disabled vehicle towed to 19the nearest place of safety.20    For the purpose of this subsection, gross vehicle weight 21rating, or GVWR, means the value specified by the manufacturer 22as the loaded weight of the tow truck.23    (b) As used in this Section, "recycling haul" or 24"recycling operation" means the hauling of non-hazardous, 25non-special, non-putrescible materials, such as paper, glass, 26cans, or plastic, for subsequent use in the secondary   10400HB2394ham001- 15 -LRB104 08276 LNS 23538 a1materials market.2    (c) No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with 3pneumatic tires shall be operated, unladen or with load, upon 4the highways of this State in violation of the provisions of 5any permit issued under the provisions of Sections 15-301 6through 15-318 of this Chapter.7    (d) No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with 8other than pneumatic tires may be operated, unladen or with 9load, upon the highways of this State when the gross weight on 10the road surface through any wheel exceeds 800 pounds per inch 11width of tire tread or when the gross weight on the road 12surface through any axle exceeds 16,000 pounds.13    (e) No person shall operate a vehicle or combination of 14vehicles over a bridge or other elevated structure 15constituting part of a highway with a gross weight that is 16greater than the maximum weight permitted by the Department, 17when the structure is sign posted as provided in this Section.18    (f) The Department upon request from any local authority 19shall, or upon its own initiative may, conduct an 20investigation of any bridge or other elevated structure 21constituting a part of a highway, and if it finds that the 22structure cannot with safety to itself withstand the weight of 23vehicles otherwise permissible under this Code the Department 24shall determine and declare the maximum weight of vehicles 25that the structures can withstand, and shall cause or permit 26suitable signs stating maximum weight to be erected and   10400HB2394ham001- 16 -LRB104 08276 LNS 23538 a1maintained before each end of the structure. No person shall 2operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles over any 3structure with a gross weight that is greater than the posted 4maximum weight.5    (g) Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation 6of subsection (e) or (f) of this Section, proof of the 7determination of the maximum allowable weight by the 8Department and the existence of the signs, constitutes 9conclusive evidence of the maximum weight that can be 10maintained with safety to the bridge or structure.11(Source: P.A. 102-124, eff. 7-23-21.)".

If a roll-back 7carrier is registered and being used as a tow truck, however, 8the license plate or plates for the tow truck must cover the 9gross vehicle weight, including any load carried on the bed of 10the roll-back carrier.11    The Department may by rule or regulation prescribe 12additional requirements. However, nothing in this Code shall 13prohibit a tow truck under instructions of a police officer 14from legally clearing a disabled vehicle, that may be in 15violation of weight limitations of this Chapter, from the 16roadway to the berm or shoulder of the highway. If in the 17opinion of the police officer that location is unsafe, the 18officer is authorized to have the disabled vehicle towed to 19the nearest place of safety.20    For the purpose of this subsection, gross vehicle weight 21rating, or GVWR, means the value specified by the manufacturer 22as the loaded weight of the tow truck.23    (b) As used in this Section, "recycling haul" or 24"recycling operation" means the hauling of non-hazardous, 25non-special, non-putrescible materials, such as paper, glass, 26cans, or plastic, for subsequent use in the secondary   10400HB2394ham001- 15 -LRB104 08276 LNS 23538 a1materials market.2    (c) No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with 3pneumatic tires shall be operated, unladen or with load, upon 4the highways of this State in violation of the provisions of 5any permit issued under the provisions of Sections 15-301 6through 15-318 of this Chapter.7    (d) No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with 8other than pneumatic tires may be operated, unladen or with 9load, upon the highways of this State when the gross weight on 10the road surface through any wheel exceeds 800 pounds per inch 11width of tire tread or when the gross weight on the road 12surface through any axle exceeds 16,000 pounds.13    (e) No person shall operate a vehicle or combination of 14vehicles over a bridge or other elevated structure 15constituting part of a highway with a gross weight that is 16greater than the maximum weight permitted by the Department, 17when the structure is sign posted as provided in this Section.18    (f) The Department upon request from any local authority 19shall, or upon its own initiative may, conduct an 20investigation of any bridge or other elevated structure 21constituting a part of a highway, and if it finds that the 22structure cannot with safety to itself withstand the weight of 23vehicles otherwise permissible under this Code the Department 24shall determine and declare the maximum weight of vehicles 25that the structures can withstand, and shall cause or permit 26suitable signs stating maximum weight to be erected and   10400HB2394ham001- 16 -LRB104 08276 LNS 23538 a1maintained before each end of the structure. No person shall 2operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles over any 3structure with a gross weight that is greater than the posted 4maximum weight.5    (g) Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation 6of subsection (e) or (f) of this Section, proof of the 7determination of the maximum allowable weight by the 8Department and the existence of the signs, constitutes 9conclusive evidence of the maximum weight that can be 10maintained with safety to the bridge or structure.11(Source: P.A. 102-124, eff. 7-23-21.)".
