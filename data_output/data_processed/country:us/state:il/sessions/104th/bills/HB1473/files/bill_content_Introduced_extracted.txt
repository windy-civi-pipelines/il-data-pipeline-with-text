The Illinois Parentage Act of 2015 is amended 22by changing Section 802 as follows: 23    (750 ILCS 46/802)24    Sec. 802. Judgment.   HB1473- 5 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1    (a) The court shall issue an order adjudicating whether a 2person alleged or claiming to be the parent is the parent of 3the child. An order adjudicating parentage must identify the 4child by name and date of birth.5    The court may assess filing fees, reasonable attorney's 6fees, fees for genetic testing, other costs, necessary travel 7expenses, and other reasonable expenses incurred in a 8proceeding under this Act. The court may award attorney's 9fees, which may be paid directly to the attorney, who may 10enforce the order in the attorney's own name. The court may not 11assess fees, costs, or expenses against the 12support-enforcement agency of this State or another state, 13except as provided by other law.14    The judgment shall contain or explicitly reserve 15provisions concerning any duty and amount of child support and 16may contain or explicitly reserve provisions concerning the 17allocation of parental responsibilities or guardianship of the 18child, parenting time privileges with the child, and the 19furnishing of bond or other security for the payment of the 20judgment, which the court shall determine in accordance with 21the relevant factors set forth in the Illinois Marriage and 22Dissolution of Marriage Act and any other applicable law of 23this State, to guide the court in a finding in the best 24interests of the child. In determining the allocation of 25parental responsibilities, relocation, parenting time, 26parenting time interference, support for a non-minor disabled   HB1473- 6 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1child, educational expenses for a non-minor child, and related 2post-judgment issues, the court shall apply the relevant 3standards of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage 4Act. Specifically, in determining the amount of a child 5support award, the court shall use the guidelines and 6standards set forth in subsection (a) of Section 505 and in 7Section 505.2 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 8Marriage Act. The court shall order all child support 9payments, determined in accordance with such guidelines, to 10commence with the date summons is served. The level of current 11periodic support payments shall not be reduced because of 12payments set for the period prior to the date of entry of the 13support order.14    (b) In an action brought during a pregnancy or within 2 15years after a child's birth, the judgment or order may direct 16the other party to the pregnancy or other intended parent 17either parent to pay 50% of pregnancy the reasonable expenses, 18as defined in the Pregnancy Expenses Act, incurred by the 19pregnant person either parent or the Department of Healthcare 20and Family Services. However, the court, in its discretion, 21may direct the other party to the pregnancy or other intended 22parent to pay more than 50% of pregnancy expenses related to 23the mother's pregnancy and the delivery of the child.24    (c) In the absence of an explicit order or judgment for the 25allocation of parental responsibilities, to the extent the 26court has authority under the Uniform Child-Custody   HB1473- 7 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act or any other appropriate 2State law, the establishment of a child support obligation or 3the allocation of parenting time to one parent shall be 4construed as an order or judgment allocating all parental 5responsibilities to the other parent. If the parentage order 6or judgment contains no such provisions, all parental 7responsibilities shall be presumed to be allocated to the 8mother; however, the presumption shall not apply if the child 9has resided primarily with the other parent for at least 6 10months prior to the date that the mother seeks to enforce the 11order or judgment of parentage.12    (c-5) Notwithstanding the limitations regarding the 13establishment of custody under the Uniform Interstate Family 14Support Act, that Act is not exclusive, and custody/allocation 15of parental responsibilities may be determined concurrently 16under other appropriate State laws, where this determination 17may be validly made.18    (d) The court, if necessary to protect and promote the 19best interests of the child, may set aside a portion of the 20separately held estates of the parties in a separate fund or 21trust for the support, education, physical and mental health, 22and general welfare of a minor or mentally or physically 23disabled child of the parties.24    (e) The court may order child support payments to be made 25for a period prior to the commencement of the action. In 26determining whether and to what extent the payments shall be   HB1473- 8 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1made for the prior period, the court shall consider all 2relevant facts, including but not limited to: 3        (1) The factors for determining the amount of support 4    specified in the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 5    Marriage Act.6        (2) The prior knowledge of the person obligated to pay 7    support of the fact and circumstances of the child's 8    birth. 9        (3) The father's prior willingness or refusal to help 10    raise or support the child. 11        (4) The extent to which the mother or the public 12    agency bringing the action previously informed the person 13    obligated to pay support of the child's needs or attempted 14    to seek or require the help of the person obligated to pay 15    support in raising or supporting the child. 16        (5) The reasons the mother or the public agency did 17    not file the action earlier. 18        (6) The extent to which the person obligated to pay 19    support would be prejudiced by the delay in bringing the 20    action.21    For purposes of determining the amount of child support to 22be paid for the period before the date the order for current 23child support is entered, there is a rebuttable presumption 24that the net income of the person obligated to pay support for 25the prior period was the same as the net income of the person 26obligated to pay support at the time the order for current   HB1473- 9 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1child support is entered.2    If (i) the person obligated to pay support was properly 3served with a request for discovery of financial information 4relating to the ability to provide child support of the person 5obligated to pay support; (ii) the person obligated to pay 6support failed to comply with the request, despite having been 7ordered to do so by the court; and (iii) the person obligated 8to pay support is not present at the hearing to determine 9support despite having received proper notice, then any 10relevant financial information concerning the ability to 11provide child support of the person obligated to pay support 12that was obtained pursuant to subpoena and proper notice shall 13be admitted into evidence without the need to establish any 14further foundation for its admission. 15    (f) A new or existing support order entered by the court 16under this Section shall be deemed to be a series of judgments 17against the person obligated to pay support thereunder, each 18judgment to be in the amount of each payment or installment of 19support and each judgment to be deemed entered as of the date 20the corresponding payment or installment becomes due under the 21terms of the support order. Each judgment shall have the full 22force, effect, and attributes of any other judgment of this 23State, including the ability to be enforced. A judgment under 24this Section is subject to modification or termination only in 25accordance with Section 510 of the Illinois Marriage and 26Dissolution of Marriage Act. Notwithstanding any State or   HB1473- 10 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1local law to the contrary, a lien arises by operation of law 2against the real and personal property of the noncustodial 3parent for each installment of overdue support owed by the 4noncustodial parent. 5    (g) If the judgment or order of the court is at variance 6with the child's birth certificate, the court shall order that 7a new birth certificate be issued under the Vital Records Act. 8    (h) On the request of both parents, the court shall order a 9change in the child's name. 10    (i) After hearing evidence, the court may stay payment of 11support during the period of the father's minority or period 12of disability. 13    (j) If, upon a showing of proper service, the father fails 14to appear in court or otherwise appear as provided by law, the 15court may proceed to hear the cause upon testimony of the 16mother or other parties taken in open court and shall enter a 17judgment by default. The court may reserve any order as to the 18amount of child support until the father has received notice, 19by regular mail, of a hearing on the matter. 20    (k) An order for support, when entered or modified, shall 21include a provision requiring the non-custodial parent to 22notify the court and, in cases in which a party is receiving 23child support enforcement services under Article X of the 24Illinois Public Aid Code, the Department of Healthcare and 25Family Services, within 7 days: (i) of the name and address of 26any new employer of the non-custodial parent; (ii) whether the   HB1473- 11 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1non-custodial parent has access to health insurance coverage 2through the employer or other group coverage and, if so, of the 3policy name and number and the names of adults and initials of 4minors covered under the policy; and (iii) of any new 5residential or mailing address or telephone number of the 6non-custodial parent. In a subsequent action to enforce a 7support order, upon a sufficient showing that a diligent 8effort has been made to ascertain the location of the 9non-custodial parent, service of process or provision of 10notice necessary in the case may be made at the last known 11address of the non-custodial parent in any manner expressly 12provided by this Act or the Code of Civil Procedure, and shall 13be sufficient for purposes of due process. 14    (l) An order for support shall include a date on which the 15current support obligation terminates. The termination date 16shall be no earlier than the date on which the child covered by 17the order will attain the age of 18. However, if the child will 18not graduate from high school until after attaining the age of 1918, then the termination date shall be no earlier than the 20earlier of the date on which the child's high school 21graduation will occur or the date on which the child will 22attain the age of 19. The order for support shall state that 23the termination date does not apply to any arrearage that may 24remain unpaid on that date. Nothing in this subsection shall 25be construed to prevent the court from modifying the order or 26terminating the order in the event the child is otherwise   HB1473- 12 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1emancipated. 2    (m) If there is an unpaid arrearage or delinquency (as 3those terms are defined in the Income Withholding for Support 4Act) equal to at least one month's support obligation on the 5termination date stated in the order for support or, if there 6is no termination date stated in the order, on the date the 7child attains the age of majority or is otherwise emancipated, 8the periodic amount required to be paid for current support of 9that child immediately prior to that date shall automatically 10continue to be an obligation, not as current support but as 11periodic payment toward satisfaction of the unpaid arrearage 12or delinquency. The periodic payment shall be in addition to 13any periodic payment previously required for satisfaction of 14the arrearage or delinquency. The total periodic amount to be 15paid toward satisfaction of the arrearage or delinquency may 16be enforced and collected by any method provided by law for 17enforcement and collection of child support, including but not 18limited to income withholding under the Income Withholding for 19Support Act. Each order for support entered or modified must 20contain a statement notifying the parties of the requirements 21of this subsection. Failure to include the statement in the 22order for support does not affect the validity of the order or 23the operation of the provisions of this subsection with regard 24to the order. This subsection shall not be construed to 25prevent or affect the establishment or modification of an 26order for support of a minor child or the establishment or   HB1473- 13 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1modification of an order for support of a non-minor child or 2educational expenses under Section 513 of the Illinois 3Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. 4    (n) An order entered under this Section shall include a 5provision requiring the obligor to report to the obligee and 6to the clerk of court within 7 days each time the obligor 7obtains new employment, and each time the obligor's employment 8is terminated for any reason. The report shall be in writing 9and shall, in the case of new employment, include the name and 10address of the new employer. Failure to report new employment 11or the termination of current employment, if coupled with 12nonpayment of support for a period in excess of 60 days, is 13indirect criminal contempt. For an obligor arrested for 14failure to report new employment, bond shall be set in the 15amount of the child support that should have been paid during 16the period of unreported employment. An order entered under 17this Section shall also include a provision requiring the 18obligor and obligee parents to advise each other of a change in 19residence within 5 days of the change except when the court 20finds that the physical, mental, or emotional health of a 21party or that of a minor child, or both, would be seriously 22endangered by disclosure of the party's address. 23(Source: P.A. 102-541, eff. 8-20-21.) 24    Section 99. Effective date. This Act takes effect upon 25becoming law.

In 26determining whether and to what extent the payments shall be   HB1473- 8 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1made for the prior period, the court shall consider all 2relevant facts, including but not limited to: 3        (1) The factors for determining the amount of support 4    specified in the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 5    Marriage Act.6        (2) The prior knowledge of the person obligated to pay 7    support of the fact and circumstances of the child's 8    birth. 9        (3) The father's prior willingness or refusal to help 10    raise or support the child. 11        (4) The extent to which the mother or the public 12    agency bringing the action previously informed the person 13    obligated to pay support of the child's needs or attempted 14    to seek or require the help of the person obligated to pay 15    support in raising or supporting the child. 16        (5) The reasons the mother or the public agency did 17    not file the action earlier. 18        (6) The extent to which the person obligated to pay 19    support would be prejudiced by the delay in bringing the 20    action.21    For purposes of determining the amount of child support to 22be paid for the period before the date the order for current 23child support is entered, there is a rebuttable presumption 24that the net income of the person obligated to pay support for 25the prior period was the same as the net income of the person 26obligated to pay support at the time the order for current   HB1473- 9 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1child support is entered.2    If (i) the person obligated to pay support was properly 3served with a request for discovery of financial information 4relating to the ability to provide child support of the person 5obligated to pay support; (ii) the person obligated to pay 6support failed to comply with the request, despite having been 7ordered to do so by the court; and (iii) the person obligated 8to pay support is not present at the hearing to determine 9support despite having received proper notice, then any 10relevant financial information concerning the ability to 11provide child support of the person obligated to pay support 12that was obtained pursuant to subpoena and proper notice shall 13be admitted into evidence without the need to establish any 14further foundation for its admission. 15    (f) A new or existing support order entered by the court 16under this Section shall be deemed to be a series of judgments 17against the person obligated to pay support thereunder, each 18judgment to be in the amount of each payment or installment of 19support and each judgment to be deemed entered as of the date 20the corresponding payment or installment becomes due under the 21terms of the support order. Each judgment shall have the full 22force, effect, and attributes of any other judgment of this 23State, including the ability to be enforced. A judgment under 24this Section is subject to modification or termination only in 25accordance with Section 510 of the Illinois Marriage and 26Dissolution of Marriage Act. Notwithstanding any State or   HB1473- 10 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1local law to the contrary, a lien arises by operation of law 2against the real and personal property of the noncustodial 3parent for each installment of overdue support owed by the 4noncustodial parent. 5    (g) If the judgment or order of the court is at variance 6with the child's birth certificate, the court shall order that 7a new birth certificate be issued under the Vital Records Act. 8    (h) On the request of both parents, the court shall order a 9change in the child's name. 10    (i) After hearing evidence, the court may stay payment of 11support during the period of the father's minority or period 12of disability. 13    (j) If, upon a showing of proper service, the father fails 14to appear in court or otherwise appear as provided by law, the 15court may proceed to hear the cause upon testimony of the 16mother or other parties taken in open court and shall enter a 17judgment by default. The court may reserve any order as to the 18amount of child support until the father has received notice, 19by regular mail, of a hearing on the matter. 20    (k) An order for support, when entered or modified, shall 21include a provision requiring the non-custodial parent to 22notify the court and, in cases in which a party is receiving 23child support enforcement services under Article X of the 24Illinois Public Aid Code, the Department of Healthcare and 25Family Services, within 7 days: (i) of the name and address of 26any new employer of the non-custodial parent; (ii) whether the   HB1473- 11 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1non-custodial parent has access to health insurance coverage 2through the employer or other group coverage and, if so, of the 3policy name and number and the names of adults and initials of 4minors covered under the policy; and (iii) of any new 5residential or mailing address or telephone number of the 6non-custodial parent. In a subsequent action to enforce a 7support order, upon a sufficient showing that a diligent 8effort has been made to ascertain the location of the 9non-custodial parent, service of process or provision of 10notice necessary in the case may be made at the last known 11address of the non-custodial parent in any manner expressly 12provided by this Act or the Code of Civil Procedure, and shall 13be sufficient for purposes of due process. 14    (l) An order for support shall include a date on which the 15current support obligation terminates. The termination date 16shall be no earlier than the date on which the child covered by 17the order will attain the age of 18. However, if the child will 18not graduate from high school until after attaining the age of 1918, then the termination date shall be no earlier than the 20earlier of the date on which the child's high school 21graduation will occur or the date on which the child will 22attain the age of 19. The order for support shall state that 23the termination date does not apply to any arrearage that may 24remain unpaid on that date. Nothing in this subsection shall 25be construed to prevent the court from modifying the order or 26terminating the order in the event the child is otherwise   HB1473- 12 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1emancipated. 2    (m) If there is an unpaid arrearage or delinquency (as 3those terms are defined in the Income Withholding for Support 4Act) equal to at least one month's support obligation on the 5termination date stated in the order for support or, if there 6is no termination date stated in the order, on the date the 7child attains the age of majority or is otherwise emancipated, 8the periodic amount required to be paid for current support of 9that child immediately prior to that date shall automatically 10continue to be an obligation, not as current support but as 11periodic payment toward satisfaction of the unpaid arrearage 12or delinquency. The periodic payment shall be in addition to 13any periodic payment previously required for satisfaction of 14the arrearage or delinquency. The total periodic amount to be 15paid toward satisfaction of the arrearage or delinquency may 16be enforced and collected by any method provided by law for 17enforcement and collection of child support, including but not 18limited to income withholding under the Income Withholding for 19Support Act. Each order for support entered or modified must 20contain a statement notifying the parties of the requirements 21of this subsection. Failure to include the statement in the 22order for support does not affect the validity of the order or 23the operation of the provisions of this subsection with regard 24to the order. This subsection shall not be construed to 25prevent or affect the establishment or modification of an 26order for support of a minor child or the establishment or   HB1473- 13 -LRB104 03151 JRC 13172 b1modification of an order for support of a non-minor child or 2educational expenses under Section 513 of the Illinois 3Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. 4    (n) An order entered under this Section shall include a 5provision requiring the obligor to report to the obligee and 6to the clerk of court within 7 days each time the obligor 7obtains new employment, and each time the obligor's employment 8is terminated for any reason. The report shall be in writing 9and shall, in the case of new employment, include the name and 10address of the new employer. Failure to report new employment 11or the termination of current employment, if coupled with 12nonpayment of support for a period in excess of 60 days, is 13indirect criminal contempt. For an obligor arrested for 14failure to report new employment, bond shall be set in the 15amount of the child support that should have been paid during 16the period of unreported employment. An order entered under 17this Section shall also include a provision requiring the 18obligor and obligee parents to advise each other of a change in 19residence within 5 days of the change except when the court 20finds that the physical, mental, or emotional health of a 21party or that of a minor child, or both, would be seriously 22endangered by disclosure of the party's address. 23(Source: P.A. 102-541, eff. 8-20-21.) 24    Section 99.
