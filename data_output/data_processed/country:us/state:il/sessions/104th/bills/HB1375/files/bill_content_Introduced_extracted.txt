The maximum service of 10 years which is allowable 26    under this paragraph shall be reduced by the service   HB1375- 3 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    credit which is validated by other retirement systems 2    under paragraph (i) of Section 15-113 and paragraph 1 of 3    Section 17-133.

Whenever 11    such service credit exceeds the maximum allowed for all 12    purposes of this Article, the first service rendered in 13    point of time shall be considered. The changes to this 14    paragraph (2) made by Public Act 86-272 shall apply not 15    only to persons who on or after its effective date (August 16    23, 1989) are in service as a teacher under the System, but 17    also to persons whose status as such a teacher terminated 18    prior to such effective date, whether or not such person 19    is an annuitant on that date.20        (3) Any periods immediately following teaching 21    service, under this System or under Article 17, (or 22    immediately following service prior to February 1, 1951 as 23    a recreation worker for the Illinois Department of Public 24    Safety) spent in active service with the military forces 25    of the United States; periods spent in educational 26    programs that prepare for return to teaching sponsored by   HB1375- 4 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    the federal government following such active military 2    service; if a teacher returns to teaching service within 3    one calendar year after discharge or after the completion 4    of the educational program, a further period, not 5    exceeding one calendar year, between time spent in 6    military service or in such educational programs and the 7    return to employment as a teacher under this System; and a 8    period of up to 2 years of active military service not 9    immediately following employment as a teacher.10        The changes to this Section and Section 16-128 11    relating to military service made by Public Act 87-794 12    shall apply not only to persons who on or after its 13    effective date are in service as a teacher under the 14    System, but also to persons whose status as a teacher 15    terminated prior to that date, whether or not the person 16    is an annuitant on that date. In the case of an annuitant 17    who applies for credit allowable under this Section for a 18    period of military service that did not immediately follow 19    employment, and who has made the required contributions 20    for such credit, the annuity shall be recalculated to 21    include the additional service credit, with the increase 22    taking effect on the date the System received written 23    notification of the annuitant's intent to purchase the 24    credit, if payment of all the required contributions is 25    made within 60 days of such notice, or else on the first 26    annuity payment date following the date of payment of the   HB1375- 5 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    required contributions. In calculating the automatic 2    annual increase for an annuity that has been recalculated 3    under this Section, the increase attributable to the 4    additional service allowable under Public Act 87-794 shall 5    be included in the calculation of automatic annual 6    increases accruing after the effective date of the 7    recalculation.8        Credit for military service shall be determined as 9    follows: if entry occurs during the months of July, 10    August, or September and the member was a teacher at the 11    end of the immediately preceding school term, credit shall 12    be granted from July 1 of the year in which he or she 13    entered service; if entry occurs during the school term 14    and the teacher was in teaching service at the beginning 15    of the school term, credit shall be granted from July 1 of 16    such year. In all other cases where credit for military 17    service is allowed, credit shall be granted from the date 18    of entry into the service.19        The total period of military service for which credit 20    is granted shall not exceed 5 years for any member unless 21    the service: (A) is validated before July 1, 1964, and (B) 22    does not extend beyond July 1, 1963.

The 2    changes to this paragraph (3) made by Public Act 86-272 3    shall apply not only to persons who on or after its 4    effective date (August 23, 1989) are in service as a 5    teacher under the System, but also to persons whose status 6    as such a teacher terminated prior to such effective date, 7    whether or not such person is an annuitant on that date.8        (4) Any periods served as a member of the General 9    Assembly.10        (5)(i) Any periods for which a teacher, as defined in 11    Section 16-106, is granted a leave of absence, provided he 12    or she returns to teaching service creditable under this 13    System or the State Universities Retirement System 14    following the leave; (ii) periods during which a teacher 15    is involuntarily laid off from teaching, provided he or 16    she returns to teaching following the lay-off; (iii) 17    periods prior to July 1, 1983 during which a teacher 18    ceased covered employment due to pregnancy, provided that 19    the teacher returned to teaching service creditable under 20    this System or the State Universities Retirement System 21    following the pregnancy and submits evidence satisfactory 22    to the Board documenting that the employment ceased due to 23    pregnancy; and (iv) periods prior to July 1, 1983 during 24    which a teacher ceased covered employment for the purpose 25    of adopting an infant under 3 years of age or caring for a 26    newly adopted infant under 3 years of age, provided that   HB1375- 7 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    the teacher returned to teaching service creditable under 2    this System or the State Universities Retirement System 3    following the adoption and submits evidence satisfactory 4    to the Board documenting that the employment ceased for 5    the purpose of adopting an infant under 3 years of age or 6    caring for a newly adopted infant under 3 years of age. 7    However, total credit under this paragraph (5) may not 8    exceed 3 years.9        Any qualified member or annuitant may apply for credit 10    under item (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph (5) without 11    regard to whether service was terminated before June 27, 12    1997 (the effective date of Public Act 90-32). In the case 13    of an annuitant who establishes credit under item (iii) or 14    (iv), the annuity shall be recalculated to include the 15    additional service credit. The increase in annuity shall 16    take effect on the date the System receives written 17    notification of the annuitant's intent to purchase the 18    credit, if the required evidence is submitted and the 19    required contribution paid within 60 days of that 20    notification, otherwise on the first annuity payment date 21    following the System's receipt of the required evidence 22    and contribution.

A teacher whose service under this Article 4    terminated prior to the effective date of Public Act 5    86-1488 shall be eligible to purchase such optional 6    credit. If a teacher who purchases this optional credit is 7    already receiving a retirement annuity under this Article, 8    the annuity shall be recalculated as if the annuitant had 9    applied for the leave of absence credit at the time of 10    retirement. The difference between the entitled annuity 11    and the actual annuity shall be credited to the purchase 12    of the optional credit. The remainder of the purchase cost 13    of the optional credit shall be paid on or before April 1, 14    1992.15        The change in this paragraph made by Public Act 86-273 16    shall be applicable to teachers who retire after June 1, 17    1989, as well as to teachers who are in service on that 18    date.19        (6) Any days of unused and uncompensated accumulated 20    sick leave earned by a teacher.

In making these determinations, the 24required State contribution shall be calculated each year as a 25level percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 26including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the   HB1375- 17 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1projected unit credit actuarial cost method.2    For each of State fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 3State shall make an additional contribution to the System 4equal to 2% of the total payroll of each employee who is deemed 5to have elected the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has 6made the election under subsection (c) of Section 1-161. 7    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 8increases or decreases the required State contribution and 9first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 10implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 11beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 12change first applies to the required State contribution.13    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 14increases or decreases the required State contribution and 15first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 162015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:17        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before 18    2018; and19        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 20    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 21    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 22    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 23    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 24    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 25    fiscal years in that 5-year period.26    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State   HB1375- 18 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable 2employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 3increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 4contributing at the rate required under this Section; except 5that in the following specified State fiscal years, the State 6contribution to the System shall not be less than the 7following indicated percentages of the applicable employee 8payroll, even if the indicated percentage will produce a State 9contribution in excess of the amount otherwise required under 10this subsection and subsection (a), and notwithstanding any 11contrary certification made under subsection (a-1) before May 1227, 1998 (the effective date of Public Act 90-582): 10.02% in 13FY 1999; 10.77% in FY 2000; 11.47% in FY 2001; 12.16% in FY 142002; 12.86% in FY 2003; and 13.56% in FY 2004.15    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 16total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2006 17is $534,627,700. 18    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 19total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2007 20is $738,014,500. 21    For each of State fiscal years 2008 through 2009, the 22State contribution to the System, as a percentage of the 23applicable employee payroll, shall be increased in equal 24annual increments from the required State contribution for 25State fiscal year 2007, so that by State fiscal year 2011, the 26State is contributing at the rate otherwise required under   HB1375- 19 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1this Section. 2    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 3total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2010 4is $2,089,268,000 and shall be made from the proceeds of bonds 5sold in fiscal year 2010 pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General 6Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale 7expenses determined by the System's share of total bond 8proceeds, (ii) any amounts received from the Common School 9Fund in fiscal year 2010, and (iii) any reduction in bond 10proceeds due to the issuance of discounted bonds, if 11applicable. 12    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 13total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2011 14is the amount recertified by the System on or before April 1, 152011 pursuant to subsection (a-1) of this Section and shall be 16made from the proceeds of bonds sold in fiscal year 2011 17pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, 18less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale expenses determined by 19the System's share of total bond proceeds, (ii) any amounts 20received from the Common School Fund in fiscal year 2011, and 21(iii) any reduction in bond proceeds due to the issuance of 22discounted bonds, if applicable. This amount shall include, in 23addition to the amount certified by the System, an amount 24necessary to meet employer contributions required by the State 25as an employer under paragraph (e) of this Section, which may 26also be used by the System for contributions required by   HB1375- 20 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1paragraph (a) of Section 16-127. 2    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, the minimum State 3contribution for each fiscal year shall be the amount needed 4to maintain the total assets of the System at 90% of the total 5actuarial liabilities of the System.6    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 7the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 8Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 9constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 10contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 11Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 12calculation of, the required State contributions under this 13Article in any future year until the System has reached a 14funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 15the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 16term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 17System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act.18    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 19required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 20fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 21calculated under this Section and certified under subsection 22(a-1), shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount of 23the required State contribution that would have been 24calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 25System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 26Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the   HB1375- 21 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 2fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 3purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 4the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 5the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 67.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act. In determining this 7maximum for State fiscal years 2008 through 2010, however, the 8amount referred to in item (i) shall be increased, as a 9percentage of the applicable employee payroll, in equal 10increments calculated from the sum of the required State 11contribution for State fiscal year 2007 plus the applicable 12portion of the State's total debt service payments for fiscal 13year 2007 on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 14purposes of Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, so 15that, by State fiscal year 2011, the State is contributing at 16the rate otherwise required under this Section.17    (b-4) Beginning in fiscal year 2018, each employer under 18this Article shall pay to the System a required contribution 19determined as a percentage of projected payroll and sufficient 20to produce an annual amount equal to:21        (i) for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 22    defined benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, 23    less the employee contribution, for each employee of that 24    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 25    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 26    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; for fiscal   HB1375- 22 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    year 2021 and each fiscal year thereafter, the defined 2    benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, less the 3    employee contribution, plus 2%, for each employee of that 4    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 5    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 6    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; plus7        (ii) the amount required for that fiscal year to 8    amortize any unfunded actuarial accrued liability 9    associated with the present value of liabilities 10    attributable to the employer's account under Section 11    16-158.3, determined as a level percentage of payroll over 12    a 30-year rolling amortization period.13    In determining contributions required under item (i) of 14this subsection, the System shall determine an aggregate rate 15for all employers, expressed as a percentage of projected 16payroll. 17    In determining the contributions required under item (ii) 18of this subsection, the amount shall be computed by the System 19on the basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in 20the most recent actuarial valuation of the System that is 21available at the time of the computation. 22    The contributions required under this subsection (b-4) 23shall be paid by an employer concurrently with that employer's 24payroll payment period. The State, as the actual employer of 25an employee, shall make the required contributions under this 26subsection.   HB1375- 23 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    (c) Payment of the required State contributions and of all 2pensions, retirement annuities, death benefits, refunds, and 3other benefits granted under or assumed by this System, and 4all expenses in connection with the administration and 5operation thereof, are obligations of the State.6    If members are paid from special trust or federal funds 7which are administered by the employing unit, whether school 8district or other unit, the employing unit shall pay to the 9System from such funds the full accruing retirement costs 10based upon that service, which, beginning July 1, 2017, shall 11be at a rate, expressed as a percentage of salary, equal to the 12total employer's normal cost, expressed as a percentage of 13payroll, as determined by the System. Employer contributions, 14based on salary paid to members from federal funds, may be 15forwarded by the distributing agency of the State of Illinois 16to the System prior to allocation, in an amount determined in 17accordance with guidelines established by such agency and the 18System. Any contribution for fiscal year 2015 collected as a 19result of the change made by Public Act 98-674 shall be 20considered a State contribution under subsection (b-3) of this 21Section. 22    (d) Effective July 1, 1986, any employer of a teacher as 23defined in paragraph (8) of Section 16-106 shall pay the 24employer's normal cost of benefits based upon the teacher's 25service, in addition to employee contributions, as determined 26by the System. Such employer contributions shall be forwarded   HB1375- 24 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1monthly in accordance with guidelines established by the 2System.3    However, with respect to benefits granted under Section 416-133.4 or 16-133.5 to a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) 5of Section 16-106, the employer's contribution shall be 12% 6(rather than 20%) of the member's highest annual salary rate 7for each year of creditable service granted, and the employer 8shall also pay the required employee contribution on behalf of 9the teacher. For the purposes of Sections 16-133.4 and 1016-133.5, a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) of Section 1116-106 who is serving in that capacity while on leave of 12absence from another employer under this Article shall not be 13considered an employee of the employer from which the teacher 14is on leave.15    (e) Beginning July 1, 1998, every employer of a teacher 16shall pay to the System an employer contribution computed as 17follows:18        (1) Beginning July 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999, the 19    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.3% of each 20    teacher's salary.21        (2) Beginning July 1, 1999 and thereafter, the 22    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.58% of each 23    teacher's salary.24The school district or other employing unit may pay these 25employer contributions out of any source of funding available 26for that purpose and shall forward the contributions to the   HB1375- 25 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1System on the schedule established for the payment of member 2contributions.3    These employer contributions are intended to offset a 4portion of the cost to the System of the increases in 5retirement benefits resulting from Public Act 90-582.6    Each employer of teachers is entitled to a credit against 7the contributions required under this subsection (e) with 8respect to salaries paid to teachers for the period January 1, 92002 through June 30, 2003, equal to the amount paid by that 10employer under subsection (a-5) of Section 6.6 of the State 11Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971 with respect to salaries 12paid to teachers for that period.13    The additional 1% employee contribution required under 14Section 16-152 by Public Act 90-582 is the responsibility of 15the teacher and not the teacher's employer, unless the 16employer agrees, through collective bargaining or otherwise, 17to make the contribution on behalf of the teacher.18    If an employer is required by a contract in effect on May 191, 1998 between the employer and an employee organization to 20pay, on behalf of all its full-time employees covered by this 21Article, all mandatory employee contributions required under 22this Article, then the employer shall be excused from paying 23the employer contribution required under this subsection (e) 24for the balance of the term of that contract. The employer and 25the employee organization shall jointly certify to the System 26the existence of the contractual requirement, in such form as   HB1375- 26 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1the System may prescribe. This exclusion shall cease upon the 2termination, extension, or renewal of the contract at any time 3after May 1, 1998.4    (f) If the amount of a teacher's salary for any school year 5used to determine final average salary exceeds the member's 6annual full-time salary rate with the same employer for the 7previous school year by more than 6%, the teacher's employer 8shall pay to the System, in addition to all other payments 9required under this Section and in accordance with guidelines 10established by the System, the present value of the increase 11in benefits resulting from the portion of the increase in 12salary that is in excess of 6%. This present value shall be 13computed by the System on the basis of the actuarial 14assumptions and tables used in the most recent actuarial 15valuation of the System that is available at the time of the 16computation. If a teacher's salary for the 2005-2006 school 17year is used to determine final average salary under this 18subsection (f), then the changes made to this subsection (f) 19by Public Act 94-1057 shall apply in calculating whether the 20increase in his or her salary is in excess of 6%. For the 21purposes of this Section, change in employment under Section 2210-21.12 of the School Code on or after June 1, 2005 shall 23constitute a change in employer. The System may require the 24employer to provide any pertinent information or 25documentation. The changes made to this subsection (f) by 26Public Act 94-1111 apply without regard to whether the teacher   HB1375- 27 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1was in service on or after its effective date. 2    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 3required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 4amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 5The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 6amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 7may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 8System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 9specify in detail the grounds of the dispute and, if the 10employer asserts that the calculation is subject to subsection 11(g), (g-5), (g-10), (g-15), (g-20), (g-25), or (h) of this 12Section, must include an affidavit setting forth and attesting 13to all facts within the employer's knowledge that are 14pertinent to the applicability of that subsection. Upon 15receiving a timely application for recalculation, the System 16shall review the application and, if appropriate, recalculate 17the amount due. 18    The employer contributions required under this subsection 19(f) may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 20receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 21paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 22will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 23actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 24annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 25must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 26of the bill.   HB1375- 28 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    (f-1) (Blank).2    (g) This subsection (g) applies only to payments made or 3salary increases given on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 41, 2011. The changes made by Public Act 94-1057 shall not 5require the System to refund any payments received before July 631, 2006 (the effective date of Public Act 94-1057).7    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 8(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to 9teachers under contracts or collective bargaining agreements 10entered into, amended, or renewed before June 1, 2005. 11    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 12(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to a 13teacher at a time when the teacher is 10 or more years from 14retirement eligibility under Section 16-132 or 16-133.2. 15    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 16(f), the System shall exclude salary increases resulting from 17overload work, including summer school, when the school 18district has certified to the System, and the System has 19approved the certification, that (i) the overload work is for 20the sole purpose of classroom instruction in excess of the 21standard number of classes for a full-time teacher in a school 22district during a school year and (ii) the salary increases 23are equal to or less than the rate of pay for classroom 24instruction computed on the teacher's current salary and work 25schedule. 26    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection   HB1375- 29 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1(f), the System shall exclude a salary increase resulting from 2a promotion (i) for which the employee is required to hold a 3certificate or supervisory endorsement issued by the State 4Teacher Certification Board that is a different certification 5or supervisory endorsement than is required for the teacher's 6previous position and (ii) to a position that has existed and 7been filled by a member for no less than one complete academic 8year and the salary increase from the promotion is an increase 9that results in an amount no greater than the lesser of the 10average salary paid for other similar positions in the 11district requiring the same certification or the amount 12stipulated in the collective bargaining agreement for a 13similar position requiring the same certification. 14    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 15(f), the System shall exclude any payment to the teacher from 16the State of Illinois or the State Board of Education over 17which the employer does not have discretion, notwithstanding 18that the payment is included in the computation of final 19average salary. 20    (g-5) When assessing payment for any amount due under 21subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 22resulting from overload or stipend work performed in a school 23year subsequent to a school year in which the employer was 24unable to offer or allow to be conducted overload or stipend 25work due to an emergency declaration limiting such activities.26    (g-10) When assessing payment for any amount due under   HB1375- 30 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 2resulting from increased instructional time that exceeded the 3instructional time required during the 2019-2020 school year. 4    (g-15) When assessing payment for any amount due under 5subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 6resulting from teaching summer school on or after May 1, 2021 7and before September 15, 2022. 8    (g-20) When assessing payment for any amount due under 9subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 10necessary to bring a school board in compliance with Public 11Act 101-443 or this amendatory Act of the 103rd General 12Assembly. 13    (g-25) When assessing payment for any amount due under 14subsection (f), the System shall exclude any stipends paid to 15an eligible cooperating teacher under Section 9.45 of the 16Board of Higher Education Act. 17    (h) When assessing payment for any amount due under 18subsection (f), the System shall exclude any salary increase 19described in subsection (g) of this Section given on or after 20July 1, 2011 but before July 1, 2014 under a contract or 21collective bargaining agreement entered into, amended, or 22renewed on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 1, 2011. 23Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, any 24payments made or salary increases given after June 30, 2014 25shall be used in assessing payment for any amount due under 26subsection (f) of this Section.   HB1375- 31 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    (i) The System shall prepare a report and file copies of 2the report with the Governor and the General Assembly by 3January 1, 2007 that contains all of the following 4information:5        (1) The number of recalculations required by the 6    changes made to this Section by Public Act 94-1057 for 7    each employer.8        (2) The dollar amount by which each employer's 9    contribution to the System was changed due to 10    recalculations required by Public Act

State contribution 15    resulting from the changes made to this Section by Public 16    Act 94-1057. 17    (i-5) For school years beginning on or after July 1, 2017, 18if the amount of a participant's salary for any school year 19exceeds the amount of the salary set for the Governor, the 20participant's employer shall pay to the System, in addition to 21all other payments required under this Section and in 22accordance with guidelines established by the System, an 23amount determined by the System to be equal to the employer 24normal cost, as established by the System and expressed as a 25total percentage of payroll, multiplied by the amount of 26salary in excess of the amount of the salary set for the   HB1375- 32 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1Governor. This amount shall be computed by the System on the 2basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in the most 3recent actuarial valuation of the System that is available at 4the time of the computation. The System may require the 5employer to provide any pertinent information or 6documentation.7    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 8required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 9amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 10The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 11amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 12may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 13System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 14specify in detail the grounds of the dispute. Upon receiving a 15timely application for recalculation, the System shall review 16the application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount 17due. 18    The employer contributions required under this subsection 19may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 20receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 21paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 22will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 23actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 24annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 25must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 26of the bill.   HB1375- 33 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    (j) For purposes of determining the required State 2contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets 3shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 4which shall be calculated as follows:5    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 6assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 7that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 8assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 9gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 10year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 115-year period following that fiscal year. 12    (k) For purposes of determining the required State 13contribution to the system for a particular year, the 14actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 15return equal to the system's actuarially assumed rate of 16return. 17(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-525, eff. 8-20-21; 18102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-515, eff. 198-11-23; 103-588, eff. 6-5-24.) 20    (40 ILCS 5/16-203)21    Sec. 16-203.

"New benefit increase", 4however, does not include any benefit increase resulting from 5the changes made to Article 1 or this Article by Public Act 695-910, Public Act 100-23, Public Act 100-587, Public Act 7100-743, Public Act 100-769, Public Act 101-10, Public Act 8101-49, Public Act 102-16, or Public Act 102-871, or this 9amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly.10    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code or 11any subsequent amendment to this Code, every new benefit 12increase is subject to this Section and shall be deemed to be 13granted only in conformance with and contingent upon 14compliance with the provisions of this Section. 15    (c) The Public Act enacting a new benefit increase must 16identify and provide for payment to the System of additional 17funding at least sufficient to fund the resulting annual 18increase in cost to the System as it accrues.19    Every new benefit increase is contingent upon the General 20Assembly providing the additional funding required under this 21subsection. The Commission on Government Forecasting and 22Accountability shall analyze whether adequate additional 23funding has been provided for the new benefit increase and 24shall report its analysis to the Public Pension Division of 25the Department of Insurance. A new benefit increase created by 26a Public Act that does not include the additional funding   HB1375- 35 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1required under this subsection is null and void. If the Public 2Pension Division determines that the additional funding 3provided for a new benefit increase under this subsection is 4or has become inadequate, it may so certify to the Governor and 5the State Comptroller and, in the absence of corrective action 6by the General Assembly, the new benefit increase shall expire 7at the end of the fiscal year in which the certification is 8made. 9    (d) Every new benefit increase shall expire 5 years after 10its effective date or on such earlier date as may be specified 11in the language enacting the new benefit increase or provided 12under subsection (c). This does not prevent the General 13Assembly from extending or re-creating a new benefit increase 14by law.15    (e) Except as otherwise provided in the language creating 16the new benefit increase, a new benefit increase that expires 17under this Section continues to apply to persons who applied 18and qualified for the affected benefit while the new benefit 19increase was in effect and to the affected beneficiaries and 20alternate payees of such persons, but does not apply to any 21other person, including, without limitation, a person who 22continues in service after the expiration date and did not 23apply and qualify for the affected benefit while the new 24benefit increase was in effect.25(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 26102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-871, eff. 5-13-22; 103-154, eff.   HB1375- 36 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b16-30-23.) 2    Section 15.

Whenever 11    such service credit exceeds the maximum allowed for all 12    purposes of this Article, the first service rendered in 13    point of time shall be considered. The changes to this 14    paragraph (2) made by Public Act 86-272 shall apply not 15    only to persons who on or after its effective date (August 16    23, 1989) are in service as a teacher under the System, but 17    also to persons whose status as such a teacher terminated 18    prior to such effective date, whether or not such person 19    is an annuitant on that date.20        (3) Any periods immediately following teaching 21    service, under this System or under Article 17, (or 22    immediately following service prior to February 1, 1951 as 23    a recreation worker for the Illinois Department of Public 24    Safety) spent in active service with the military forces 25    of the United States; periods spent in educational 26    programs that prepare for return to teaching sponsored by   HB1375- 4 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    the federal government following such active military 2    service; if a teacher returns to teaching service within 3    one calendar year after discharge or after the completion 4    of the educational program, a further period, not 5    exceeding one calendar year, between time spent in 6    military service or in such educational programs and the 7    return to employment as a teacher under this System; and a 8    period of up to 2 years of active military service not 9    immediately following employment as a teacher.10        The changes to this Section and Section 16-128 11    relating to military service made by Public Act 87-794 12    shall apply not only to persons who on or after its 13    effective date are in service as a teacher under the 14    System, but also to persons whose status as a teacher 15    terminated prior to that date, whether or not the person 16    is an annuitant on that date.

A teacher whose service under this Article 4    terminated prior to the effective date of Public Act 5    86-1488 shall be eligible to purchase such optional 6    credit. If a teacher who purchases this optional credit is 7    already receiving a retirement annuity under this Article, 8    the annuity shall be recalculated as if the annuitant had 9    applied for the leave of absence credit at the time of 10    retirement. The difference between the entitled annuity 11    and the actual annuity shall be credited to the purchase 12    of the optional credit. The remainder of the purchase cost 13    of the optional credit shall be paid on or before April 1, 14    1992.15        The change in this paragraph made by Public Act 86-273 16    shall be applicable to teachers who retire after June 1, 17    1989, as well as to teachers who are in service on that 18    date.19        (6) Any days of unused and uncompensated accumulated 20    sick leave earned by a teacher.

On or before January 1 of 12each year, beginning January 1, 2013, the State Actuary shall 13issue a preliminary report concerning the proposed 14certification and identifying, if necessary, recommended 15changes in actuarial assumptions that the Board must consider 16before finalizing its certification of the required State 17contributions. On or before January 15, 2013 and each January 1815 thereafter, the Board shall certify to the Governor and the 19General Assembly the amount of the required State contribution 20for the next fiscal year.

The amount vouchered for a 14monthly payment shall total one-twelfth of the required annual 15State contribution certified under subsection (a-1). 16    (b-1.1) Beginning in State fiscal year 2025, if the 17Comptroller requests that the Board submit, during a State 18fiscal year, vouchers for multiple monthly payments for the 19advance payment of State contributions due to the System for 20that State fiscal year, then the Board shall submit those 21additional vouchers as directed by the Comptroller, 22notwithstanding subsection (b-1). Unless an act of 23appropriations provides otherwise, nothing in this Section 24authorizes the Board to submit, in a State fiscal year, 25vouchers for the payment of State contributions to the System 26in an amount that exceeds the rate of payroll that is certified   HB1375- 16 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1by the System under this Section for that State fiscal year. 2    (b-1.2) The vouchers described in subsections (b-1) and 3(b-1.1) shall be paid by the State Comptroller and Treasurer 4by warrants drawn on the funds appropriated to the System for 5that fiscal year.6    If in any month the amount remaining unexpended from all 7other appropriations to the System for the applicable fiscal 8year (including the appropriations to the System under Section 98.12 of the State Finance Act and Section 1 of the State 10Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation Act) is less than the 11amount lawfully vouchered under this subsection, the 12difference shall be paid from the Common School Fund under the 13continuing appropriation authority provided in Section 1.1 of 14the State Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation Act.15    (b-2) Allocations from the Common School Fund apportioned 16to school districts not coming under this System shall not be 17diminished or affected by the provisions of this Article.18    (b-3) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, the 19minimum contribution to the System to be made by the State for 20each fiscal year shall be an amount determined by the System to 21be sufficient to bring the total assets of the System up to 90% 22of the total actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of 23State fiscal year 2045. In making these determinations, the 24required State contribution shall be calculated each year as a 25level percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 26including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the   HB1375- 17 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1projected unit credit actuarial cost method.2    For each of State fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 3State shall make an additional contribution to the System 4equal to 2% of the total payroll of each employee who is deemed 5to have elected the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has 6made the election under subsection (c) of Section 1-161. 7    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 8increases or decreases the required State contribution and 9first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 10implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 11beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 12change first applies to the required State contribution.13    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 14increases or decreases the required State contribution and 15first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 162015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:17        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before 18    2018; and19        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 20    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 21    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 22    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 23    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 24    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 25    fiscal years in that 5-year period.26    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State   HB1375- 18 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable 2employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 3increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 4contributing at the rate required under this Section; except 5that in the following specified State fiscal years, the State 6contribution to the System shall not be less than the 7following indicated percentages of the applicable employee 8payroll, even if the indicated percentage will produce a State 9contribution in excess of the amount otherwise required under 10this subsection and subsection (a), and notwithstanding any 11contrary certification made under subsection (a-1) before May 1227, 1998 (the effective date of Public Act 90-582): 10.02% in 13FY 1999; 10.77% in FY 2000; 11.47% in FY 2001; 12.16% in FY 142002; 12.86% in FY 2003; and 13.56% in FY 2004.15    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 16total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2006 17is $534,627,700. 18    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 19total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2007 20is $738,014,500. 21    For each of State fiscal years 2008 through 2009, the 22State contribution to the System, as a percentage of the 23applicable employee payroll, shall be increased in equal 24annual increments from the required State contribution for 25State fiscal year 2007, so that by State fiscal year 2011, the 26State is contributing at the rate otherwise required under   HB1375- 19 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1this Section. 2    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 3total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2010 4is $2,089,268,000 and shall be made from the proceeds of bonds 5sold in fiscal year 2010 pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General 6Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale 7expenses determined by the System's share of total bond 8proceeds, (ii) any amounts received from the Common School 9Fund in fiscal year 2010, and (iii) any reduction in bond 10proceeds due to the issuance of discounted bonds, if 11applicable. 12    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 13total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2011 14is the amount recertified by the System on or before April 1, 152011 pursuant to subsection (a-1) of this Section and shall be 16made from the proceeds of bonds sold in fiscal year 2011 17pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, 18less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale expenses determined by 19the System's share of total bond proceeds, (ii) any amounts 20received from the Common School Fund in fiscal year 2011, and 21(iii) any reduction in bond proceeds due to the issuance of 22discounted bonds, if applicable. This amount shall include, in 23addition to the amount certified by the System, an amount 24necessary to meet employer contributions required by the State 25as an employer under paragraph (e) of this Section, which may 26also be used by the System for contributions required by   HB1375- 20 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1paragraph (a) of Section 16-127. 2    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, the minimum State 3contribution for each fiscal year shall be the amount needed 4to maintain the total assets of the System at 90% of the total 5actuarial liabilities of the System.6    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 7the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 8Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 9constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 10contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 11Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 12calculation of, the required State contributions under this 13Article in any future year until the System has reached a 14funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 15the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 16term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 17System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act.18    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 19required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 20fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 21calculated under this Section and certified under subsection 22(a-1), shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount of 23the required State contribution that would have been 24calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 25System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 26Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the   HB1375- 21 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 2fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 3purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 4the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 5the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 67.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act. In determining this 7maximum for State fiscal years 2008 through 2010, however, the 8amount referred to in item (i) shall be increased, as a 9percentage of the applicable employee payroll, in equal 10increments calculated from the sum of the required State 11contribution for State fiscal year 2007 plus the applicable 12portion of the State's total debt service payments for fiscal 13year 2007 on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 14purposes of Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, so 15that, by State fiscal year 2011, the State is contributing at 16the rate otherwise required under this Section.17    (b-4) Beginning in fiscal year 2018, each employer under 18this Article shall pay to the System a required contribution 19determined as a percentage of projected payroll and sufficient 20to produce an annual amount equal to:21        (i) for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 22    defined benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, 23    less the employee contribution, for each employee of that 24    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 25    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 26    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; for fiscal   HB1375- 22 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    year 2021 and each fiscal year thereafter, the defined 2    benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, less the 3    employee contribution, plus 2%, for each employee of that 4    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 5    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 6    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; plus7        (ii) the amount required for that fiscal year to 8    amortize any unfunded actuarial accrued liability 9    associated with the present value of liabilities 10    attributable to the employer's account under Section 11    16-158.3, determined as a level percentage of payroll over 12    a 30-year rolling amortization period.13    In determining contributions required under item (i) of 14this subsection, the System shall determine an aggregate rate 15for all employers, expressed as a percentage of projected 16payroll. 17    In determining the contributions required under item (ii) 18of this subsection, the amount shall be computed by the System 19on the basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in 20the most recent actuarial valuation of the System that is 21available at the time of the computation. 22    The contributions required under this subsection (b-4) 23shall be paid by an employer concurrently with that employer's 24payroll payment period. The State, as the actual employer of 25an employee, shall make the required contributions under this 26subsection.   HB1375- 23 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    (c) Payment of the required State contributions and of all 2pensions, retirement annuities, death benefits, refunds, and 3other benefits granted under or assumed by this System, and 4all expenses in connection with the administration and 5operation thereof, are obligations of the State.6    If members are paid from special trust or federal funds 7which are administered by the employing unit, whether school 8district or other unit, the employing unit shall pay to the 9System from such funds the full accruing retirement costs 10based upon that service, which, beginning July 1, 2017, shall 11be at a rate, expressed as a percentage of salary, equal to the 12total employer's normal cost, expressed as a percentage of 13payroll, as determined by the System. Employer contributions, 14based on salary paid to members from federal funds, may be 15forwarded by the distributing agency of the State of Illinois 16to the System prior to allocation, in an amount determined in 17accordance with guidelines established by such agency and the 18System. Any contribution for fiscal year 2015 collected as a 19result of the change made by Public Act 98-674 shall be 20considered a State contribution under subsection (b-3) of this 21Section. 22    (d) Effective July 1, 1986, any employer of a teacher as 23defined in paragraph (8) of Section 16-106 shall pay the 24employer's normal cost of benefits based upon the teacher's 25service, in addition to employee contributions, as determined 26by the System. Such employer contributions shall be forwarded   HB1375- 24 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1monthly in accordance with guidelines established by the 2System.3    However, with respect to benefits granted under Section 416-133.4 or 16-133.5 to a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) 5of Section 16-106, the employer's contribution shall be 12% 6(rather than 20%) of the member's highest annual salary rate 7for each year of creditable service granted, and the employer 8shall also pay the required employee contribution on behalf of 9the teacher. For the purposes of Sections 16-133.4 and 1016-133.5, a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) of Section 1116-106 who is serving in that capacity while on leave of 12absence from another employer under this Article shall not be 13considered an employee of the employer from which the teacher 14is on leave.15    (e) Beginning July 1, 1998, every employer of a teacher 16shall pay to the System an employer contribution computed as 17follows:18        (1) Beginning July 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999, the 19    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.3% of each 20    teacher's salary.21        (2) Beginning July 1, 1999 and thereafter, the 22    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.58% of each 23    teacher's salary.24The school district or other employing unit may pay these 25employer contributions out of any source of funding available 26for that purpose and shall forward the contributions to the   HB1375- 25 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1System on the schedule established for the payment of member 2contributions.3    These employer contributions are intended to offset a 4portion of the cost to the System of the increases in 5retirement benefits resulting from Public Act 90-582.6    Each employer of teachers is entitled to a credit against 7the contributions required under this subsection (e) with 8respect to salaries paid to teachers for the period January 1, 92002 through June 30, 2003, equal to the amount paid by that 10employer under subsection (a-5) of Section 6.6 of the State 11Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971 with respect to salaries 12paid to teachers for that period.13    The additional 1% employee contribution required under 14Section 16-152 by Public Act 90-582 is the responsibility of 15the teacher and not the teacher's employer, unless the 16employer agrees, through collective bargaining or otherwise, 17to make the contribution on behalf of the teacher.18    If an employer is required by a contract in effect on May 191, 1998 between the employer and an employee organization to 20pay, on behalf of all its full-time employees covered by this 21Article, all mandatory employee contributions required under 22this Article, then the employer shall be excused from paying 23the employer contribution required under this subsection (e) 24for the balance of the term of that contract. The employer and 25the employee organization shall jointly certify to the System 26the existence of the contractual requirement, in such form as   HB1375- 26 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1the System may prescribe. This exclusion shall cease upon the 2termination, extension, or renewal of the contract at any time 3after May 1, 1998.4    (f) If the amount of a teacher's salary for any school year 5used to determine final average salary exceeds the member's 6annual full-time salary rate with the same employer for the 7previous school year by more than 6%, the teacher's employer 8shall pay to the System, in addition to all other payments 9required under this Section and in accordance with guidelines 10established by the System, the present value of the increase 11in benefits resulting from the portion of the increase in 12salary that is in excess of 6%. This present value shall be 13computed by the System on the basis of the actuarial 14assumptions and tables used in the most recent actuarial 15valuation of the System that is available at the time of the 16computation. If a teacher's salary for the 2005-2006 school 17year is used to determine final average salary under this 18subsection (f), then the changes made to this subsection (f) 19by Public Act 94-1057 shall apply in calculating whether the 20increase in his or her salary is in excess of 6%. For the 21purposes of this Section, change in employment under Section 2210-21.12 of the School Code on or after June 1, 2005 shall 23constitute a change in employer. The System may require the 24employer to provide any pertinent information or 25documentation. The changes made to this subsection (f) by 26Public Act 94-1111 apply without regard to whether the teacher   HB1375- 27 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1was in service on or after its effective date. 2    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 3required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 4amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 5The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 6amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 7may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 8System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 9specify in detail the grounds of the dispute and, if the 10employer asserts that the calculation is subject to subsection 11(g), (g-5), (g-10), (g-15), (g-20), (g-25), or (h) of this 12Section, must include an affidavit setting forth and attesting 13to all facts within the employer's knowledge that are 14pertinent to the applicability of that subsection. Upon 15receiving a timely application for recalculation, the System 16shall review the application and, if appropriate, recalculate 17the amount due. 18    The employer contributions required under this subsection 19(f) may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 20receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 21paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 22will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 23actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 24annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 25must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 26of the bill.   HB1375- 28 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    (f-1) (Blank).2    (g) This subsection (g) applies only to payments made or 3salary increases given on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 41, 2011. The changes made by Public Act 94-1057 shall not 5require the System to refund any payments received before July 631, 2006 (the effective date of Public Act 94-1057).7    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 8(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to 9teachers under contracts or collective bargaining agreements 10entered into, amended, or renewed before June 1, 2005. 11    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 12(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to a 13teacher at a time when the teacher is 10 or more years from

This amount shall be computed by the System on the 2basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in the most 3recent actuarial valuation of the System that is available at 4the time of the computation. The System may require the 5employer to provide any pertinent information or 6documentation.7    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 8required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 9amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 10The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 11amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 12may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 13System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 14specify in detail the grounds of the dispute. Upon receiving a 15timely application for recalculation, the System shall review 16the application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount 17due. 18    The employer contributions required under this subsection 19may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 20receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 21paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 22will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 23actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 24annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 25must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 26of the bill.   HB1375- 33 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1    (j) For purposes of determining the required State 2contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets 3shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 4which shall be calculated as follows:5    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 6assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 7that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 8assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 9gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 10year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 115-year period following that fiscal year. 12    (k) For purposes of determining the required State 13contribution to the system for a particular year, the 14actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 15return equal to the system's actuarially assumed rate of 16return. 17(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-525, eff. 8-20-21; 18102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-515, eff. 198-11-23; 103-588, eff. 6-5-24.) 20    (40 ILCS 5/16-203)21    Sec. 16-203. Application and expiration of new benefit 22increases.23    (a) As used in this Section, "new benefit increase" means 24an increase in the amount of any benefit provided under this 25Article, or an expansion of the conditions of eligibility for   HB1375- 34 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1any benefit under this Article, that results from an amendment 2to this Code that takes effect after June 1, 2005 (the 3effective date of Public Act 94-4). "New benefit increase", 4however, does not include any benefit increase resulting from 5the changes made to Article 1 or this Article by Public Act 695-910, Public Act 100-23, Public Act 100-587, Public Act 7100-743, Public Act 100-769, Public Act 101-10, Public Act 8101-49, Public Act 102-16, or Public Act 102-871, or this 9amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly.10    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code or 11any subsequent amendment to this Code, every new benefit 12increase is subject to this Section and shall be deemed to be 13granted only in conformance with and contingent upon 14compliance with the provisions of this Section. 15    (c) The Public Act enacting a new benefit increase must 16identify and provide for payment to the System of additional 17funding at least sufficient to fund the resulting annual 18increase in cost to the System as it accrues.19    Every new benefit increase is contingent upon the General 20Assembly providing the additional funding required under this 21subsection. The Commission on Government Forecasting and 22Accountability shall analyze whether adequate additional 23funding has been provided for the new benefit increase and 24shall report its analysis to the Public Pension Division of 25the Department of Insurance. A new benefit increase created by 26a Public Act that does not include the additional funding   HB1375- 35 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b1required under this subsection is null and void. If the Public 2Pension Division determines that the additional funding 3provided for a new benefit increase under this subsection is 4or has become inadequate, it may so certify to the Governor and 5the State Comptroller and, in the absence of corrective action 6by the General Assembly, the new benefit increase shall expire 7at the end of the fiscal year in which the certification is 8made. 9    (d) Every new benefit increase shall expire 5 years after 10its effective date or on such earlier date as may be specified 11in the language enacting the new benefit increase or provided 12under subsection (c). This does not prevent the General 13Assembly from extending or re-creating a new benefit increase 14by law.15    (e) Except as otherwise provided in the language creating 16the new benefit increase, a new benefit increase that expires 17under this Section continues to apply to persons who applied 18and qualified for the affected benefit while the new benefit 19increase was in effect and to the affected beneficiaries and 20alternate payees of such persons, but does not apply to any 21other person, including, without limitation, a person who 22continues in service after the expiration date and did not 23apply and qualify for the affected benefit while the new 24benefit increase was in effect.25(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 26102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-871, eff. 5-13-22; 103-154, eff.   HB1375- 36 -LRB104 05627 LNS 15657 b16-30-23.) 2    Section 15.
