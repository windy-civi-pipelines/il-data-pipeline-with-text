Solventum shall be the exclusive 17provider of this software unless the Department determines 18that Solventum is unable to meet the required operational or 19contractual terms. Only under such circumstances may an 20alternative authorized provider of the software be considered. 21        (1) The Department shall establish Medicaid weighting 22    factors to be used in the reimbursement system established 23    under this subsection. Initial weighting factors shall be   HB3273- 2 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1    the weighting factors as published by the authorized 2    provider of this software 3M Health Information System, 3    associated with Version 30.0 adjusted for the Illinois 4    experience. 5        (2) The Department shall establish a 6    statewide-standardized amount to be used in the inpatient 7    reimbursement system. The Department shall publish these 8    amounts on its website no later than 10 calendar days 9    prior to their effective date. 10        (3) In addition to the statewide-standardized amount, 11    the Department shall develop adjusters to adjust the rate 12    of reimbursement for critical Medicaid providers or 13    services for trauma, transplantation services, perinatal 14    care, and Graduate Medical Education (GME). 15        (4) The Department shall develop add-on payments to 16    account for exceptionally costly inpatient stays, 17    consistent with Medicare outlier principles. Outlier fixed 18    loss thresholds may be updated to control for excessive 19    growth in outlier payments no more frequently than on an 20    annual basis, but at least once every 4 years. Upon 21    updating the fixed loss thresholds, the Department shall 22    be required to update base rates within 12 months.23        (5) The Department shall define those hospitals or 24    distinct parts of hospitals that shall be exempt from the 25    APR-DRG reimbursement system established under this 26    Section. The Department shall publish these hospitals'   HB3273- 3 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1    inpatient rates on its website no later than 10 calendar 2    days prior to their effective date. 3        (6) Beginning July 1, 2014 and ending on December 31, 4    2023, in addition to the statewide-standardized amount, 5    the Department shall develop an adjustor to adjust the 6    rate of reimbursement for safety-net hospitals defined in 7    Section 5-5e.1 of this Code excluding pediatric hospitals. 8        (7) Beginning July 1, 2014, in addition to the 9    statewide-standardized amount, the Department shall 10    develop an adjustor to adjust the rate of reimbursement 11    for Illinois freestanding inpatient psychiatric hospitals 12    that are not designated as children's hospitals by the 13    Department but are primarily treating patients under the 14    age of 21. 15        (7.5) (Blank).16        (8) Beginning July 1, 2018, in addition to the 17    statewide-standardized amount, the Department shall adjust 18    the rate of reimbursement for hospitals designated by the 19    Department of Public Health as a Perinatal Level II or II+ 20    center by applying the same adjustor that is applied to 21    Perinatal and Obstetrical care cases for Perinatal Level 22    III centers, as of December 31, 2017.23        (9) Beginning July 1, 2018, in addition to the 24    statewide-standardized amount, the Department shall apply 25    the same adjustor that is applied to trauma cases as of 26    December 31, 2017 to inpatient claims to treat patients   HB3273- 4 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1    with burns, including, but not limited to, APR-DRGs 841, 2    842, 843, and 844.3        (10) Beginning July 1, 2018, the 4    statewide-standardized amount for inpatient general acute 5    care services shall be uniformly increased so that base 6    claims projected reimbursement is increased by an amount 7    equal to the funds allocated in paragraph (1) of 8    subsection (b) of Section 5A-12.6, less the amount 9    allocated under paragraphs (8) and (9) of this subsection 10    and paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (b) multiplied by 11    40%.12        (11) Beginning July 1, 2018, the reimbursement for 13    inpatient rehabilitation services shall be increased by 14    the addition of a $96 per day add-on.15    (b) Outpatient hospital services. Effective for dates of 16service on and after the effective date of this amendatory Act 17of the 104th General Assembly July 1, 2014, reimbursement for 18outpatient services shall utilize the Enhanced Ambulatory 19Procedure Grouping (EAPG) software, version 3.7 distributed by 20Solventum previously known as 3MTM Health Information System. 21Solventum shall be the exclusive provider of this software 22unless the Department determines that Solventum is unable to 23meet the required operational or contractual terms. Only under 24such circumstances may an alternative authorized provider of 25the software be considered. 26        (1) The Department shall establish Medicaid weighting   HB3273- 5 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1    factors to be used in the reimbursement system established 2    under this subsection. The initial weighting factors shall 3    be the weighting factors as published by the authorized 4    provider 3M Health Information System, associated with 5    Version 3.7. 6        (2) The Department shall establish service specific 7    statewide-standardized amounts to be used in the 8    reimbursement system. 9            (A) The initial statewide standardized amounts, 10        with the labor portion adjusted by the Calendar Year 11        2013 Medicare Outpatient Prospective Payment System 12        wage index with reclassifications, shall be published 13        by the Department on its website no later than 10 14        calendar days prior to their effective date. 15            (B) The Department shall establish adjustments to 16        the statewide-standardized amounts for each Critical 17        Access Hospital, as designated by the Department of 18        Public Health in accordance with 42 CFR 485, Subpart 19        F. For outpatient services provided on or before June 20        30, 2018, the EAPG standardized amounts are determined 21        separately for each critical access hospital such that 22        simulated EAPG payments using outpatient base period 23        paid claim data plus payments under Section 5A-12.4 of 24        this Code net of the associated tax costs are equal to 25        the estimated costs of outpatient base period claims 26        data with a rate year cost inflation factor applied.   HB3273- 6 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1        (3) In addition to the statewide-standardized amounts, 2    the Department shall develop adjusters to adjust the rate 3    of reimbursement for critical Medicaid hospital outpatient 4    providers or services, including outpatient high volume or 5    safety-net hospitals. Beginning July 1, 2018, the 6    outpatient high volume adjustor shall be increased to 7    increase annual expenditures associated with this adjustor 8    by $79,200,000, based on the State Fiscal Year 2015 base 9    year data and this adjustor shall apply to public 10    hospitals, except for large public hospitals, as defined 11    under 89 Ill. Adm. Code 148.25(a).12        (4) Beginning July 1, 2018, in addition to the 13    statewide standardized amounts, the Department shall make 14    an add-on payment for outpatient expensive devices and 15    drugs. This add-on payment shall at least apply to claim 16    lines that: (i) are assigned with one of the following 17    EAPGs: 490, 1001 to 1020, and coded with one of the 18    following revenue codes: 0274 to 0276, 0278; or (ii) are 19    assigned with one of the following EAPGs: 430 to 441, 443, 20    444, 460 to 465, 495, 496, 1090. The add-on payment shall 21    be calculated as follows: the claim line's covered charges 22    multiplied by the hospital's total acute cost to charge 23    ratio, less the claim line's EAPG payment plus $1,000, 24    multiplied by 0.8.25        (5) Beginning July 1, 2018, the statewide-standardized 26    amounts for outpatient services shall be increased by a   HB3273- 7 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1    uniform percentage so that base claims projected 2    reimbursement is increased by an amount equal to no less 3    than the funds allocated in paragraph (1) of subsection 4    (b) of Section 5A-12.6, less the amount allocated under 5    paragraphs (8) and (9) of subsection (a) and paragraphs 6    (3) and (4) of this subsection multiplied by 46%. 7        (6) Effective for dates of service on or after July 1, 8    2018, the Department shall establish adjustments to the 9    statewide-standardized amounts for each Critical Access 10    Hospital, as designated by the Department of Public Health 11    in accordance with 42 CFR 485, Subpart F, such that each 12    Critical Access Hospital's standardized amount for 13    outpatient services shall be increased by the applicable 14    uniform percentage determined pursuant to paragraph (5) of 15    this subsection. It is the intent of the General Assembly 16    that the adjustments required under this paragraph (6) by 17    Public Act 100-1181 shall be applied retroactively to 18    claims for dates of service provided on or after July 1, 19    2018. 20        (7) Effective for dates of service on or after March 21    8, 2019 (the effective date of Public Act 100-1181), the 22    Department shall recalculate and implement an updated 23    statewide-standardized amount for outpatient services 24    provided by hospitals that are not Critical Access 25    Hospitals to reflect the applicable uniform percentage 26    determined pursuant to paragraph (5).   HB3273- 8 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1            (1) Any recalculation to the 2        statewide-standardized amounts for outpatient services 3        provided by hospitals that are not Critical Access 4        Hospitals shall be the amount necessary to achieve the 5        increase in the statewide-standardized amounts for 6        outpatient services increased by a uniform percentage, 7        so that base claims projected reimbursement is 8        increased by an amount equal to no less than the funds 9        allocated in paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of 10        Section 5A-12.6, less the amount allocated under 11        paragraphs (8) and (9) of subsection (a) and 12        paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection, for all 13        hospitals that are not Critical Access Hospitals, 14        multiplied by 46%.15            (2) It is the intent of the General Assembly that 16        the recalculations required under this paragraph (7) 17        by Public Act 100-1181 shall be applied prospectively 18        to claims for dates of service provided on or after 19        March 8, 2019 (the effective date of Public Act 20        100-1181) and that no recoupment or repayment by the 21        Department or an MCO of payments attributable to 22        recalculation under this paragraph (7), issued to the 23        hospital for dates of service on or after July 1, 2018 24        and before March 8, 2019 (the effective date of Public 25        Act 100-1181), shall be permitted. 26        (8) The Department shall ensure that all necessary   HB3273- 9 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1    adjustments to the managed care organization capitation 2    base rates necessitated by the adjustments under 3    subparagraph (6) or (7) of this subsection are completed 4    and applied retroactively in accordance with Section 5    5-30.8 of this Code within 90 days of March 8, 2019 (the 6    effective date of Public Act 100-1181). 7        (9) Within 60 days after federal approval of the 8    change made to the assessment in Section 5A-2 by Public 9    Act 101-650, the Department shall incorporate into the 10    EAPG system for outpatient services those services 11    performed by hospitals currently billed through the 12    Non-Institutional Provider billing system. 13    (b-5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, 14beginning with dates of service on and after January 1, 2023, 15any general acute care hospital with more than 500 outpatient 16psychiatric Medicaid services to persons under 19 years of age 17in any calendar year shall be paid the outpatient add-on 18payment of no less than $113. 19    (c) In consultation with the hospital community, the 20Department is authorized to replace 89 Ill. Adm. Code 152.150 21as published in 38 Ill. Reg. 4980 through 4986 within 12 months 22of June 16, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 98-651). If 23the Department does not replace these rules within 12 months 24of June 16, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 98-651), the 25rules in effect for 152.150 as published in 38 Ill. Reg. 4980 26through 4986 shall remain in effect until modified by rule by   HB3273- 10 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1the Department.

There shall be a transition period 4to the reimbursement systems authorized under this Section 5that shall begin on the effective date of these systems and 6continue until June 30, 2018, unless extended by rule by the 7Department. To help provide an orderly and predictable 8transition to the new reimbursement systems and to preserve 9and enhance access to the hospital services during this 10transition, the Department shall allocate a transitional 11hospital access pool of at least $290,000,000 annually so that 12transitional hospital access payments are made to hospitals. 13        (1) After the transition period, the Department may 14    begin incorporating the transitional hospital access pool 15    into the base rate structure; however, the transitional 16    hospital access payments in effect on June 30, 2018 shall 17    continue to be paid, if continued under Section 5A-16. 18        (2) After the transition period, if the Department 19    reduces payments from the transitional hospital access 20    pool, it shall increase base rates, develop new adjustors, 21    adjust current adjustors, develop new hospital access 22    payments based on updated information, or any combination 23    thereof by an amount equal to the decreases proposed in 24    the transitional hospital access pool payments, ensuring 25    that the entire transitional hospital access pool amount 26    shall continue to be used for hospital payments.   HB3273- 11 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1    (d-5) Hospital and health care transformation program. The 2Department shall develop a hospital and health care 3transformation program to provide financial assistance to 4hospitals in transforming their services and care models to 5better align with the needs of the communities they serve. The 6payments authorized in this Section shall be subject to 7approval by the federal government.8        (1) Phase 1. In State fiscal years 2019 through 2020, 9    the Department shall allocate funds from the transitional 10    access hospital pool to create a hospital transformation 11    pool of at least $262,906,870 annually and make hospital 12    transformation payments to hospitals. Subject to Section 13    5A-16, in State fiscal years 2019 and 2020, an Illinois 14    hospital that received either a transitional hospital 15    access payment under subsection (d) or a supplemental 16    payment under subsection (f) of this Section in State 17    fiscal year 2018, shall receive a hospital transformation 18    payment as follows:19            (A) If the hospital's Rate Year 2017 Medicaid 20        inpatient utilization rate is equal to or greater than 21        45%, the hospital transformation payment shall be 22        equal to 100% of the sum of its transitional hospital 23        access payment authorized under subsection (d) and any 24        supplemental payment authorized under subsection (f).25            (B) If the hospital's Rate Year 2017 Medicaid 26        inpatient utilization rate is equal to or greater than   HB3273- 12 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1        25% but less than 45%, the hospital transformation 2        payment shall be equal to 75% of the sum of its 3        transitional hospital access payment authorized under 4        subsection (d) and any supplemental payment authorized 5        under subsection (f).6            (C) If the hospital's Rate Year 2017 Medicaid 7        inpatient utilization rate is less than 25%, the 8        hospital transformation payment shall be equal to 50% 9        of the sum of its transitional hospital access payment 10        authorized under subsection (d) and any supplemental 11        payment authorized under subsection (f).12        (2) Phase 2. 13            (A) The funding amount from phase one shall be 14        incorporated into directed payment and pass-through 15        payment methodologies described in Section 5A-12.7.16            (B) Because there are communities in Illinois that 17        experience significant health care disparities due to 18        systemic racism, as recently emphasized by the 19        COVID-19 pandemic, aggravated by social determinants 20        of health and a lack of sufficiently allocated health 21        care healthcare resources, particularly 22        community-based services, preventive care, obstetric 23        care, chronic disease management, and specialty care, 24        the Department shall establish a health care 25        transformation program that shall be supported by the 26        transformation funding pool. It is the intention of   HB3273- 13 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1        the General Assembly that innovative partnerships 2        funded by the pool must be designed to establish or 3        improve integrated health care delivery systems that 4        will provide significant access to the Medicaid and 5        uninsured populations in their communities, as well as 6        improve health care equity. It is also the intention 7        of the General Assembly that partnerships recognize 8        and address the disparities revealed by the COVID-19 9        pandemic, as well as the need for post-COVID care. 10        During State fiscal years 2021 through 2027, the 11        hospital and health care transformation program shall 12        be supported by an annual transformation funding pool 13        of up to $150,000,000, pending federal matching funds, 14        to be allocated during the specified fiscal years for 15        the purpose of facilitating hospital and health care 16        transformation. No disbursement of moneys for 17        transformation projects from the transformation 18        funding pool described under this Section shall be 19        considered an award, a grant, or an expenditure of 20        grant funds. Funding agreements made in accordance 21        with the transformation program shall be considered 22        purchases of care under the Illinois Procurement Code, 23        and funds shall be expended by the Department in a 24        manner that maximizes federal funding to expend the 25        entire allocated amount.26            The Department shall convene, within 30 days after   HB3273- 14 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1        March 12, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 2        101-655), a workgroup that includes subject matter 3        experts on health care healthcare disparities and 4        stakeholders from distressed communities, which could 5        be a subcommittee of the Medicaid Advisory Committee, 6        to review and provide recommendations on how 7        Department policy, including health care 8        transformation, can improve health disparities and the 9        impact on communities disproportionately affected by 10        COVID-19. The workgroup shall consider and make 11        recommendations on the following issues: a community 12        safety-net designation of certain hospitals, racial 13        equity, and a regional partnership to bring additional 14        specialty services to communities. 15            (C) As provided in paragraph (9) of Section 3 of 16        the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Act, any 17        hospital participating in the transformation program 18        may be excluded from the requirements of the Illinois 19        Health Facilities Planning Act for those projects 20        related to the hospital's transformation. To be 21        eligible, the hospital must submit to the Health 22        Facilities and Services Review Board approval from the 23        Department that the project is a part of the 24        hospital's transformation.25            (D) As provided in subsection (a-20) of Section 26        32.5 of the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems   HB3273- 15 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1        Act, a hospital that received hospital transformation 2        payments under this Section may convert to a 3        freestanding emergency center. To be eligible for such 4        a conversion, the hospital must submit to the 5        Department of Public Health approval from the 6        Department that the project is a part of the 7        hospital's transformation.8            (E) Criteria for proposals. To be eligible for 9        funding under this Section, a transformation proposal 10        shall meet all of the following criteria: 11                (i) the proposal shall be designed based on 12            community needs assessment completed by either a 13            University partner or other qualified entity with 14            significant community input;15                (ii) the proposal shall be a collaboration 16            among providers across the care and community 17            spectrum, including preventative care, primary 18            care specialty care, hospital services, mental 19            health and substance abuse services, as well as 20            community-based entities that address the social 21            determinants of health;22                (iii) the proposal shall be specifically 23            designed to improve health care healthcare 24            outcomes and reduce health care healthcare 25            disparities, and improve the coordination, 26            effectiveness, and efficiency of care delivery;  HB3273- 16 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1                (iv) the proposal shall have specific 2            measurable metrics related to disparities that 3            will be tracked by the Department and made public 4            by the Department;5                (v) the proposal shall include a commitment to 6            include Business Enterprise Program certified 7            vendors or other entities controlled and managed 8            by minorities or women; and 9                (vi) the proposal shall specifically increase 10            access to primary, preventive, or specialty care. 11            (F) Entities eligible to be funded. 12                (i) Proposals for funding should come from 13            collaborations operating in one of the most 14            distressed communities in Illinois as determined 15            by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 16            Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index for 17            Illinois and areas disproportionately impacted by 18            COVID-19 or from rural areas of Illinois.19                (ii) The Department shall prioritize 20            partnerships from distressed communities, which 21            include Business Enterprise Program certified 22            vendors or other entities controlled and managed 23            by minorities or women and also include one or 24            more of the following: safety-net hospitals, 25            critical access hospitals, the campuses of 26            hospitals that have closed since January 1, 2018,   HB3273- 17 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1            or other health care healthcare providers designed 2            to address specific health care healthcare 3            disparities, including the impact of COVID-19 on 4            individuals and the community and the need for 5            post-COVID care.

To help provide an orderly and predictable 8transition to the new reimbursement systems and to preserve 9and enhance access to the hospital services during this 10transition, the Department shall allocate a transitional 11hospital access pool of at least $290,000,000 annually so that 12transitional hospital access payments are made to hospitals. 13        (1) After the transition period, the Department may 14    begin incorporating the transitional hospital access pool 15    into the base rate structure; however, the transitional 16    hospital access payments in effect on June 30, 2018 shall 17    continue to be paid, if continued under Section 5A-16. 18        (2) After the transition period, if the Department 19    reduces payments from the transitional hospital access 20    pool, it shall increase base rates, develop new adjustors, 21    adjust current adjustors, develop new hospital access 22    payments based on updated information, or any combination 23    thereof by an amount equal to the decreases proposed in 24    the transitional hospital access pool payments, ensuring 25    that the entire transitional hospital access pool amount 26    shall continue to be used for hospital payments.   HB3273- 11 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1    (d-5) Hospital and health care transformation program. The 2Department shall develop a hospital and health care 3transformation program to provide financial assistance to 4hospitals in transforming their services and care models to 5better align with the needs of the communities they serve. The 6payments authorized in this Section shall be subject to 7approval by the federal government.8        (1) Phase 1. In State fiscal years 2019 through 2020, 9    the Department shall allocate funds from the transitional 10    access hospital pool to create a hospital transformation 11    pool of at least $262,906,870 annually and make hospital 12    transformation payments to hospitals. Subject to Section 13    5A-16, in State fiscal years 2019 and 2020, an Illinois 14    hospital that received either a transitional hospital 15    access payment under subsection (d) or a supplemental 16    payment under subsection (f) of this Section in State 17    fiscal year 2018, shall receive a hospital transformation 18    payment as follows:19            (A) If the hospital's Rate Year 2017 Medicaid 20        inpatient utilization rate is equal to or greater than 21        45%, the hospital transformation payment shall be 22        equal to 100% of the sum of its transitional hospital 23        access payment authorized under subsection (d) and any 24        supplemental payment authorized under subsection (f).25            (B) If the hospital's Rate Year 2017 Medicaid 26        inpatient utilization rate is equal to or greater than   HB3273- 12 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1        25% but less than 45%, the hospital transformation 2        payment shall be equal to 75% of the sum of its 3        transitional hospital access payment authorized under 4        subsection (d) and any supplemental payment authorized 5        under subsection (f).6            (C) If the hospital's Rate Year 2017 Medicaid 7        inpatient utilization rate is less than 25%, the 8        hospital transformation payment shall be equal to 50% 9        of the sum of its transitional hospital access payment 10        authorized under subsection (d) and any supplemental 11        payment authorized under subsection (f).12        (2) Phase 2. 13            (A) The funding amount from phase one shall be 14        incorporated into directed payment and pass-through 15        payment methodologies described in Section 5A-12.7.16            (B) Because there are communities in Illinois that 17        experience significant health care disparities due to 18        systemic racism, as recently emphasized by the 19        COVID-19 pandemic, aggravated by social determinants 20        of health and a lack of sufficiently allocated health 21        care healthcare resources, particularly 22        community-based services, preventive care, obstetric 23        care, chronic disease management, and specialty care, 24        the Department shall establish a health care 25        transformation program that shall be supported by the 26        transformation funding pool. It is the intention of   HB3273- 13 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1        the General Assembly that innovative partnerships 2        funded by the pool must be designed to establish or 3        improve integrated health care delivery systems that 4        will provide significant access to the Medicaid and 5        uninsured populations in their communities, as well as 6        improve health care equity. It is also the intention 7        of the General Assembly that partnerships recognize 8        and address the disparities revealed by the COVID-19 9        pandemic, as well as the need for post-COVID care. 10        During State fiscal years 2021 through 2027, the 11        hospital and health care transformation program shall 12        be supported by an annual transformation funding pool 13        of up to $150,000,000, pending federal matching funds, 14        to be allocated during the specified fiscal years for 15        the purpose of facilitating hospital and health care 16        transformation. No disbursement of moneys for 17        transformation projects from the transformation 18        funding pool described under this Section shall be 19        considered an award, a grant, or an expenditure of 20        grant funds. Funding agreements made in accordance 21        with the transformation program shall be considered 22        purchases of care under the Illinois Procurement Code, 23        and funds shall be expended by the Department in a 24        manner that maximizes federal funding to expend the 25        entire allocated amount.26            The Department shall convene, within 30 days after   HB3273- 14 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1        March 12, 2021 (the effective date of Public Act 2        101-655), a workgroup that includes subject matter 3        experts on health care healthcare disparities and 4        stakeholders from distressed communities, which could 5        be a subcommittee of the Medicaid Advisory Committee, 6        to review and provide recommendations on how 7        Department policy, including health care 8        transformation, can improve health disparities and the 9        impact on communities disproportionately affected by 10        COVID-19. The workgroup shall consider and make 11        recommendations on the following issues: a community 12        safety-net designation of certain hospitals, racial 13        equity, and a regional partnership to bring additional 14        specialty services to communities. 15            (C) As provided in paragraph (9) of Section 3 of 16        the Illinois Health Facilities Planning Act, any 17        hospital participating in the transformation program 18        may be excluded from the requirements of the Illinois 19        Health Facilities Planning Act for those projects 20        related to the hospital's transformation. To be 21        eligible, the hospital must submit to the Health 22        Facilities and Services Review Board approval from the 23        Department that the project is a part of the 24        hospital's transformation.25            (D) As provided in subsection (a-20) of Section 26        32.5 of the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems   HB3273- 15 -LRB104 10515 KTG 20590 b1        Act, a hospital that received hospital transformation 2        payments under this Section may convert to a 3        freestanding emergency center. To be eligible for such 4        a conversion, the hospital must submit to the 5        Department of Public Health approval from the 6        Department that the project is a part of the 7        hospital's transformation.8            (E) Criteria for proposals.
