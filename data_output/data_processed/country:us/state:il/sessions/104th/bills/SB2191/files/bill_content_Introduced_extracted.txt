All remaining petitions thus 2pending against the minor respondent shall be adjudicated 3within 120 160 days from the date on which a finding relative 4to the first petition prosecuted is rendered under Section 55-620 of this Article, or, if the trial upon the first petition 6is terminated without a finding and there is no subsequent 7trial, or adjudication after waiver of trial, on the first 8petition within a reasonable time, the minor shall receive a 9trial upon all of the remaining petitions within 120 160 days 10from the date on which the trial, or finding after waiver of 11trial, on the first petition is concluded. If either such 12period of 120 160 days expires without the commencement of 13trial, or adjudication after waiver of trial, of any of the 14remaining pending petitions, the petition or petitions shall 15be dismissed and barred for want of prosecution unless the 16delay is occasioned by any of the reasons described in this 17Section.18    (3) When no such trial is held within the time required by 19subsections (1) and (2) of this Section, the court shall, upon 20motion by any party, dismiss the petition with prejudice.21    (3.5) The period in which a trial shall be held as 22prescribed by this Section is tolled by: (i) delay occasioned 23by the minor; (ii) a continuance allowed pursuant to Section 24114-4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 after the 25court's determination of the minor's incapacity for trial; 26(iii) an interlocutory appeal; (iv) an examination of fitness   SB2191- 3 -LRB104 07561 RLC 22017 b1ordered pursuant to Section 104-13 of the Code of Criminal 2Procedure of 1963; (v) a fitness hearing; or (vi) an 3adjudication of unfitness for trial.

On the day of expiration of the delays, the period 7shall continue at the point at which the time was suspended.8    (4) (Blank). Without affecting the applicability of the 9tolling and multiple prosecution provisions of subsections (8) 10and (2) of this Section when a petition has been filed alleging 11that the minor is a delinquent and the minor is in detention or 12shelter care, the trial shall be held within 30 calendar days 13after the date of the order directing detention or shelter 14care, or the earliest possible date in compliance with the 15provisions of Section 5-525 as to the custodial parent, 16guardian, or legal custodian, but no later than 45 calendar 17days from the date of the order of the court directing 18detention or shelter care.

Further, demanding trial under subsections 14(1) or (2) does not relieve the State of its ongoing duty to 15tender discovery.16    (5) (Blank). If the court determines that the State, 17without success, has exercised due diligence to obtain the 18results of DNA testing that is material to the case, and that 19there are reasonable grounds to believe that the results may 20be obtained at a later date, the court may continue the cause 21on application of the State for not more than 120 additional 22days.

The period in which a trial shall be held as 15prescribed by subsection (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7) 16of this Section is tolled by: (i) delay occasioned by the 17minor; (ii) a continuance allowed pursuant to Section 114-4 of 18the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 after the court's 19determination of the minor's incapacity for trial; (iii) an 20interlocutory appeal; (iv) an examination of fitness ordered 21pursuant to Section 104-13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 22of 1963; (v) a fitness hearing; or (vi) an adjudication of 23unfitness for trial. Any such delay shall temporarily suspend, 24for the time of the delay, the period within which a trial must 25be held as prescribed by subsections (1), (2), (4), (5), and 26(6) of this Section.

A pending extended juvenile jurisdiction petition shall 22not be a basis for detention past the prescribed time periods 23in this Section.24    (6) When the State's Attorney files a motion for waiver of 25jurisdiction pursuant to Section 5-805, and the minor is in 26detention, the period the minor may be held in detention may be   SB2191- 8 -LRB104 07561 RLC 22017 b1extended an additional 30 days. A pending transfer petition 2shall not be a basis for detention past the prescribed time 3periods in this Section.4    (7) The period in which a trial shall be held as prescribed 5by this Section is tolled by: (i) delay occasioned by the 6minor; (ii) a continuance allowed pursuant to Section 114-4 of 7the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 after the court's 8determination of the minor's incapacity for trial; (iii) an 9interlocutory appeal; (iv) an examination of fitness ordered 10pursuant to Section 104-13 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 11of 1963; (v) a fitness hearing; or (vi) an adjudication of 12unfitness for trial.
