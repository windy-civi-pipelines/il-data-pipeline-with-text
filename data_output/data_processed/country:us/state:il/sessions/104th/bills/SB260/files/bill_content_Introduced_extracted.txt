The projected sales 21    volume may be calculated using the historical method or 22    the underwriting method. The provider shall provide notice 23    to the Secretary on which method the provider intends to 24    use across all instances of sales-based financing offered 25    in calculating the estimated annual percentage rate under   SB0260- 20 -LRB104 06474 BAB 16510 b1    this Section, according to the following:2            (A) A provider using the historical method shall 3        use an average historical volume of sales or revenue 4        by which the financing's payment amounts are based and 5        the estimated annual percentage rate is calculated. 6        The provider shall fix the historical time period used 7        to calculate the average historical volume and use the 8        period for all disclosure purposes for all sales-based 9        financing products offered. The fixed historical time 10        period shall either be the preceding time period from 11        the specific offer or, alternatively, the provider may 12        use average sales for the same number of months with 13        the highest sales volume within the previous 12 14        months. The fixed historical time period shall be no 15        less than one month and shall not exceed 12 months.16            (B) A provider using the underwriting method shall 17        determine the estimated annual percentage rate, the 18        estimated term, and the projected payments, using a 19        projected sales volume that the provider elects for 20        each disclosure, if they participate in a review 21        process prescribed by the Secretary. A provider shall, 22        on an annual basis, report data to the Secretary of 23        estimated annual percentage rates disclosed to the 24        recipient and actual retrospective annual percentage 25        rates of completed transactions.

The projected sales 21    volume may be calculated using the historical method or 22    the underwriting method. The provider shall provide notice 23    to the Secretary on which method the provider intends to 24    use across all instances of sales-based financing offered 25    in calculating the estimated annual percentage rate under   SB0260- 20 -LRB104 06474 BAB 16510 b1    this Section, according to the following:2            (A) A provider using the historical method shall 3        use an average historical volume of sales or revenue 4        by which the financing's payment amounts are based and 5        the estimated annual percentage rate is calculated. 6        The provider shall fix the historical time period used 7        to calculate the average historical volume and use the 8        period for all disclosure purposes for all sales-based 9        financing products offered.

The Secretary 6        shall establish the method of reporting and may, upon 7        a finding that the use of projected sales volume by the 8        provider has resulted in an unacceptable deviation 9        between estimated and actual annual percentage rate, 10        require the provider to use the historical method.
