Full Text of SB2500 ILGA.GOV SB2500 - 104th General Assembly SB2500 EnrolledLRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    AN ACT concerning local government. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Community Emergency Services and Support 5Act is amended by changing Sections 5, 15, 25, 30, 40, and 65 6as follows: 7    (50 ILCS 754/5)8    Sec. 5. Findings. The General Assembly recognizes that the 9Illinois Department of Human Services Division of Mental 10Health is preparing to provide mobile mental and behavioral 11health services to all Illinoisans as part of the federally 12mandated adoption of the 9-8-8 phone number. The General 13Assembly also recognizes that many cities and some states have 14successfully established mobile emergency mental and 15behavioral health services as part of their emergency response 16system to support people who need such support and do not 17present a threat of physical violence to the mobile mental 18health relief providers. In light of that experience, the 19General Assembly finds that in order to promote and protect 20the health, safety, and welfare of the public, it is necessary 21and in the public interest to provide emergency response, with 22or without medical transportation, to individuals requiring 23mental health or behavioral health services in a manner that   SB2500 Enrolled- 2 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1is substantially equivalent to the response already provided 2to individuals who require emergency physical health care. 3    The General Assembly also recognizes the history of 4vulnerable populations being subject to unwarranted 5involuntary commitment or other human rights violations 6instead of receiving necessary care during acute crises which 7may contribute to an understandable apprehension of behavioral 8health services among individuals who have historically been 9subject to these practices. The General Assembly intends for 10the Mobile Mental Health Relief Providers regulated by this 11Act to assist with crises that do not rise to the level of 12involuntary commitment. However, the General Assembly also 13recognizes that Mobile Mental Health Relief Providers may, 14during the course of assisting with a crisis, encounter 15individuals who present an imminent threat of injury to 16themselves or others unless they receive assistance through 17the involuntary commitment process. This Act intends to 18balance concerns about misuse of the involuntary commitment 19process with the need for emergency care for individuals whose 20crisis presents an imminent threat of injury. 21(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23.) 22    (50 ILCS 754/15)23    Sec. 15. Definitions. As used in this Act:24    "Chemical restraint" means any drug used for discipline or 25convenience and not required to treat medical symptoms.  SB2500 Enrolled- 3 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    "Community services" and "community-based mental or 2behavioral health services" include both public and private 3settings. 4    "Division of Mental Health" means the Division of Mental 5Health of the Department of Human Services.6    "Emergency" means an emergent circumstance caused by a 7health condition, regardless of whether it is perceived as 8physical, mental, or behavioral in nature, for which an 9individual may require prompt care, support, or assessment at 10the individual's location. 11    "Mental or behavioral health" means any health condition 12involving changes in thinking, emotion, or behavior, and that 13the medical community treats as distinct from physical health 14care.15    "Mobile mental health relief provider" means a person 16engaging with a member of the public to provide the mobile 17mental and behavioral service established in conjunction with 18the Division of Mental Health establishing the 9-8-8 emergency 19number. "Mobile mental health relief provider" does not 20include a Paramedic (EMT-P) or EMT, as those terms are defined 21in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems Act, unless 22that responding agency has agreed to provide a specialized 23response in accordance with the Division of Mental Health's 24services offered through its 9-8-8 number and has met all the 25requirements to offer that service through that system. 26    "Physical health" means a health condition that the   SB2500 Enrolled- 4 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1medical community treats as distinct from mental or behavioral 2health care.3    "Physical restraint" means any manual method or physical 4or mechanical device, material, or equipment attached or 5adjacent to an individual's body that the individual cannot 6easily remove and restricts freedom of movement or normal 7access to one's body.

State goals.   SB2500 Enrolled- 5 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    (a) 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency services dispatched through 29-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental and behavioral health 3service established by the Division of Mental Health must 4coordinate their services so that the State goals listed in 5this Section are achieved. Appropriate mobile response service 6for mental and behavioral health emergencies shall be 7available regardless of whether the initial contact was with 89-8-8, 9-1-1 or directly with an emergency service dispatched 9through 9-1-1. Appropriate mobile response services must:10        (1) whenever possible, ensure that individuals 11    experiencing mental or behavioral health crises are 12    diverted from hospitalization or incarceration and are 13    instead linked with available appropriate community 14    services; 15        (2) include the option of on-site care if that type of 16    care is appropriate and does not override the care 17    decisions of the individual receiving care. Providing care 18    in the community, through methods like mobile crisis 19    units, is encouraged. If effective care is provided on 20    site, and if it is consistent with the care decisions of 21    the individual receiving the care, further transportation 22    to other medical providers is not required by this Act;23        (3) recommend appropriate referrals for available 24    community services if the individual receiving on-site 25    care is not already in a treatment relationship with a 26    service provider or is unsatisfied with their current   SB2500 Enrolled- 6 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    service providers. The referrals shall take into 2    consideration waiting lists and copayments, which may 3    present barriers to access; and 4        (4) subject to the care decisions of the individual 5    receiving care, coordinate provide transportation for any 6    individual experiencing a mental or behavioral health 7    emergency to the most integrated and least restrictive 8    setting feasible. A mobile crisis response team may 9    provide transportation if the mobile crisis response team 10    is appropriately equipped and staffed to do so. 11    Transportation shall be to the most integrated and least 12    restrictive setting appropriate in the community, such as 13    to the individual's home or chosen location, community 14    crisis respite centers, clinic settings, behavioral health 15    centers, or the offices of particular medical care 16    providers with existing treatment relationships to the 17    individual seeking care.18    (b) Prioritize requests for emergency assistance. 9-1-1 19PSAPs, emergency services dispatched through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and 20the mobile mental and behavioral health service established by 21the Division of Mental Health must provide guidance for 22prioritizing calls for assistance and maximum response time in 23relation to the type of emergency reported.24    (c) Provide appropriate response times. From the time of 25first notification, 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency services dispatched 26through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental and behavioral   SB2500 Enrolled- 7 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1health service established by the Division of Mental Health 2must provide the response within response time appropriate to 3the care requirements of the individual with an emergency.4    (d) Require appropriate mobile mental health relief 5provider training. Mobile mental health relief providers must 6have adequate training to address the needs of individuals 7experiencing a mental or behavioral health emergency. Adequate 8training at least includes:9        (1) training in de-escalation techniques;10        (2) knowledge of local community services and 11    supports; and 12        (3) training in respectful interaction with people 13    experiencing mental or behavioral health crises, including 14    the concepts of stigma and respectful language; .15        (4) training in recognizing and working with people 16    with neurodivergent and developmental disability diagnoses 17    and in the techniques available to help stabilize and 18    connect them to further services; and19        (5) training in the involuntary commitment process, in 20    identification of situations that meet the standards for 21    involuntary commitment, and in cultural competencies and 22    social biases to guard against any group being 23    disproportionately subjected to the involuntary commitment 24    process or the use of the process not warranted under the 25    legal standard for involuntary commitment. 26    (e) Require minimum team staffing. The Division of Mental   SB2500 Enrolled- 8 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1Health, in consultation with the Regional Advisory Committees 2created in Section 40, shall determine the appropriate 3credentials for the mental health providers responding to 4calls, including to what extent the mobile mental health 5relief providers must have certain credentials and licensing, 6and to what extent the mobile mental health relief providers 7can be peer support professionals.8    (f) Require training from individuals with lived 9experience. Training shall be provided by individuals with 10lived experience to the extent available.11    (g) Adopt guidelines directing referral to restrictive 12care settings. Mobile mental health relief providers must have 13guidelines to follow when considering whether to refer an 14individual to more restrictive forms of care, like emergency 15room or hospital settings.16    (h) Specify regional best practices. Mobile mental health 17relief providers providing these services must do so 18consistently with best practices, which include respecting the 19care choices of the individuals receiving assistance. Regional 20best practices may be broken down into sub-regions, as 21appropriate to reflect local resources and conditions. With 22the agreement of the impacted EMS Regions, providers of 23emergency response to physical emergencies may participate in 24another EMS Region for mental and behavioral response, if that 25participation shall provide a better service to individuals 26experiencing a mental or behavioral health emergency.   SB2500 Enrolled- 9 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    (i) Adopt system for directing care in advance of an 2emergency. The Division of Mental Health shall select and 3publicly identify a system that allows individuals who 4voluntarily chose to do so to provide confidential advanced 5care directions to individuals providing services under this 6Act. No system for providing advanced care direction may be 7implemented unless the Division of Mental Health approves it 8as confidential, available to individuals at all economic 9levels, and non-stigmatizing. The Division of Mental Health 10may defer this requirement for providing a system for advanced 11care direction if it determines that no existing systems can 12currently meet these requirements. 13    (j) Train dispatching staff. The personnel staffing 9-1-1, 143-1-1, or other emergency response intake systems must be 15provided with adequate training to assess whether coordinating 16with 9-8-8 is appropriate.17    (k) Establish protocol for emergency responder 18coordination. The Division of Mental Health shall establish a 19protocol for mobile mental health relief providers, law 20enforcement, and fire and ambulance services to request 21assistance from each other, and train these groups on the 22protocol.23    (l) Integrate law enforcement. The Division of Mental 24Health shall provide for law enforcement to request mobile 25mental health relief provider assistance whenever law 26enforcement engages an individual appropriate for services   SB2500 Enrolled- 10 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1under this Act. If law enforcement would typically request EMS 2assistance when it encounters an individual with a physical 3health emergency, law enforcement shall similarly dispatch 4mental or behavioral health personnel or medical 5transportation when it encounters an individual in a mental or 6behavioral health emergency.7(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23.) 8    (50 ILCS 754/30)9    Sec. 30. State prohibitions. 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency 10services dispatched through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental 11and behavioral health service established by the Division of 12Mental Health must coordinate their services so that, based on 13the information provided to them, the following State 14prohibitions are avoided: 15    (a) Law enforcement responsibility for providing mental 16and behavioral health care. In any area where mobile mental 17health relief providers are available for dispatch, law 18enforcement shall not be dispatched to respond to an 19individual requiring mental or behavioral health care unless 20that individual is (i) involved in a suspected violation of 21the criminal laws of this State, or (ii) presents a threat of 22physical injury to self or others. Mobile mental health relief 23providers are not considered available for dispatch under this 24Section if 9-8-8 reports that it cannot dispatch appropriate 25service within the maximum response times established by each   SB2500 Enrolled- 11 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1Regional Advisory Committee under Section 45.2        (1) Standing on its own or in combination with each 3    other, the fact that an individual is experiencing a 4    mental or behavioral health emergency, or has a mental 5    health, behavioral health, or other diagnosis, is not 6    sufficient to justify an assessment that the individual is 7    a threat of physical injury to self or others, or requires 8    a law enforcement response to a request for emergency 9    response or medical transportation.10        (2) If, based on its assessment of the threat to 11    public safety, law enforcement would not accompany medical 12    transportation responding to a physical health emergency, 13    unless requested by mobile mental health relief providers, 14    law enforcement may not accompany emergency response or 15    medical transportation personnel responding to a mental or 16    behavioral health emergency that presents an equivalent 17    level of threat to self or public safety. 18        (3) Without regard to an assessment of threat to self 19    or threat to public safety, law enforcement may station 20    personnel so that they can rapidly respond to requests for 21    assistance from mobile mental health relief providers if 22    law enforcement does not interfere with the provision of 23    emergency response or transportation services. To the 24    extent practical, not interfering with services includes 25    remaining sufficiently distant from or out of sight of the 26    individual receiving care so that law enforcement presence   SB2500 Enrolled- 12 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    is unlikely to escalate the emergency.2    (b) Mobile mental health relief provider involvement in 3involuntary commitment. Mobile mental health relief providers 4may participate in the involuntary commitment process only to 5the extent permitted under the Mental Health and Developmental 6Disabilities Code. The Division of Behavioral Health shall, in 7consultation with each Regional Advisory Committee, as 8appropriate, monitor the use of involuntary commitment under 9this Act and provide systemic recommendations to improve 10outcomes for those subject to commitment. In order to maintain 11the appropriate care relationship, mobile mental health relief 12providers shall not in any way assist in the involuntary 13commitment of an individual beyond (i) reporting to their 14dispatching entity or to law enforcement that they believe the 15situation requires assistance the mobile mental health relief 16providers are not permitted to provide under this Section; 17(ii) providing witness statements; and (iii) fulfilling 18reporting requirements the mobile mental health relief 19providers may have under their professional ethical 20obligations or laws of this State. This prohibition shall not 21interfere with any mobile mental health relief provider's 22ability to provide physical or mental health care.23    (c) Use of law enforcement for transportation. In any area 24where mobile mental health relief providers are available for 25dispatch, unless requested by mobile mental health relief 26providers, law enforcement shall not be used to provide   SB2500 Enrolled- 13 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1transportation to access mental or behavioral health care, or 2travel between mental or behavioral health care providers, 3except where (i) no alternative is available; (ii) the 4individual requests transportation from law enforcement and 5law enforcement mutually agrees to provide transportation; or 6(iii) the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code 7requires or permits law enforcement to provide transportation.8    (d) Reduction of educational institution obligations. The 9services coordinated under this Act may not be used to replace 10any service an educational institution is required to provide 11to a student. It shall not substitute for appropriate special 12education and related services that schools are required to 13provide by any law.14    (e) This Section is operative beginning on the date the 3 15conditions in Section 65 are met or July 1, 2025, whichever is 16earlier.17(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23; 18103-645, eff. 7-1-24.) 19    (50 ILCS 754/40)20    Sec. 40. Statewide Advisory Committee. 21    (a) The Division of Mental Health shall establish a 22Statewide Advisory Committee to review and make 23recommendations for aspects of coordinating 9-1-1 and the 249-8-8 mobile mental health response system most appropriately 25addressed on a State level.  SB2500 Enrolled- 14 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    (b) Issues to be addressed by the Statewide Advisory 2Committee include, but are not limited to, addressing changes 3necessary in 9-1-1 call taking protocols and scripts used in 49-1-1 PSAPs where those protocols and scripts are based on or 5otherwise dependent on national providers for their operation. 6    (c) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall recommend a 7system for gathering data related to the coordination of the 89-1-1 and 9-8-8 systems for purposes of allowing the parties 9to make ongoing improvements in that system. As practical, the 10system shall attempt to determine issues, which may include, 11but are not limited to including, but not limited to:12        (1) the volume of calls coordinated between 9-1-1 and 13    9-8-8;14        (2) the volume of referrals from other first 15    responders to 9-8-8;16        (3) the volume and type of calls deemed appropriate 17    for referral to 9-8-8 but could not be served by 9-8-8 18    because of capacity restrictions or other reasons;19        (4) the appropriate information to improve 20    coordination between 9-1-1 and 9-8-8; and21        (5) the appropriate information to improve the 9-8-8 22    system, if the information is most appropriately gathered 23    at the 9-1-1 PSAPs; and .24        (6) the number of instances of mobile mental health 25    relief providers initiating petitions for involuntary 26    commitment, broken down by county and contracting entity   SB2500 Enrolled- 15 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    employing the petitioning mobile mental health relief 2    providers and the aggregate demographic data of the 3    individuals subject to those petitions. 4    (d) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall consist of:5        (1) the Statewide 9-1-1 Administrator, ex officio;6        (2) one representative designated by the Illinois 7    Chapter of National Emergency Number Association (NENA);8        (3) one representative designated by the Illinois 9    Chapter of Association of Public Safety Communications 10    Officials (APCO);11        (4) one representative of the Division of Mental 12    Health;13        (5) one representative of the Illinois Department of 14    Public Health;15        (6) one representative of a statewide organization of 16    EMS responders;17        (7) one representative of a statewide organization of 18    fire chiefs;19        (8) two representatives of statewide organizations of 20    law enforcement; 21        (9) two representatives of mental health, behavioral 22    health, or substance abuse providers; and23        (10) four representatives of advocacy organizations 24    either led by or consisting primarily of individuals with 25    intellectual or developmental disabilities, individuals 26    with behavioral disabilities, or individuals with lived   SB2500 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    experience.2    (e) The members of the Statewide Advisory Committee, other 3than the Statewide 9-1-1 Administrator, shall be appointed by 4the Secretary of Human Services.5    (f) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall continue to 6meet until this Act has been fully implemented, as determined 7by the Division of Mental Health, and mobile mental health 8relief providers are available in all parts of Illinois. The 9Division of Mental Health may reconvene the Statewide Advisory 10Committee at its discretion after full implementation of this 11Act. 12(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23.) 13    (50 ILCS 754/65)14    Sec. 65. PSAP and emergency service dispatched through a 159-1-1 PSAP; coordination of activities with mobile and 16behavioral health services. 17    (a) Each 9-1-1 PSAP and emergency service dispatched 18through a 9-1-1 PSAP must begin coordinating its activities 19with the mobile mental and behavioral health services 20established by the Division of Mental Health once all 3 of the 21following conditions are met, but not later than July 1, 2027 222025: 23        (1) the Statewide Committee has negotiated useful 24    protocol and 9-1-1 operator script adjustments with the 25    contracted services providing these tools to 9-1-1 PSAPs   SB2500 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    operating in Illinois;2        (2) the appropriate Regional Advisory Committee has 3    completed design of the specific 9-1-1 PSAP's process for 4    coordinating activities with the mobile mental and 5    behavioral health service; and 6        (3) the mobile mental and behavioral health service is 7    available in their jurisdiction.8    (b) To achieve the conditions of subsection (a) by July 1, 92027, the following activities shall be completed:10        (1) No later than June 30, 2025, pilot testing of the 11    revised protocols;12        (2) No later than June 30, 2026:13            (A) assessment and evaluation of the pilots;14            (B) revisions, as needed, of protocols and 15        operations based on assessment and evaluation of the 16        pilots;17            (C) implementation of revised protocols at pilot 18        sites; and19            (D) implementation of revised protocols by PSAPs 20        who are ready to implement, otherwise known as early 21        adopters; and22        (3) No later than June 30, 2027, implementation of 23    revised protocols by all remaining PSAPs, including any 24    PSAPs that previously cited financial barriers to updating 25    systems.26(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 102-1109, eff. 12-21-22;   SB2500 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1103-105, eff. 6-27-23; 103-645, eff. 7-1-24.) 2    Section 99.

State goals.   SB2500 Enrolled- 5 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    (a) 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency services dispatched through 29-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental and behavioral health 3service established by the Division of Mental Health must 4coordinate their services so that the State goals listed in 5this Section are achieved. Appropriate mobile response service 6for mental and behavioral health emergencies shall be 7available regardless of whether the initial contact was with 89-8-8, 9-1-1 or directly with an emergency service dispatched 9through 9-1-1. Appropriate mobile response services must:10        (1) whenever possible, ensure that individuals 11    experiencing mental or behavioral health crises are 12    diverted from hospitalization or incarceration and are 13    instead linked with available appropriate community 14    services; 15        (2) include the option of on-site care if that type of 16    care is appropriate and does not override the care 17    decisions of the individual receiving care. Providing care 18    in the community, through methods like mobile crisis 19    units, is encouraged. If effective care is provided on 20    site, and if it is consistent with the care decisions of 21    the individual receiving the care, further transportation 22    to other medical providers is not required by this Act;23        (3) recommend appropriate referrals for available 24    community services if the individual receiving on-site 25    care is not already in a treatment relationship with a 26    service provider or is unsatisfied with their current   SB2500 Enrolled- 6 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    service providers. The referrals shall take into 2    consideration waiting lists and copayments, which may 3    present barriers to access; and 4        (4) subject to the care decisions of the individual 5    receiving care, coordinate provide transportation for any 6    individual experiencing a mental or behavioral health 7    emergency to the most integrated and least restrictive 8    setting feasible. A mobile crisis response team may 9    provide transportation if the mobile crisis response team 10    is appropriately equipped and staffed to do so. 11    Transportation shall be to the most integrated and least 12    restrictive setting appropriate in the community, such as 13    to the individual's home or chosen location, community 14    crisis respite centers, clinic settings, behavioral health 15    centers, or the offices of particular medical care 16    providers with existing treatment relationships to the 17    individual seeking care.18    (b) Prioritize requests for emergency assistance. 9-1-1 19PSAPs, emergency services dispatched through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and 20the mobile mental and behavioral health service established by 21the Division of Mental Health must provide guidance for 22prioritizing calls for assistance and maximum response time in 23relation to the type of emergency reported.24    (c) Provide appropriate response times. From the time of 25first notification, 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency services dispatched 26through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental and behavioral   SB2500 Enrolled- 7 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1health service established by the Division of Mental Health 2must provide the response within response time appropriate to 3the care requirements of the individual with an emergency.4    (d) Require appropriate mobile mental health relief 5provider training. Mobile mental health relief providers must 6have adequate training to address the needs of individuals 7experiencing a mental or behavioral health emergency. Adequate 8training at least includes:9        (1) training in de-escalation techniques;10        (2) knowledge of local community services and 11    supports; and 12        (3) training in respectful interaction with people 13    experiencing mental or behavioral health crises, including 14    the concepts of stigma and respectful language; .15        (4) training in recognizing and working with people 16    with neurodivergent and developmental disability diagnoses 17    and in the techniques available to help stabilize and 18    connect them to further services; and19        (5) training in the involuntary commitment process, in 20    identification of situations that meet the standards for 21    involuntary commitment, and in cultural competencies and 22    social biases to guard against any group being 23    disproportionately subjected to the involuntary commitment 24    process or the use of the process not warranted under the 25    legal standard for involuntary commitment. 26    (e) Require minimum team staffing. The Division of Mental   SB2500 Enrolled- 8 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1Health, in consultation with the Regional Advisory Committees 2created in Section 40, shall determine the appropriate 3credentials for the mental health providers responding to 4calls, including to what extent the mobile mental health 5relief providers must have certain credentials and licensing, 6and to what extent the mobile mental health relief providers 7can be peer support professionals.8    (f) Require training from individuals with lived 9experience. Training shall be provided by individuals with 10lived experience to the extent available.11    (g) Adopt guidelines directing referral to restrictive 12care settings. Mobile mental health relief providers must have 13guidelines to follow when considering whether to refer an 14individual to more restrictive forms of care, like emergency 15room or hospital settings.16    (h) Specify regional best practices. Mobile mental health 17relief providers providing these services must do so 18consistently with best practices, which include respecting the 19care choices of the individuals receiving assistance. Regional 20best practices may be broken down into sub-regions, as 21appropriate to reflect local resources and conditions. With 22the agreement of the impacted EMS Regions, providers of 23emergency response to physical emergencies may participate in 24another EMS Region for mental and behavioral response, if that 25participation shall provide a better service to individuals 26experiencing a mental or behavioral health emergency.   SB2500 Enrolled- 9 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    (i) Adopt system for directing care in advance of an 2emergency. The Division of Mental Health shall select and 3publicly identify a system that allows individuals who 4voluntarily chose to do so to provide confidential advanced 5care directions to individuals providing services under this 6Act. No system for providing advanced care direction may be 7implemented unless the Division of Mental Health approves it 8as confidential, available to individuals at all economic 9levels, and non-stigmatizing. The Division of Mental Health 10may defer this requirement for providing a system for advanced 11care direction if it determines that no existing systems can 12currently meet these requirements. 13    (j) Train dispatching staff. The personnel staffing 9-1-1, 143-1-1, or other emergency response intake systems must be 15provided with adequate training to assess whether coordinating 16with 9-8-8 is appropriate.17    (k) Establish protocol for emergency responder 18coordination. The Division of Mental Health shall establish a 19protocol for mobile mental health relief providers, law 20enforcement, and fire and ambulance services to request 21assistance from each other, and train these groups on the 22protocol.23    (l) Integrate law enforcement. The Division of Mental 24Health shall provide for law enforcement to request mobile 25mental health relief provider assistance whenever law 26enforcement engages an individual appropriate for services   SB2500 Enrolled- 10 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1under this Act. If law enforcement would typically request EMS 2assistance when it encounters an individual with a physical 3health emergency, law enforcement shall similarly dispatch 4mental or behavioral health personnel or medical 5transportation when it encounters an individual in a mental or 6behavioral health emergency.7(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23.) 8    (50 ILCS 754/30)9    Sec. 30. State prohibitions. 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency 10services dispatched through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental 11and behavioral health service established by the Division of 12Mental Health must coordinate their services so that, based on 13the information provided to them, the following State 14prohibitions are avoided: 15    (a) Law enforcement responsibility for providing mental 16and behavioral health care. In any area where mobile mental 17health relief providers are available for dispatch, law 18enforcement shall not be dispatched to respond to an 19individual requiring mental or behavioral health care unless 20that individual is (i) involved in a suspected violation of 21the criminal laws of this State, or (ii) presents a threat of 22physical injury to self or others. Mobile mental health relief 23providers are not considered available for dispatch under this 24Section if 9-8-8 reports that it cannot dispatch appropriate 25service within the maximum response times established by each   SB2500 Enrolled- 11 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1Regional Advisory Committee under Section 45.2        (1) Standing on its own or in combination with each 3    other, the fact that an individual is experiencing a 4    mental or behavioral health emergency, or has a mental 5    health, behavioral health, or other diagnosis, is not 6    sufficient to justify an assessment that the individual is 7    a threat of physical injury to self or others, or requires 8    a law enforcement response to a request for emergency 9    response or medical transportation.10        (2) If, based on its assessment of the threat to 11    public safety, law enforcement would not accompany medical 12    transportation responding to a physical health emergency, 13    unless requested by mobile mental health relief providers, 14    law enforcement may not accompany emergency response or 15    medical transportation personnel responding to a mental or 16    behavioral health emergency that presents an equivalent 17    level of threat to self or public safety. 18        (3) Without regard to an assessment of threat to self 19    or threat to public safety, law enforcement may station 20    personnel so that they can rapidly respond to requests for 21    assistance from mobile mental health relief providers if 22    law enforcement does not interfere with the provision of 23    emergency response or transportation services. To the 24    extent practical, not interfering with services includes 25    remaining sufficiently distant from or out of sight of the 26    individual receiving care so that law enforcement presence   SB2500 Enrolled- 12 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    is unlikely to escalate the emergency.2    (b) Mobile mental health relief provider involvement in 3involuntary commitment. Mobile mental health relief providers 4may participate in the involuntary commitment process only to 5the extent permitted under the Mental Health and Developmental 6Disabilities Code. The Division of Behavioral Health shall, in 7consultation with each Regional Advisory Committee, as 8appropriate, monitor the use of involuntary commitment under 9this Act and provide systemic recommendations to improve 10outcomes for those subject to commitment. In order to maintain 11the appropriate care relationship, mobile mental health relief 12providers shall not in any way assist in the involuntary 13commitment of an individual beyond (i) reporting to their 14dispatching entity or to law enforcement that they believe the 15situation requires assistance the mobile mental health relief 16providers are not permitted to provide under this Section; 17(ii) providing witness statements; and (iii) fulfilling 18reporting requirements the mobile mental health relief 19providers may have under their professional ethical 20obligations or laws of this State. This prohibition shall not 21interfere with any mobile mental health relief provider's 22ability to provide physical or mental health care.23    (c) Use of law enforcement for transportation. In any area 24where mobile mental health relief providers are available for 25dispatch, unless requested by mobile mental health relief 26providers, law enforcement shall not be used to provide   SB2500 Enrolled- 13 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1transportation to access mental or behavioral health care, or 2travel between mental or behavioral health care providers, 3except where (i) no alternative is available; (ii) the 4individual requests transportation from law enforcement and 5law enforcement mutually agrees to provide transportation; or 6(iii) the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code 7requires or permits law enforcement to provide transportation.8    (d) Reduction of educational institution obligations. The 9services coordinated under this Act may not be used to replace 10any service an educational institution is required to provide 11to a student. It shall not substitute for appropriate special 12education and related services that schools are required to 13provide by any law.14    (e) This Section is operative beginning on the date the 3 15conditions in Section 65 are met or July 1, 2025, whichever is 16earlier.17(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23; 18103-645, eff. 7-1-24.) 19    (50 ILCS 754/40)20    Sec. 40. Statewide Advisory Committee. 21    (a) The Division of Mental Health shall establish a 22Statewide Advisory Committee to review and make 23recommendations for aspects of coordinating 9-1-1 and the 249-8-8 mobile mental health response system most appropriately 25addressed on a State level.  SB2500 Enrolled- 14 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    (b) Issues to be addressed by the Statewide Advisory 2Committee include, but are not limited to, addressing changes 3necessary in 9-1-1 call taking protocols and scripts used in 49-1-1 PSAPs where those protocols and scripts are based on or 5otherwise dependent on national providers for their operation. 6    (c) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall recommend a 7system for gathering data related to the coordination of the 89-1-1 and 9-8-8 systems for purposes of allowing the parties 9to make ongoing improvements in that system. As practical, the 10system shall attempt to determine issues, which may include, 11but are not limited to including, but not limited to:12        (1) the volume of calls coordinated between 9-1-1 and 13    9-8-8;14        (2) the volume of referrals from other first 15    responders to 9-8-8;16        (3) the volume and type of calls deemed appropriate 17    for referral to 9-8-8 but could not be served by 9-8-8 18    because of capacity restrictions or other reasons;19        (4) the appropriate information to improve 20    coordination between 9-1-1 and 9-8-8; and21        (5) the appropriate information to improve the 9-8-8 22    system, if the information is most appropriately gathered 23    at the 9-1-1 PSAPs; and .24        (6) the number of instances of mobile mental health 25    relief providers initiating petitions for involuntary 26    commitment, broken down by county and contracting entity   SB2500 Enrolled- 15 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    employing the petitioning mobile mental health relief 2    providers and the aggregate demographic data of the 3    individuals subject to those petitions. 4    (d) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall consist of:5        (1) the Statewide 9-1-1 Administrator, ex officio;6        (2) one representative designated by the Illinois 7    Chapter of National Emergency Number Association (NENA);8        (3) one representative designated by the Illinois 9    Chapter of Association of Public Safety Communications 10    Officials (APCO);11        (4) one representative of the Division of Mental 12    Health;13        (5) one representative of the Illinois Department of 14    Public Health;15        (6) one representative of a statewide organization of 16    EMS responders;17        (7) one representative of a statewide organization of 18    fire chiefs;19        (8) two representatives of statewide organizations of 20    law enforcement; 21        (9) two representatives of mental health, behavioral 22    health, or substance abuse providers; and23        (10) four representatives of advocacy organizations 24    either led by or consisting primarily of individuals with 25    intellectual or developmental disabilities, individuals 26    with behavioral disabilities, or individuals with lived   SB2500 Enrolled- 16 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    experience.2    (e) The members of the Statewide Advisory Committee, other 3than the Statewide 9-1-1 Administrator, shall be appointed by 4the Secretary of Human Services.5    (f) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall continue to 6meet until this Act has been fully implemented, as determined 7by the Division of Mental Health, and mobile mental health 8relief providers are available in all parts of Illinois. The 9Division of Mental Health may reconvene the Statewide Advisory 10Committee at its discretion after full implementation of this 11Act. 12(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23.) 13    (50 ILCS 754/65)14    Sec. 65. PSAP and emergency service dispatched through a 159-1-1 PSAP; coordination of activities with mobile and 16behavioral health services. 17    (a) Each 9-1-1 PSAP and emergency service dispatched 18through a 9-1-1 PSAP must begin coordinating its activities 19with the mobile mental and behavioral health services 20established by the Division of Mental Health once all 3 of the 21following conditions are met, but not later than July 1, 2027 222025: 23        (1) the Statewide Committee has negotiated useful 24    protocol and 9-1-1 operator script adjustments with the 25    contracted services providing these tools to 9-1-1 PSAPs   SB2500 Enrolled- 17 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1    operating in Illinois;2        (2) the appropriate Regional Advisory Committee has 3    completed design of the specific 9-1-1 PSAP's process for 4    coordinating activities with the mobile mental and 5    behavioral health service; and 6        (3) the mobile mental and behavioral health service is 7    available in their jurisdiction.8    (b) To achieve the conditions of subsection (a) by July 1, 92027, the following activities shall be completed:10        (1) No later than June 30, 2025, pilot testing of the 11    revised protocols;12        (2) No later than June 30, 2026:13            (A) assessment and evaluation of the pilots;14            (B) revisions, as needed, of protocols and 15        operations based on assessment and evaluation of the 16        pilots;17            (C) implementation of revised protocols at pilot 18        sites; and19            (D) implementation of revised protocols by PSAPs 20        who are ready to implement, otherwise known as early 21        adopters; and22        (3) No later than June 30, 2027, implementation of 23    revised protocols by all remaining PSAPs, including any 24    PSAPs that previously cited financial barriers to updating 25    systems.26(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 102-1109, eff. 12-21-22;   SB2500 Enrolled- 18 -LRB104 12196 RTM 22301 b1103-105, eff. 6-27-23; 103-645, eff. 7-1-24.) 2    Section 99.
