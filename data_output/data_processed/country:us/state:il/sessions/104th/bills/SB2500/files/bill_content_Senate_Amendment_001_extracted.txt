Full Text of SB2500 ILGA.GOV SB2500 - 104th General Assembly Sen. Robert PetersFiled: 4/3/2025   10400SB2500sam001LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1AMENDMENT TO SENATE BILL 2500 2    AMENDMENT NO. ______. Amend Senate Bill 2500 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 5. The Community Emergency Services and Support 5Act is amended by changing Sections 5, 15, 25, 30, 40, and 65 6as follows: 7    (50 ILCS 754/5)8    Sec. 5. Findings. The General Assembly recognizes that the 9Illinois Department of Human Services Division of Mental 10Health is preparing to provide mobile mental and behavioral 11health services to all Illinoisans as part of the federally 12mandated adoption of the 9-8-8 phone number. The General 13Assembly also recognizes that many cities and some states have 14successfully established mobile emergency mental and 15behavioral health services as part of their emergency response 16system to support people who need such support and do not   10400SB2500sam001- 2 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1present a threat of physical violence to the mobile mental 2health relief providers. In light of that experience, the 3General Assembly finds that in order to promote and protect 4the health, safety, and welfare of the public, it is necessary 5and in the public interest to provide emergency response, with 6or without medical transportation, to individuals requiring 7mental health or behavioral health services in a manner that 8is substantially equivalent to the response already provided 9to individuals who require emergency physical health care. 10    The General Assembly also recognizes the history of 11vulnerable populations being subject to unwarranted 12involuntary commitment or other human rights violations 13instead of receiving necessary care during acute crises which 14may contribute to an understandable apprehension of behavioral 15health services among individuals who have historically been 16subject to these practices. The General Assembly intends for 17the Mobile Mental Health Relief Providers regulated by this 18Act to assist with crises that do not rise to the level of 19involuntary commitment. However, the General Assembly also 20recognizes that Mobile Mental Health Relief Providers may, 21during the course of assisting with a crisis, encounter 22individuals who present an imminent threat of injury to 23themselves or others unless they receive assistance through 24the involuntary commitment process. This Act intends to 25balance concerns about misuse of the involuntary commitment 26process with the need for emergency care for individuals whose   10400SB2500sam001- 3 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1crisis presents an imminent threat of injury. 2(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23.) 3    (50 ILCS 754/15)4    Sec. 15. Definitions. As used in this Act:5    "Chemical restraint" means any drug used for discipline or 6convenience and not required to treat medical symptoms.7    "Community services" and "community-based mental or 8behavioral health services" include both public and private 9settings. 10    "Division of Mental Health" means the Division of Mental 11Health of the Department of Human Services.12    "Emergency" means an emergent circumstance caused by a 13health condition, regardless of whether it is perceived as 14physical, mental, or behavioral in nature, for which an 15individual may require prompt care, support, or assessment at 16the individual's location. 17    "Mental or behavioral health" means any health condition 18involving changes in thinking, emotion, or behavior, and that 19the medical community treats as distinct from physical health 20care.21    "Mobile mental health relief provider" means a person 22engaging with a member of the public to provide the mobile 23mental and behavioral service established in conjunction with 24the Division of Mental Health establishing the 9-8-8 emergency 25number. "Mobile mental health relief provider" does not   10400SB2500sam001- 4 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1include a Paramedic (EMT-P) or EMT, as those terms are defined 2in the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems Act, unless 3that responding agency has agreed to provide a specialized 4response in accordance with the Division of Mental Health's 5services offered through its 9-8-8 number and has met all the 6requirements to offer that service through that system. 7    "Physical health" means a health condition that the 8medical community treats as distinct from mental or behavioral 9health care.10    "Physical restraint" means any manual method or physical 11or mechanical device, material, or equipment attached or 12adjacent to an individual's body that the individual cannot 13easily remove and restricts freedom of movement or normal 14access to one's body.

State goals. 7    (a) 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency services dispatched through 89-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental and behavioral health 9service established by the Division of Mental Health must 10coordinate their services so that the State goals listed in 11this Section are achieved. Appropriate mobile response service 12for mental and behavioral health emergencies shall be 13available regardless of whether the initial contact was with 149-8-8, 9-1-1 or directly with an emergency service dispatched 15through 9-1-1. Appropriate mobile response services must:16        (1) whenever possible, ensure that individuals 17    experiencing mental or behavioral health crises are 18    diverted from hospitalization or incarceration and are 19    instead linked with available appropriate community 20    services; 21        (2) include the option of on-site care if that type of 22    care is appropriate and does not override the care 23    decisions of the individual receiving care. Providing care 24    in the community, through methods like mobile crisis 25    units, is encouraged. If effective care is provided on   10400SB2500sam001- 6 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    site, and if it is consistent with the care decisions of 2    the individual receiving the care, further transportation 3    to other medical providers is not required by this Act;4        (3) recommend appropriate referrals for available 5    community services if the individual receiving on-site 6    care is not already in a treatment relationship with a 7    service provider or is unsatisfied with their current 8    service providers. The referrals shall take into 9    consideration waiting lists and copayments, which may 10    present barriers to access; and 11        (4) subject to the care decisions of the individual 12    receiving care, coordinate provide transportation for any 13    individual experiencing a mental or behavioral health 14    emergency to the most integrated and least restrictive 15    setting feasible. A mobile crisis response team may 16    provide transportation if the mobile crisis response team 17    is appropriately equipped and staffed to do so. 18    Transportation shall be to the most integrated and least 19    restrictive setting appropriate in the community, such as 20    to the individual's home or chosen location, community 21    crisis respite centers, clinic settings, behavioral health 22    centers, or the offices of particular medical care 23    providers with existing treatment relationships to the 24    individual seeking care.25    (b) Prioritize requests for emergency assistance. 9-1-1 26PSAPs, emergency services dispatched through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and   10400SB2500sam001- 7 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1the mobile mental and behavioral health service established by 2the Division of Mental Health must provide guidance for 3prioritizing calls for assistance and maximum response time in 4relation to the type of emergency reported.5    (c) Provide appropriate response times. From the time of 6first notification, 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency services dispatched 7through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental and behavioral 8health service established by the Division of Mental Health 9must provide the response within response time appropriate to 10the care requirements of the individual with an emergency.11    (d) Require appropriate mobile mental health relief 12provider training. Mobile mental health relief providers must 13have adequate training to address the needs of individuals 14experiencing a mental or behavioral health emergency. Adequate 15training at least includes:16        (1) training in de-escalation techniques;17        (2) knowledge of local community services and 18    supports; and 19        (3) training in respectful interaction with people 20    experiencing mental or behavioral health crises, including 21    the concepts of stigma and respectful language; .22        (4) training in recognizing and working with people 23    with neurodivergent and developmental disability diagnoses 24    and in the techniques available to help stabilize and 25    connect them to further services; and26        (5) training in the involuntary commitment process, in   10400SB2500sam001- 8 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    identification of situations that meet the standards for 2    involuntary commitment, and in cultural competencies and 3    social biases to guard against any group being 4    disproportionately subjected to the involuntary commitment 5    process or the use of the process not warranted under the 6    legal standard for involuntary commitment. 7    (e) Require minimum team staffing. The Division of Mental 8Health, in consultation with the Regional Advisory Committees 9created in Section 40, shall determine the appropriate 10credentials for the mental health providers responding to 11calls, including to what extent the mobile mental health 12relief providers must have certain credentials and licensing, 13and to what extent the mobile mental health relief providers 14can be peer support professionals.15    (f) Require training from individuals with lived 16experience. Training shall be provided by individuals with 17lived experience to the extent available.18    (g) Adopt guidelines directing referral to restrictive 19care settings. Mobile mental health relief providers must have 20guidelines to follow when considering whether to refer an 21individual to more restrictive forms of care, like emergency 22room or hospital settings.23    (h) Specify regional best practices. Mobile mental health 24relief providers providing these services must do so 25consistently with best practices, which include respecting the 26care choices of the individuals receiving assistance. Regional   10400SB2500sam001- 9 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1best practices may be broken down into sub-regions, as 2appropriate to reflect local resources and conditions. With 3the agreement of the impacted EMS Regions, providers of 4emergency response to physical emergencies may participate in 5another EMS Region for mental and behavioral response, if that 6participation shall provide a better service to individuals 7experiencing a mental or behavioral health emergency. 8    (i) Adopt system for directing care in advance of an 9emergency. The Division of Mental Health shall select and 10publicly identify a system that allows individuals who 11voluntarily chose to do so to provide confidential advanced 12care directions to individuals providing services under this 13Act. No system for providing advanced care direction may be 14implemented unless the Division of Mental Health approves it 15as confidential, available to individuals at all economic 16levels, and non-stigmatizing. The Division of Mental Health 17may defer this requirement for providing a system for advanced 18care direction if it determines that no existing systems can 19currently meet these requirements. 20    (j) Train dispatching staff. The personnel staffing 9-1-1, 213-1-1, or other emergency response intake systems must be 22provided with adequate training to assess whether coordinating 23with 9-8-8 is appropriate.24    (k) Establish protocol for emergency responder 25coordination. The Division of Mental Health shall establish a 26protocol for mobile mental health relief providers, law   10400SB2500sam001- 10 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1enforcement, and fire and ambulance services to request 2assistance from each other, and train these groups on the 3protocol.4    (l) Integrate law enforcement. The Division of Mental 5Health shall provide for law enforcement to request mobile 6mental health relief provider assistance whenever law 7enforcement engages an individual appropriate for services 8under this Act. If law enforcement would typically request EMS 9assistance when it encounters an individual with a physical 10health emergency, law enforcement shall similarly dispatch 11mental or behavioral health personnel or medical 12transportation when it encounters an individual in a mental or 13behavioral health emergency.14(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23.) 15    (50 ILCS 754/30)16    Sec. 30. State prohibitions. 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency 17services dispatched through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental 18and behavioral health service established by the Division of 19Mental Health must coordinate their services so that, based on 20the information provided to them, the following State 21prohibitions are avoided: 22    (a) Law enforcement responsibility for providing mental 23and behavioral health care. In any area where mobile mental 24health relief providers are available for dispatch, law 25enforcement shall not be dispatched to respond to an   10400SB2500sam001- 11 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1individual requiring mental or behavioral health care unless 2that individual is (i) involved in a suspected violation of 3the criminal laws of this State, or (ii) presents a threat of 4physical injury to self or others. Mobile mental health relief 5providers are not considered available for dispatch under this 6Section if 9-8-8 reports that it cannot dispatch appropriate 7service within the maximum response times established by each 8Regional Advisory Committee under Section 45.9        (1) Standing on its own or in combination with each 10    other, the fact that an individual is experiencing a 11    mental or behavioral health emergency, or has a mental 12    health, behavioral health, or other diagnosis, is not 13    sufficient to justify an assessment that the individual is 14    a threat of physical injury to self or others, or requires 15    a law enforcement response to a request for emergency 16    response or medical transportation.17        (2) If, based on its assessment of the threat to 18    public safety, law enforcement would not accompany medical 19    transportation responding to a physical health emergency, 20    unless requested by mobile mental health relief providers, 21    law enforcement may not accompany emergency response or 22    medical transportation personnel responding to a mental or 23    behavioral health emergency that presents an equivalent 24    level of threat to self or public safety. 25        (3) Without regard to an assessment of threat to self 26    or threat to public safety, law enforcement may station   10400SB2500sam001- 12 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    personnel so that they can rapidly respond to requests for 2    assistance from mobile mental health relief providers if 3    law enforcement does not interfere with the provision of 4    emergency response or transportation services. To the 5    extent practical, not interfering with services includes 6    remaining sufficiently distant from or out of sight of the 7    individual receiving care so that law enforcement presence 8    is unlikely to escalate the emergency.9    (b) Mobile mental health relief provider involvement in 10involuntary commitment. Mobile mental health relief providers 11may participate in the involuntary commitment process only to 12the extent permitted under the Mental Health and Developmental 13Disabilities Code. The Division of Behavioral Health shall, in 14consultation with each Regional Advisory Committee, as 15appropriate, monitor the use of involuntary commitment under 16this Act and provide systemic recommendations to improve 17outcomes for those subject to commitment. In order to maintain 18the appropriate care relationship, mobile mental health relief 19providers shall not in any way assist in the involuntary 20commitment of an individual beyond (i) reporting to their 21dispatching entity or to law enforcement that they believe the 22situation requires assistance the mobile mental health relief 23providers are not permitted to provide under this Section; 24(ii) providing witness statements; and (iii) fulfilling 25reporting requirements the mobile mental health relief 26providers may have under their professional ethical   10400SB2500sam001- 13 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1obligations or laws of this State. This prohibition shall not 2interfere with any mobile mental health relief provider's 3ability to provide physical or mental health care.4    (c) Use of law enforcement for transportation. In any area 5where mobile mental health relief providers are available for 6dispatch, unless requested by mobile mental health relief 7providers, law enforcement shall not be used to provide 8transportation to access mental or behavioral health care, or 9travel between mental or behavioral health care providers, 10except where (i) no alternative is available; (ii) the 11individual requests transportation from law enforcement and 12law enforcement mutually agrees to provide transportation; or 13(iii) the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code 14requires or permits law enforcement to provide transportation.15    (d) Reduction of educational institution obligations. The 16services coordinated under this Act may not be used to replace 17any service an educational institution is required to provide 18to a student. It shall not substitute for appropriate special 19education and related services that schools are required to 20provide by any law.21    (e) This Section is operative beginning on the date the 3 22conditions in Section 65 are met or July 1, 2025, whichever is 23earlier.24(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23; 25103-645, eff. 7-1-24.)   10400SB2500sam001- 14 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    (50 ILCS 754/40)2    Sec. 40. Statewide Advisory Committee. 3    (a) The Division of Mental Health shall establish a 4Statewide Advisory Committee to review and make 5recommendations for aspects of coordinating 9-1-1 and the 69-8-8 mobile mental health response system most appropriately 7addressed on a State level.8    (b) Issues to be addressed by the Statewide Advisory 9Committee include, but are not limited to, addressing changes 10necessary in 9-1-1 call taking protocols and scripts used in 119-1-1 PSAPs where those protocols and scripts are based on or 12otherwise dependent on national providers for their operation. 13    (c) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall recommend a 14system for gathering data related to the coordination of the 159-1-1 and 9-8-8 systems for purposes of allowing the parties 16to make ongoing improvements in that system. As practical, the 17system shall attempt to determine issues, which may include, 18but are not limited to including, but not limited to:19        (1) the volume of calls coordinated between 9-1-1 and 20    9-8-8;21        (2) the volume of referrals from other first 22    responders to 9-8-8;23        (3) the volume and type of calls deemed appropriate 24    for referral to 9-8-8 but could not be served by 9-8-8 25    because of capacity restrictions or other reasons;26        (4) the appropriate information to improve   10400SB2500sam001- 15 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    coordination between 9-1-1 and 9-8-8; and2        (5) the appropriate information to improve the 9-8-8 3    system, if the information is most appropriately gathered 4    at the 9-1-1 PSAPs; and .5        (6) the number of instances of mobile mental health 6    relief providers initiating petitions for involuntary 7    commitment, broken down by county and contracting entity 8    employing the petitioning mobile mental health relief 9    providers and the aggregate demographic data of the 10    individuals subject to those petitions. 11    (d) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall consist of:12        (1) the Statewide 9-1-1 Administrator, ex officio;13        (2) one representative designated by the Illinois 14    Chapter of National Emergency Number Association (NENA);15        (3) one representative designated by the Illinois 16    Chapter of Association of Public Safety Communications 17    Officials (APCO);18        (4) one representative of the Division of Mental 19    Health;20        (5) one representative of the Illinois Department of 21    Public Health;22        (6) one representative of a statewide organization of 23    EMS responders;24        (7) one representative of a statewide organization of 25    fire chiefs;26        (8) two representatives of statewide organizations of   10400SB2500sam001- 16 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    law enforcement; 2        (9) two representatives of mental health, behavioral 3    health, or substance abuse providers; and4        (10) four representatives of advocacy organizations 5    either led by or consisting primarily of individuals with 6    intellectual or developmental disabilities, individuals 7    with behavioral disabilities, or individuals with lived 8    experience.9    (e) The members of the Statewide Advisory Committee, other 10than the Statewide 9-1-1 Administrator, shall be appointed by 11the Secretary of Human Services.12    (f) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall continue to 13meet until this Act has been fully implemented, as determined 14by the Division of Mental Health, and mobile mental health 15relief providers are available in all parts of Illinois. The 16Division of Mental Health may reconvene the Statewide Advisory 17Committee at its discretion after full implementation of this 18Act. 19(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23.) 20    (50 ILCS 754/65)21    Sec. 65. PSAP and emergency service dispatched through a 229-1-1 PSAP; coordination of activities with mobile and 23behavioral health services. 24    (a) Each 9-1-1 PSAP and emergency service dispatched 25through a 9-1-1 PSAP must begin coordinating its activities   10400SB2500sam001- 17 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1with the mobile mental and behavioral health services 2established by the Division of Mental Health once all 3 of the 3following conditions are met, but not later than July 1, 2027 42025: 5        (1) the Statewide Committee has negotiated useful 6    protocol and 9-1-1 operator script adjustments with the 7    contracted services providing these tools to 9-1-1 PSAPs 8    operating in Illinois;9        (2) the appropriate Regional Advisory Committee has 10    completed design of the specific 9-1-1 PSAP's process for 11    coordinating activities with the mobile mental and 12    behavioral health service; and 13        (3) the mobile mental and behavioral health service is 14    available in their jurisdiction.15    (b) To achieve the conditions of subsection (a) by July 1, 162027, the following activities shall be completed:17        (1) No later than June 30, 2025, pilot testing of the 18    revised protocols;19        (2) No later than June 30, 2026:20            (A) assessment and evaluation of the pilots;21            (B) revisions, as needed, of protocols and 22        operations based on assessment and evaluation of the 23        pilots;24            (C) implementation of revised protocols at pilot 25        sites; and26            (D) implementation of revised protocols by PSAPs   10400SB2500sam001- 18 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1        who are ready to implement, otherwise known as early 2        adopters; and3        (3) No later than June 30, 2027, implementation of 4    revised protocols by all remaining PSAPs, including any 5    PSAPs that previously cited financial barriers to updating 6    systems.7(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 102-1109, eff. 12-21-22; 8103-105, eff. 6-27-23; 103-645, eff. 7-1-24.) 9    Section 99.

State goals. 7    (a) 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency services dispatched through 89-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental and behavioral health 9service established by the Division of Mental Health must 10coordinate their services so that the State goals listed in 11this Section are achieved. Appropriate mobile response service 12for mental and behavioral health emergencies shall be 13available regardless of whether the initial contact was with 149-8-8, 9-1-1 or directly with an emergency service dispatched 15through 9-1-1. Appropriate mobile response services must:16        (1) whenever possible, ensure that individuals 17    experiencing mental or behavioral health crises are 18    diverted from hospitalization or incarceration and are 19    instead linked with available appropriate community 20    services; 21        (2) include the option of on-site care if that type of 22    care is appropriate and does not override the care 23    decisions of the individual receiving care. Providing care 24    in the community, through methods like mobile crisis 25    units, is encouraged. If effective care is provided on   10400SB2500sam001- 6 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    site, and if it is consistent with the care decisions of 2    the individual receiving the care, further transportation 3    to other medical providers is not required by this Act;4        (3) recommend appropriate referrals for available 5    community services if the individual receiving on-site 6    care is not already in a treatment relationship with a 7    service provider or is unsatisfied with their current 8    service providers. The referrals shall take into 9    consideration waiting lists and copayments, which may 10    present barriers to access; and 11        (4) subject to the care decisions of the individual 12    receiving care, coordinate provide transportation for any 13    individual experiencing a mental or behavioral health 14    emergency to the most integrated and least restrictive 15    setting feasible. A mobile crisis response team may 16    provide transportation if the mobile crisis response team 17    is appropriately equipped and staffed to do so. 18    Transportation shall be to the most integrated and least 19    restrictive setting appropriate in the community, such as 20    to the individual's home or chosen location, community 21    crisis respite centers, clinic settings, behavioral health 22    centers, or the offices of particular medical care 23    providers with existing treatment relationships to the 24    individual seeking care.25    (b) Prioritize requests for emergency assistance. 9-1-1 26PSAPs, emergency services dispatched through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and   10400SB2500sam001- 7 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1the mobile mental and behavioral health service established by 2the Division of Mental Health must provide guidance for 3prioritizing calls for assistance and maximum response time in 4relation to the type of emergency reported.5    (c) Provide appropriate response times. From the time of 6first notification, 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency services dispatched 7through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental and behavioral 8health service established by the Division of Mental Health 9must provide the response within response time appropriate to 10the care requirements of the individual with an emergency.11    (d) Require appropriate mobile mental health relief 12provider training. Mobile mental health relief providers must 13have adequate training to address the needs of individuals 14experiencing a mental or behavioral health emergency. Adequate 15training at least includes:16        (1) training in de-escalation techniques;17        (2) knowledge of local community services and 18    supports; and 19        (3) training in respectful interaction with people 20    experiencing mental or behavioral health crises, including 21    the concepts of stigma and respectful language; .22        (4) training in recognizing and working with people 23    with neurodivergent and developmental disability diagnoses 24    and in the techniques available to help stabilize and 25    connect them to further services; and26        (5) training in the involuntary commitment process, in   10400SB2500sam001- 8 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    identification of situations that meet the standards for 2    involuntary commitment, and in cultural competencies and 3    social biases to guard against any group being 4    disproportionately subjected to the involuntary commitment 5    process or the use of the process not warranted under the 6    legal standard for involuntary commitment. 7    (e) Require minimum team staffing. The Division of Mental 8Health, in consultation with the Regional Advisory Committees 9created in Section 40, shall determine the appropriate 10credentials for the mental health providers responding to 11calls, including to what extent the mobile mental health 12relief providers must have certain credentials and licensing, 13and to what extent the mobile mental health relief providers 14can be peer support professionals.15    (f) Require training from individuals with lived 16experience. Training shall be provided by individuals with 17lived experience to the extent available.18    (g) Adopt guidelines directing referral to restrictive 19care settings. Mobile mental health relief providers must have 20guidelines to follow when considering whether to refer an 21individual to more restrictive forms of care, like emergency 22room or hospital settings.23    (h) Specify regional best practices. Mobile mental health 24relief providers providing these services must do so 25consistently with best practices, which include respecting the 26care choices of the individuals receiving assistance. Regional   10400SB2500sam001- 9 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1best practices may be broken down into sub-regions, as 2appropriate to reflect local resources and conditions. With 3the agreement of the impacted EMS Regions, providers of 4emergency response to physical emergencies may participate in 5another EMS Region for mental and behavioral response, if that 6participation shall provide a better service to individuals 7experiencing a mental or behavioral health emergency. 8    (i) Adopt system for directing care in advance of an 9emergency. The Division of Mental Health shall select and 10publicly identify a system that allows individuals who 11voluntarily chose to do so to provide confidential advanced 12care directions to individuals providing services under this 13Act. No system for providing advanced care direction may be 14implemented unless the Division of Mental Health approves it 15as confidential, available to individuals at all economic 16levels, and non-stigmatizing. The Division of Mental Health 17may defer this requirement for providing a system for advanced 18care direction if it determines that no existing systems can 19currently meet these requirements. 20    (j) Train dispatching staff. The personnel staffing 9-1-1, 213-1-1, or other emergency response intake systems must be 22provided with adequate training to assess whether coordinating 23with 9-8-8 is appropriate.24    (k) Establish protocol for emergency responder 25coordination. The Division of Mental Health shall establish a 26protocol for mobile mental health relief providers, law   10400SB2500sam001- 10 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1enforcement, and fire and ambulance services to request 2assistance from each other, and train these groups on the 3protocol.4    (l) Integrate law enforcement. The Division of Mental 5Health shall provide for law enforcement to request mobile 6mental health relief provider assistance whenever law 7enforcement engages an individual appropriate for services 8under this Act. If law enforcement would typically request EMS 9assistance when it encounters an individual with a physical 10health emergency, law enforcement shall similarly dispatch 11mental or behavioral health personnel or medical 12transportation when it encounters an individual in a mental or 13behavioral health emergency.14(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23.) 15    (50 ILCS 754/30)16    Sec. 30. State prohibitions. 9-1-1 PSAPs, emergency 17services dispatched through 9-1-1 PSAPs, and the mobile mental 18and behavioral health service established by the Division of 19Mental Health must coordinate their services so that, based on 20the information provided to them, the following State 21prohibitions are avoided: 22    (a) Law enforcement responsibility for providing mental 23and behavioral health care. In any area where mobile mental 24health relief providers are available for dispatch, law 25enforcement shall not be dispatched to respond to an   10400SB2500sam001- 11 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1individual requiring mental or behavioral health care unless 2that individual is (i) involved in a suspected violation of 3the criminal laws of this State, or (ii) presents a threat of 4physical injury to self or others. Mobile mental health relief 5providers are not considered available for dispatch under this 6Section if 9-8-8 reports that it cannot dispatch appropriate 7service within the maximum response times established by each 8Regional Advisory Committee under Section 45.9        (1) Standing on its own or in combination with each 10    other, the fact that an individual is experiencing a 11    mental or behavioral health emergency, or has a mental 12    health, behavioral health, or other diagnosis, is not 13    sufficient to justify an assessment that the individual is 14    a threat of physical injury to self or others, or requires 15    a law enforcement response to a request for emergency 16    response or medical transportation.17        (2) If, based on its assessment of the threat to 18    public safety, law enforcement would not accompany medical 19    transportation responding to a physical health emergency, 20    unless requested by mobile mental health relief providers, 21    law enforcement may not accompany emergency response or 22    medical transportation personnel responding to a mental or 23    behavioral health emergency that presents an equivalent 24    level of threat to self or public safety. 25        (3) Without regard to an assessment of threat to self 26    or threat to public safety, law enforcement may station   10400SB2500sam001- 12 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    personnel so that they can rapidly respond to requests for 2    assistance from mobile mental health relief providers if 3    law enforcement does not interfere with the provision of 4    emergency response or transportation services. To the 5    extent practical, not interfering with services includes 6    remaining sufficiently distant from or out of sight of the 7    individual receiving care so that law enforcement presence 8    is unlikely to escalate the emergency.9    (b) Mobile mental health relief provider involvement in 10involuntary commitment. Mobile mental health relief providers 11may participate in the involuntary commitment process only to 12the extent permitted under the Mental Health and Developmental 13Disabilities Code. The Division of Behavioral Health shall, in 14consultation with each Regional Advisory Committee, as 15appropriate, monitor the use of involuntary commitment under 16this Act and provide systemic recommendations to improve 17outcomes for those subject to commitment. In order to maintain 18the appropriate care relationship, mobile mental health relief 19providers shall not in any way assist in the involuntary 20commitment of an individual beyond (i) reporting to their 21dispatching entity or to law enforcement that they believe the 22situation requires assistance the mobile mental health relief 23providers are not permitted to provide under this Section; 24(ii) providing witness statements; and (iii) fulfilling 25reporting requirements the mobile mental health relief 26providers may have under their professional ethical   10400SB2500sam001- 13 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1obligations or laws of this State. This prohibition shall not 2interfere with any mobile mental health relief provider's 3ability to provide physical or mental health care.4    (c) Use of law enforcement for transportation. In any area 5where mobile mental health relief providers are available for 6dispatch, unless requested by mobile mental health relief 7providers, law enforcement shall not be used to provide 8transportation to access mental or behavioral health care, or 9travel between mental or behavioral health care providers, 10except where (i) no alternative is available; (ii) the 11individual requests transportation from law enforcement and 12law enforcement mutually agrees to provide transportation; or 13(iii) the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code 14requires or permits law enforcement to provide transportation.15    (d) Reduction of educational institution obligations. The 16services coordinated under this Act may not be used to replace 17any service an educational institution is required to provide 18to a student. It shall not substitute for appropriate special 19education and related services that schools are required to 20provide by any law.21    (e) This Section is operative beginning on the date the 3 22conditions in Section 65 are met or July 1, 2025, whichever is 23earlier.24(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23; 25103-645, eff. 7-1-24.)   10400SB2500sam001- 14 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    (50 ILCS 754/40)2    Sec. 40. Statewide Advisory Committee. 3    (a) The Division of Mental Health shall establish a 4Statewide Advisory Committee to review and make 5recommendations for aspects of coordinating 9-1-1 and the 69-8-8 mobile mental health response system most appropriately 7addressed on a State level.8    (b) Issues to be addressed by the Statewide Advisory 9Committee include, but are not limited to, addressing changes 10necessary in 9-1-1 call taking protocols and scripts used in 119-1-1 PSAPs where those protocols and scripts are based on or 12otherwise dependent on national providers for their operation. 13    (c) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall recommend a 14system for gathering data related to the coordination of the 159-1-1 and 9-8-8 systems for purposes of allowing the parties 16to make ongoing improvements in that system. As practical, the 17system shall attempt to determine issues, which may include, 18but are not limited to including, but not limited to:19        (1) the volume of calls coordinated between 9-1-1 and 20    9-8-8;21        (2) the volume of referrals from other first 22    responders to 9-8-8;23        (3) the volume and type of calls deemed appropriate 24    for referral to 9-8-8 but could not be served by 9-8-8 25    because of capacity restrictions or other reasons;26        (4) the appropriate information to improve   10400SB2500sam001- 15 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    coordination between 9-1-1 and 9-8-8; and2        (5) the appropriate information to improve the 9-8-8 3    system, if the information is most appropriately gathered 4    at the 9-1-1 PSAPs; and .5        (6) the number of instances of mobile mental health 6    relief providers initiating petitions for involuntary 7    commitment, broken down by county and contracting entity 8    employing the petitioning mobile mental health relief 9    providers and the aggregate demographic data of the 10    individuals subject to those petitions. 11    (d) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall consist of:12        (1) the Statewide 9-1-1 Administrator, ex officio;13        (2) one representative designated by the Illinois 14    Chapter of National Emergency Number Association (NENA);15        (3) one representative designated by the Illinois 16    Chapter of Association of Public Safety Communications 17    Officials (APCO);18        (4) one representative of the Division of Mental 19    Health;20        (5) one representative of the Illinois Department of 21    Public Health;22        (6) one representative of a statewide organization of 23    EMS responders;24        (7) one representative of a statewide organization of 25    fire chiefs;26        (8) two representatives of statewide organizations of   10400SB2500sam001- 16 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1    law enforcement; 2        (9) two representatives of mental health, behavioral 3    health, or substance abuse providers; and4        (10) four representatives of advocacy organizations 5    either led by or consisting primarily of individuals with 6    intellectual or developmental disabilities, individuals 7    with behavioral disabilities, or individuals with lived 8    experience.9    (e) The members of the Statewide Advisory Committee, other 10than the Statewide 9-1-1 Administrator, shall be appointed by 11the Secretary of Human Services.12    (f) The Statewide Advisory Committee shall continue to 13meet until this Act has been fully implemented, as determined 14by the Division of Mental Health, and mobile mental health 15relief providers are available in all parts of Illinois. The 16Division of Mental Health may reconvene the Statewide Advisory 17Committee at its discretion after full implementation of this 18Act. 19(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 103-105, eff. 6-27-23.) 20    (50 ILCS 754/65)21    Sec. 65. PSAP and emergency service dispatched through a 229-1-1 PSAP; coordination of activities with mobile and 23behavioral health services. 24    (a) Each 9-1-1 PSAP and emergency service dispatched 25through a 9-1-1 PSAP must begin coordinating its activities   10400SB2500sam001- 17 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1with the mobile mental and behavioral health services 2established by the Division of Mental Health once all 3 of the 3following conditions are met, but not later than July 1, 2027 42025: 5        (1) the Statewide Committee has negotiated useful 6    protocol and 9-1-1 operator script adjustments with the 7    contracted services providing these tools to 9-1-1 PSAPs 8    operating in Illinois;9        (2) the appropriate Regional Advisory Committee has 10    completed design of the specific 9-1-1 PSAP's process for 11    coordinating activities with the mobile mental and 12    behavioral health service; and 13        (3) the mobile mental and behavioral health service is 14    available in their jurisdiction.15    (b) To achieve the conditions of subsection (a) by July 1, 162027, the following activities shall be completed:17        (1) No later than June 30, 2025, pilot testing of the 18    revised protocols;19        (2) No later than June 30, 2026:20            (A) assessment and evaluation of the pilots;21            (B) revisions, as needed, of protocols and 22        operations based on assessment and evaluation of the 23        pilots;24            (C) implementation of revised protocols at pilot 25        sites; and26            (D) implementation of revised protocols by PSAPs   10400SB2500sam001- 18 -LRB104 12196 RTM 24634 a1        who are ready to implement, otherwise known as early 2        adopters; and3        (3) No later than June 30, 2027, implementation of 4    revised protocols by all remaining PSAPs, including any 5    PSAPs that previously cited financial barriers to updating 6    systems.7(Source: P.A. 102-580, eff. 1-1-22; 102-1109, eff. 12-21-22; 8103-105, eff. 6-27-23; 103-645, eff. 7-1-24.) 9    Section 99.
