The full verbatim record 6of the sentencing hearing shall be filed with the clerk of the 7court and shall be a public record.8    (c-1) In imposing a sentence for the offense of aggravated 9kidnapping for ransom, home invasion, armed robbery, 10aggravated vehicular hijacking, aggravated discharge of a 11firearm, or armed violence with a category I weapon or 12category II weapon, the trial judge shall make a finding as to 13whether the conduct leading to conviction for the offense 14resulted in great bodily harm to a victim, and shall enter that 15finding and the basis for that finding in the record.16    (c-1.5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the 17contrary, in imposing a sentence for an offense that requires 18a mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment, the court may 19instead sentence the offender to probation, conditional 20discharge, or a lesser term of imprisonment it deems 21appropriate if: (1) the offense involves the use or possession 22of drugs, retail theft, or driving on a revoked license due to 23unpaid financial obligations; (2) the court finds that the 24defendant does not pose a risk to public safety; and (3) the 25interest of justice requires imposing a term of probation, 26conditional discharge, or a lesser term of imprisonment. The   HB0850 Enrolled- 34 -LRB104 04748 BDA 14775 b1court must state on the record its reasons for imposing 2probation, conditional discharge, or a lesser term of 3imprisonment.4    (c-2) If the defendant is sentenced to prison, other than 5when a sentence of natural life imprisonment is imposed, at 6the time the sentence is imposed the judge shall state on the 7record in open court the approximate period of time the 8defendant will serve in custody according to the then current 9statutory rules and regulations for sentence credit found in 10Section 3-6-3 and other related provisions of this Code. This 11statement is intended solely to inform the public, has no 12legal effect on the defendant's actual release, and may not be 13relied on by the defendant on appeal.14    The judge's statement, to be given after pronouncing the 15sentence, other than when the sentence is imposed for one of 16the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) of Section 3-6-3, 17shall include the following:18    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 19the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in 20prison as a result of this sentence.

In this 24case, assuming the defendant receives all of his or her 25sentence credit, the period of estimated actual custody is ... 26years and ... months, less up to 180 days additional earned   HB0850 Enrolled- 35 -LRB104 04748 BDA 14775 b1sentence credit. If the defendant, because of his or her own 2misconduct or failure to comply with the institutional 3regulations, does not receive those credits, the actual time 4served in prison will be longer. The defendant may also 5receive an additional one-half day sentence credit for each 6day of participation in vocational, industry, substance abuse, 7and educational programs as provided for by Illinois statute."8    When the sentence is imposed for one of the offenses 9enumerated in paragraph (a)(2) of Section 3-6-3, other than 10first degree murder, and the offense was committed on or after 11June 19, 1998, and when the sentence is imposed for reckless 12homicide as defined in subsection (e) of Section 9-3 of the 13Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 if the 14offense was committed on or after January 1, 1999, and when the 15sentence is imposed for aggravated driving under the influence 16of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or 17compounds, or any combination thereof as defined in 18subparagraph (F) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Section 1911-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, and when the sentence is 20imposed for aggravated arson if the offense was committed on 21or after July 27, 2001 (the effective date of Public Act 2292-176), and when the sentence is imposed for aggravated 23driving under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, 24or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination 25thereof as defined in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of 26subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code   HB0850 Enrolled- 36 -LRB104 04748 BDA 14775 b1committed on or after January 1, 2011 (the effective date of 2Public Act 96-1230), the judge's statement, to be given after 3pronouncing the sentence, shall include the following:4    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 5the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in 6prison as a result of this sentence. The actual period of 7prison time served is determined by the statutes of Illinois 8as applied to this sentence by the Illinois Department of 9Corrections and the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. In this 10case, the defendant is entitled to no more than 4 1/2 days of 11sentence credit for each month of his or her sentence of 12imprisonment. Therefore, this defendant will serve at least 1385% of his or her sentence. Assuming the defendant receives 4 141/2 days credit for each month of his or her sentence, the 15period of estimated actual custody is ... years and ... 16months. If the defendant, because of his or her own misconduct 17or failure to comply with the institutional regulations 18receives lesser credit, the actual time served in prison will 19be longer."20    When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed for first 21degree murder and the offense was committed on or after June 2219, 1998, the judge's statement, to be given after pronouncing 23the sentence, shall include the following:24    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 25the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in 26prison as a result of this sentence.
