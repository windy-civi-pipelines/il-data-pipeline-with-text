This 18statement is intended solely to inform the public, has no 19legal effect on the defendant's actual release, and may not be 20relied on by the defendant on appeal.21    The judge's statement, to be given after pronouncing the 22sentence, other than when the sentence is imposed for one of 23the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(4) of Section 3-6-3, 24shall include the following:25    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 26the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in   10400HB0850ham001- 35 -LRB104 04748 RLC 26929 a1prison as a result of this sentence. The actual period of 2prison time served is determined by the statutes of Illinois 3as applied to this sentence by the Illinois Department of 4Corrections and the Illinois Prisoner Review Board. In this 5case, assuming the defendant receives all of his or her 6sentence credit, the period of estimated actual custody is ... 7years and ... months, less up to 180 days additional earned 8sentence credit. If the defendant, because of his or her own 9misconduct or failure to comply with the institutional 10regulations, does not receive those credits, the actual time 11served in prison will be longer. The defendant may also 12receive an additional one-half day sentence credit for each 13day of participation in vocational, industry, substance abuse, 14and educational programs as provided for by Illinois statute."15    When the sentence is imposed for one of the offenses 16enumerated in paragraph (a)(2) of Section 3-6-3, other than 17first degree murder, and the offense was committed on or after 18June 19, 1998, and when the sentence is imposed for reckless 19homicide as defined in subsection (e) of Section 9-3 of the 20Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 if the 21offense was committed on or after January 1, 1999, and when the 22sentence is imposed for aggravated driving under the influence 23of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or 24compounds, or any combination thereof as defined in 25subparagraph (F) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Section 2611-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, and when the sentence is   10400HB0850ham001- 36 -LRB104 04748 RLC 26929 a1imposed for aggravated arson if the offense was committed on 2or after July 27, 2001 (the effective date of Public Act 392-176), and when the sentence is imposed for aggravated 4driving under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, 5or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination 6thereof as defined in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of 7subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of the Illinois Vehicle Code 8committed on or after January 1, 2011 (the effective date of 9Public Act 96-1230), the judge's statement, to be given after 10pronouncing the sentence, shall include the following:11    "The purpose of this statement is to inform the public of 12the actual period of time this defendant is likely to spend in 13prison as a result of this sentence.

In this 17case, the defendant is entitled to no more than 4 1/2 days of 18sentence credit for each month of his or her sentence of 19imprisonment. Therefore, this defendant will serve at least 2085% of his or her sentence.
