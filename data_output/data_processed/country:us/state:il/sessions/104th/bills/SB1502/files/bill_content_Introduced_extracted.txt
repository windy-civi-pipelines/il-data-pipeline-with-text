This number shall be designated as 7the base amount of the Department. No positions approved by 8the Division under paragraph (b) of subsection 4 will be 9included in the base amount. In the event that the Department 10employs fewer Probation officers and Probation managers than 11the base amount for a period of 90 days, funding received by 12the Department under subsection 4 of this Section may be 13reduced on a monthly basis by the amount of the current 14salaries of any positions below the base amount.15    (9) Before the 15th day of each month, the treasurer of any 16county which has a Probation and Court Services Department, or 17the treasurer of the most populous county, in the case of a 18Probation or Court Services Department funded by more than one 19county, shall submit an itemized statement of all approved 20costs incurred in the delivery of Basic Probation and Court 21Services under this Act to the Supreme Court.

If after 90 days of written 18notice the noncompliance still exists, the Supreme Court shall 19be required to reduce the amount of monthly reimbursement by 2010%. An additional 10% reduction of monthly reimbursement 21shall occur for each consecutive month of noncompliance. 22Except as provided in subsection 5 of Section 15, funding to 23counties shall commence on April 1, 1986.
