Short title. This Act may be cited as the PFAS 5Wastewater Citizen Protection Act. 6    Section 5. Findings; policy. 7    (a) The General Assembly finds that:8        (1) Current scientific research suggests that exposure 9    to certain per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may 10    cause adverse human health impacts.11        (2) Once released, PFAS does not naturally degrade and 12    is difficult and costly to remove from the environment.13        (3) PFAS enters wastewater treatment plants through 14    wastewater discharges associated with consumer products, 15    industrial products, and solid waste streams, such as 16    landfill leachate.17        (4) Wastewater agencies do not manufacture, 18    intentionally use, or sell PFAS, but they are passive 19    receivers of PFAS and are required to accept wastewater 20    containing PFAS, including wastewater from domestic, 21    industrial, and solid waste sources.22        (5) Wastewater treatment plants, which are generally 23    owned by wastewater agencies and funded by the customers   HB2955 Engrossed- 2 -LRB104 03057 BDA 13075 b1    within a specific service area, are not designed for or 2    easily adapted to treat wastewater for PFAS.3        (6) If wastewater agencies are required to treat 4    wastewater for PFAS in the future, that treatment will 5    come at a significant operational and capital cost.6    (b) Therefore, it is the policy of the State of Illinois 7that, as it relates to PFAS and PFAS elimination and 8mitigation:9        (1) The State should follow sound science, use 10    existing source control regulatory frameworks, avoid 11    unintended negative consequences to the citizens of the 12    State, and ensure adequate funding to eliminate or 13    mitigate PFAS.14        (2) Neither wastewater agencies nor their customers 15    should bear liability or cost relating to PFAS.16        (3) Manufacturers of PFAS should be held responsible 17    for all liability and costs relating to PFAS, including 18    costs to implement any federal or State policy, rule, or 19    regulation relating to PFAS monitoring, elimination, and 20    mitigation, including requirements in permits issued to 21    any wastewater agency. 22    Section 10.
