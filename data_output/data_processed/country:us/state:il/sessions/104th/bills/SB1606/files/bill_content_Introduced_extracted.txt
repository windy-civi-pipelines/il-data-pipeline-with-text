For the purposes of Public 23Act 102-1035, the implementation date of the PDPM   SB1606- 2 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1reimbursement system and all related provisions shall be July 21, 2022 if the following conditions are met: (i) the Centers 3for Medicare and Medicaid Services has approved corresponding 4changes in the reimbursement system and bed assessment; and 5(ii) the Department has filed rules to implement these changes 6no later than June 1, 2022. Failure of the Department to file 7rules to implement the changes provided in Public Act 102-1035 8no later than June 1, 2022 shall result in the implementation 9date being delayed to October 1, 2022. 10    (d) The new nursing services reimbursement methodology 11utilizing the Patient Driven Payment Model, which shall be 12referred to as the PDPM reimbursement system, taking effect 13July 1, 2022, upon federal approval by the Centers for 14Medicare and Medicaid Services, shall be based on the 15following: 16        (1) The methodology shall be resident-centered, 17    facility-specific, cost-based, and based on guidance from 18    the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 19        (2) Costs shall be annually rebased and case mix index 20    quarterly updated. The nursing services methodology will 21    be assigned to the Medicaid enrolled residents on record 22    as of 30 days prior to the beginning of the rate period in 23    the Department's Medicaid Management Information System 24    (MMIS) as present on the last day of the second quarter 25    preceding the rate period based upon the Assessment 26    Reference Date of the Minimum Data Set (MDS).   SB1606- 3 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1        (3) Regional wage adjustors based on the Health 2    Service Areas (HSA) groupings and adjusters in effect on 3    April 30, 2012 shall be included, except no adjuster shall 4    be lower than 1.06. 5        (4) PDPM nursing case mix indices in effect on March 6    1, 2022 shall be assigned to each resident class at no less 7    than 0.7858 of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 8    Services PDPM unadjusted case mix values, in effect on 9    March 1, 2022.10        (5) The pool of funds available for distribution by 11    case mix and the base facility rate shall be determined 12    using the formula contained in subsection (d-1). 13        (6) The Department shall establish a variable per diem 14    staffing add-on in accordance with the most recent 15    available federal staffing report, currently the Payroll 16    Based Journal, for the same period of time, and if 17    applicable adjusted for acuity using the same quarter's 18    MDS. The Department shall rely on Payroll Based Journals 19    provided to the Department of Public Health to make a 20    determination of non-submission. If the Department is 21    notified by a facility of missing or inaccurate Payroll 22    Based Journal data or an incorrect calculation of 23    staffing, the Department must make a correction as soon as 24    the error is verified for the applicable quarter.25        Beginning October 1, 2024, the staffing percentage 26    used in the calculation of the per diem staffing add-on   SB1606- 4 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1    shall be its PDPM STRIVE Staffing Ratio which equals: its 2    Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day 3    as published in the most recent federal staffing report 4    (the Provider Information File), divided by the facility's 5    PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target. Each facility's PDPM STRIVE 6    Staffing Target is equal to .82 times the facility's 7    Illinois Adjusted Facility Case-Mix Hours Per Resident Per 8    Day. A facility's Illinois Adjusted Facility Case Mix 9    Hours Per Resident Per Day is equal to its Case-Mix Total 10    Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 11    the most recent federal staffing report) times 3.662 12    (which reflects the national resident days-weighted mean 13    Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day 14    as calculated using the January 2024 federal Provider 15    Information Files), divided by the national resident 16    days-weighted mean Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per 17    Resident Per Day calculated using the most recent federal 18    Provider Information File.19        (6.5) Beginning July 1, 2024, the paid per diem 20    staffing add-on shall be the paid per diem staffing add-on 21    in effect April 1, 2024. For dates beginning October 1, 22    2024 and through September 30, 2025, the denominator for 23    the staffing percentage shall be the lesser of the 24    facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target and:25            (A) For the quarter beginning October 1, 2024, the 26        sum of 20% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing   SB1606- 5 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1        Target and 80% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 2        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 3        the January 2024 federal staffing report).4            (B) For the quarter beginning January 1, 2025, the 5        sum of 40% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 6        Target and 60% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 7        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 8        the January 2024 federal staffing report).9            (C) For the quarter beginning March 1, 2025, the 10        sum of 60% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 11        Target and 40% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 12        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 13        the January 2024 federal staffing report).14            (D) For the quarter beginning July 1, 2025, the 15        sum of 80% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 16        Target and 20% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 17        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 18        the January 2024 federal staffing report). 19         Facilities with at least 70% of the staffing 20    indicated by the STRIVE study shall be paid a per diem 21    add-on of $9, increasing by equivalent steps for each 22    whole percentage point until the facilities reach a per 23    diem of $16.52. Facilities with at least 80% of the 24    staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall be paid a per 25    diem add-on of $16.52, increasing by equivalent steps for 26    each whole percentage point until the facilities reach a   SB1606- 6 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1    per diem add-on of $25.77. Facilities with at least 92% of 2    the staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall be paid a 3    per diem add-on of $25.77, increasing by equivalent steps 4    for each whole percentage point until the facilities reach 5    a per diem add-on of $30.98. Facilities with at least 100% 6    of the staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall be 7    paid a per diem add-on of $30.98, increasing by equivalent 8    steps for each whole percentage point until the facilities 9    reach a per diem add-on of $36.44.

Implementation of 22Medicare's Patient-Driven Payment Model shall, by September 1, 232020, end the collection of the MDS data that is necessary to 24maintain the current RUG-IV Medicaid payment methodology. The 25technical advisory group must consider a revised reimbursement 26methodology that takes into account transparency,   SB1606- 15 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1accountability, actual staffing as reported under the 2federally required Payroll Based Journal system, changes to 3the minimum wage, adequacy in coverage of the cost of care, and 4a quality component that rewards quality improvements.5    (l) The Department shall establish per diem add-on 6payments to improve the quality of care delivered by 7facilities, including:8        (1) Incentive payments determined by facility 9    performance on specified quality measures in an initial 10    amount of $70,000,000. Nothing in this subsection shall be 11    construed to limit the quality of care payments in the 12    aggregate statewide to $70,000,000, and, if quality of 13    care has improved across nursing facilities, the 14    Department shall adjust those add-on payments accordingly. 15    The quality payment methodology described in this 16    subsection must be used for at least State Fiscal Year 17    2023. Beginning with the quarter starting July 1, 2023, 18    the Department may add, remove, or change quality metrics 19    and make associated changes to the quality payment 20    methodology as outlined in subparagraph (E). Facilities 21    designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 22    Services as a special focus facility or a hospital-based 23    nursing home do not qualify for quality payments.24            (A) Each quality pool must be distributed by 25        assigning a quality weighted score for each nursing 26        home which is calculated by multiplying the nursing   SB1606- 16 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1        home's quality base period Medicaid days by the 2        nursing home's star rating weight in that period.3            (B) Star rating weights are assigned based on the 4        nursing home's star rating for the LTS quality star 5        rating. As used in this subparagraph, "LTS quality 6        star rating" means the long-term stay quality rating 7        for each nursing facility, as assigned by the Centers 8        for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the Five-Star 9        Quality Rating System. The rating is a number ranging 10        from 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest).11                (i) Zero-star or one-star rating has a weight 12            of 0.13                (ii) Two-star rating has a weight of 0.75.14                (iii) Three-star rating has a weight of 1.5. 15                (iv) Four-star rating has a weight of 2.5.16                (v) Five-star rating has a weight of 3.5.17            (C) Each nursing home's quality weight score is 18        divided by the sum of all quality weight scores for 19        qualifying nursing homes to determine the proportion 20        of the quality pool to be paid to the nursing home. 21            (D) The quality pool is no less than $70,000,000 22        annually or $17,500,000 per quarter. The Department 23        shall publish on its website the estimated payments 24        and the associated weights for each facility 45 days 25        prior to when the initial payments for the quarter are 26        to be paid. The Department shall assign each facility   SB1606- 17 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1        the most recent and applicable quarter's STAR value 2        unless the facility notifies the Department within 15 3        days of an issue and the facility provides reasonable 4        evidence demonstrating its timely compliance with 5        federal data submission requirements for the quarter 6        of record. If such evidence cannot be provided to the 7        Department, the STAR rating assigned to the facility 8        shall be reduced by one from the prior quarter. 9            (E) The Department shall review quality metrics 10        used for payment of the quality pool and make 11        recommendations for any associated changes to the 12        methodology for distributing quality pool payments in 13        consultation with associations representing long-term 14        care providers, consumer advocates, organizations 15        representing workers of long-term care facilities, and 16        payors. The Department may establish, by rule, changes 17        to the methodology for distributing quality pool 18        payments. 19            (F) The Department shall disburse quality pool 20        payments from the Long-Term Care Provider Fund on a 21        monthly basis in amounts proportional to the total 22        quality pool payment determined for the quarter. 23            (G) The Department shall publish any changes in 24        the methodology for distributing quality pool payments 25        prior to the beginning of the measurement period or 26        quality base period for any metric added to the   SB1606- 18 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1        distribution's methodology. 2        (2) Payments based on CNA tenure, promotion, and CNA 3    training for the purpose of increasing CNA compensation. 4    It is the intent of this subsection that payments made in 5    accordance with this paragraph be directly incorporated 6    into increased compensation for CNAs. As used in this 7    paragraph, "CNA" means a certified nursing assistant as 8    that term is described in Section 3-206 of the Nursing 9    Home Care Act, Section 3-206 of the ID/DD Community Care 10    Act, and Section 3-206 of the MC/DD Act. The Department 11    shall establish, by rule, payments to nursing facilities 12    equal to Medicaid's share of the tenure wage increments 13    specified in this paragraph for all reported CNA employee 14    hours compensated according to a posted schedule 15    consisting of increments at least as large as those 16    specified in this paragraph. The increments are as 17    follows: an additional $1.50 per hour for CNAs with at 18    least one and less than 2 years' experience plus another 19    $1 per hour for each additional year of experience up to a 20    maximum of $6.50 for CNAs with at least 6 years of 21    experience. For purposes of this paragraph, Medicaid's 22    share shall be the ratio determined by paid Medicaid bed 23    days divided by total bed days for the applicable time 24    period used in the calculation. In addition, and additive 25    to any tenure increments paid as specified in this 26    paragraph, the Department shall establish, by rule,   SB1606- 19 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1    payments supporting Medicaid's share of the 2    promotion-based wage increments for CNA employee hours 3    compensated for that promotion with at least a $1.50 4    hourly increase. Medicaid's share shall be established as 5    it is for the tenure increments described in this 6    paragraph. Qualifying promotions shall be defined by the 7    Department in rules for an expected 10-15% subset of CNAs 8    assigned intermediate, specialized, or added roles such as 9    CNA trainers, CNA scheduling "captains", and CNA 10    specialists for resident conditions like dementia or 11    memory care or behavioral health.12    (m) The Department shall work with nursing facility 13industry representatives to design policies and procedures to 14permit facilities to address the integrity of data from 15federal reporting sites used by the Department in setting 16facility rates. 17(Source: P.A. 102-77, eff. 7-9-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 18102-1035, eff. 5-31-22; 102-1118, eff. 1-18-23; 103-102, 19Article 40, Section 40-5, eff. 1-1-24; 103-102, Article 50, 20Section 50-5, eff. 1-1-24; 103-593, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 217-1-24.) 22    Section 99.

For the purposes of Public 23Act 102-1035, the implementation date of the PDPM   SB1606- 2 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1reimbursement system and all related provisions shall be July 21, 2022 if the following conditions are met: (i) the Centers 3for Medicare and Medicaid Services has approved corresponding 4changes in the reimbursement system and bed assessment; and 5(ii) the Department has filed rules to implement these changes 6no later than June 1, 2022. Failure of the Department to file 7rules to implement the changes provided in Public Act 102-1035 8no later than June 1, 2022 shall result in the implementation 9date being delayed to October 1, 2022. 10    (d) The new nursing services reimbursement methodology 11utilizing the Patient Driven Payment Model, which shall be 12referred to as the PDPM reimbursement system, taking effect 13July 1, 2022, upon federal approval by the Centers for 14Medicare and Medicaid Services, shall be based on the 15following: 16        (1) The methodology shall be resident-centered, 17    facility-specific, cost-based, and based on guidance from 18    the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 19        (2) Costs shall be annually rebased and case mix index 20    quarterly updated. The nursing services methodology will 21    be assigned to the Medicaid enrolled residents on record 22    as of 30 days prior to the beginning of the rate period in 23    the Department's Medicaid Management Information System 24    (MMIS) as present on the last day of the second quarter 25    preceding the rate period based upon the Assessment 26    Reference Date of the Minimum Data Set (MDS).   SB1606- 3 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1        (3) Regional wage adjustors based on the Health 2    Service Areas (HSA) groupings and adjusters in effect on 3    April 30, 2012 shall be included, except no adjuster shall 4    be lower than 1.06. 5        (4) PDPM nursing case mix indices in effect on March 6    1, 2022 shall be assigned to each resident class at no less 7    than 0.7858 of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 8    Services PDPM unadjusted case mix values, in effect on 9    March 1, 2022.10        (5) The pool of funds available for distribution by 11    case mix and the base facility rate shall be determined 12    using the formula contained in subsection (d-1). 13        (6) The Department shall establish a variable per diem 14    staffing add-on in accordance with the most recent 15    available federal staffing report, currently the Payroll 16    Based Journal, for the same period of time, and if 17    applicable adjusted for acuity using the same quarter's 18    MDS. The Department shall rely on Payroll Based Journals 19    provided to the Department of Public Health to make a 20    determination of non-submission. If the Department is 21    notified by a facility of missing or inaccurate Payroll 22    Based Journal data or an incorrect calculation of 23    staffing, the Department must make a correction as soon as 24    the error is verified for the applicable quarter.25        Beginning October 1, 2024, the staffing percentage 26    used in the calculation of the per diem staffing add-on   SB1606- 4 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1    shall be its PDPM STRIVE Staffing Ratio which equals: its 2    Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day 3    as published in the most recent federal staffing report 4    (the Provider Information File), divided by the facility's 5    PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target. Each facility's PDPM STRIVE 6    Staffing Target is equal to .82 times the facility's 7    Illinois Adjusted Facility Case-Mix Hours Per Resident Per 8    Day. A facility's Illinois Adjusted Facility Case Mix 9    Hours Per Resident Per Day is equal to its Case-Mix Total 10    Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 11    the most recent federal staffing report) times 3.662 12    (which reflects the national resident days-weighted mean 13    Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day 14    as calculated using the January 2024 federal Provider 15    Information Files), divided by the national resident 16    days-weighted mean Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per 17    Resident Per Day calculated using the most recent federal 18    Provider Information File.19        (6.5) Beginning July 1, 2024, the paid per diem 20    staffing add-on shall be the paid per diem staffing add-on 21    in effect April 1, 2024. For dates beginning October 1, 22    2024 and through September 30, 2025, the denominator for 23    the staffing percentage shall be the lesser of the 24    facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target and:25            (A) For the quarter beginning October 1, 2024, the 26        sum of 20% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing   SB1606- 5 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1        Target and 80% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 2        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 3        the January 2024 federal staffing report).4            (B) For the quarter beginning January 1, 2025, the 5        sum of 40% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 6        Target and 60% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 7        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 8        the January 2024 federal staffing report).9            (C) For the quarter beginning March 1, 2025, the 10        sum of 60% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 11        Target and 40% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 12        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 13        the January 2024 federal staffing report).14            (D) For the quarter beginning July 1, 2025, the 15        sum of 80% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 16        Target and 20% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 17        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 18        the January 2024 federal staffing report). 19         Facilities with at least 70% of the staffing 20    indicated by the STRIVE study shall be paid a per diem 21    add-on of $9, increasing by equivalent steps for each 22    whole percentage point until the facilities reach a per 23    diem of $16.52. Facilities with at least 80% of the 24    staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall be paid a per 25    diem add-on of $16.52, increasing by equivalent steps for 26    each whole percentage point until the facilities reach a   SB1606- 6 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1    per diem add-on of $25.77.

Facilities 21    designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 22    Services as a special focus facility or a hospital-based 23    nursing home do not qualify for quality payments.24            (A) Each quality pool must be distributed by 25        assigning a quality weighted score for each nursing 26        home which is calculated by multiplying the nursing   SB1606- 16 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1        home's quality base period Medicaid days by the 2        nursing home's star rating weight in that period.3            (B) Star rating weights are assigned based on the 4        nursing home's star rating for the LTS quality star 5        rating. As used in this subparagraph, "LTS quality 6        star rating" means the long-term stay quality rating 7        for each nursing facility, as assigned by the Centers 8        for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the Five-Star 9        Quality Rating System. The rating is a number ranging 10        from 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest).11                (i) Zero-star or one-star rating has a weight 12            of 0.13                (ii) Two-star rating has a weight of 0.75.14                (iii) Three-star rating has a weight of 1.5. 15                (iv) Four-star rating has a weight of 2.5.16                (v) Five-star rating has a weight of 3.5.17            (C) Each nursing home's quality weight score is 18        divided by the sum of all quality weight scores for 19        qualifying nursing homes to determine the proportion 20        of the quality pool to be paid to the nursing home. 21            (D) The quality pool is no less than $70,000,000 22        annually or $17,500,000 per quarter. The Department 23        shall publish on its website the estimated payments 24        and the associated weights for each facility 45 days 25        prior to when the initial payments for the quarter are 26        to be paid. The Department shall assign each facility   SB1606- 17 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1        the most recent and applicable quarter's STAR value 2        unless the facility notifies the Department within 15 3        days of an issue and the facility provides reasonable 4        evidence demonstrating its timely compliance with 5        federal data submission requirements for the quarter 6        of record. If such evidence cannot be provided to the 7        Department, the STAR rating assigned to the facility 8        shall be reduced by one from the prior quarter. 9            (E) The Department shall review quality metrics 10        used for payment of the quality pool and make 11        recommendations for any associated changes to the 12        methodology for distributing quality pool payments in 13        consultation with associations representing long-term 14        care providers, consumer advocates, organizations 15        representing workers of long-term care facilities, and 16        payors. The Department may establish, by rule, changes 17        to the methodology for distributing quality pool 18        payments. 19            (F) The Department shall disburse quality pool 20        payments from the Long-Term Care Provider Fund on a 21        monthly basis in amounts proportional to the total 22        quality pool payment determined for the quarter. 23            (G) The Department shall publish any changes in 24        the methodology for distributing quality pool payments 25        prior to the beginning of the measurement period or 26        quality base period for any metric added to the   SB1606- 18 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1        distribution's methodology. 2        (2) Payments based on CNA tenure, promotion, and CNA 3    training for the purpose of increasing CNA compensation. 4    It is the intent of this subsection that payments made in 5    accordance with this paragraph be directly incorporated 6    into increased compensation for CNAs. As used in this 7    paragraph, "CNA" means a certified nursing assistant as 8    that term is described in Section 3-206 of the Nursing 9    Home Care Act, Section 3-206 of the ID/DD Community Care 10    Act, and Section 3-206 of the MC/DD Act. The Department 11    shall establish, by rule, payments to nursing facilities 12    equal to Medicaid's share of the tenure wage increments 13    specified in this paragraph for all reported CNA employee 14    hours compensated according to a posted schedule 15    consisting of increments at least as large as those 16    specified in this paragraph. The increments are as 17    follows: an additional $1.50 per hour for CNAs with at 18    least one and less than 2 years' experience plus another 19    $1 per hour for each additional year of experience up to a 20    maximum of $6.50 for CNAs with at least 6 years of 21    experience. For purposes of this paragraph, Medicaid's 22    share shall be the ratio determined by paid Medicaid bed 23    days divided by total bed days for the applicable time 24    period used in the calculation. In addition, and additive 25    to any tenure increments paid as specified in this 26    paragraph, the Department shall establish, by rule,   SB1606- 19 -LRB104 10490 KTG 20565 b1    payments supporting Medicaid's share of the 2    promotion-based wage increments for CNA employee hours 3    compensated for that promotion with at least a $1.50 4    hourly increase. Medicaid's share shall be established as 5    it is for the tenure increments described in this 6    paragraph. Qualifying promotions shall be defined by the 7    Department in rules for an expected 10-15% subset of CNAs 8    assigned intermediate, specialized, or added roles such as 9    CNA trainers, CNA scheduling "captains", and CNA 10    specialists for resident conditions like dementia or 11    memory care or behavioral health.12    (m) The Department shall work with nursing facility 13industry representatives to design policies and procedures to 14permit facilities to address the integrity of data from 15federal reporting sites used by the Department in setting 16facility rates. 17(Source: P.A. 102-77, eff. 7-9-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 18102-1035, eff. 5-31-22; 102-1118, eff. 1-18-23; 103-102, 19Article 40, Section 40-5, eff. 1-1-24; 103-102, Article 50, 20Section 50-5, eff. 1-1-24; 103-593, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 217-1-24.) 22    Section 99.
