The School Code is amended by changing Section 524-12 as follows: 6    (105 ILCS 5/24-12)7    Sec. 24-12. Removal or dismissal of teachers in 8contractual continued service. 9    (a) This subsection (a) applies only to honorable 10dismissals and recalls in which the notice of dismissal is 11provided on or before the end of the 2010-2011 school term. If 12a teacher in contractual continued service is removed or 13dismissed as a result of a decision of the board to decrease 14the number of teachers employed by the board or to discontinue 15some particular type of teaching service, written notice shall 16be mailed to the teacher and also given the teacher either by 17certified mail, return receipt requested or personal delivery 18with receipt at least 60 days before the end of the school 19term, together with a statement of honorable dismissal and the 20reason therefor, and in all such cases the board shall first 21remove or dismiss all teachers who have not entered upon 22contractual continued service before removing or dismissing 23any teacher who has entered upon contractual continued service   HB2970- 2 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1and who is legally qualified to hold a position currently held 2by a teacher who has not entered upon contractual continued 3service. 4    As between teachers who have entered upon contractual 5continued service, the teacher or teachers with the shorter 6length of continuing service with the district shall be 7dismissed first unless an alternative method of determining 8the sequence of dismissal is established in a collective 9bargaining agreement or contract between the board and a 10professional faculty members' organization and except that 11this provision shall not impair the operation of any 12affirmative action program in the district, regardless of 13whether it exists by operation of law or is conducted on a 14voluntary basis by the board. Any teacher dismissed as a 15result of such decrease or discontinuance shall be paid all 16earned compensation on or before the third business day 17following the last day of pupil attendance in the regular 18school term. 19    If the board has any vacancies for the following school 20term or within one calendar year from the beginning of the 21following school term, the positions thereby becoming 22available shall be tendered to the teachers so removed or 23dismissed so far as they are legally qualified to hold such 24positions; provided, however, that if the number of honorable 25dismissal notices based on economic necessity exceeds 15% of 26the number of full-time equivalent positions filled by   HB2970- 3 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1certified employees (excluding principals and administrative 2personnel) during the preceding school year, then if the board 3has any vacancies for the following school term or within 2 4calendar years from the beginning of the following school 5term, the positions so becoming available shall be tendered to 6the teachers who were so notified and removed or dismissed 7whenever they are legally qualified to hold such positions. 8Each board shall, in consultation with any exclusive employee 9representatives, each year establish a list, categorized by 10positions, showing the length of continuing service of each 11teacher who is qualified to hold any such positions, unless an 12alternative method of determining a sequence of dismissal is 13established as provided for in this Section, in which case a 14list shall be made in accordance with the alternative method. 15Copies of the list shall be distributed to the exclusive 16employee representative on or before February 1 of each year. 17Whenever the number of honorable dismissal notices based upon 18economic necessity exceeds 5, or 150% of the average number of 19teachers honorably dismissed in the preceding 3 years, 20whichever is more, then the board also shall hold a public 21hearing on the question of the dismissals. Following the 22hearing and board review, the action to approve any such 23reduction shall require a majority vote of the board members.24    (b) If any teacher, whether or not in contractual 25continued service, is removed or dismissed as a result of a 26decision of a school board to decrease the number of teachers   HB2970- 4 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1employed by the board, a decision of a school board to 2discontinue some particular type of teaching service, or a 3reduction in the number of programs or positions in a special 4education joint agreement, then written notice must be mailed 5to the teacher and also given to the teacher either by 6electronic mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, or 7personal delivery with receipt on or before April 15, together 8with a statement of honorable dismissal and the reason 9therefor, and in all such cases the sequence of dismissal 10shall occur in accordance with this subsection (b); except 11that this subsection (b) shall not impair the operation of any 12affirmative action program in the school district, regardless 13of whether it exists by operation of law or is conducted on a 14voluntary basis by the board.15    Each teacher must be categorized into one or more 16positions for which the teacher is qualified to hold, based 17upon legal qualifications and any other qualifications 18established in a district or joint agreement job description, 19on or before the May 10 prior to the school year during which 20the sequence of dismissal is determined. Within each position 21and subject to agreements made by the joint committee on 22honorable dismissals that are authorized by subsection (c) of 23this Section, the school district or joint agreement must 24establish 4 groupings of teachers qualified to hold the 25position as follows:26        (1) Grouping one shall consist of each teacher who is   HB2970- 5 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    not in contractual continued service and who (i) has not 2    received a performance evaluation rating, (ii) is employed 3    for one school term or less to replace a teacher on leave, 4    or (iii) is employed on a part-time basis. "Part-time 5    basis" for the purposes of this subsection (b) means a 6    teacher who is employed to teach less than a full-day, 7    teacher workload or less than 5 days of the normal student 8    attendance week, unless otherwise provided for in a 9    collective bargaining agreement between the district and 10    the exclusive representative of the district's teachers. 11    For the purposes of this Section, a teacher (A) who is 12    employed as a full-time teacher but who actually teaches 13    or is otherwise present and participating in the 14    district's educational program for less than a school term 15    or (B) who, in the immediately previous school term, was 16    employed on a full-time basis and actually taught or was 17    otherwise present and participated in the district's 18    educational program for 120 days or more is not considered 19    employed on a part-time basis.20        (2) Grouping 2 shall consist of each teacher with a 21    Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory performance evaluation 22    rating on either of the teacher's last 2 performance 23    evaluation ratings.24        (3) Grouping 3 shall consist of each teacher with a 25    performance evaluation rating of at least Satisfactory or 26    Proficient on both of the teacher's last 2 performance   HB2970- 6 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    evaluation ratings, if 2 ratings are available, or on the 2    teacher's last performance evaluation rating, if only one 3    rating is available, unless the teacher qualifies for 4    placement into grouping 4.5        (4) Grouping 4 shall consist of each teacher whose 6    last 2 performance evaluation ratings are Excellent and 7    each teacher with 2 Excellent performance evaluation 8    ratings out of the teacher's last 3 performance evaluation 9    ratings with a third rating of Satisfactory or Proficient.10    Among teachers qualified to hold a position, teachers must 11be dismissed in the order of their groupings, with teachers in 12grouping one dismissed first and teachers in grouping 4 13dismissed last.14    Within grouping one, the sequence of dismissal must be at 15the discretion of the school district or joint agreement. 16Within grouping 2, the sequence of dismissal must be based 17upon average performance evaluation ratings, with the teacher 18or teachers with the lowest average performance evaluation 19rating dismissed first. A teacher's average performance 20evaluation rating must be calculated using the average of the 21teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings, if 2 ratings 22are available, or the teacher's last performance evaluation 23rating, if only one rating is available, using the following 24numerical values: 4 for Excellent; 3 for Proficient or 25Satisfactory; 2 for Needs Improvement; and 1 for 26Unsatisfactory. As between or among teachers in grouping 2   HB2970- 7 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1with the same average performance evaluation rating and within 2each of groupings 3 and 4, the teacher or teachers with the 3shorter length of continuing service with the school district 4or joint agreement must be dismissed first unless an 5alternative method of determining the sequence of dismissal is 6established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract 7between the board and a professional faculty members' 8organization.9    Each board, including the governing board of a joint 10agreement, shall, in consultation with any exclusive employee 11representatives, each year establish a sequence of honorable 12dismissal list categorized by positions and the groupings 13defined in this subsection (b). Copies of the list showing 14each teacher by name, along with the race or ethnicity of the 15teacher if provided by the teacher, and categorized by 16positions and the groupings defined in this subsection (b) 17must be distributed to the exclusive bargaining representative 18at least 75 days before the end of the school term, provided 19that the school district or joint agreement may, with notice 20to any exclusive employee representatives, move teachers from 21grouping one into another grouping during the period of time 22from 75 days until April 15. Each year, each board shall also 23establish, in consultation with any exclusive employee 24representatives, a list showing the length of continuing 25service of each teacher who is qualified to hold any such 26positions, unless an alternative method of determining a   HB2970- 8 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1sequence of dismissal is established as provided for in this 2Section, in which case a list must be made in accordance with 3the alternative method. Copies of the list must be distributed 4to the exclusive employee representative at least 75 days 5before the end of the school term. 6    Any teacher dismissed as a result of such decrease or 7discontinuance must be paid all earned compensation on or 8before the third business day following the last day of pupil 9attendance in the regular school term.10    If the board or joint agreement has any vacancies for the 11following school term or within one calendar year from the 12beginning of the following school term, the positions thereby 13becoming available must be tendered to the teachers so removed 14or dismissed who were in grouping 3 or 4 of the sequence of 15dismissal and are qualified to hold the positions, based upon 16legal qualifications and any other qualifications established 17in a district or joint agreement job description, on or before 18the May 10 prior to the date of the positions becoming 19available, provided that if the number of honorable dismissal 20notices based on economic necessity exceeds 15% of the number 21of full-time equivalent positions filled by certified 22employees (excluding principals and administrative personnel) 23during the preceding school year, then the recall period is 24for the following school term or within 2 calendar years from 25the beginning of the following school term. If the board or 26joint agreement has any vacancies within the period from the   HB2970- 9 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1beginning of the following school term through February 1 of 2the following school term (unless a date later than February 31, but no later than 6 months from the beginning of the 4following school term, is established in a collective 5bargaining agreement), the positions thereby becoming 6available must be tendered to the teachers so removed or 7dismissed who were in grouping 2 of the sequence of dismissal 8due to one "needs improvement" rating on either of the 9teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings, provided 10that, if 2 ratings are available, the other performance 11evaluation rating used for grouping purposes is 12"satisfactory", "proficient", or "excellent", and are 13qualified to hold the positions, based upon legal 14qualifications and any other qualifications established in a 15district or joint agreement job description, on or before the 16May 10 prior to the date of the positions becoming available. 17On and after July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1898-648), the preceding sentence shall apply to teachers 19removed or dismissed by honorable dismissal, even if notice of 20honorable dismissal occurred during the 2013-2014 school year. 21Among teachers eligible for recall pursuant to the preceding 22sentence, the order of recall must be in inverse order of 23dismissal, unless an alternative order of recall is 24established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract 25between the board and a professional faculty members' 26organization. Whenever the number of honorable dismissal   HB2970- 10 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1notices based upon economic necessity exceeds 5 notices or 2150% of the average number of teachers honorably dismissed in 3the preceding 3 years, whichever is more, then the school 4board or governing board of a joint agreement, as applicable, 5shall also hold a public hearing on the question of the 6dismissals. Following the hearing and board review, the action 7to approve any such reduction shall require a majority vote of 8the board members.9    For purposes of this subsection (b), subject to agreement 10on an alternative definition reached by the joint committee 11described in subsection (c) of this Section, a teacher's 12performance evaluation rating means the overall performance 13evaluation rating resulting from an annual or biennial 14performance evaluation conducted pursuant to Article 24A of 15this Code by the school district or joint agreement 16determining the sequence of dismissal, not including any 17performance evaluation conducted during or at the end of a 18remediation period. No more than one evaluation rating each 19school term shall be one of the evaluation ratings used for the 20purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. Except as 21otherwise provided in this subsection for any performance 22evaluations conducted during or at the end of a remediation 23period, if multiple performance evaluations are conducted in a 24school term, only the rating from the last evaluation 25conducted prior to establishing the sequence of honorable 26dismissal list in such school term shall be the one evaluation   HB2970- 11 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1rating from that school term used for the purpose of 2determining the sequence of dismissal. Averaging ratings from 3multiple evaluations is not permitted unless otherwise agreed 4to in a collective bargaining agreement or contract between 5the board and a professional faculty members' organization. 6The preceding 3 sentences are not a legislative declaration 7that existing law does or does not already require that only 8one performance evaluation each school term shall be used for 9the purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. For 10performance evaluation ratings determined prior to September 111, 2012, any school district or joint agreement with a 12performance evaluation rating system that does not use either 13of the rating category systems specified in subsection (d) of 14Section 24A-5 of this Code for all teachers must establish a 15basis for assigning each teacher a rating that complies with 16subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code for all of the 17performance evaluation ratings that are to be used to 18determine the sequence of dismissal. A teacher's grouping and 19ranking on a sequence of honorable dismissal shall be deemed a 20part of the teacher's performance evaluation, and that 21information shall be disclosed to the exclusive bargaining 22representative as part of a sequence of honorable dismissal 23list, notwithstanding any laws prohibiting disclosure of such 24information. A performance evaluation rating may be used to 25determine the sequence of dismissal, notwithstanding the 26pendency of any grievance resolution or arbitration procedures   HB2970- 12 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1relating to the performance evaluation. If a teacher has 2received at least one performance evaluation rating conducted 3by the school district or joint agreement determining the 4sequence of dismissal and a subsequent performance evaluation 5is not conducted in any school year in which such evaluation is 6required to be conducted under Section 24A-5 of this Code, the 7teacher's performance evaluation rating for that school year 8for purposes of determining the sequence of dismissal is 9deemed Proficient, except that, during any time in which the 10Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health 11emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency 12Management Agency Act, this default to Proficient does not 13apply to any teacher who has entered into contractual 14continued service and who was deemed Excellent on his or her 15most recent evaluation. During any time in which the Governor 16has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency 17pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 18Agency Act and unless the school board and any exclusive 19bargaining representative have completed the performance 20rating for teachers or have mutually agreed to an alternate 21performance rating, any teacher who has entered into 22contractual continued service, whose most recent evaluation 23was deemed Excellent, and whose performance evaluation is not 24conducted when the evaluation is required to be conducted 25shall receive a teacher's performance rating deemed Excellent. 26A school board and any exclusive bargaining representative may   HB2970- 13 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1mutually agree to an alternate performance rating for teachers 2not in contractual continued service during any time in which 3the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health 4emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency 5Management Agency Act, as long as the agreement is in writing. 6If a performance evaluation rating is nullified as the result 7of an arbitration, administrative agency, or court 8determination, then the school district or joint agreement is 9deemed to have conducted a performance evaluation for that 10school year, but the performance evaluation rating may not be 11used in determining the sequence of dismissal.12    Nothing in this subsection (b) shall be construed as 13limiting the right of a school board or governing board of a 14joint agreement to dismiss a teacher not in contractual 15continued service in accordance with Section 24-11 of this 16Code.17    Any provisions regarding the sequence of honorable 18dismissals and recall of honorably dismissed teachers in a 19collective bargaining agreement entered into on or before 20January 1, 2011 and in effect on June 13, 2011 (the effective 21date of Public Act 97-8) that may conflict with Public Act 97-8 22shall remain in effect through the expiration of such 23agreement or June 30, 2013, whichever is earlier.24    (c) Each school district and special education joint 25agreement must use a joint committee composed of equal 26representation selected by the school board and its teachers   HB2970- 14 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1or, if applicable, the exclusive bargaining representative of 2its teachers, to address the matters described in paragraphs 3(1) through (5) of this subsection (c) pertaining to honorable 4dismissals under subsection (b) of this Section.5        (1) The joint committee must consider and may agree to 6    criteria for excluding from grouping 2 and placing into 7    grouping 3 a teacher whose last 2 performance evaluations 8    include a Needs Improvement and either a Proficient or 9    Excellent.10        (2) The joint committee must consider and may agree to 11    an alternative definition for grouping 4, which definition 12    must take into account prior performance evaluation 13    ratings and may take into account other factors that 14    relate to the school district's or program's educational 15    objectives. An alternative definition for grouping 4 may 16    not permit the inclusion of a teacher in the grouping with 17    a Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory performance 18    evaluation rating on either of the teacher's last 2 19    performance evaluation ratings.20        (3) The joint committee may agree to including within 21    the definition of a performance evaluation rating a 22    performance evaluation rating administered by a school 23    district or joint agreement other than the school district 24    or joint agreement determining the sequence of dismissal.25        (4) For each school district or joint agreement that 26    administers performance evaluation ratings that are   HB2970- 15 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    inconsistent with either of the rating category systems 2    specified in subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code, 3    the school district or joint agreement must consult with 4    the joint committee on the basis for assigning a rating 5    that complies with subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this 6    Code to each performance evaluation rating that will be 7    used in a sequence of dismissal.8        (5) Upon request by a joint committee member submitted 9    to the employing board by no later than 10 days after the 10    distribution of the sequence of honorable dismissal list, 11    a representative of the employing board shall, within 5 12    days after the request, provide to members of the joint 13    committee a list showing the most recent and prior 14    performance evaluation ratings of each teacher identified 15    only by length of continuing service in the district or 16    joint agreement and not by name. If, after review of this 17    list, a member of the joint committee has a good faith 18    belief that a disproportionate number of teachers with 19    greater length of continuing service with the district or 20    joint agreement have received a recent performance 21    evaluation rating lower than the prior rating, the member 22    may request that the joint committee review the list to 23    assess whether such a trend may exist. Following the joint 24    committee's review, but by no later than the end of the 25    applicable school term, the joint committee or any member 26    or members of the joint committee may submit a report of   HB2970- 16 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    the review to the employing board and exclusive bargaining 2    representative, if any. Nothing in this paragraph (5) 3    shall impact the order of honorable dismissal or a school 4    district's or joint agreement's authority to carry out a 5    dismissal in accordance with subsection (b) of this 6    Section.7    Agreement by the joint committee as to a matter requires 8the majority vote of all committee members, and if the joint 9committee does not reach agreement on a matter, then the 10otherwise applicable requirements of subsection (b) of this 11Section shall apply. Except as explicitly set forth in this 12subsection (c), a joint committee has no authority to agree to 13any further modifications to the requirements for honorable 14dismissals set forth in subsection (b) of this Section. The 15joint committee must be established, and the first meeting of 16the joint committee each school year must occur on or before 17December 1.18    The joint committee must reach agreement on a matter on or 19before February 1 of a school year in order for the agreement 20of the joint committee to apply to the sequence of dismissal 21determined during that school year. Subject to the February 1 22deadline for agreements, the agreement of a joint committee on 23a matter shall apply to the sequence of dismissal until the 24agreement is amended or terminated by the joint committee. 25    The provisions of the Open Meetings Act shall not apply to 26meetings of a joint committee created under this subsection   HB2970- 17 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1(c). 2    (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 3subsection (d), the requirements and dismissal procedures of 4Section 24-16.5 of this Code shall apply to any dismissal 5sought under Section 24-16.5 of this Code.6        (1) If a dismissal of a teacher in contractual 7    continued service is sought for any reason or cause other 8    than an honorable dismissal under subsections (a) or (b) 9    of this Section or a dismissal sought under Section 10    24-16.5 of this Code, including those under Section 11    10-22.4, the board must first approve a motion containing 12    specific charges by a majority vote of all its members. 13    Written notice of such charges, including a bill of 14    particulars and the teacher's right to request a hearing, 15    must be mailed to the teacher and also given to the teacher 16    either by electronic mail, certified mail, return receipt 17    requested, or personal delivery with receipt within 5 days 18    of the adoption of the motion. Any written notice sent on 19    or after July 1, 2012 shall inform the teacher of the right 20    to request a hearing before a mutually selected hearing 21    officer, with the cost of the hearing officer split 22    equally between the teacher and the board, or a hearing 23    before a board-selected hearing officer, with the cost of 24    the hearing officer paid by the board.25        Before setting a hearing on charges stemming from 26    causes that are considered remediable, a board must give   HB2970- 18 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    the teacher reasonable warning in writing, stating 2    specifically the causes that, if not removed, may result 3    in charges; however, no such written warning is required 4    if the causes have been the subject of a remediation plan 5    pursuant to Article 24A of this Code. The teacher may 6    grieve the issuance of such warning pursuant to the 7    applicable collective bargaining agreement to determine 8    whether the school district had just cause in issuing the 9    warning. Notice of remedial warnings must narrowly specify 10    the nature of the alleged misconduct that needs to be 11    remedied. General allegations of unprofessional conduct, 12    or similar phrases, are insufficient to link together 13    otherwise unrelated offenses as related. Under no 14    circumstances shall a notice of remedial warning remain 15    effective or within a teacher's personnel file or record 16    for longer than 3 years from the date of the occurrence 17    which gave rise to the issuance of the notice of remedial 18    warning. 19        If, in the opinion of the board, the interests of the 20    school require it, the board may suspend the teacher 21    without pay, pending the hearing, but if the board's 22    dismissal or removal is not sustained, the teacher shall 23    not suffer the loss of any salary or benefits by reason of 24    the suspension.25        (2) No hearing upon the charges is required unless the 26    teacher within 17 days after receiving notice requests in   HB2970- 19 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    writing of the board that a hearing be scheduled before a 2    mutually selected hearing officer or a hearing officer 3    selected by the board. The secretary of the school board 4    shall forward a copy of the notice to the State Board of 5    Education.6        (3) Within 5 business days after receiving a notice of 7    hearing in which either notice to the teacher was sent 8    before July 1, 2012 or, if the notice was sent on or after 9    July 1, 2012, the teacher has requested a hearing before a 10    mutually selected hearing officer, the State Board of 11    Education shall provide a list of 5 prospective, impartial 12    hearing officers from the master list of qualified, 13    impartial hearing officers maintained by the State Board 14    of Education. Each person on the master list must (i) be 15    accredited by a national arbitration organization and have 16    had a minimum of 5 years of experience directly related to 17    labor and employment relations matters between employers 18    and employees or their exclusive bargaining 19    representatives and (ii) beginning September 1, 2012, have 20    participated in training provided or approved by the State 21    Board of Education for teacher dismissal hearing officers 22    so that he or she is familiar with issues generally 23    involved in evaluative and non-evaluative dismissals.24        If notice to the teacher was sent before July 1, 2012 25    or, if the notice was sent on or after July 1, 2012, the 26    teacher has requested a hearing before a mutually selected   HB2970- 20 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    hearing officer, the board and the teacher or their legal 2    representatives within 3 business days shall alternately 3    strike one name from the list provided by the State Board 4    of Education until only one name remains. Unless waived by 5    the teacher, the teacher shall have the right to proceed 6    first with the striking. Within 3 business days of receipt 7    of the list provided by the State Board of Education, the 8    board and the teacher or their legal representatives shall 9    each have the right to reject all prospective hearing 10    officers named on the list and notify the State Board of 11    Education of such rejection. Within 3 business days after 12    receiving this notification, the State Board of Education 13    shall appoint a qualified person from the master list who 14    did not appear on the list sent to the parties to serve as 15    the hearing officer, unless the parties notify it that 16    they have chosen to alternatively select a hearing officer 17    under paragraph (4) of this subsection (d).18        If the teacher has requested a hearing before a 19    hearing officer selected by the board, the board shall 20    select one name from the master list of qualified 21    impartial hearing officers maintained by the State Board 22    of Education within 3 business days after receipt and 23    shall notify the State Board of Education of its 24    selection.25        A hearing officer mutually selected by the parties, 26    selected by the board, or selected through an alternative   HB2970- 21 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    selection process under paragraph (4) of this subsection 2    (d) (A) must not be a resident of the school district, (B) 3    must be available to commence the hearing within 75 days 4    and conclude the hearing within 120 days after being 5    selected as the hearing officer, and (C) must issue a 6    decision as to whether the teacher must be dismissed and 7    give a copy of that decision to both the teacher and the 8    board within 30 days from the conclusion of the hearing or 9    closure of the record, whichever is later.10        Any hearing convened during a public health emergency 11    pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 12    Agency Act may be convened remotely. Any hearing officer 13    for a hearing convened during a public health emergency 14    pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 15    Agency Act may voluntarily withdraw from the hearing and 16    another hearing officer shall be selected or appointed 17    pursuant to this Section. 18        In this paragraph, "pre-hearing procedures" refers to 19    the pre-hearing procedures under Section 51.55 of Title 23 20    of the Illinois Administrative Code and "hearing" refers 21    to the hearing under Section 51.60 of Title 23 of the 22    Illinois Administrative Code. Any teacher who has been 23    charged with engaging in acts of corporal punishment, 24    physical abuse, grooming, or sexual misconduct and who 25    previously paused pre-hearing procedures or a hearing 26    pursuant to Public Act 101-643 must proceed with selection   HB2970- 22 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    of a hearing officer or hearing date, or both, within the 2    timeframes established by this paragraph (3) and 3    paragraphs (4) through (6) of this subsection (d), unless 4    the timeframes are mutually waived in writing by both 5    parties, and all timelines set forth in this Section in 6    cases concerning corporal punishment, physical abuse, 7    grooming, or sexual misconduct shall be reset to begin the 8    day after April 22, 2022 (the effective date of Public Act 9    102-708). Any teacher charged with engaging in acts of 10    corporal punishment, physical abuse, grooming, or sexual 11    misconduct on or after April 22, 2022 (the effective date 12    of Public Act 102-708) may not pause pre-hearing 13    procedures or a hearing.14        (4) In the alternative to selecting a hearing officer 15    from the list received from the State Board of Education 16    or accepting the appointment of a hearing officer by the 17    State Board of Education or if the State Board of 18    Education cannot provide a list or appoint a hearing 19    officer that meets the foregoing requirements, the board 20    and the teacher or their legal representatives may 21    mutually agree to select an impartial hearing officer who 22    is not on the master list either by direct appointment by 23    the parties or by using procedures for the appointment of 24    an arbitrator established by the Federal Mediation and 25    Conciliation Service or the American Arbitration 26    Association. The parties shall notify the State Board of   HB2970- 23 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    Education of their intent to select a hearing officer 2    using an alternative procedure within 3 business days of 3    receipt of a list of prospective hearing officers provided 4    by the State Board of Education, notice of appointment of 5    a hearing officer by the State Board of Education, or 6    receipt of notice from the State Board of Education that 7    it cannot provide a list that meets the foregoing 8    requirements, whichever is later. 9        (5) If the notice of dismissal was sent to the teacher 10    before July 1, 2012, the fees and costs for the hearing 11    officer must be paid by the State Board of Education. If 12    the notice of dismissal was sent to the teacher on or after 13    July 1, 2012, the hearing officer's fees and costs must be 14    paid as follows in this paragraph (5). The fees and 15    permissible costs for the hearing officer must be 16    determined by the State Board of Education. If the board 17    and the teacher or their legal representatives mutually 18    agree to select an impartial hearing officer who is not on 19    a list received from the State Board of Education, they 20    may agree to supplement the fees determined by the State 21    Board to the hearing officer, at a rate consistent with 22    the hearing officer's published professional fees. If the 23    hearing officer is mutually selected by the parties, then 24    the board and the teacher or their legal representatives 25    shall each pay 50% of the fees and costs and any 26    supplemental allowance to which they agree. If the hearing   HB2970- 24 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    officer is selected by the board, then the board shall pay 2    100% of the hearing officer's fees and costs. The fees and 3    costs must be paid to the hearing officer within 14 days 4    after the board and the teacher or their legal 5    representatives receive the hearing officer's decision set 6    forth in paragraph (7) of this subsection (d).7        (6) The teacher is required to answer the bill of 8    particulars and aver affirmative matters in his or her 9    defense, and the time for initially doing so and the time 10    for updating such answer and defenses after pre-hearing 11    discovery must be set by the hearing officer. The State 12    Board of Education shall promulgate rules so that each 13    party has a fair opportunity to present its case and to 14    ensure that the dismissal process proceeds in a fair and 15    expeditious manner. These rules shall address, without 16    limitation, discovery and hearing scheduling conferences; 17    the teacher's initial answer and affirmative defenses to 18    the bill of particulars and the updating of that 19    information after pre-hearing discovery; provision for 20    written interrogatories and requests for production of 21    documents; the requirement that each party initially 22    disclose to the other party and then update the disclosure 23    no later than 10 calendar days prior to the commencement 24    of the hearing, the names and addresses of persons who may 25    be called as witnesses at the hearing, a summary of the 26    facts or opinions each witness will testify to, and all   HB2970- 25 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    other documents and materials, including information 2    maintained electronically, relevant to its own as well as 3    the other party's case (the hearing officer may exclude 4    witnesses and exhibits not identified and shared, except 5    those offered in rebuttal for which the party could not 6    reasonably have anticipated prior to the hearing); 7    pre-hearing discovery and preparation, including provision 8    for written interrogatories and requests for production of 9    documents, provided that discovery depositions are 10    prohibited; the conduct of the hearing; the right of each 11    party to be represented by counsel, the offer of evidence 12    and witnesses and the cross-examination of witnesses; the 13    authority of the hearing officer to issue subpoenas and 14    subpoenas duces tecum, provided that the hearing officer 15    may limit the number of witnesses to be subpoenaed on 16    behalf of each party to no more than 7; the length of 17    post-hearing briefs; and the form, length, and content of 18    hearing officers' decisions. The hearing officer shall 19    hold a hearing and render a final decision for dismissal 20    pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or shall report to the 21    school board findings of fact and a recommendation as to 22    whether or not the teacher must be dismissed for conduct. 23    The hearing officer shall commence the hearing within 75 24    days and conclude the hearing within 120 days after being 25    selected as the hearing officer, provided that the hearing 26    officer may modify these timelines upon the showing of   HB2970- 26 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    good cause or mutual agreement of the parties. Good cause 2    for the purpose of this subsection (d) shall mean the 3    illness or otherwise unavoidable emergency of the teacher, 4    district representative, their legal representatives, the 5    hearing officer, or an essential witness as indicated in 6    each party's pre-hearing submission. In a dismissal 7    hearing pursuant to Article 24A of this Code in which a 8    witness is a student or is under the age of 18, the hearing 9    officer must make accommodations for the witness, as 10    provided under paragraph (6.5) of this subsection. The 11    hearing officer shall consider and give weight to all of 12    the teacher's evaluations written pursuant to Article 24A 13    that are relevant to the issues in the hearing.14        Each party shall have no more than 3 days to present 15    its case, unless extended by the hearing officer to enable 16    a party to present adequate evidence and testimony, 17    including due to the other party's cross-examination of 18    the party's witnesses, for good cause or by mutual 19    agreement of the parties. The State Board of Education 20    shall define in rules the meaning of "day" for such 21    purposes. All testimony at the hearing shall be taken 22    under oath administered by the hearing officer. The 23    hearing officer shall cause a record of the proceedings to 24    be kept and shall employ a competent reporter to take 25    stenographic or stenotype notes of all the testimony. The 26    costs of the reporter's attendance and services at the   HB2970- 27 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    hearing shall be paid by the party or parties who are 2    responsible for paying the fees and costs of the hearing 3    officer. Either party desiring a transcript of the hearing 4    shall pay for the cost thereof. Any post-hearing briefs 5    must be submitted by the parties by no later than 21 days 6    after a party's receipt of the transcript of the hearing, 7    unless extended by the hearing officer for good cause or 8    by mutual agreement of the parties.9        (6.5) In the case of charges involving any witness who 10    is or was at the time of the alleged conduct a student or a 11    person under the age of 18, the hearing officer shall make 12    accommodations to protect a witness from being 13    intimidated, traumatized, or re-traumatized. No alleged 14    victim or other witness who is or was at the time of the 15    alleged conduct a student or under the age of 18 may be 16    compelled to testify in the physical or visual presence of 17    a teacher or other witness. If such a witness invokes this 18    right, then the hearing officer must provide an 19    accommodation consistent with the invoked right and use a 20    procedure by which each party may hear such witness's 21    testimony. Accommodations may include, but are not limited 22    to: (i) testimony made via a telecommunication device in a 23    location other than the hearing room and outside the 24    physical or visual presence of the teacher and other 25    hearing participants, but accessible to the teacher via a 26    telecommunication device, (ii) testimony made in the   HB2970- 28 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    hearing room but outside the physical presence of the 2    teacher and accessible to the teacher via a 3    telecommunication device, (iii) non-public testimony, (iv) 4    testimony made via videoconference with the cameras and 5    microphones of the teacher turned off, or (v) pre-recorded 6    testimony, including, but not limited to, a recording of a 7    forensic interview conducted at an accredited Children's 8    Advocacy Center. With all accommodations, the hearing 9    officer shall give such testimony the same consideration 10    as if the witness testified without the accommodation. The 11    teacher may not directly, or through a representative, 12    question a witness called by the school board who is or was 13    a student or under 18 years of age at the time of the 14    alleged conduct. The hearing officer must permit the 15    teacher to submit all relevant questions and follow-up 16    questions for such a witness to have the questions posed 17    by the hearing officer. All questions must exclude 18    evidence of the witness' sexual behavior or 19    predisposition, unless the evidence is offered to prove 20    that someone other than the teacher subject to the 21    dismissal hearing engaged in the charge at issue. 22        (7) The hearing officer shall, within 30 days from the 23    conclusion of the hearing or closure of the record, 24    whichever is later, make a decision as to whether or not 25    the teacher shall be dismissed pursuant to Article 24A of 26    this Code or report to the school board findings of fact   HB2970- 29 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    and a recommendation as to whether or not the teacher 2    shall be dismissed for cause and shall give a copy of the 3    decision or findings of fact and recommendation to both 4    the teacher and the school board. If a hearing officer 5    fails without good cause, specifically provided in writing 6    to both parties and the State Board of Education, to 7    render a decision or findings of fact and recommendation 8    within 30 days after the hearing is concluded or the 9    record is closed, whichever is later, the parties may 10    mutually agree to select a hearing officer pursuant to the 11    alternative procedure, as provided in this Section, to 12    rehear the charges heard by the hearing officer who failed 13    to render a decision or findings of fact and 14    recommendation or to review the record and render a 15    decision. If any hearing officer fails without good cause, 16    specifically provided in writing to both parties and the 17    State Board of Education, to render a decision or findings 18    of fact and recommendation within 30 days after the 19    hearing is concluded or the record is closed, whichever is 20    later, or if any hearing officer fails to make an 21    accommodation as described in paragraph (6.5), the hearing 22    officer shall be removed from the master list of hearing 23    officers maintained by the State Board of Education for 24    not more than 24 months. The parties and the State Board of 25    Education may also take such other actions as it deems 26    appropriate, including recovering, reducing, or   HB2970- 30 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    withholding any fees paid or to be paid to the hearing 2    officer. If any hearing officer repeats such failure, he 3    or she must be permanently removed from the master list 4    maintained by the State Board of Education and may not be 5    selected by parties through the alternative selection 6    process under this paragraph (7) or paragraph (4) of this 7    subsection (d). The board shall not lose jurisdiction to 8    discharge a teacher if the hearing officer fails to render 9    a decision or findings of fact and recommendation within 10    the time specified in this Section. If the decision of the 11    hearing officer for dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of 12    this Code or of the school board for dismissal for cause is 13    in favor of the teacher, then the hearing officer or 14    school board shall order reinstatement to the same or 15    substantially equivalent position and shall determine the 16    amount for which the school board is liable, including, 17    but not limited to, loss of income and benefits.18        (8) The school board, within 45 days after receipt of 19    the hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation 20    as to whether (i) the conduct at issue occurred, (ii) the 21    conduct that did occur was remediable, and (iii) the 22    proposed dismissal should be sustained, shall issue a 23    written order as to whether the teacher must be retained 24    or dismissed for cause from its employ. The school board's 25    written order shall incorporate the hearing officer's 26    findings of fact, except that the school board may modify   HB2970- 31 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    or supplement the findings of fact if, in its opinion, the 2    findings of fact are against the manifest weight of the 3    evidence.4        If the school board dismisses the teacher 5    notwithstanding the hearing officer's findings of fact and 6    recommendation, the school board shall make a conclusion 7    in its written order, giving its reasons therefor, and 8    such conclusion and reasons must be included in its 9    written order. The failure of the school board to strictly 10    adhere to the timelines contained in this Section shall 11    not render it without jurisdiction to dismiss the teacher. 12    The school board shall not lose jurisdiction to discharge 13    the teacher for cause if the hearing officer fails to 14    render a recommendation within the time specified in this 15    Section. The decision of the school board is final, unless 16    reviewed as provided in paragraph (9) of this subsection 17    (d).18        If the school board retains the teacher, the school 19    board shall enter a written order stating the amount of 20    back pay and lost benefits, less mitigation, to be paid to 21    the teacher, within 45 days after its retention order. 22    Should the teacher object to the amount of the back pay and 23    lost benefits or amount mitigated, the teacher shall give 24    written objections to the amount within 21 days. If the 25    parties fail to reach resolution within 7 days, the 26    dispute shall be referred to the hearing officer, who   HB2970- 32 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    shall consider the school board's written order and 2    teacher's written objection and determine the amount to 3    which the school board is liable. The costs of the hearing 4    officer's review and determination must be paid by the 5    board.6        (9) The decision of the hearing officer pursuant to 7    Article 24A of this Code or of the school board's decision 8    to dismiss for cause is final unless reviewed as provided 9    in Section 24-16 of this Code. If the school board's 10    decision to dismiss for cause is contrary to the hearing 11    officer's recommendation, the court on review shall give 12    consideration to the school board's decision and its 13    supplemental findings of fact, if applicable, and the 14    hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation in 15    making its decision. In the event such review is 16    instituted, the school board shall be responsible for 17    preparing and filing the record of proceedings, and such 18    costs associated therewith must be divided equally between 19    the parties.20        (10) If a decision of the hearing officer for 21    dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or of the 22    school board for dismissal for cause is adjudicated upon 23    review or appeal in favor of the teacher, then the trial 24    court shall order reinstatement and shall remand the 25    matter to the school board with direction for entry of an 26    order setting the amount of back pay, lost benefits, and   HB2970- 33 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    costs, less mitigation. The teacher may challenge the 2    school board's order setting the amount of back pay, lost 3    benefits, and costs, less mitigation, through an expedited 4    arbitration procedure, with the costs of the arbitrator 5    borne by the school board.6        Any teacher who is reinstated by any hearing or 7    adjudication brought under this Section shall be assigned 8    by the board to a position substantially similar to the 9    one which that teacher held prior to that teacher's 10    suspension or dismissal.11        (11) Subject to any later effective date referenced in 12    this Section for a specific aspect of the dismissal 13    process, the changes made by Public Act 97-8 shall apply 14    to dismissals instituted on or after September 1, 2011. 15    Any dismissal instituted prior to September 1, 2011 must 16    be carried out in accordance with the requirements of this 17    Section prior to amendment by Public Act 97-8. 18    (e) Nothing contained in Public Act 98-648 repeals, 19supersedes, invalidates, or nullifies final decisions in 20lawsuits pending on July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public 21Act 98-648) in Illinois courts involving the interpretation of 22Public Act 97-8. 23(Source: P.A. 102-708, eff. 4-22-22; 103-354, eff. 1-1-24; 24103-398, eff. 1-1-24; 103-500, eff. 8-4-23; 103-605, eff. 257-1-24.) 26    Section 99.

If 12a teacher in contractual continued service is removed or 13dismissed as a result of a decision of the board to decrease 14the number of teachers employed by the board or to discontinue 15some particular type of teaching service, written notice shall 16be mailed to the teacher and also given the teacher either by 17certified mail, return receipt requested or personal delivery 18with receipt at least 60 days before the end of the school 19term, together with a statement of honorable dismissal and the 20reason therefor, and in all such cases the board shall first 21remove or dismiss all teachers who have not entered upon 22contractual continued service before removing or dismissing 23any teacher who has entered upon contractual continued service   HB2970- 2 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1and who is legally qualified to hold a position currently held 2by a teacher who has not entered upon contractual continued 3service. 4    As between teachers who have entered upon contractual 5continued service, the teacher or teachers with the shorter 6length of continuing service with the district shall be 7dismissed first unless an alternative method of determining 8the sequence of dismissal is established in a collective 9bargaining agreement or contract between the board and a 10professional faculty members' organization and except that 11this provision shall not impair the operation of any 12affirmative action program in the district, regardless of 13whether it exists by operation of law or is conducted on a 14voluntary basis by the board. Any teacher dismissed as a 15result of such decrease or discontinuance shall be paid all 16earned compensation on or before the third business day 17following the last day of pupil attendance in the regular 18school term. 19    If the board has any vacancies for the following school 20term or within one calendar year from the beginning of the 21following school term, the positions thereby becoming 22available shall be tendered to the teachers so removed or 23dismissed so far as they are legally qualified to hold such 24positions; provided, however, that if the number of honorable 25dismissal notices based on economic necessity exceeds 15% of 26the number of full-time equivalent positions filled by   HB2970- 3 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1certified employees (excluding principals and administrative 2personnel) during the preceding school year, then if the board 3has any vacancies for the following school term or within 2 4calendar years from the beginning of the following school 5term, the positions so becoming available shall be tendered to 6the teachers who were so notified and removed or dismissed 7whenever they are legally qualified to hold such positions. 8Each board shall, in consultation with any exclusive employee 9representatives, each year establish a list, categorized by 10positions, showing the length of continuing service of each 11teacher who is qualified to hold any such positions, unless an 12alternative method of determining a sequence of dismissal is 13established as provided for in this Section, in which case a 14list shall be made in accordance with the alternative method. 15Copies of the list shall be distributed to the exclusive 16employee representative on or before February 1 of each year. 17Whenever the number of honorable dismissal notices based upon 18economic necessity exceeds 5, or 150% of the average number of 19teachers honorably dismissed in the preceding 3 years, 20whichever is more, then the board also shall hold a public 21hearing on the question of the dismissals. Following the 22hearing and board review, the action to approve any such 23reduction shall require a majority vote of the board members.24    (b) If any teacher, whether or not in contractual 25continued service, is removed or dismissed as a result of a 26decision of a school board to decrease the number of teachers   HB2970- 4 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1employed by the board, a decision of a school board to 2discontinue some particular type of teaching service, or a 3reduction in the number of programs or positions in a special 4education joint agreement, then written notice must be mailed 5to the teacher and also given to the teacher either by 6electronic mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, or 7personal delivery with receipt on or before April 15, together 8with a statement of honorable dismissal and the reason 9therefor, and in all such cases the sequence of dismissal 10shall occur in accordance with this subsection (b); except 11that this subsection (b) shall not impair the operation of any 12affirmative action program in the school district, regardless 13of whether it exists by operation of law or is conducted on a 14voluntary basis by the board.15    Each teacher must be categorized into one or more 16positions for which the teacher is qualified to hold, based 17upon legal qualifications and any other qualifications 18established in a district or joint agreement job description, 19on or before the May 10 prior to the school year during which 20the sequence of dismissal is determined. Within each position 21and subject to agreements made by the joint committee on 22honorable dismissals that are authorized by subsection (c) of 23this Section, the school district or joint agreement must 24establish 4 groupings of teachers qualified to hold the 25position as follows:26        (1) Grouping one shall consist of each teacher who is   HB2970- 5 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    not in contractual continued service and who (i) has not 2    received a performance evaluation rating, (ii) is employed 3    for one school term or less to replace a teacher on leave, 4    or (iii) is employed on a part-time basis. "Part-time 5    basis" for the purposes of this subsection (b) means a 6    teacher who is employed to teach less than a full-day, 7    teacher workload or less than 5 days of the normal student 8    attendance week, unless otherwise provided for in a 9    collective bargaining agreement between the district and 10    the exclusive representative of the district's teachers. 11    For the purposes of this Section, a teacher (A) who is 12    employed as a full-time teacher but who actually teaches 13    or is otherwise present and participating in the 14    district's educational program for less than a school term 15    or (B) who, in the immediately previous school term, was 16    employed on a full-time basis and actually taught or was 17    otherwise present and participated in the district's 18    educational program for 120 days or more is not considered 19    employed on a part-time basis.20        (2) Grouping 2 shall consist of each teacher with a 21    Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory performance evaluation 22    rating on either of the teacher's last 2 performance 23    evaluation ratings.24        (3) Grouping 3 shall consist of each teacher with a 25    performance evaluation rating of at least Satisfactory or 26    Proficient on both of the teacher's last 2 performance   HB2970- 6 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    evaluation ratings, if 2 ratings are available, or on the 2    teacher's last performance evaluation rating, if only one 3    rating is available, unless the teacher qualifies for 4    placement into grouping 4.5        (4) Grouping 4 shall consist of each teacher whose 6    last 2 performance evaluation ratings are Excellent and 7    each teacher with 2 Excellent performance evaluation 8    ratings out of the teacher's last 3 performance evaluation 9    ratings with a third rating of Satisfactory or Proficient.10    Among teachers qualified to hold a position, teachers must 11be dismissed in the order of their groupings, with teachers in 12grouping one dismissed first and teachers in grouping 4 13dismissed last.14    Within grouping one, the sequence of dismissal must be at 15the discretion of the school district or joint agreement. 16Within grouping 2, the sequence of dismissal must be based 17upon average performance evaluation ratings, with the teacher 18or teachers with the lowest average performance evaluation 19rating dismissed first. A teacher's average performance 20evaluation rating must be calculated using the average of the 21teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings, if 2 ratings 22are available, or the teacher's last performance evaluation 23rating, if only one rating is available, using the following 24numerical values: 4 for Excellent; 3 for Proficient or 25Satisfactory; 2 for Needs Improvement; and 1 for 26Unsatisfactory. As between or among teachers in grouping 2   HB2970- 7 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1with the same average performance evaluation rating and within 2each of groupings 3 and 4, the teacher or teachers with the 3shorter length of continuing service with the school district 4or joint agreement must be dismissed first unless an 5alternative method of determining the sequence of dismissal is 6established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract 7between the board and a professional faculty members' 8organization.9    Each board, including the governing board of a joint 10agreement, shall, in consultation with any exclusive employee 11representatives, each year establish a sequence of honorable 12dismissal list categorized by positions and the groupings 13defined in this subsection (b). Copies of the list showing 14each teacher by name, along with the race or ethnicity of the 15teacher if provided by the teacher, and categorized by 16positions and the groupings defined in this subsection (b) 17must be distributed to the exclusive bargaining representative 18at least 75 days before the end of the school term, provided 19that the school district or joint agreement may, with notice 20to any exclusive employee representatives, move teachers from 21grouping one into another grouping during the period of time 22from 75 days until April 15. Each year, each board shall also 23establish, in consultation with any exclusive employee 24representatives, a list showing the length of continuing 25service of each teacher who is qualified to hold any such 26positions, unless an alternative method of determining a   HB2970- 8 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1sequence of dismissal is established as provided for in this 2Section, in which case a list must be made in accordance with 3the alternative method. Copies of the list must be distributed 4to the exclusive employee representative at least 75 days 5before the end of the school term. 6    Any teacher dismissed as a result of such decrease or 7discontinuance must be paid all earned compensation on or 8before the third business day following the last day of pupil 9attendance in the regular school term.10    If the board or joint agreement has any vacancies for the 11following school term or within one calendar year from the 12beginning of the following school term, the positions thereby 13becoming available must be tendered to the teachers so removed 14or dismissed who were in grouping 3 or 4 of the sequence of 15dismissal and are qualified to hold the positions, based upon 16legal qualifications and any other qualifications established 17in a district or joint agreement job description, on or before 18the May 10 prior to the date of the positions becoming 19available, provided that if the number of honorable dismissal 20notices based on economic necessity exceeds 15% of the number 21of full-time equivalent positions filled by certified 22employees (excluding principals and administrative personnel) 23during the preceding school year, then the recall period is 24for the following school term or within 2 calendar years from 25the beginning of the following school term. If the board or 26joint agreement has any vacancies within the period from the   HB2970- 9 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1beginning of the following school term through February 1 of 2the following school term (unless a date later than February 31, but no later than 6 months from the beginning of the 4following school term, is established in a collective 5bargaining agreement), the positions thereby becoming 6available must be tendered to the teachers so removed or 7dismissed who were in grouping 2 of the sequence of dismissal 8due to one "needs improvement" rating on either of the 9teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings, provided 10that, if 2 ratings are available, the other performance 11evaluation rating used for grouping purposes is 12"satisfactory", "proficient", or "excellent", and are 13qualified to hold the positions, based upon legal 14qualifications and any other qualifications established in a 15district or joint agreement job description, on or before the 16May 10 prior to the date of the positions becoming available. 17On and after July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 1898-648), the preceding sentence shall apply to teachers 19removed or dismissed by honorable dismissal, even if notice of 20honorable dismissal occurred during the 2013-2014 school year. 21Among teachers eligible for recall pursuant to the preceding 22sentence, the order of recall must be in inverse order of 23dismissal, unless an alternative order of recall is 24established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract 25between the board and a professional faculty members' 26organization. Whenever the number of honorable dismissal   HB2970- 10 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1notices based upon economic necessity exceeds 5 notices or 2150% of the average number of teachers honorably dismissed in 3the preceding 3 years, whichever is more, then the school 4board or governing board of a joint agreement, as applicable, 5shall also hold a public hearing on the question of the 6dismissals. Following the hearing and board review, the action 7to approve any such reduction shall require a majority vote of 8the board members.9    For purposes of this subsection (b), subject to agreement 10on an alternative definition reached by the joint committee 11described in subsection (c) of this Section, a teacher's 12performance evaluation rating means the overall performance 13evaluation rating resulting from an annual or biennial 14performance evaluation conducted pursuant to Article 24A of 15this Code by the school district or joint agreement 16determining the sequence of dismissal, not including any 17performance evaluation conducted during or at the end of a 18remediation period. No more than one evaluation rating each 19school term shall be one of the evaluation ratings used for the 20purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. Except as 21otherwise provided in this subsection for any performance 22evaluations conducted during or at the end of a remediation 23period, if multiple performance evaluations are conducted in a 24school term, only the rating from the last evaluation 25conducted prior to establishing the sequence of honorable 26dismissal list in such school term shall be the one evaluation   HB2970- 11 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1rating from that school term used for the purpose of 2determining the sequence of dismissal. Averaging ratings from 3multiple evaluations is not permitted unless otherwise agreed 4to in a collective bargaining agreement or contract between 5the board and a professional faculty members' organization. 6The preceding 3 sentences are not a legislative declaration 7that existing law does or does not already require that only 8one performance evaluation each school term shall be used for 9the purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. For 10performance evaluation ratings determined prior to September 111, 2012, any school district or joint agreement with a 12performance evaluation rating system that does not use either 13of the rating category systems specified in subsection (d) of 14Section 24A-5 of this Code for all teachers must establish a 15basis for assigning each teacher a rating that complies with 16subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code for all of the 17performance evaluation ratings that are to be used to 18determine the sequence of dismissal. A teacher's grouping and 19ranking on a sequence of honorable dismissal shall be deemed a 20part of the teacher's performance evaluation, and that 21information shall be disclosed to the exclusive bargaining 22representative as part of a sequence of honorable dismissal 23list, notwithstanding any laws prohibiting disclosure of such 24information. A performance evaluation rating may be used to 25determine the sequence of dismissal, notwithstanding the 26pendency of any grievance resolution or arbitration procedures   HB2970- 12 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1relating to the performance evaluation. If a teacher has 2received at least one performance evaluation rating conducted 3by the school district or joint agreement determining the 4sequence of dismissal and a subsequent performance evaluation 5is not conducted in any school year in which such evaluation is 6required to be conducted under Section 24A-5 of this Code, the 7teacher's performance evaluation rating for that school year 8for purposes of determining the sequence of dismissal is 9deemed Proficient, except that, during any time in which the 10Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health 11emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency 12Management Agency Act, this default to Proficient does not 13apply to any teacher who has entered into contractual 14continued service and who was deemed Excellent on his or her 15most recent evaluation. During any time in which the Governor 16has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency 17pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 18Agency Act and unless the school board and any exclusive 19bargaining representative have completed the performance 20rating for teachers or have mutually agreed to an alternate 21performance rating, any teacher who has entered into 22contractual continued service, whose most recent evaluation 23was deemed Excellent, and whose performance evaluation is not 24conducted when the evaluation is required to be conducted 25shall receive a teacher's performance rating deemed Excellent. 26A school board and any exclusive bargaining representative may   HB2970- 13 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1mutually agree to an alternate performance rating for teachers 2not in contractual continued service during any time in which 3the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health 4emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency 5Management Agency Act, as long as the agreement is in writing. 6If a performance evaluation rating is nullified as the result 7of an arbitration, administrative agency, or court 8determination, then the school district or joint agreement is 9deemed to have conducted a performance evaluation for that 10school year, but the performance evaluation rating may not be 11used in determining the sequence of dismissal.12    Nothing in this subsection (b) shall be construed as 13limiting the right of a school board or governing board of a 14joint agreement to dismiss a teacher not in contractual 15continued service in accordance with Section 24-11 of this 16Code.17    Any provisions regarding the sequence of honorable 18dismissals and recall of honorably dismissed teachers in a 19collective bargaining agreement entered into on or before 20January 1, 2011 and in effect on June 13, 2011 (the effective 21date of Public Act 97-8) that may conflict with Public Act 97-8 22shall remain in effect through the expiration of such 23agreement or June 30, 2013, whichever is earlier.24    (c) Each school district and special education joint 25agreement must use a joint committee composed of equal 26representation selected by the school board and its teachers   HB2970- 14 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1or, if applicable, the exclusive bargaining representative of 2its teachers, to address the matters described in paragraphs 3(1) through (5) of this subsection (c) pertaining to honorable 4dismissals under subsection (b) of this Section.5        (1) The joint committee must consider and may agree to 6    criteria for excluding from grouping 2 and placing into 7    grouping 3 a teacher whose last 2 performance evaluations 8    include a Needs Improvement and either a Proficient or 9    Excellent.10        (2) The joint committee must consider and may agree to 11    an alternative definition for grouping 4, which definition 12    must take into account prior performance evaluation 13    ratings and may take into account other factors that 14    relate to the school district's or program's educational 15    objectives. An alternative definition for grouping 4 may 16    not permit the inclusion of a teacher in the grouping with 17    a Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory performance 18    evaluation rating on either of the teacher's last 2 19    performance evaluation ratings.20        (3) The joint committee may agree to including within 21    the definition of a performance evaluation rating a 22    performance evaluation rating administered by a school 23    district or joint agreement other than the school district 24    or joint agreement determining the sequence of dismissal.25        (4) For each school district or joint agreement that 26    administers performance evaluation ratings that are   HB2970- 15 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    inconsistent with either of the rating category systems 2    specified in subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code, 3    the school district or joint agreement must consult with 4    the joint committee on the basis for assigning a rating 5    that complies with subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this 6    Code to each performance evaluation rating that will be 7    used in a sequence of dismissal.8        (5) Upon request by a joint committee member submitted 9    to the employing board by no later than 10 days after the 10    distribution of the sequence of honorable dismissal list, 11    a representative of the employing board shall, within 5 12    days after the request, provide to members of the joint 13    committee a list showing the most recent and prior 14    performance evaluation ratings of each teacher identified 15    only by length of continuing service in the district or 16    joint agreement and not by name. If, after review of this 17    list, a member of the joint committee has a good faith 18    belief that a disproportionate number of teachers with 19    greater length of continuing service with the district or 20    joint agreement have received a recent performance 21    evaluation rating lower than the prior rating, the member 22    may request that the joint committee review the list to 23    assess whether such a trend may exist. Following the joint 24    committee's review, but by no later than the end of the 25    applicable school term, the joint committee or any member 26    or members of the joint committee may submit a report of   HB2970- 16 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    the review to the employing board and exclusive bargaining 2    representative, if any. Nothing in this paragraph (5) 3    shall impact the order of honorable dismissal or a school 4    district's or joint agreement's authority to carry out a 5    dismissal in accordance with subsection (b) of this 6    Section.7    Agreement by the joint committee as to a matter requires 8the majority vote of all committee members, and if the joint 9committee does not reach agreement on a matter, then the 10otherwise applicable requirements of subsection (b) of this 11Section shall apply. Except as explicitly set forth in this 12subsection (c), a joint committee has no authority to agree to 13any further modifications to the requirements for honorable 14dismissals set forth in subsection (b) of this Section. The 15joint committee must be established, and the first meeting of 16the joint committee each school year must occur on or before 17December 1.18    The joint committee must reach agreement on a matter on or 19before February 1 of a school year in order for the agreement 20of the joint committee to apply to the sequence of dismissal 21determined during that school year. Subject to the February 1 22deadline for agreements, the agreement of a joint committee on 23a matter shall apply to the sequence of dismissal until the 24agreement is amended or terminated by the joint committee. 25    The provisions of the Open Meetings Act shall not apply to 26meetings of a joint committee created under this subsection   HB2970- 17 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1(c). 2    (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 3subsection (d), the requirements and dismissal procedures of 4Section 24-16.5 of this Code shall apply to any dismissal 5sought under Section 24-16.5 of this Code.6        (1) If a dismissal of a teacher in contractual 7    continued service is sought for any reason or cause other 8    than an honorable dismissal under subsections (a) or (b) 9    of this Section or a dismissal sought under Section 10    24-16.5 of this Code, including those under Section 11    10-22.4, the board must first approve a motion containing 12    specific charges by a majority vote of all its members. 13    Written notice of such charges, including a bill of 14    particulars and the teacher's right to request a hearing, 15    must be mailed to the teacher and also given to the teacher 16    either by electronic mail, certified mail, return receipt 17    requested, or personal delivery with receipt within 5 days 18    of the adoption of the motion. Any written notice sent on 19    or after July 1, 2012 shall inform the teacher of the right 20    to request a hearing before a mutually selected hearing 21    officer, with the cost of the hearing officer split 22    equally between the teacher and the board, or a hearing 23    before a board-selected hearing officer, with the cost of 24    the hearing officer paid by the board.25        Before setting a hearing on charges stemming from 26    causes that are considered remediable, a board must give   HB2970- 18 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    the teacher reasonable warning in writing, stating 2    specifically the causes that, if not removed, may result 3    in charges; however, no such written warning is required 4    if the causes have been the subject of a remediation plan 5    pursuant to Article 24A of this Code. The teacher may 6    grieve the issuance of such warning pursuant to the 7    applicable collective bargaining agreement to determine 8    whether the school district had just cause in issuing the 9    warning. Notice of remedial warnings must narrowly specify 10    the nature of the alleged misconduct that needs to be 11    remedied. General allegations of unprofessional conduct, 12    or similar phrases, are insufficient to link together 13    otherwise unrelated offenses as related. Under no 14    circumstances shall a notice of remedial warning remain 15    effective or within a teacher's personnel file or record 16    for longer than 3 years from the date of the occurrence 17    which gave rise to the issuance of the notice of remedial 18    warning. 19        If, in the opinion of the board, the interests of the 20    school require it, the board may suspend the teacher 21    without pay, pending the hearing, but if the board's 22    dismissal or removal is not sustained, the teacher shall 23    not suffer the loss of any salary or benefits by reason of 24    the suspension.25        (2) No hearing upon the charges is required unless the 26    teacher within 17 days after receiving notice requests in   HB2970- 19 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    writing of the board that a hearing be scheduled before a 2    mutually selected hearing officer or a hearing officer 3    selected by the board. The secretary of the school board 4    shall forward a copy of the notice to the State Board of 5    Education.6        (3) Within 5 business days after receiving a notice of 7    hearing in which either notice to the teacher was sent 8    before July 1, 2012 or, if the notice was sent on or after 9    July 1, 2012, the teacher has requested a hearing before a 10    mutually selected hearing officer, the State Board of 11    Education shall provide a list of 5 prospective, impartial 12    hearing officers from the master list of qualified, 13    impartial hearing officers maintained by the State Board 14    of Education. Each person on the master list must (i) be 15    accredited by a national arbitration organization and have 16    had a minimum of 5 years of experience directly related to 17    labor and employment relations matters between employers 18    and employees or their exclusive bargaining 19    representatives and (ii) beginning September 1, 2012, have 20    participated in training provided or approved by the State 21    Board of Education for teacher dismissal hearing officers 22    so that he or she is familiar with issues generally 23    involved in evaluative and non-evaluative dismissals.24        If notice to the teacher was sent before July 1, 2012 25    or, if the notice was sent on or after July 1, 2012, the 26    teacher has requested a hearing before a mutually selected   HB2970- 20 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    hearing officer, the board and the teacher or their legal 2    representatives within 3 business days shall alternately 3    strike one name from the list provided by the State Board 4    of Education until only one name remains. Unless waived by 5    the teacher, the teacher shall have the right to proceed 6    first with the striking. Within 3 business days of receipt 7    of the list provided by the State Board of Education, the 8    board and the teacher or their legal representatives shall 9    each have the right to reject all prospective hearing 10    officers named on the list and notify the State Board of 11    Education of such rejection. Within 3 business days after 12    receiving this notification, the State Board of Education 13    shall appoint a qualified person from the master list who 14    did not appear on the list sent to the parties to serve as 15    the hearing officer, unless the parties notify it that 16    they have chosen to alternatively select a hearing officer 17    under paragraph (4) of this subsection (d).18        If the teacher has requested a hearing before a 19    hearing officer selected by the board, the board shall 20    select one name from the master list of qualified 21    impartial hearing officers maintained by the State Board 22    of Education within 3 business days after receipt and 23    shall notify the State Board of Education of its 24    selection.25        A hearing officer mutually selected by the parties, 26    selected by the board, or selected through an alternative   HB2970- 21 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    selection process under paragraph (4) of this subsection 2    (d) (A) must not be a resident of the school district, (B) 3    must be available to commence the hearing within 75 days 4    and conclude the hearing within 120 days after being 5    selected as the hearing officer, and (C) must issue a 6    decision as to whether the teacher must be dismissed and 7    give a copy of that decision to both the teacher and the 8    board within 30 days from the conclusion of the hearing or 9    closure of the record, whichever is later.10        Any hearing convened during a public health emergency 11    pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 12    Agency Act may be convened remotely. Any hearing officer 13    for a hearing convened during a public health emergency 14    pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 15    Agency Act may voluntarily withdraw from the hearing and 16    another hearing officer shall be selected or appointed 17    pursuant to this Section. 18        In this paragraph, "pre-hearing procedures" refers to 19    the pre-hearing procedures under Section 51.55 of Title 23 20    of the Illinois Administrative Code and "hearing" refers 21    to the hearing under Section 51.60 of Title 23 of the 22    Illinois Administrative Code. Any teacher who has been 23    charged with engaging in acts of corporal punishment, 24    physical abuse, grooming, or sexual misconduct and who 25    previously paused pre-hearing procedures or a hearing 26    pursuant to Public Act 101-643 must proceed with selection   HB2970- 22 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    of a hearing officer or hearing date, or both, within the 2    timeframes established by this paragraph (3) and 3    paragraphs (4) through (6) of this subsection (d), unless 4    the timeframes are mutually waived in writing by both 5    parties, and all timelines set forth in this Section in 6    cases concerning corporal punishment, physical abuse, 7    grooming, or sexual misconduct shall be reset to begin the 8    day after April 22, 2022 (the effective date of Public Act 9    102-708). Any teacher charged with engaging in acts of 10    corporal punishment, physical abuse, grooming, or sexual 11    misconduct on or after April 22, 2022 (the effective date 12    of Public Act 102-708) may not pause pre-hearing 13    procedures or a hearing.14        (4) In the alternative to selecting a hearing officer 15    from the list received from the State Board of Education 16    or accepting the appointment of a hearing officer by the 17    State Board of Education or if the State Board of 18    Education cannot provide a list or appoint a hearing 19    officer that meets the foregoing requirements, the board 20    and the teacher or their legal representatives may 21    mutually agree to select an impartial hearing officer who 22    is not on the master list either by direct appointment by 23    the parties or by using procedures for the appointment of 24    an arbitrator established by the Federal Mediation and 25    Conciliation Service or the American Arbitration 26    Association. The parties shall notify the State Board of   HB2970- 23 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    Education of their intent to select a hearing officer 2    using an alternative procedure within 3 business days of 3    receipt of a list of prospective hearing officers provided 4    by the State Board of Education, notice of appointment of 5    a hearing officer by the State Board of Education, or 6    receipt of notice from the State Board of Education that 7    it cannot provide a list that meets the foregoing 8    requirements, whichever is later. 9        (5) If the notice of dismissal was sent to the teacher 10    before July 1, 2012, the fees and costs for the hearing 11    officer must be paid by the State Board of Education. If 12    the notice of dismissal was sent to the teacher on or after 13    July 1, 2012, the hearing officer's fees and costs must be 14    paid as follows in this paragraph (5). The fees and 15    permissible costs for the hearing officer must be 16    determined by the State Board of Education. If the board 17    and the teacher or their legal representatives mutually 18    agree to select an impartial hearing officer who is not on 19    a list received from the State Board of Education, they 20    may agree to supplement the fees determined by the State 21    Board to the hearing officer, at a rate consistent with 22    the hearing officer's published professional fees. If the 23    hearing officer is mutually selected by the parties, then 24    the board and the teacher or their legal representatives 25    shall each pay 50% of the fees and costs and any 26    supplemental allowance to which they agree. If the hearing   HB2970- 24 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    officer is selected by the board, then the board shall pay 2    100% of the hearing officer's fees and costs. The fees and 3    costs must be paid to the hearing officer within 14 days 4    after the board and the teacher or their legal 5    representatives receive the hearing officer's decision set 6    forth in paragraph (7) of this subsection (d).7        (6) The teacher is required to answer the bill of 8    particulars and aver affirmative matters in his or her 9    defense, and the time for initially doing so and the time 10    for updating such answer and defenses after pre-hearing 11    discovery must be set by the hearing officer. The State 12    Board of Education shall promulgate rules so that each 13    party has a fair opportunity to present its case and to 14    ensure that the dismissal process proceeds in a fair and 15    expeditious manner. These rules shall address, without 16    limitation, discovery and hearing scheduling conferences; 17    the teacher's initial answer and affirmative defenses to 18    the bill of particulars and the updating of that 19    information after pre-hearing discovery; provision for 20    written interrogatories and requests for production of 21    documents; the requirement that each party initially 22    disclose to the other party and then update the disclosure 23    no later than 10 calendar days prior to the commencement 24    of the hearing, the names and addresses of persons who may 25    be called as witnesses at the hearing, a summary of the 26    facts or opinions each witness will testify to, and all   HB2970- 25 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    other documents and materials, including information 2    maintained electronically, relevant to its own as well as 3    the other party's case (the hearing officer may exclude 4    witnesses and exhibits not identified and shared, except 5    those offered in rebuttal for which the party could not 6    reasonably have anticipated prior to the hearing); 7    pre-hearing discovery and preparation, including provision 8    for written interrogatories and requests for production of 9    documents, provided that discovery depositions are 10    prohibited; the conduct of the hearing; the right of each 11    party to be represented by counsel, the offer of evidence 12    and witnesses and the cross-examination of witnesses; the 13    authority of the hearing officer to issue subpoenas and 14    subpoenas duces tecum, provided that the hearing officer 15    may limit the number of witnesses to be subpoenaed on 16    behalf of each party to no more than 7; the length of 17    post-hearing briefs; and the form, length, and content of 18    hearing officers' decisions. The hearing officer shall 19    hold a hearing and render a final decision for dismissal 20    pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or shall report to the 21    school board findings of fact and a recommendation as to 22    whether or not the teacher must be dismissed for conduct. 23    The hearing officer shall commence the hearing within 75 24    days and conclude the hearing within 120 days after being 25    selected as the hearing officer, provided that the hearing 26    officer may modify these timelines upon the showing of   HB2970- 26 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    good cause or mutual agreement of the parties. Good cause 2    for the purpose of this subsection (d) shall mean the 3    illness or otherwise unavoidable emergency of the teacher, 4    district representative, their legal representatives, the 5    hearing officer, or an essential witness as indicated in 6    each party's pre-hearing submission. In a dismissal 7    hearing pursuant to Article 24A of this Code in which a 8    witness is a student or is under the age of 18, the hearing 9    officer must make accommodations for the witness, as 10    provided under paragraph (6.5) of this subsection. The 11    hearing officer shall consider and give weight to all of 12    the teacher's evaluations written pursuant to Article 24A 13    that are relevant to the issues in the hearing.14        Each party shall have no more than 3 days to present 15    its case, unless extended by the hearing officer to enable 16    a party to present adequate evidence and testimony, 17    including due to the other party's cross-examination of 18    the party's witnesses, for good cause or by mutual 19    agreement of the parties. The State Board of Education 20    shall define in rules the meaning of "day" for such 21    purposes. All testimony at the hearing shall be taken 22    under oath administered by the hearing officer. The 23    hearing officer shall cause a record of the proceedings to 24    be kept and shall employ a competent reporter to take 25    stenographic or stenotype notes of all the testimony. The 26    costs of the reporter's attendance and services at the   HB2970- 27 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    hearing shall be paid by the party or parties who are 2    responsible for paying the fees and costs of the hearing 3    officer. Either party desiring a transcript of the hearing 4    shall pay for the cost thereof. Any post-hearing briefs 5    must be submitted by the parties by no later than 21 days 6    after a party's receipt of the transcript of the hearing, 7    unless extended by the hearing officer for good cause or 8    by mutual agreement of the parties.9        (6.5) In the case of charges involving any witness who 10    is or was at the time of the alleged conduct a student or a 11    person under the age of 18, the hearing officer shall make 12    accommodations to protect a witness from being 13    intimidated, traumatized, or re-traumatized. No alleged 14    victim or other witness who is or was at the time of the 15    alleged conduct a student or under the age of 18 may be 16    compelled to testify in the physical or visual presence of 17    a teacher or other witness. If such a witness invokes this 18    right, then the hearing officer must provide an 19    accommodation consistent with the invoked right and use a 20    procedure by which each party may hear such witness's 21    testimony. Accommodations may include, but are not limited 22    to: (i) testimony made via a telecommunication device in a 23    location other than the hearing room and outside the 24    physical or visual presence of the teacher and other 25    hearing participants, but accessible to the teacher via a 26    telecommunication device, (ii) testimony made in the   HB2970- 28 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    hearing room but outside the physical presence of the 2    teacher and accessible to the teacher via a 3    telecommunication device, (iii) non-public testimony, (iv) 4    testimony made via videoconference with the cameras and 5    microphones of the teacher turned off, or (v) pre-recorded 6    testimony, including, but not limited to, a recording of a 7    forensic interview conducted at an accredited Children's 8    Advocacy Center. With all accommodations, the hearing 9    officer shall give such testimony the same consideration 10    as if the witness testified without the accommodation. The 11    teacher may not directly, or through a representative, 12    question a witness called by the school board who is or was 13    a student or under 18 years of age at the time of the 14    alleged conduct. The hearing officer must permit the 15    teacher to submit all relevant questions and follow-up 16    questions for such a witness to have the questions posed 17    by the hearing officer. All questions must exclude 18    evidence of the witness' sexual behavior or 19    predisposition, unless the evidence is offered to prove 20    that someone other than the teacher subject to the 21    dismissal hearing engaged in the charge at issue. 22        (7) The hearing officer shall, within 30 days from the 23    conclusion of the hearing or closure of the record, 24    whichever is later, make a decision as to whether or not 25    the teacher shall be dismissed pursuant to Article 24A of 26    this Code or report to the school board findings of fact   HB2970- 29 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    and a recommendation as to whether or not the teacher 2    shall be dismissed for cause and shall give a copy of the 3    decision or findings of fact and recommendation to both 4    the teacher and the school board. If a hearing officer 5    fails without good cause, specifically provided in writing 6    to both parties and the State Board of Education, to 7    render a decision or findings of fact and recommendation 8    within 30 days after the hearing is concluded or the 9    record is closed, whichever is later, the parties may 10    mutually agree to select a hearing officer pursuant to the 11    alternative procedure, as provided in this Section, to 12    rehear the charges heard by the hearing officer who failed 13    to render a decision or findings of fact and 14    recommendation or to review the record and render a 15    decision. If any hearing officer fails without good cause, 16    specifically provided in writing to both parties and the 17    State Board of Education, to render a decision or findings 18    of fact and recommendation within 30 days after the 19    hearing is concluded or the record is closed, whichever is 20    later, or if any hearing officer fails to make an 21    accommodation as described in paragraph (6.5), the hearing 22    officer shall be removed from the master list of hearing 23    officers maintained by the State Board of Education for 24    not more than 24 months. The parties and the State Board of 25    Education may also take such other actions as it deems 26    appropriate, including recovering, reducing, or   HB2970- 30 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    withholding any fees paid or to be paid to the hearing 2    officer. If any hearing officer repeats such failure, he 3    or she must be permanently removed from the master list 4    maintained by the State Board of Education and may not be 5    selected by parties through the alternative selection 6    process under this paragraph (7) or paragraph (4) of this 7    subsection (d). The board shall not lose jurisdiction to 8    discharge a teacher if the hearing officer fails to render 9    a decision or findings of fact and recommendation within 10    the time specified in this Section. If the decision of the 11    hearing officer for dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of 12    this Code or of the school board for dismissal for cause is 13    in favor of the teacher, then the hearing officer or 14    school board shall order reinstatement to the same or 15    substantially equivalent position and shall determine the 16    amount for which the school board is liable, including, 17    but not limited to, loss of income and benefits.18        (8) The school board, within 45 days after receipt of 19    the hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation 20    as to whether (i) the conduct at issue occurred, (ii) the 21    conduct that did occur was remediable, and (iii) the 22    proposed dismissal should be sustained, shall issue a 23    written order as to whether the teacher must be retained 24    or dismissed for cause from its employ. The school board's 25    written order shall incorporate the hearing officer's 26    findings of fact, except that the school board may modify   HB2970- 31 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    or supplement the findings of fact if, in its opinion, the 2    findings of fact are against the manifest weight of the 3    evidence.4        If the school board dismisses the teacher 5    notwithstanding the hearing officer's findings of fact and 6    recommendation, the school board shall make a conclusion 7    in its written order, giving its reasons therefor, and 8    such conclusion and reasons must be included in its 9    written order. The failure of the school board to strictly 10    adhere to the timelines contained in this Section shall 11    not render it without jurisdiction to dismiss the teacher. 12    The school board shall not lose jurisdiction to discharge 13    the teacher for cause if the hearing officer fails to 14    render a recommendation within the time specified in this 15    Section. The decision of the school board is final, unless 16    reviewed as provided in paragraph (9) of this subsection 17    (d).18        If the school board retains the teacher, the school 19    board shall enter a written order stating the amount of 20    back pay and lost benefits, less mitigation, to be paid to 21    the teacher, within 45 days after its retention order. 22    Should the teacher object to the amount of the back pay and 23    lost benefits or amount mitigated, the teacher shall give 24    written objections to the amount within 21 days. If the 25    parties fail to reach resolution within 7 days, the 26    dispute shall be referred to the hearing officer, who   HB2970- 32 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    shall consider the school board's written order and 2    teacher's written objection and determine the amount to 3    which the school board is liable. The costs of the hearing 4    officer's review and determination must be paid by the 5    board.6        (9) The decision of the hearing officer pursuant to 7    Article 24A of this Code or of the school board's decision 8    to dismiss for cause is final unless reviewed as provided 9    in Section 24-16 of this Code. If the school board's 10    decision to dismiss for cause is contrary to the hearing 11    officer's recommendation, the court on review shall give 12    consideration to the school board's decision and its 13    supplemental findings of fact, if applicable, and the 14    hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation in 15    making its decision. In the event such review is 16    instituted, the school board shall be responsible for 17    preparing and filing the record of proceedings, and such 18    costs associated therewith must be divided equally between 19    the parties.20        (10) If a decision of the hearing officer for 21    dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or of the 22    school board for dismissal for cause is adjudicated upon 23    review or appeal in favor of the teacher, then the trial 24    court shall order reinstatement and shall remand the 25    matter to the school board with direction for entry of an 26    order setting the amount of back pay, lost benefits, and   HB2970- 33 -LRB104 10378 LNS 20453 b1    costs, less mitigation. The teacher may challenge the 2    school board's order setting the amount of back pay, lost 3    benefits, and costs, less mitigation, through an expedited 4    arbitration procedure, with the costs of the arbitrator 5    borne by the school board.6        Any teacher who is reinstated by any hearing or 7    adjudication brought under this Section shall be assigned 8    by the board to a position substantially similar to the 9    one which that teacher held prior to that teacher's 10    suspension or dismissal.11        (11) Subject to any later effective date referenced in 12    this Section for a specific aspect of the dismissal 13    process, the changes made by Public Act 97-8 shall apply 14    to dismissals instituted on or after September 1, 2011. 15    Any dismissal instituted prior to September 1, 2011 must 16    be carried out in accordance with the requirements of this 17    Section prior to amendment by Public Act 97-8. 18    (e) Nothing contained in Public Act 98-648 repeals, 19supersedes, invalidates, or nullifies final decisions in 20lawsuits pending on July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public 21Act 98-648) in Illinois courts involving the interpretation of 22Public Act 97-8. 23(Source: P.A. 102-708, eff. 4-22-22; 103-354, eff. 1-1-24; 24103-398, eff. 1-1-24; 103-500, eff. 8-4-23; 103-605, eff. 257-1-24.) 26    Section 99.
