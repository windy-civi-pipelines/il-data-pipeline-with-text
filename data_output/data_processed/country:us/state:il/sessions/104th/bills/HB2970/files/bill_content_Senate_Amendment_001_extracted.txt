Amend House Bill 2970 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 5. The School Code is amended by changing Section 524-12 as follows: 6    (105 ILCS 5/24-12)7    Sec. 24-12. Removal or dismissal of teachers in 8contractual continued service. 9    (a) This subsection (a) applies only to honorable 10dismissals and recalls in which the notice of dismissal is 11provided on or before the end of the 2010-2011 school term. If 12a teacher in contractual continued service is removed or 13dismissed as a result of a decision of the board to decrease 14the number of teachers employed by the board or to discontinue 15some particular type of teaching service, written notice shall 16be mailed to the teacher and also given the teacher either by   10400HB2970sam001- 2 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1certified mail, return receipt requested or personal delivery 2with receipt at least 60 days before the end of the school 3term, together with a statement of honorable dismissal and the 4reason therefor, and in all such cases the board shall first 5remove or dismiss all teachers who have not entered upon 6contractual continued service before removing or dismissing 7any teacher who has entered upon contractual continued service 8and who is legally qualified to hold a position currently held 9by a teacher who has not entered upon contractual continued 10service. 11    As between teachers who have entered upon contractual 12continued service, the teacher or teachers with the shorter 13length of continuing service with the district shall be 14dismissed first unless an alternative method of determining 15the sequence of dismissal is established in a collective 16bargaining agreement or contract between the board and a 17professional faculty members' organization and except that 18this provision shall not impair the operation of any 19affirmative action program in the district, regardless of 20whether it exists by operation of law or is conducted on a 21voluntary basis by the board. Any teacher dismissed as a 22result of such decrease or discontinuance shall be paid all 23earned compensation on or before the third business day 24following the last day of pupil attendance in the regular 25school term. 26    If the board has any vacancies for the following school   10400HB2970sam001- 3 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1term or within one calendar year from the beginning of the 2following school term, the positions thereby becoming 3available shall be tendered to the teachers so removed or 4dismissed so far as they are legally qualified to hold such 5positions; provided, however, that if the number of honorable 6dismissal notices based on economic necessity exceeds 15% of 7the number of full-time equivalent positions filled by 8certified employees (excluding principals and administrative 9personnel) during the preceding school year, then if the board 10has any vacancies for the following school term or within 2 11calendar years from the beginning of the following school 12term, the positions so becoming available shall be tendered to 13the teachers who were so notified and removed or dismissed 14whenever they are legally qualified to hold such positions. 15Each board shall, in consultation with any exclusive employee 16representatives, each year establish a list, categorized by 17positions, showing the length of continuing service of each 18teacher who is qualified to hold any such positions, unless an 19alternative method of determining a sequence of dismissal is 20established as provided for in this Section, in which case a 21list shall be made in accordance with the alternative method. 22Copies of the list shall be distributed to the exclusive 23employee representative on or before February 1 of each year. 24Whenever the number of honorable dismissal notices based upon 25economic necessity exceeds 5, or 150% of the average number of 26teachers honorably dismissed in the preceding 3 years,   10400HB2970sam001- 4 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1whichever is more, then the board also shall hold a public 2hearing on the question of the dismissals. Following the 3hearing and board review, the action to approve any such 4reduction shall require a majority vote of the board members.5    (b) If any teacher, whether or not in contractual 6continued service, is removed or dismissed as a result of a 7decision of a school board to decrease the number of teachers 8employed by the board, a decision of a school board to 9discontinue some particular type of teaching service, or a 10reduction in the number of programs or positions in a special 11education joint agreement, then written notice must be mailed 12to the teacher and also given to the teacher either by 13electronic mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, or 14personal delivery with receipt on or before April 15, together 15with a statement of honorable dismissal and the reason 16therefor, and in all such cases the sequence of dismissal 17shall occur in accordance with this subsection (b); except 18that this subsection (b) shall not impair the operation of any 19affirmative action program in the school district, regardless 20of whether it exists by operation of law or is conducted on a 21voluntary basis by the board.22    Each teacher must be categorized into one or more 23positions for which the teacher is qualified to hold, based 24upon legal qualifications and any other qualifications 25established in a district or joint agreement job description, 26on or before the May 10 prior to the school year during which   10400HB2970sam001- 5 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1the sequence of dismissal is determined. Within each position 2and subject to agreements made by the joint committee on 3honorable dismissals that are authorized by subsection (c) of 4this Section, the school district or joint agreement must 5establish 4 groupings of teachers qualified to hold the 6position as follows:7        (1) Grouping one shall consist of each teacher who is 8    not in contractual continued service and who (i) has not 9    received a performance evaluation rating, (ii) is employed 10    for one school term or less to replace a teacher on leave, 11    or (iii) is employed on a part-time basis. "Part-time 12    basis" for the purposes of this subsection (b) means a 13    teacher who is employed to teach less than a full-day, 14    teacher workload or less than 5 days of the normal student 15    attendance week, unless otherwise provided for in a 16    collective bargaining agreement between the district and 17    the exclusive representative of the district's teachers. 18    For the purposes of this Section, a teacher (A) who is 19    employed as a full-time teacher but who actually teaches 20    or is otherwise present and participating in the 21    district's educational program for less than a school term 22    or (B) who, in the immediately previous school term, was 23    employed on a full-time basis and actually taught or was 24    otherwise present and participated in the district's 25    educational program for 120 days or more is not considered 26    employed on a part-time basis.  10400HB2970sam001- 6 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1        (2) Grouping 2 shall consist of each teacher with a 2    Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory performance evaluation 3    rating on either of the teacher's last 2 performance 4    evaluation ratings.5        (3) Grouping 3 shall consist of each teacher with a 6    performance evaluation rating of at least Satisfactory or 7    Proficient on both of the teacher's last 2 performance 8    evaluation ratings, if 2 ratings are available, or on the 9    teacher's last performance evaluation rating, if only one 10    rating is available, unless the teacher qualifies for 11    placement into grouping 4.12        (4) Grouping 4 shall consist of each teacher whose 13    last 2 performance evaluation ratings are Excellent and 14    each teacher with 2 Excellent performance evaluation 15    ratings out of the teacher's last 3 performance evaluation 16    ratings with a third rating of Satisfactory or Proficient.17    Among teachers qualified to hold a position, teachers must 18be dismissed in the order of their groupings, with teachers in 19grouping one dismissed first and teachers in grouping 4 20dismissed last.21    Within grouping one, the sequence of dismissal must be at 22the discretion of the school district or joint agreement. 23Within grouping 2, the sequence of dismissal must be based 24upon average performance evaluation ratings, with the teacher 25or teachers with the lowest average performance evaluation 26rating dismissed first. A teacher's average performance   10400HB2970sam001- 7 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1evaluation rating must be calculated using the average of the 2teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings, if 2 ratings 3are available, or the teacher's last performance evaluation 4rating, if only one rating is available, using the following 5numerical values: 4 for Excellent; 3 for Proficient or 6Satisfactory; 2 for Needs Improvement; and 1 for 7Unsatisfactory. As between or among teachers in grouping 2 8with the same average performance evaluation rating and within 9each of groupings 3 and 4, the teacher or teachers with the 10shorter length of continuing service with the school district 11or joint agreement must be dismissed first unless an 12alternative method of determining the sequence of dismissal is 13established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract 14between the board and a professional faculty members' 15organization.16    Each board, including the governing board of a joint 17agreement, shall, in consultation with any exclusive employee 18representatives, each year establish a sequence of honorable 19dismissal list categorized by positions and the groupings 20defined in this subsection (b). Copies of the list showing 21each teacher by name, along with the race or ethnicity of the 22teacher if provided by the teacher, and categorized by 23positions and the groupings defined in this subsection (b) 24must be distributed to the exclusive bargaining representative 25at least 75 days before the end of the school term, provided 26that the school district or joint agreement may, with notice   10400HB2970sam001- 8 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1to any exclusive employee representatives, move teachers from 2grouping one into another grouping during the period of time 3from 75 days until April 15. Each year, each board shall also 4establish, in consultation with any exclusive employee 5representatives, a list showing the length of continuing 6service of each teacher who is qualified to hold any such 7positions, unless an alternative method of determining a 8sequence of dismissal is established as provided for in this 9Section, in which case a list must be made in accordance with 10the alternative method. Copies of the list must be distributed 11to the exclusive employee representative at least 75 days 12before the end of the school term. 13    Any teacher dismissed as a result of such decrease or 14discontinuance must be paid all earned compensation on or 15before the third business day following the last day of pupil 16attendance in the regular school term.17    If the board or joint agreement has any vacancies for the 18following school term or within one calendar year from the 19beginning of the following school term, the positions thereby 20becoming available must be tendered to the teachers so removed 21or dismissed who were in grouping 3 or 4 of the sequence of 22dismissal and are qualified to hold the positions, based upon 23legal qualifications and any other qualifications established 24in a district or joint agreement job description, on or before 25the May 10 prior to the date of the positions becoming 26available, provided that if the number of honorable dismissal   10400HB2970sam001- 9 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1notices based on economic necessity exceeds 15% of the number 2of full-time equivalent positions filled by certified 3employees (excluding principals and administrative personnel) 4during the preceding school year, then the recall period is 5for the following school term or within 2 calendar years from 6the beginning of the following school term. If the board or 7joint agreement has any vacancies within the period from the 8beginning of the following school term through February 1 of 9the following school term (unless a date later than February 101, but no later than 6 months from the beginning of the 11following school term, is established in a collective 12bargaining agreement), the positions thereby becoming 13available must be tendered to the teachers so removed or 14dismissed who were in grouping 2 of the sequence of dismissal 15due to one "needs improvement" rating on either of the 16teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings, provided 17that, if 2 ratings are available, the other performance 18evaluation rating used for grouping purposes is 19"satisfactory", "proficient", or "excellent", and are 20qualified to hold the positions, based upon legal 21qualifications and any other qualifications established in a 22district or joint agreement job description, on or before the 23May 10 prior to the date of the positions becoming available. 24On and after July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 2598-648), the preceding sentence shall apply to teachers 26removed or dismissed by honorable dismissal, even if notice of   10400HB2970sam001- 10 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1honorable dismissal occurred during the 2013-2014 school year. 2Among teachers eligible for recall pursuant to the preceding 3sentence, the order of recall must be in inverse order of 4dismissal, unless an alternative order of recall is 5established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract 6between the board and a professional faculty members' 7organization. Whenever the number of honorable dismissal 8notices based upon economic necessity exceeds 5 notices or 9150% of the average number of teachers honorably dismissed in 10the preceding 3 years, whichever is more, then the school 11board or governing board of a joint agreement, as applicable, 12shall also hold a public hearing on the question of the 13dismissals. Following the hearing and board review, the action 14to approve any such reduction shall require a majority vote of 15the board members.16    For purposes of this subsection (b), subject to agreement 17on an alternative definition reached by the joint committee 18described in subsection (c) of this Section, a teacher's 19performance evaluation rating means the overall performance 20evaluation rating resulting from an annual or biennial 21performance evaluation conducted pursuant to Article 24A of 22this Code by the school district or joint agreement 23determining the sequence of dismissal, not including any 24performance evaluation conducted during or at the end of a 25remediation period. No more than one evaluation rating each 26school term shall be one of the evaluation ratings used for the   10400HB2970sam001- 11 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. Except as 2otherwise provided in this subsection for any performance 3evaluations conducted during or at the end of a remediation 4period, if multiple performance evaluations are conducted in a 5school term, only the rating from the last evaluation 6conducted prior to establishing the sequence of honorable 7dismissal list in such school term shall be the one evaluation 8rating from that school term used for the purpose of 9determining the sequence of dismissal. Averaging ratings from 10multiple evaluations is not permitted unless otherwise agreed 11to in a collective bargaining agreement or contract between 12the board and a professional faculty members' organization. 13The preceding 3 sentences are not a legislative declaration 14that existing law does or does not already require that only 15one performance evaluation each school term shall be used for 16the purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. For 17performance evaluation ratings determined prior to September 181, 2012, any school district or joint agreement with a 19performance evaluation rating system that does not use either 20of the rating category systems specified in subsection (d) of 21Section 24A-5 of this Code for all teachers must establish a 22basis for assigning each teacher a rating that complies with 23subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code for all of the 24performance evaluation ratings that are to be used to 25determine the sequence of dismissal. A teacher's grouping and 26ranking on a sequence of honorable dismissal shall be deemed a   10400HB2970sam001- 12 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1part of the teacher's performance evaluation, and that 2information shall be disclosed to the exclusive bargaining 3representative as part of a sequence of honorable dismissal 4list, notwithstanding any laws prohibiting disclosure of such 5information. A performance evaluation rating may be used to 6determine the sequence of dismissal, notwithstanding the 7pendency of any grievance resolution or arbitration procedures 8relating to the performance evaluation. If a teacher has 9received at least one performance evaluation rating conducted 10by the school district or joint agreement determining the 11sequence of dismissal and a subsequent performance evaluation 12is not conducted in any school year in which such evaluation is 13required to be conducted under Section 24A-5 of this Code, the 14teacher's performance evaluation rating for that school year 15for purposes of determining the sequence of dismissal is 16deemed Proficient, except that, during any time in which the 17Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health 18emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency 19Management Agency Act, this default to Proficient does not 20apply to any teacher who has entered into contractual 21continued service and who was deemed Excellent on his or her 22most recent evaluation. During any time in which the Governor 23has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency 24pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 25Agency Act and unless the school board and any exclusive 26bargaining representative have completed the performance   10400HB2970sam001- 13 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1rating for teachers or have mutually agreed to an alternate 2performance rating, any teacher who has entered into 3contractual continued service, whose most recent evaluation 4was deemed Excellent, and whose performance evaluation is not 5conducted when the evaluation is required to be conducted 6shall receive a teacher's performance rating deemed Excellent. 7A school board and any exclusive bargaining representative may 8mutually agree to an alternate performance rating for teachers 9not in contractual continued service during any time in which 10the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health 11emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency 12Management Agency Act, as long as the agreement is in writing. 13If a performance evaluation rating is nullified as the result 14of an arbitration, administrative agency, or court 15determination, then the school district or joint agreement is 16deemed to have conducted a performance evaluation for that 17school year, but the performance evaluation rating may not be 18used in determining the sequence of dismissal.19    Nothing in this subsection (b) shall be construed as 20limiting the right of a school board or governing board of a 21joint agreement to dismiss a teacher not in contractual 22continued service in accordance with Section 24-11 of this 23Code.24    Any provisions regarding the sequence of honorable 25dismissals and recall of honorably dismissed teachers in a 26collective bargaining agreement entered into on or before   10400HB2970sam001- 14 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1January 1, 2011 and in effect on June 13, 2011 (the effective 2date of Public Act 97-8) that may conflict with Public Act 97-8 3shall remain in effect through the expiration of such 4agreement or June 30, 2013, whichever is earlier.5    (c) Each school district and special education joint 6agreement must use a joint committee composed of equal 7representation selected by the school board and its teachers 8or, if applicable, the exclusive bargaining representative of 9its teachers, to address the matters described in paragraphs 10(1) through (5) of this subsection (c) pertaining to honorable 11dismissals under subsection (b) of this Section.12        (1) The joint committee must consider and may agree to 13    criteria for excluding from grouping 2 and placing into 14    grouping 3 a teacher whose last 2 performance evaluations 15    include a Needs Improvement and either a Proficient or 16    Excellent.17        (2) The joint committee must consider and may agree to 18    an alternative definition for grouping 4, which definition 19    must take into account prior performance evaluation 20    ratings and may take into account other factors that 21    relate to the school district's or program's educational 22    objectives. An alternative definition for grouping 4 may 23    not permit the inclusion of a teacher in the grouping with 24    a Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory performance 25    evaluation rating on either of the teacher's last 2 26    performance evaluation ratings.  10400HB2970sam001- 15 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1        (3) The joint committee may agree to including within 2    the definition of a performance evaluation rating a 3    performance evaluation rating administered by a school 4    district or joint agreement other than the school district 5    or joint agreement determining the sequence of dismissal.6        (4) For each school district or joint agreement that 7    administers performance evaluation ratings that are 8    inconsistent with either of the rating category systems 9    specified in subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code, 10    the school district or joint agreement must consult with 11    the joint committee on the basis for assigning a rating 12    that complies with subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this 13    Code to each performance evaluation rating that will be 14    used in a sequence of dismissal.15        (5) Upon request by a joint committee member submitted 16    to the employing board by no later than 10 days after the 17    distribution of the sequence of honorable dismissal list, 18    a representative of the employing board shall, within 5 19    days after the request, provide to members of the joint 20    committee a list showing the most recent and prior 21    performance evaluation ratings of each teacher identified 22    only by length of continuing service in the district or 23    joint agreement and not by name. If, after review of this 24    list, a member of the joint committee has a good faith 25    belief that a disproportionate number of teachers with 26    greater length of continuing service with the district or   10400HB2970sam001- 16 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    joint agreement have received a recent performance 2    evaluation rating lower than the prior rating, the member 3    may request that the joint committee review the list to 4    assess whether such a trend may exist. Following the joint 5    committee's review, but by no later than the end of the 6    applicable school term, the joint committee or any member 7    or members of the joint committee may submit a report of 8    the review to the employing board and exclusive bargaining 9    representative, if any. Nothing in this paragraph (5) 10    shall impact the order of honorable dismissal or a school 11    district's or joint agreement's authority to carry out a 12    dismissal in accordance with subsection (b) of this 13    Section.14    Agreement by the joint committee as to a matter requires 15the majority vote of all committee members, and if the joint 16committee does not reach agreement on a matter, then the 17otherwise applicable requirements of subsection (b) of this 18Section shall apply. Except as explicitly set forth in this 19subsection (c), a joint committee has no authority to agree to 20any further modifications to the requirements for honorable 21dismissals set forth in subsection (b) of this Section. The 22joint committee must be established, and the first meeting of 23the joint committee each school year must occur on or before 24December 1.25    The joint committee must reach agreement on a matter on or 26before February 1 of a school year in order for the agreement   10400HB2970sam001- 17 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1of the joint committee to apply to the sequence of dismissal 2determined during that school year. Subject to the February 1 3deadline for agreements, the agreement of a joint committee on 4a matter shall apply to the sequence of dismissal until the 5agreement is amended or terminated by the joint committee. 6    The provisions of the Open Meetings Act shall not apply to 7meetings of a joint committee created under this subsection 8(c). 9    (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 10subsection (d), the requirements and dismissal procedures of 11Section 24-16.5 of this Code shall apply to any dismissal 12sought under Section 24-16.5 of this Code.13        (1) If a dismissal of a teacher in contractual 14    continued service is sought for any reason or cause other 15    than an honorable dismissal under subsections (a) or (b) 16    of this Section or a dismissal sought under Section 17    24-16.5 of this Code, including those under Section 18    10-22.4, the board must first approve a motion containing 19    specific charges by a majority vote of all its members. 20    Written notice of such charges, including a bill of 21    particulars and the teacher's right to request a hearing, 22    must be mailed to the teacher and also given to the teacher 23    either by electronic mail, certified mail, return receipt 24    requested, or personal delivery with receipt within 5 days 25    of the adoption of the motion. Any written notice sent on 26    or after July 1, 2012 shall inform the teacher of the right   10400HB2970sam001- 18 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    to request a hearing before a mutually selected hearing 2    officer, with the cost of the hearing officer split 3    equally between the teacher and the board, or a hearing 4    before a board-selected hearing officer, with the cost of 5    the hearing officer paid by the board.6        Before setting a hearing on charges stemming from 7    causes that are considered remediable, a board must give 8    the teacher reasonable warning in writing, stating 9    specifically the causes that, if not removed, may result 10    in charges; however, no such written warning is required 11    if the causes have been the subject of a remediation plan 12    pursuant to Article 24A of this Code. The teacher may 13    grieve the issuance of such warning pursuant to the 14    applicable collective bargaining agreement to determine 15    whether the board had just cause in issuing the warning. A 16    notice of remedial warning must narrowly specify the 17    nature of the alleged misconduct that needs to be 18    remedied. Nothing in this Section precludes a board from 19    asserting that the specific conduct alleged in an original 20    notice of remedial warning letter is part of an alleged 21    pattern of behavior, but the original warning or 22    subsequent action taken must be reasonably related to the 23    specific conduct alleged. Under no circumstances may a 24    notice of remedial warning remain effective for longer 25    than 4 years from the date of the issuance of the notice of 26    remedial warning. The school district shall use reasonable   10400HB2970sam001- 19 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    efforts to remove the notice of remedial warning from the 2    teacher's personnel file after the 4 years have elapsed or 3    sooner if agreed through the exclusive bargaining 4    representative. A notice of remedial warning may not 5    include misconduct deemed irremediable or actions that are 6    injurious to or endanger the health or person of students 7    in the classroom or school, including, but not limited to, 8    acts of sexual misconduct as defined in Section 22-85.5 of 9    this Code. 10        If, in the opinion of the board, the interests of the 11    school require it, the board may suspend the teacher 12    without pay, pending the hearing, but if the board's 13    dismissal or removal is not sustained, the teacher shall 14    not suffer the loss of any salary or benefits by reason of 15    the suspension.16        (2) No hearing upon the charges is required unless the 17    teacher within 17 days after receiving notice requests in 18    writing of the board that a hearing be scheduled before a 19    mutually selected hearing officer or a hearing officer 20    selected by the board. The secretary of the school board 21    shall forward a copy of the notice to the State Board of 22    Education.23        (3) Within 5 business days after receiving a notice of 24    hearing in which either notice to the teacher was sent 25    before July 1, 2012 or, if the notice was sent on or after 26    July 1, 2012, the teacher has requested a hearing before a   10400HB2970sam001- 20 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    mutually selected hearing officer, the State Board of 2    Education shall provide a list of 5 prospective, impartial 3    hearing officers from the master list of qualified, 4    impartial hearing officers maintained by the State Board 5    of Education. Each person on the master list must (i) be 6    accredited by a national arbitration organization and have 7    had a minimum of 5 years of experience directly related to 8    labor and employment relations matters between employers 9    and employees or their exclusive bargaining 10    representatives and (ii) beginning September 1, 2012, have 11    participated in training provided or approved by the State 12    Board of Education for teacher dismissal hearing officers 13    so that he or she is familiar with issues generally 14    involved in evaluative and non-evaluative dismissals.15        If notice to the teacher was sent before July 1, 2012 16    or, if the notice was sent on or after July 1, 2012, the 17    teacher has requested a hearing before a mutually selected 18    hearing officer, the board and the teacher or their legal 19    representatives within 3 business days shall alternately 20    strike one name from the list provided by the State Board 21    of Education until only one name remains. Unless waived by 22    the teacher, the teacher shall have the right to proceed 23    first with the striking. Within 3 business days of receipt 24    of the list provided by the State Board of Education, the 25    board and the teacher or their legal representatives shall 26    each have the right to reject all prospective hearing   10400HB2970sam001- 21 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    officers named on the list and notify the State Board of 2    Education of such rejection. Within 3 business days after 3    receiving this notification, the State Board of Education 4    shall appoint a qualified person from the master list who 5    did not appear on the list sent to the parties to serve as 6    the hearing officer, unless the parties notify it that 7    they have chosen to alternatively select a hearing officer 8    under paragraph (4) of this subsection (d).9        If the teacher has requested a hearing before a 10    hearing officer selected by the board, the board shall 11    select one name from the master list of qualified 12    impartial hearing officers maintained by the State Board 13    of Education within 3 business days after receipt and 14    shall notify the State Board of Education of its 15    selection.16        A hearing officer mutually selected by the parties, 17    selected by the board, or selected through an alternative 18    selection process under paragraph (4) of this subsection 19    (d) (A) must not be a resident of the school district, (B) 20    must be available to commence the hearing within 75 days 21    and conclude the hearing within 120 days after being 22    selected as the hearing officer, and (C) must issue a 23    decision as to whether the teacher must be dismissed and 24    give a copy of that decision to both the teacher and the 25    board within 30 days from the conclusion of the hearing or 26    closure of the record, whichever is later.  10400HB2970sam001- 22 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1        Any hearing convened during a public health emergency 2    pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 3    Agency Act may be convened remotely. Any hearing officer 4    for a hearing convened during a public health emergency 5    pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 6    Agency Act may voluntarily withdraw from the hearing and 7    another hearing officer shall be selected or appointed 8    pursuant to this Section. 9        In this paragraph, "pre-hearing procedures" refers to 10    the pre-hearing procedures under Section 51.55 of Title 23 11    of the Illinois Administrative Code and "hearing" refers 12    to the hearing under Section 51.60 of Title 23 of the 13    Illinois Administrative Code. Any teacher who has been 14    charged with engaging in acts of corporal punishment, 15    physical abuse, grooming, or sexual misconduct and who 16    previously paused pre-hearing procedures or a hearing 17    pursuant to Public Act 101-643 must proceed with selection 18    of a hearing officer or hearing date, or both, within the 19    timeframes established by this paragraph (3) and 20    paragraphs (4) through (6) of this subsection (d), unless 21    the timeframes are mutually waived in writing by both 22    parties, and all timelines set forth in this Section in 23    cases concerning corporal punishment, physical abuse, 24    grooming, or sexual misconduct shall be reset to begin the 25    day after April 22, 2022 (the effective date of Public Act 26    102-708). Any teacher charged with engaging in acts of   10400HB2970sam001- 23 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    corporal punishment, physical abuse, grooming, or sexual 2    misconduct on or after April 22, 2022 (the effective date 3    of Public Act 102-708) may not pause pre-hearing 4    procedures or a hearing.5        (4) In the alternative to selecting a hearing officer 6    from the list received from the State Board of Education 7    or accepting the appointment of a hearing officer by the 8    State Board of Education or if the State Board of 9    Education cannot provide a list or appoint a hearing 10    officer that meets the foregoing requirements, the board 11    and the teacher or their legal representatives may 12    mutually agree to select an impartial hearing officer who 13    is not on the master list either by direct appointment by 14    the parties or by using procedures for the appointment of 15    an arbitrator established by the Federal Mediation and 16    Conciliation Service or the American Arbitration 17    Association. The parties shall notify the State Board of 18    Education of their intent to select a hearing officer 19    using an alternative procedure within 3 business days of 20    receipt of a list of prospective hearing officers provided 21    by the State Board of Education, notice of appointment of 22    a hearing officer by the State Board of Education, or 23    receipt of notice from the State Board of Education that 24    it cannot provide a list that meets the foregoing 25    requirements, whichever is later. 26        (5) If the notice of dismissal was sent to the teacher   10400HB2970sam001- 24 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    before July 1, 2012, the fees and costs for the hearing 2    officer must be paid by the State Board of Education. If 3    the notice of dismissal was sent to the teacher on or after 4    July 1, 2012, the hearing officer's fees and costs must be 5    paid as follows in this paragraph (5). The fees and 6    permissible costs for the hearing officer must be 7    determined by the State Board of Education. If the board 8    and the teacher or their legal representatives mutually 9    agree to select an impartial hearing officer who is not on 10    a list received from the State Board of Education, they 11    may agree to supplement the fees determined by the State 12    Board to the hearing officer, at a rate consistent with 13    the hearing officer's published professional fees. If the 14    hearing officer is mutually selected by the parties, then 15    the board and the teacher or their legal representatives 16    shall each pay 50% of the fees and costs and any 17    supplemental allowance to which they agree. If the hearing 18    officer is selected by the board, then the board shall pay 19    100% of the hearing officer's fees and costs. The fees and 20    costs must be paid to the hearing officer within 14 days 21    after the board and the teacher or their legal 22    representatives receive the hearing officer's decision set 23    forth in paragraph (7) of this subsection (d).24        (6) The teacher is required to answer the bill of 25    particulars and aver affirmative matters in his or her 26    defense, and the time for initially doing so and the time   10400HB2970sam001- 25 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    for updating such answer and defenses after pre-hearing 2    discovery must be set by the hearing officer. The State 3    Board of Education shall promulgate rules so that each 4    party has a fair opportunity to present its case and to 5    ensure that the dismissal process proceeds in a fair and 6    expeditious manner. These rules shall address, without 7    limitation, discovery and hearing scheduling conferences; 8    the teacher's initial answer and affirmative defenses to 9    the bill of particulars and the updating of that 10    information after pre-hearing discovery; provision for 11    written interrogatories and requests for production of 12    documents; the requirement that each party initially 13    disclose to the other party and then update the disclosure 14    no later than 10 calendar days prior to the commencement 15    of the hearing, the names and addresses of persons who may 16    be called as witnesses at the hearing, a summary of the 17    facts or opinions each witness will testify to, and all 18    other documents and materials, including information 19    maintained electronically, relevant to its own as well as 20    the other party's case (the hearing officer may exclude 21    witnesses and exhibits not identified and shared, except 22    those offered in rebuttal for which the party could not 23    reasonably have anticipated prior to the hearing); 24    pre-hearing discovery and preparation, including provision 25    for written interrogatories and requests for production of 26    documents, provided that discovery depositions are   10400HB2970sam001- 26 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    prohibited; the conduct of the hearing; the right of each 2    party to be represented by counsel, the offer of evidence 3    and witnesses and the cross-examination of witnesses; the 4    authority of the hearing officer to issue subpoenas and 5    subpoenas duces tecum, provided that the hearing officer 6    may limit the number of witnesses to be subpoenaed on 7    behalf of each party to no more than 7; the length of 8    post-hearing briefs; and the form, length, and content of 9    hearing officers' decisions. The hearing officer shall 10    hold a hearing and render a final decision for dismissal 11    pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or shall report to the 12    school board findings of fact and a recommendation as to 13    whether or not the teacher must be dismissed for conduct. 14    The hearing officer shall commence the hearing within 75 15    days and conclude the hearing within 120 days after being 16    selected as the hearing officer, provided that the hearing 17    officer may modify these timelines upon the showing of 18    good cause or mutual agreement of the parties. Good cause 19    for the purpose of this subsection (d) shall mean the 20    illness or otherwise unavoidable emergency of the teacher, 21    district representative, their legal representatives, the 22    hearing officer, or an essential witness as indicated in 23    each party's pre-hearing submission. In a dismissal 24    hearing pursuant to Article 24A of this Code in which a 25    witness is a student or is under the age of 18, the hearing 26    officer must make accommodations for the witness, as   10400HB2970sam001- 27 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    provided under paragraph (6.5) of this subsection. The 2    hearing officer shall consider and give weight to all of 3    the teacher's evaluations written pursuant to Article 24A 4    that are relevant to the issues in the hearing.5        Each party shall have no more than 3 days to present 6    its case, unless extended by the hearing officer to enable 7    a party to present adequate evidence and testimony, 8    including due to the other party's cross-examination of 9    the party's witnesses, for good cause or by mutual 10    agreement of the parties. The State Board of Education 11    shall define in rules the meaning of "day" for such 12    purposes. All testimony at the hearing shall be taken 13    under oath administered by the hearing officer. The 14    hearing officer shall cause a record of the proceedings to 15    be kept and shall employ a competent reporter to take 16    stenographic or stenotype notes of all the testimony. The 17    costs of the reporter's attendance and services at the 18    hearing shall be paid by the party or parties who are 19    responsible for paying the fees and costs of the hearing 20    officer. Either party desiring a transcript of the hearing 21    shall pay for the cost thereof. Any post-hearing briefs 22    must be submitted by the parties by no later than 21 days 23    after a party's receipt of the transcript of the hearing, 24    unless extended by the hearing officer for good cause or 25    by mutual agreement of the parties.26        (6.5) In the case of charges involving any witness who   10400HB2970sam001- 28 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    is or was at the time of the alleged conduct a student or a 2    person under the age of 18, the hearing officer shall make 3    accommodations to protect a witness from being 4    intimidated, traumatized, or re-traumatized. No alleged 5    victim or other witness who is or was at the time of the 6    alleged conduct a student or under the age of 18 may be 7    compelled to testify in the physical or visual presence of 8    a teacher or other witness. If such a witness invokes this 9    right, then the hearing officer must provide an 10    accommodation consistent with the invoked right and use a 11    procedure by which each party may hear such witness's 12    testimony. Accommodations may include, but are not limited 13    to: (i) testimony made via a telecommunication device in a 14    location other than the hearing room and outside the 15    physical or visual presence of the teacher and other 16    hearing participants, but accessible to the teacher via a 17    telecommunication device, (ii) testimony made in the 18    hearing room but outside the physical presence of the 19    teacher and accessible to the teacher via a 20    telecommunication device, (iii) non-public testimony, (iv) 21    testimony made via videoconference with the cameras and 22    microphones of the teacher turned off, or (v) pre-recorded 23    testimony, including, but not limited to, a recording of a 24    forensic interview conducted at an accredited Children's 25    Advocacy Center. With all accommodations, the hearing 26    officer shall give such testimony the same consideration   10400HB2970sam001- 29 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    as if the witness testified without the accommodation. The 2    teacher may not directly, or through a representative, 3    question a witness called by the school board who is or was 4    a student or under 18 years of age at the time of the 5    alleged conduct. The hearing officer must permit the 6    teacher to submit all relevant questions and follow-up 7    questions for such a witness to have the questions posed 8    by the hearing officer. All questions must exclude 9    evidence of the witness' sexual behavior or 10    predisposition, unless the evidence is offered to prove 11    that someone other than the teacher subject to the 12    dismissal hearing engaged in the charge at issue. 13        (7) The hearing officer shall, within 30 days from the 14    conclusion of the hearing or closure of the record, 15    whichever is later, make a decision as to whether or not 16    the teacher shall be dismissed pursuant to Article 24A of 17    this Code or report to the school board findings of fact 18    and a recommendation as to whether or not the teacher 19    shall be dismissed for cause and shall give a copy of the 20    decision or findings of fact and recommendation to both 21    the teacher and the school board. If a hearing officer 22    fails without good cause, specifically provided in writing 23    to both parties and the State Board of Education, to 24    render a decision or findings of fact and recommendation 25    within 30 days after the hearing is concluded or the 26    record is closed, whichever is later, the parties may   10400HB2970sam001- 30 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    mutually agree to select a hearing officer pursuant to the 2    alternative procedure, as provided in this Section, to 3    rehear the charges heard by the hearing officer who failed 4    to render a decision or findings of fact and 5    recommendation or to review the record and render a 6    decision. If any hearing officer fails without good cause, 7    specifically provided in writing to both parties and the 8    State Board of Education, to render a decision or findings 9    of fact and recommendation within 30 days after the 10    hearing is concluded or the record is closed, whichever is 11    later, or if any hearing officer fails to make an 12    accommodation as described in paragraph (6.5), the hearing 13    officer shall be removed from the master list of hearing 14    officers maintained by the State Board of Education for 15    not more than 24 months. The parties and the State Board of 16    Education may also take such other actions as it deems 17    appropriate, including recovering, reducing, or 18    withholding any fees paid or to be paid to the hearing 19    officer. If any hearing officer repeats such failure, he 20    or she must be permanently removed from the master list 21    maintained by the State Board of Education and may not be 22    selected by parties through the alternative selection 23    process under this paragraph (7) or paragraph (4) of this 24    subsection (d). The board shall not lose jurisdiction to 25    discharge a teacher if the hearing officer fails to render 26    a decision or findings of fact and recommendation within   10400HB2970sam001- 31 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    the time specified in this Section. If the decision of the 2    hearing officer for dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of 3    this Code or of the school board for dismissal for cause is 4    in favor of the teacher, then the hearing officer or 5    school board shall order reinstatement to the same or 6    substantially equivalent position and shall determine the 7    amount for which the school board is liable, including, 8    but not limited to, loss of income and benefits.9        (8) The school board, within 45 days after receipt of 10    the hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation 11    as to whether (i) the conduct at issue occurred, (ii) the 12    conduct that did occur was remediable, and (iii) the 13    proposed dismissal should be sustained, shall issue a 14    written order as to whether the teacher must be retained 15    or dismissed for cause from its employ. The school board's 16    written order shall incorporate the hearing officer's 17    findings of fact, except that the school board may modify 18    or supplement the findings of fact if, in its opinion, the 19    findings of fact are against the manifest weight of the 20    evidence.21        If the school board dismisses the teacher 22    notwithstanding the hearing officer's findings of fact and 23    recommendation, the school board shall make a conclusion 24    in its written order, giving its reasons therefor, and 25    such conclusion and reasons must be included in its 26    written order. The failure of the school board to strictly   10400HB2970sam001- 32 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    adhere to the timelines contained in this Section shall 2    not render it without jurisdiction to dismiss the teacher. 3    The school board shall not lose jurisdiction to discharge 4    the teacher for cause if the hearing officer fails to 5    render a recommendation within the time specified in this 6    Section. The decision of the school board is final, unless 7    reviewed as provided in paragraph (9) of this subsection 8    (d).9        If the school board retains the teacher, the school 10    board shall enter a written order stating the amount of 11    back pay and lost benefits, less mitigation, to be paid to 12    the teacher, within 45 days after its retention order. 13    Should the teacher object to the amount of the back pay and 14    lost benefits or amount mitigated, the teacher shall give 15    written objections to the amount within 21 days. If the 16    parties fail to reach resolution within 7 days, the 17    dispute shall be referred to the hearing officer, who 18    shall consider the school board's written order and 19    teacher's written objection and determine the amount to 20    which the school board is liable. The costs of the hearing 21    officer's review and determination must be paid by the 22    board.23        (9) The decision of the hearing officer pursuant to 24    Article 24A of this Code or of the school board's decision 25    to dismiss for cause is final unless reviewed as provided 26    in Section 24-16 of this Code. If the school board's   10400HB2970sam001- 33 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    decision to dismiss for cause is contrary to the hearing 2    officer's recommendation, the court on review shall give 3    consideration to the school board's decision and its 4    supplemental findings of fact, if applicable, and the 5    hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation in 6    making its decision. In the event such review is 7    instituted, the school board shall be responsible for 8    preparing and filing the record of proceedings, and such 9    costs associated therewith must be divided equally between 10    the parties.11        (10) If a decision of the hearing officer for 12    dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or of the 13    school board for dismissal for cause is adjudicated upon 14    review or appeal in favor of the teacher, then the trial 15    court shall order reinstatement and shall remand the 16    matter to the school board with direction for entry of an 17    order setting the amount of back pay, lost benefits, and 18    costs, less mitigation. The teacher may challenge the 19    school board's order setting the amount of back pay, lost 20    benefits, and costs, less mitigation, through an expedited 21    arbitration procedure, with the costs of the arbitrator 22    borne by the school board.23        Any teacher who is reinstated by any hearing or 24    adjudication brought under this Section shall be assigned 25    by the board to a position substantially similar to the 26    one which that teacher held prior to that teacher's   10400HB2970sam001- 34 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    suspension or dismissal.2        (11) Subject to any later effective date referenced in 3    this Section for a specific aspect of the dismissal 4    process, the changes made by Public Act 97-8 shall apply 5    to dismissals instituted on or after September 1, 2011. 6    Any dismissal instituted prior to September 1, 2011 must 7    be carried out in accordance with the requirements of this 8    Section prior to amendment by Public Act 97-8. 9    (e) Nothing contained in Public Act 98-648 repeals, 10supersedes, invalidates, or nullifies final decisions in 11lawsuits pending on July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public 12Act 98-648) in Illinois courts involving the interpretation of 13Public Act 97-8. 14(Source: P.A. 102-708, eff. 4-22-22; 103-354, eff. 1-1-24; 15103-398, eff. 1-1-24; 103-500, eff. 8-4-23; 103-605, eff. 167-1-24.) 17    Section 99.

If 12a teacher in contractual continued service is removed or 13dismissed as a result of a decision of the board to decrease 14the number of teachers employed by the board or to discontinue 15some particular type of teaching service, written notice shall 16be mailed to the teacher and also given the teacher either by   10400HB2970sam001- 2 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1certified mail, return receipt requested or personal delivery 2with receipt at least 60 days before the end of the school 3term, together with a statement of honorable dismissal and the 4reason therefor, and in all such cases the board shall first 5remove or dismiss all teachers who have not entered upon 6contractual continued service before removing or dismissing 7any teacher who has entered upon contractual continued service 8and who is legally qualified to hold a position currently held 9by a teacher who has not entered upon contractual continued 10service. 11    As between teachers who have entered upon contractual 12continued service, the teacher or teachers with the shorter 13length of continuing service with the district shall be 14dismissed first unless an alternative method of determining 15the sequence of dismissal is established in a collective 16bargaining agreement or contract between the board and a 17professional faculty members' organization and except that 18this provision shall not impair the operation of any 19affirmative action program in the district, regardless of 20whether it exists by operation of law or is conducted on a 21voluntary basis by the board. Any teacher dismissed as a 22result of such decrease or discontinuance shall be paid all 23earned compensation on or before the third business day 24following the last day of pupil attendance in the regular 25school term. 26    If the board has any vacancies for the following school   10400HB2970sam001- 3 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1term or within one calendar year from the beginning of the 2following school term, the positions thereby becoming 3available shall be tendered to the teachers so removed or 4dismissed so far as they are legally qualified to hold such 5positions; provided, however, that if the number of honorable 6dismissal notices based on economic necessity exceeds 15% of 7the number of full-time equivalent positions filled by 8certified employees (excluding principals and administrative 9personnel) during the preceding school year, then if the board 10has any vacancies for the following school term or within 2 11calendar years from the beginning of the following school 12term, the positions so becoming available shall be tendered to 13the teachers who were so notified and removed or dismissed 14whenever they are legally qualified to hold such positions. 15Each board shall, in consultation with any exclusive employee 16representatives, each year establish a list, categorized by 17positions, showing the length of continuing service of each 18teacher who is qualified to hold any such positions, unless an 19alternative method of determining a sequence of dismissal is 20established as provided for in this Section, in which case a 21list shall be made in accordance with the alternative method. 22Copies of the list shall be distributed to the exclusive 23employee representative on or before February 1 of each year. 24Whenever the number of honorable dismissal notices based upon 25economic necessity exceeds 5, or 150% of the average number of 26teachers honorably dismissed in the preceding 3 years,   10400HB2970sam001- 4 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1whichever is more, then the board also shall hold a public 2hearing on the question of the dismissals. Following the 3hearing and board review, the action to approve any such 4reduction shall require a majority vote of the board members.5    (b) If any teacher, whether or not in contractual 6continued service, is removed or dismissed as a result of a 7decision of a school board to decrease the number of teachers 8employed by the board, a decision of a school board to 9discontinue some particular type of teaching service, or a 10reduction in the number of programs or positions in a special 11education joint agreement, then written notice must be mailed 12to the teacher and also given to the teacher either by 13electronic mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, or 14personal delivery with receipt on or before April 15, together 15with a statement of honorable dismissal and the reason 16therefor, and in all such cases the sequence of dismissal 17shall occur in accordance with this subsection (b); except 18that this subsection (b) shall not impair the operation of any 19affirmative action program in the school district, regardless 20of whether it exists by operation of law or is conducted on a 21voluntary basis by the board.22    Each teacher must be categorized into one or more 23positions for which the teacher is qualified to hold, based 24upon legal qualifications and any other qualifications 25established in a district or joint agreement job description, 26on or before the May 10 prior to the school year during which   10400HB2970sam001- 5 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1the sequence of dismissal is determined. Within each position 2and subject to agreements made by the joint committee on 3honorable dismissals that are authorized by subsection (c) of 4this Section, the school district or joint agreement must 5establish 4 groupings of teachers qualified to hold the 6position as follows:7        (1) Grouping one shall consist of each teacher who is 8    not in contractual continued service and who (i) has not 9    received a performance evaluation rating, (ii) is employed 10    for one school term or less to replace a teacher on leave, 11    or (iii) is employed on a part-time basis. "Part-time 12    basis" for the purposes of this subsection (b) means a 13    teacher who is employed to teach less than a full-day, 14    teacher workload or less than 5 days of the normal student 15    attendance week, unless otherwise provided for in a 16    collective bargaining agreement between the district and 17    the exclusive representative of the district's teachers. 18    For the purposes of this Section, a teacher (A) who is 19    employed as a full-time teacher but who actually teaches 20    or is otherwise present and participating in the 21    district's educational program for less than a school term 22    or (B) who, in the immediately previous school term, was 23    employed on a full-time basis and actually taught or was 24    otherwise present and participated in the district's 25    educational program for 120 days or more is not considered 26    employed on a part-time basis.  10400HB2970sam001- 6 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1        (2) Grouping 2 shall consist of each teacher with a 2    Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory performance evaluation 3    rating on either of the teacher's last 2 performance 4    evaluation ratings.5        (3) Grouping 3 shall consist of each teacher with a 6    performance evaluation rating of at least Satisfactory or 7    Proficient on both of the teacher's last 2 performance 8    evaluation ratings, if 2 ratings are available, or on the 9    teacher's last performance evaluation rating, if only one 10    rating is available, unless the teacher qualifies for 11    placement into grouping 4.12        (4) Grouping 4 shall consist of each teacher whose 13    last 2 performance evaluation ratings are Excellent and 14    each teacher with 2 Excellent performance evaluation 15    ratings out of the teacher's last 3 performance evaluation 16    ratings with a third rating of Satisfactory or Proficient.17    Among teachers qualified to hold a position, teachers must 18be dismissed in the order of their groupings, with teachers in 19grouping one dismissed first and teachers in grouping 4 20dismissed last.21    Within grouping one, the sequence of dismissal must be at 22the discretion of the school district or joint agreement. 23Within grouping 2, the sequence of dismissal must be based 24upon average performance evaluation ratings, with the teacher 25or teachers with the lowest average performance evaluation 26rating dismissed first. A teacher's average performance   10400HB2970sam001- 7 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1evaluation rating must be calculated using the average of the 2teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings, if 2 ratings 3are available, or the teacher's last performance evaluation 4rating, if only one rating is available, using the following 5numerical values: 4 for Excellent; 3 for Proficient or 6Satisfactory; 2 for Needs Improvement; and 1 for 7Unsatisfactory. As between or among teachers in grouping 2 8with the same average performance evaluation rating and within 9each of groupings 3 and 4, the teacher or teachers with the 10shorter length of continuing service with the school district 11or joint agreement must be dismissed first unless an 12alternative method of determining the sequence of dismissal is 13established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract 14between the board and a professional faculty members' 15organization.16    Each board, including the governing board of a joint 17agreement, shall, in consultation with any exclusive employee 18representatives, each year establish a sequence of honorable 19dismissal list categorized by positions and the groupings 20defined in this subsection (b). Copies of the list showing 21each teacher by name, along with the race or ethnicity of the 22teacher if provided by the teacher, and categorized by 23positions and the groupings defined in this subsection (b) 24must be distributed to the exclusive bargaining representative 25at least 75 days before the end of the school term, provided 26that the school district or joint agreement may, with notice   10400HB2970sam001- 8 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1to any exclusive employee representatives, move teachers from 2grouping one into another grouping during the period of time 3from 75 days until April 15. Each year, each board shall also 4establish, in consultation with any exclusive employee 5representatives, a list showing the length of continuing 6service of each teacher who is qualified to hold any such 7positions, unless an alternative method of determining a 8sequence of dismissal is established as provided for in this 9Section, in which case a list must be made in accordance with 10the alternative method. Copies of the list must be distributed 11to the exclusive employee representative at least 75 days 12before the end of the school term. 13    Any teacher dismissed as a result of such decrease or 14discontinuance must be paid all earned compensation on or 15before the third business day following the last day of pupil 16attendance in the regular school term.17    If the board or joint agreement has any vacancies for the 18following school term or within one calendar year from the 19beginning of the following school term, the positions thereby 20becoming available must be tendered to the teachers so removed 21or dismissed who were in grouping 3 or 4 of the sequence of 22dismissal and are qualified to hold the positions, based upon 23legal qualifications and any other qualifications established 24in a district or joint agreement job description, on or before 25the May 10 prior to the date of the positions becoming 26available, provided that if the number of honorable dismissal   10400HB2970sam001- 9 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1notices based on economic necessity exceeds 15% of the number 2of full-time equivalent positions filled by certified 3employees (excluding principals and administrative personnel) 4during the preceding school year, then the recall period is 5for the following school term or within 2 calendar years from 6the beginning of the following school term. If the board or 7joint agreement has any vacancies within the period from the 8beginning of the following school term through February 1 of 9the following school term (unless a date later than February 101, but no later than 6 months from the beginning of the 11following school term, is established in a collective 12bargaining agreement), the positions thereby becoming 13available must be tendered to the teachers so removed or 14dismissed who were in grouping 2 of the sequence of dismissal 15due to one "needs improvement" rating on either of the 16teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings, provided 17that, if 2 ratings are available, the other performance 18evaluation rating used for grouping purposes is 19"satisfactory", "proficient", or "excellent", and are 20qualified to hold the positions, based upon legal 21qualifications and any other qualifications established in a 22district or joint agreement job description, on or before the 23May 10 prior to the date of the positions becoming available. 24On and after July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 2598-648), the preceding sentence shall apply to teachers 26removed or dismissed by honorable dismissal, even if notice of   10400HB2970sam001- 10 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1honorable dismissal occurred during the 2013-2014 school year. 2Among teachers eligible for recall pursuant to the preceding 3sentence, the order of recall must be in inverse order of 4dismissal, unless an alternative order of recall is 5established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract 6between the board and a professional faculty members' 7organization. Whenever the number of honorable dismissal 8notices based upon economic necessity exceeds 5 notices or 9150% of the average number of teachers honorably dismissed in 10the preceding 3 years, whichever is more, then the school 11board or governing board of a joint agreement, as applicable, 12shall also hold a public hearing on the question of the 13dismissals. Following the hearing and board review, the action 14to approve any such reduction shall require a majority vote of 15the board members.16    For purposes of this subsection (b), subject to agreement 17on an alternative definition reached by the joint committee 18described in subsection (c) of this Section, a teacher's 19performance evaluation rating means the overall performance 20evaluation rating resulting from an annual or biennial 21performance evaluation conducted pursuant to Article 24A of 22this Code by the school district or joint agreement 23determining the sequence of dismissal, not including any 24performance evaluation conducted during or at the end of a 25remediation period. No more than one evaluation rating each 26school term shall be one of the evaluation ratings used for the   10400HB2970sam001- 11 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. Except as 2otherwise provided in this subsection for any performance 3evaluations conducted during or at the end of a remediation 4period, if multiple performance evaluations are conducted in a 5school term, only the rating from the last evaluation 6conducted prior to establishing the sequence of honorable 7dismissal list in such school term shall be the one evaluation 8rating from that school term used for the purpose of 9determining the sequence of dismissal. Averaging ratings from 10multiple evaluations is not permitted unless otherwise agreed 11to in a collective bargaining agreement or contract between 12the board and a professional faculty members' organization. 13The preceding 3 sentences are not a legislative declaration 14that existing law does or does not already require that only 15one performance evaluation each school term shall be used for 16the purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. For 17performance evaluation ratings determined prior to September 181, 2012, any school district or joint agreement with a 19performance evaluation rating system that does not use either 20of the rating category systems specified in subsection (d) of 21Section 24A-5 of this Code for all teachers must establish a 22basis for assigning each teacher a rating that complies with 23subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code for all of the 24performance evaluation ratings that are to be used to 25determine the sequence of dismissal. A teacher's grouping and 26ranking on a sequence of honorable dismissal shall be deemed a   10400HB2970sam001- 12 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1part of the teacher's performance evaluation, and that 2information shall be disclosed to the exclusive bargaining 3representative as part of a sequence of honorable dismissal 4list, notwithstanding any laws prohibiting disclosure of such 5information. A performance evaluation rating may be used to 6determine the sequence of dismissal, notwithstanding the 7pendency of any grievance resolution or arbitration procedures 8relating to the performance evaluation. If a teacher has 9received at least one performance evaluation rating conducted 10by the school district or joint agreement determining the 11sequence of dismissal and a subsequent performance evaluation 12is not conducted in any school year in which such evaluation is 13required to be conducted under Section 24A-5 of this Code, the 14teacher's performance evaluation rating for that school year 15for purposes of determining the sequence of dismissal is 16deemed Proficient, except that, during any time in which the 17Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health 18emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency 19Management Agency Act, this default to Proficient does not 20apply to any teacher who has entered into contractual 21continued service and who was deemed Excellent on his or her 22most recent evaluation. During any time in which the Governor 23has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency 24pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 25Agency Act and unless the school board and any exclusive 26bargaining representative have completed the performance   10400HB2970sam001- 13 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1rating for teachers or have mutually agreed to an alternate 2performance rating, any teacher who has entered into 3contractual continued service, whose most recent evaluation 4was deemed Excellent, and whose performance evaluation is not 5conducted when the evaluation is required to be conducted 6shall receive a teacher's performance rating deemed Excellent. 7A school board and any exclusive bargaining representative may 8mutually agree to an alternate performance rating for teachers 9not in contractual continued service during any time in which 10the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health 11emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency 12Management Agency Act, as long as the agreement is in writing. 13If a performance evaluation rating is nullified as the result 14of an arbitration, administrative agency, or court 15determination, then the school district or joint agreement is 16deemed to have conducted a performance evaluation for that 17school year, but the performance evaluation rating may not be 18used in determining the sequence of dismissal.19    Nothing in this subsection (b) shall be construed as 20limiting the right of a school board or governing board of a 21joint agreement to dismiss a teacher not in contractual 22continued service in accordance with Section 24-11 of this 23Code.24    Any provisions regarding the sequence of honorable 25dismissals and recall of honorably dismissed teachers in a 26collective bargaining agreement entered into on or before   10400HB2970sam001- 14 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1January 1, 2011 and in effect on June 13, 2011 (the effective 2date of Public Act 97-8) that may conflict with Public Act 97-8 3shall remain in effect through the expiration of such 4agreement or June 30, 2013, whichever is earlier.5    (c) Each school district and special education joint 6agreement must use a joint committee composed of equal 7representation selected by the school board and its teachers 8or, if applicable, the exclusive bargaining representative of 9its teachers, to address the matters described in paragraphs 10(1) through (5) of this subsection (c) pertaining to honorable 11dismissals under subsection (b) of this Section.12        (1) The joint committee must consider and may agree to 13    criteria for excluding from grouping 2 and placing into 14    grouping 3 a teacher whose last 2 performance evaluations 15    include a Needs Improvement and either a Proficient or 16    Excellent.17        (2) The joint committee must consider and may agree to 18    an alternative definition for grouping 4, which definition 19    must take into account prior performance evaluation 20    ratings and may take into account other factors that 21    relate to the school district's or program's educational 22    objectives. An alternative definition for grouping 4 may 23    not permit the inclusion of a teacher in the grouping with 24    a Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory performance 25    evaluation rating on either of the teacher's last 2 26    performance evaluation ratings.  10400HB2970sam001- 15 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1        (3) The joint committee may agree to including within 2    the definition of a performance evaluation rating a 3    performance evaluation rating administered by a school 4    district or joint agreement other than the school district 5    or joint agreement determining the sequence of dismissal.6        (4) For each school district or joint agreement that 7    administers performance evaluation ratings that are 8    inconsistent with either of the rating category systems 9    specified in subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code, 10    the school district or joint agreement must consult with 11    the joint committee on the basis for assigning a rating 12    that complies with subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this 13    Code to each performance evaluation rating that will be 14    used in a sequence of dismissal.15        (5) Upon request by a joint committee member submitted 16    to the employing board by no later than 10 days after the 17    distribution of the sequence of honorable dismissal list, 18    a representative of the employing board shall, within 5 19    days after the request, provide to members of the joint 20    committee a list showing the most recent and prior 21    performance evaluation ratings of each teacher identified 22    only by length of continuing service in the district or 23    joint agreement and not by name. If, after review of this 24    list, a member of the joint committee has a good faith 25    belief that a disproportionate number of teachers with 26    greater length of continuing service with the district or   10400HB2970sam001- 16 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    joint agreement have received a recent performance 2    evaluation rating lower than the prior rating, the member 3    may request that the joint committee review the list to 4    assess whether such a trend may exist. Following the joint 5    committee's review, but by no later than the end of the 6    applicable school term, the joint committee or any member 7    or members of the joint committee may submit a report of 8    the review to the employing board and exclusive bargaining 9    representative, if any. Nothing in this paragraph (5) 10    shall impact the order of honorable dismissal or a school 11    district's or joint agreement's authority to carry out a 12    dismissal in accordance with subsection (b) of this 13    Section.14    Agreement by the joint committee as to a matter requires 15the majority vote of all committee members, and if the joint 16committee does not reach agreement on a matter, then the 17otherwise applicable requirements of subsection (b) of this 18Section shall apply. Except as explicitly set forth in this 19subsection (c), a joint committee has no authority to agree to 20any further modifications to the requirements for honorable 21dismissals set forth in subsection (b) of this Section. The 22joint committee must be established, and the first meeting of 23the joint committee each school year must occur on or before 24December 1.25    The joint committee must reach agreement on a matter on or 26before February 1 of a school year in order for the agreement   10400HB2970sam001- 17 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1of the joint committee to apply to the sequence of dismissal 2determined during that school year. Subject to the February 1 3deadline for agreements, the agreement of a joint committee on 4a matter shall apply to the sequence of dismissal until the 5agreement is amended or terminated by the joint committee. 6    The provisions of the Open Meetings Act shall not apply to 7meetings of a joint committee created under this subsection 8(c). 9    (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 10subsection (d), the requirements and dismissal procedures of 11Section 24-16.5 of this Code shall apply to any dismissal 12sought under Section 24-16.5 of this Code.13        (1) If a dismissal of a teacher in contractual 14    continued service is sought for any reason or cause other 15    than an honorable dismissal under subsections (a) or (b) 16    of this Section or a dismissal sought under Section 17    24-16.5 of this Code, including those under Section 18    10-22.4, the board must first approve a motion containing 19    specific charges by a majority vote of all its members. 20    Written notice of such charges, including a bill of 21    particulars and the teacher's right to request a hearing, 22    must be mailed to the teacher and also given to the teacher 23    either by electronic mail, certified mail, return receipt 24    requested, or personal delivery with receipt within 5 days 25    of the adoption of the motion. Any written notice sent on 26    or after July 1, 2012 shall inform the teacher of the right   10400HB2970sam001- 18 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    to request a hearing before a mutually selected hearing 2    officer, with the cost of the hearing officer split 3    equally between the teacher and the board, or a hearing 4    before a board-selected hearing officer, with the cost of 5    the hearing officer paid by the board.6        Before setting a hearing on charges stemming from 7    causes that are considered remediable, a board must give 8    the teacher reasonable warning in writing, stating 9    specifically the causes that, if not removed, may result 10    in charges; however, no such written warning is required 11    if the causes have been the subject of a remediation plan 12    pursuant to Article 24A of this Code. The teacher may 13    grieve the issuance of such warning pursuant to the 14    applicable collective bargaining agreement to determine 15    whether the board had just cause in issuing the warning. A 16    notice of remedial warning must narrowly specify the 17    nature of the alleged misconduct that needs to be 18    remedied. Nothing in this Section precludes a board from 19    asserting that the specific conduct alleged in an original 20    notice of remedial warning letter is part of an alleged 21    pattern of behavior, but the original warning or 22    subsequent action taken must be reasonably related to the 23    specific conduct alleged. Under no circumstances may a 24    notice of remedial warning remain effective for longer 25    than 4 years from the date of the issuance of the notice of 26    remedial warning. The school district shall use reasonable   10400HB2970sam001- 19 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    efforts to remove the notice of remedial warning from the 2    teacher's personnel file after the 4 years have elapsed or 3    sooner if agreed through the exclusive bargaining 4    representative. A notice of remedial warning may not 5    include misconduct deemed irremediable or actions that are 6    injurious to or endanger the health or person of students 7    in the classroom or school, including, but not limited to, 8    acts of sexual misconduct as defined in Section 22-85.5 of 9    this Code. 10        If, in the opinion of the board, the interests of the 11    school require it, the board may suspend the teacher 12    without pay, pending the hearing, but if the board's 13    dismissal or removal is not sustained, the teacher shall 14    not suffer the loss of any salary or benefits by reason of 15    the suspension.16        (2) No hearing upon the charges is required unless the 17    teacher within 17 days after receiving notice requests in 18    writing of the board that a hearing be scheduled before a 19    mutually selected hearing officer or a hearing officer 20    selected by the board. The secretary of the school board 21    shall forward a copy of the notice to the State Board of 22    Education.23        (3) Within 5 business days after receiving a notice of 24    hearing in which either notice to the teacher was sent 25    before July 1, 2012 or, if the notice was sent on or after 26    July 1, 2012, the teacher has requested a hearing before a   10400HB2970sam001- 20 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    mutually selected hearing officer, the State Board of 2    Education shall provide a list of 5 prospective, impartial 3    hearing officers from the master list of qualified, 4    impartial hearing officers maintained by the State Board 5    of Education. Each person on the master list must (i) be 6    accredited by a national arbitration organization and have 7    had a minimum of 5 years of experience directly related to 8    labor and employment relations matters between employers 9    and employees or their exclusive bargaining 10    representatives and (ii) beginning September 1, 2012, have 11    participated in training provided or approved by the State 12    Board of Education for teacher dismissal hearing officers 13    so that he or she is familiar with issues generally 14    involved in evaluative and non-evaluative dismissals.15        If notice to the teacher was sent before July 1, 2012 16    or, if the notice was sent on or after July 1, 2012, the 17    teacher has requested a hearing before a mutually selected 18    hearing officer, the board and the teacher or their legal 19    representatives within 3 business days shall alternately 20    strike one name from the list provided by the State Board 21    of Education until only one name remains. Unless waived by 22    the teacher, the teacher shall have the right to proceed 23    first with the striking. Within 3 business days of receipt 24    of the list provided by the State Board of Education, the 25    board and the teacher or their legal representatives shall 26    each have the right to reject all prospective hearing   10400HB2970sam001- 21 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    officers named on the list and notify the State Board of 2    Education of such rejection. Within 3 business days after 3    receiving this notification, the State Board of Education 4    shall appoint a qualified person from the master list who 5    did not appear on the list sent to the parties to serve as 6    the hearing officer, unless the parties notify it that 7    they have chosen to alternatively select a hearing officer 8    under paragraph (4) of this subsection (d).9        If the teacher has requested a hearing before a 10    hearing officer selected by the board, the board shall 11    select one name from the master list of qualified 12    impartial hearing officers maintained by the State Board 13    of Education within 3 business days after receipt and 14    shall notify the State Board of Education of its 15    selection.16        A hearing officer mutually selected by the parties, 17    selected by the board, or selected through an alternative 18    selection process under paragraph (4) of this subsection 19    (d) (A) must not be a resident of the school district, (B) 20    must be available to commence the hearing within 75 days 21    and conclude the hearing within 120 days after being 22    selected as the hearing officer, and (C) must issue a 23    decision as to whether the teacher must be dismissed and 24    give a copy of that decision to both the teacher and the 25    board within 30 days from the conclusion of the hearing or 26    closure of the record, whichever is later.  10400HB2970sam001- 22 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1        Any hearing convened during a public health emergency 2    pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 3    Agency Act may be convened remotely. Any hearing officer 4    for a hearing convened during a public health emergency 5    pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management 6    Agency Act may voluntarily withdraw from the hearing and 7    another hearing officer shall be selected or appointed 8    pursuant to this Section. 9        In this paragraph, "pre-hearing procedures" refers to 10    the pre-hearing procedures under Section 51.55 of Title 23 11    of the Illinois Administrative Code and "hearing" refers 12    to the hearing under Section 51.60 of Title 23 of the 13    Illinois Administrative Code. Any teacher who has been 14    charged with engaging in acts of corporal punishment, 15    physical abuse, grooming, or sexual misconduct and who 16    previously paused pre-hearing procedures or a hearing 17    pursuant to Public Act 101-643 must proceed with selection 18    of a hearing officer or hearing date, or both, within the 19    timeframes established by this paragraph (3) and 20    paragraphs (4) through (6) of this subsection (d), unless 21    the timeframes are mutually waived in writing by both 22    parties, and all timelines set forth in this Section in 23    cases concerning corporal punishment, physical abuse, 24    grooming, or sexual misconduct shall be reset to begin the 25    day after April 22, 2022 (the effective date of Public Act 26    102-708). Any teacher charged with engaging in acts of   10400HB2970sam001- 23 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    corporal punishment, physical abuse, grooming, or sexual 2    misconduct on or after April 22, 2022 (the effective date 3    of Public Act 102-708) may not pause pre-hearing 4    procedures or a hearing.5        (4) In the alternative to selecting a hearing officer 6    from the list received from the State Board of Education 7    or accepting the appointment of a hearing officer by the 8    State Board of Education or if the State Board of 9    Education cannot provide a list or appoint a hearing 10    officer that meets the foregoing requirements, the board 11    and the teacher or their legal representatives may 12    mutually agree to select an impartial hearing officer who 13    is not on the master list either by direct appointment by 14    the parties or by using procedures for the appointment of 15    an arbitrator established by the Federal Mediation and 16    Conciliation Service or the American Arbitration 17    Association. The parties shall notify the State Board of 18    Education of their intent to select a hearing officer 19    using an alternative procedure within 3 business days of 20    receipt of a list of prospective hearing officers provided 21    by the State Board of Education, notice of appointment of 22    a hearing officer by the State Board of Education, or 23    receipt of notice from the State Board of Education that 24    it cannot provide a list that meets the foregoing 25    requirements, whichever is later. 26        (5) If the notice of dismissal was sent to the teacher   10400HB2970sam001- 24 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    before July 1, 2012, the fees and costs for the hearing 2    officer must be paid by the State Board of Education. If 3    the notice of dismissal was sent to the teacher on or after 4    July 1, 2012, the hearing officer's fees and costs must be 5    paid as follows in this paragraph (5). The fees and 6    permissible costs for the hearing officer must be 7    determined by the State Board of Education. If the board 8    and the teacher or their legal representatives mutually 9    agree to select an impartial hearing officer who is not on 10    a list received from the State Board of Education, they 11    may agree to supplement the fees determined by the State 12    Board to the hearing officer, at a rate consistent with 13    the hearing officer's published professional fees. If the 14    hearing officer is mutually selected by the parties, then 15    the board and the teacher or their legal representatives 16    shall each pay 50% of the fees and costs and any 17    supplemental allowance to which they agree. If the hearing 18    officer is selected by the board, then the board shall pay 19    100% of the hearing officer's fees and costs. The fees and 20    costs must be paid to the hearing officer within 14 days 21    after the board and the teacher or their legal 22    representatives receive the hearing officer's decision set 23    forth in paragraph (7) of this subsection (d).24        (6) The teacher is required to answer the bill of 25    particulars and aver affirmative matters in his or her 26    defense, and the time for initially doing so and the time   10400HB2970sam001- 25 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    for updating such answer and defenses after pre-hearing 2    discovery must be set by the hearing officer. The State 3    Board of Education shall promulgate rules so that each 4    party has a fair opportunity to present its case and to 5    ensure that the dismissal process proceeds in a fair and 6    expeditious manner. These rules shall address, without 7    limitation, discovery and hearing scheduling conferences; 8    the teacher's initial answer and affirmative defenses to 9    the bill of particulars and the updating of that 10    information after pre-hearing discovery; provision for 11    written interrogatories and requests for production of 12    documents; the requirement that each party initially 13    disclose to the other party and then update the disclosure 14    no later than 10 calendar days prior to the commencement 15    of the hearing, the names and addresses of persons who may 16    be called as witnesses at the hearing, a summary of the 17    facts or opinions each witness will testify to, and all 18    other documents and materials, including information 19    maintained electronically, relevant to its own as well as 20    the other party's case (the hearing officer may exclude 21    witnesses and exhibits not identified and shared, except 22    those offered in rebuttal for which the party could not 23    reasonably have anticipated prior to the hearing); 24    pre-hearing discovery and preparation, including provision 25    for written interrogatories and requests for production of 26    documents, provided that discovery depositions are   10400HB2970sam001- 26 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    prohibited; the conduct of the hearing; the right of each 2    party to be represented by counsel, the offer of evidence 3    and witnesses and the cross-examination of witnesses; the 4    authority of the hearing officer to issue subpoenas and 5    subpoenas duces tecum, provided that the hearing officer 6    may limit the number of witnesses to be subpoenaed on 7    behalf of each party to no more than 7; the length of 8    post-hearing briefs; and the form, length, and content of 9    hearing officers' decisions. The hearing officer shall 10    hold a hearing and render a final decision for dismissal 11    pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or shall report to the 12    school board findings of fact and a recommendation as to 13    whether or not the teacher must be dismissed for conduct. 14    The hearing officer shall commence the hearing within 75 15    days and conclude the hearing within 120 days after being 16    selected as the hearing officer, provided that the hearing 17    officer may modify these timelines upon the showing of 18    good cause or mutual agreement of the parties. Good cause 19    for the purpose of this subsection (d) shall mean the 20    illness or otherwise unavoidable emergency of the teacher, 21    district representative, their legal representatives, the 22    hearing officer, or an essential witness as indicated in 23    each party's pre-hearing submission. In a dismissal 24    hearing pursuant to Article 24A of this Code in which a 25    witness is a student or is under the age of 18, the hearing 26    officer must make accommodations for the witness, as   10400HB2970sam001- 27 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    provided under paragraph (6.5) of this subsection. The 2    hearing officer shall consider and give weight to all of 3    the teacher's evaluations written pursuant to Article 24A 4    that are relevant to the issues in the hearing.5        Each party shall have no more than 3 days to present 6    its case, unless extended by the hearing officer to enable 7    a party to present adequate evidence and testimony, 8    including due to the other party's cross-examination of 9    the party's witnesses, for good cause or by mutual 10    agreement of the parties. The State Board of Education 11    shall define in rules the meaning of "day" for such 12    purposes. All testimony at the hearing shall be taken 13    under oath administered by the hearing officer. The 14    hearing officer shall cause a record of the proceedings to 15    be kept and shall employ a competent reporter to take 16    stenographic or stenotype notes of all the testimony. The 17    costs of the reporter's attendance and services at the 18    hearing shall be paid by the party or parties who are 19    responsible for paying the fees and costs of the hearing 20    officer. Either party desiring a transcript of the hearing 21    shall pay for the cost thereof. Any post-hearing briefs 22    must be submitted by the parties by no later than 21 days 23    after a party's receipt of the transcript of the hearing, 24    unless extended by the hearing officer for good cause or 25    by mutual agreement of the parties.26        (6.5) In the case of charges involving any witness who   10400HB2970sam001- 28 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    is or was at the time of the alleged conduct a student or a 2    person under the age of 18, the hearing officer shall make 3    accommodations to protect a witness from being 4    intimidated, traumatized, or re-traumatized. No alleged 5    victim or other witness who is or was at the time of the 6    alleged conduct a student or under the age of 18 may be 7    compelled to testify in the physical or visual presence of 8    a teacher or other witness. If such a witness invokes this 9    right, then the hearing officer must provide an 10    accommodation consistent with the invoked right and use a 11    procedure by which each party may hear such witness's 12    testimony. Accommodations may include, but are not limited 13    to: (i) testimony made via a telecommunication device in a 14    location other than the hearing room and outside the 15    physical or visual presence of the teacher and other 16    hearing participants, but accessible to the teacher via a 17    telecommunication device, (ii) testimony made in the 18    hearing room but outside the physical presence of the 19    teacher and accessible to the teacher via a 20    telecommunication device, (iii) non-public testimony, (iv) 21    testimony made via videoconference with the cameras and 22    microphones of the teacher turned off, or (v) pre-recorded 23    testimony, including, but not limited to, a recording of a 24    forensic interview conducted at an accredited Children's 25    Advocacy Center. With all accommodations, the hearing 26    officer shall give such testimony the same consideration   10400HB2970sam001- 29 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    as if the witness testified without the accommodation. The 2    teacher may not directly, or through a representative, 3    question a witness called by the school board who is or was 4    a student or under 18 years of age at the time of the 5    alleged conduct. The hearing officer must permit the 6    teacher to submit all relevant questions and follow-up 7    questions for such a witness to have the questions posed 8    by the hearing officer. All questions must exclude 9    evidence of the witness' sexual behavior or 10    predisposition, unless the evidence is offered to prove 11    that someone other than the teacher subject to the 12    dismissal hearing engaged in the charge at issue. 13        (7) The hearing officer shall, within 30 days from the 14    conclusion of the hearing or closure of the record, 15    whichever is later, make a decision as to whether or not 16    the teacher shall be dismissed pursuant to Article 24A of 17    this Code or report to the school board findings of fact 18    and a recommendation as to whether or not the teacher 19    shall be dismissed for cause and shall give a copy of the 20    decision or findings of fact and recommendation to both 21    the teacher and the school board. If a hearing officer 22    fails without good cause, specifically provided in writing 23    to both parties and the State Board of Education, to 24    render a decision or findings of fact and recommendation 25    within 30 days after the hearing is concluded or the 26    record is closed, whichever is later, the parties may   10400HB2970sam001- 30 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    mutually agree to select a hearing officer pursuant to the 2    alternative procedure, as provided in this Section, to 3    rehear the charges heard by the hearing officer who failed 4    to render a decision or findings of fact and 5    recommendation or to review the record and render a 6    decision. If any hearing officer fails without good cause, 7    specifically provided in writing to both parties and the 8    State Board of Education, to render a decision or findings 9    of fact and recommendation within 30 days after the 10    hearing is concluded or the record is closed, whichever is 11    later, or if any hearing officer fails to make an 12    accommodation as described in paragraph (6.5), the hearing 13    officer shall be removed from the master list of hearing 14    officers maintained by the State Board of Education for 15    not more than 24 months. The parties and the State Board of 16    Education may also take such other actions as it deems 17    appropriate, including recovering, reducing, or 18    withholding any fees paid or to be paid to the hearing 19    officer. If any hearing officer repeats such failure, he 20    or she must be permanently removed from the master list 21    maintained by the State Board of Education and may not be 22    selected by parties through the alternative selection 23    process under this paragraph (7) or paragraph (4) of this 24    subsection (d). The board shall not lose jurisdiction to 25    discharge a teacher if the hearing officer fails to render 26    a decision or findings of fact and recommendation within   10400HB2970sam001- 31 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    the time specified in this Section. If the decision of the 2    hearing officer for dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of 3    this Code or of the school board for dismissal for cause is 4    in favor of the teacher, then the hearing officer or 5    school board shall order reinstatement to the same or 6    substantially equivalent position and shall determine the 7    amount for which the school board is liable, including, 8    but not limited to, loss of income and benefits.9        (8) The school board, within 45 days after receipt of 10    the hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation 11    as to whether (i) the conduct at issue occurred, (ii) the 12    conduct that did occur was remediable, and (iii) the 13    proposed dismissal should be sustained, shall issue a 14    written order as to whether the teacher must be retained 15    or dismissed for cause from its employ. The school board's 16    written order shall incorporate the hearing officer's 17    findings of fact, except that the school board may modify 18    or supplement the findings of fact if, in its opinion, the 19    findings of fact are against the manifest weight of the 20    evidence.21        If the school board dismisses the teacher 22    notwithstanding the hearing officer's findings of fact and 23    recommendation, the school board shall make a conclusion 24    in its written order, giving its reasons therefor, and 25    such conclusion and reasons must be included in its 26    written order. The failure of the school board to strictly   10400HB2970sam001- 32 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    adhere to the timelines contained in this Section shall 2    not render it without jurisdiction to dismiss the teacher. 3    The school board shall not lose jurisdiction to discharge 4    the teacher for cause if the hearing officer fails to 5    render a recommendation within the time specified in this 6    Section. The decision of the school board is final, unless 7    reviewed as provided in paragraph (9) of this subsection 8    (d).9        If the school board retains the teacher, the school 10    board shall enter a written order stating the amount of 11    back pay and lost benefits, less mitigation, to be paid to 12    the teacher, within 45 days after its retention order. 13    Should the teacher object to the amount of the back pay and 14    lost benefits or amount mitigated, the teacher shall give 15    written objections to the amount within 21 days. If the 16    parties fail to reach resolution within 7 days, the 17    dispute shall be referred to the hearing officer, who 18    shall consider the school board's written order and 19    teacher's written objection and determine the amount to 20    which the school board is liable. The costs of the hearing 21    officer's review and determination must be paid by the 22    board.23        (9) The decision of the hearing officer pursuant to 24    Article 24A of this Code or of the school board's decision 25    to dismiss for cause is final unless reviewed as provided 26    in Section 24-16 of this Code. If the school board's   10400HB2970sam001- 33 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    decision to dismiss for cause is contrary to the hearing 2    officer's recommendation, the court on review shall give 3    consideration to the school board's decision and its 4    supplemental findings of fact, if applicable, and the 5    hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation in 6    making its decision. In the event such review is 7    instituted, the school board shall be responsible for 8    preparing and filing the record of proceedings, and such 9    costs associated therewith must be divided equally between 10    the parties.11        (10) If a decision of the hearing officer for 12    dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or of the 13    school board for dismissal for cause is adjudicated upon 14    review or appeal in favor of the teacher, then the trial 15    court shall order reinstatement and shall remand the 16    matter to the school board with direction for entry of an 17    order setting the amount of back pay, lost benefits, and 18    costs, less mitigation. The teacher may challenge the 19    school board's order setting the amount of back pay, lost 20    benefits, and costs, less mitigation, through an expedited 21    arbitration procedure, with the costs of the arbitrator 22    borne by the school board.23        Any teacher who is reinstated by any hearing or 24    adjudication brought under this Section shall be assigned 25    by the board to a position substantially similar to the 26    one which that teacher held prior to that teacher's   10400HB2970sam001- 34 -LRB104 10378 LNS 26498 a1    suspension or dismissal.2        (11) Subject to any later effective date referenced in 3    this Section for a specific aspect of the dismissal 4    process, the changes made by Public Act 97-8 shall apply 5    to dismissals instituted on or after September 1, 2011. 6    Any dismissal instituted prior to September 1, 2011 must 7    be carried out in accordance with the requirements of this 8    Section prior to amendment by Public Act 97-8. 9    (e) Nothing contained in Public Act 98-648 repeals, 10supersedes, invalidates, or nullifies final decisions in 11lawsuits pending on July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public 12Act 98-648) in Illinois courts involving the interpretation of 13Public Act 97-8. 14(Source: P.A. 102-708, eff. 4-22-22; 103-354, eff. 1-1-24; 15103-398, eff. 1-1-24; 103-500, eff. 8-4-23; 103-605, eff. 167-1-24.) 17    Section 99.
