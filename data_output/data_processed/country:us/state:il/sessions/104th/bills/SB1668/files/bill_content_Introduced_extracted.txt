Contributions by State. 9    (a) The State shall make contributions to the System by 10appropriations of amounts which, together with the 11contributions of participants, interest earned on investments, 12and other income will meet the cost of maintaining and 13administering the System on a 90% funded basis in accordance 14with actuarial recommendations.15    (b) The Board shall determine the amount of State 16contributions required for each fiscal year on the basis of 17the actuarial tables and other assumptions adopted by the 18Board and the prescribed rate of interest, using the formula 19in subsection (c).20    (c) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, except as 21otherwise provided in this Section, the minimum contribution 22to the System to be made by the State for each fiscal year 23shall be an amount determined by the System to be sufficient to   SB1668- 2 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1bring the total assets of the System up to 90% of the total 2actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of State fiscal 3year 2045. In making these determinations, the required State 4contribution shall be calculated each year as a level 5percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 6including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the 7projected unit credit actuarial cost method.8    If the System determines that the minimum contribution to 9the System is sufficient to bring the total assets of the 10System up to 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of the 11System in the following fiscal year, then the System shall 12determine the actuarially determined contribution rate for the 13following year in accordance with this paragraph. Beginning 14the first State fiscal year after the total assets of the 15System are at least 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of 16the System and each State fiscal year thereafter, the 17contribution to the System shall be calculated based on an 18actuarially determined contribution rate in accordance with 19the following:20        (1) The Board, with the consultation of a competent 21    actuary, shall calculate the actuarially determined 22    contribution rate for each fiscal year.23        (2) The System shall calculate the actuarially 24    determined contribution rate in accordance with the 25    Governmental Accounting Research System and officially 26    adopted actuarial assumptions. The System shall use this   SB1668- 3 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    valuation to calculate the actuarially determined 2    contribution rate for the next fiscal year.3        (3) No later than January 1 of each year in which this 4    paragraph applies, the System shall report the actuarially 5    determined contribution rate for the following fiscal year 6    to the Governor, the Auditor General, the State Treasurer, 7    and the General Assembly.8        (4) After the calculation of the actuarially 9    determined contribution rate under item (2), the General 10    Assembly and the System shall calculate the necessary 11    amount to account for any changes in appropriations 12    necessary to fund the minimum contribution, including 13    changes in amounts for the employer's share of the 14    actuarially determined contribution rate.15        (5) The actuarially determined contribution rate for a 16    fiscal year shall not be less than the amount for the 17    preceding fiscal year if the ratio of the System's total 18    assets to the System's total liabilities is less than 90%.19        (6) In no event shall the actuarially determined 20    contribution rate be less than the normal cost for that 21    fiscal year. 22    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 23increases or decreases the required State contribution and 24first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 25implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 26beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial   SB1668- 4 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1change first applies to the required State contribution.2    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 3increases or decreases the required State contribution and 4first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 52015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:6        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before 7    2018; and8        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 9    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 10    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 11    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 12    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 13    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 14    fiscal years in that 5-year period.15    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State 16contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable 17employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 18increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 19contributing at the rate required under this Section.20    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 21total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2006 22is $4,157,000. 23    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 24total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2007 25is $5,220,300. 26    For each of State fiscal years 2008 through 2009, the   SB1668- 5 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1State contribution to the System, as a percentage of the 2applicable employee payroll, shall be increased in equal 3annual increments from the required State contribution for 4State fiscal year 2007, so that by State fiscal year 2011, the 5State is contributing at the rate otherwise required under 6this Section. 7    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 8total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2010 9is $10,454,000 and shall be made from the proceeds of bonds 10sold in fiscal year 2010 pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General 11Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale 12expenses determined by the System's share of total bond 13proceeds, (ii) any amounts received from the General Revenue 14Fund in fiscal year 2010, and (iii) any reduction in bond 15proceeds due to the issuance of discounted bonds, if 16applicable. 17    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 18total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2011 19is the amount recertified by the System on or before April 1, 202011 pursuant to Section 2-134 and shall be made from the 21proceeds of bonds sold in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to Section 227.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the pro rata 23share of bond sale expenses determined by the System's share 24of total bond proceeds, (ii) any amounts received from the 25General Revenue Fund in fiscal year 2011, and (iii) any 26reduction in bond proceeds due to the issuance of discounted   SB1668- 6 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1bonds, if applicable. 2    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, except as otherwise 3provided in this Section, the minimum State contribution for 4each fiscal year shall be the amount needed to maintain the 5total assets of the System at 90% of the total actuarial 6liabilities of the System.7    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 8the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 9Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 10constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 11contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 12Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 13calculation of, the required State contributions under this 14Article in any future year until the System has reached a 15funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 16the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 17term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 18System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act. 19    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 20required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 21fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 22calculated under this Section and certified under Section 232-134, shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount of 24the required State contribution that would have been 25calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 26System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of   SB1668- 7 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 2portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 3fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 4purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 5the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 6the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 77.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act. In determining this 8maximum for State fiscal years 2008 through 2010, however, the 9amount referred to in item (i) shall be increased, as a 10percentage of the applicable employee payroll, in equal 11increments calculated from the sum of the required State 12contribution for State fiscal year 2007 plus the applicable 13portion of the State's total debt service payments for fiscal 14year 2007 on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 15purposes of Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, so 16that, by State fiscal year 2011, the State is contributing at 17the rate otherwise required under this Section. 18    (d) For purposes of determining the required State 19contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets 20shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 21which shall be calculated as follows:22    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 23assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 24that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 25assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 26gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal   SB1668- 8 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 25-year period following that fiscal year. 3    (e) For purposes of determining the required State 4contribution to the system for a particular year, the 5actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 6return equal to the system's actuarially assumed rate of 7return. 8(Source: P.A. 100-23, eff. 7-6-17.) 9    (40 ILCS 5/14-131)10    Sec. 14-131. Contributions by State. 11    (a) The State shall make contributions to the System by 12appropriations of amounts which, together with other employer 13contributions from trust, federal, and other funds, employee 14contributions, investment income, and other income, will be 15sufficient to meet the cost of maintaining and administering 16the System on a 90% funded basis in accordance with actuarial 17recommendations.18    For the purposes of this Section and Section 14-135.08, 19references to State contributions refer only to employer 20contributions and do not include employee contributions that 21are picked up or otherwise paid by the State or a department on 22behalf of the employee.23    (b) The Board shall determine the total amount of State 24contributions required for each fiscal year on the basis of 25the actuarial tables and other assumptions adopted by the   SB1668- 9 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1Board, using the formula in subsection (e).2    The Board shall also determine a State contribution rate 3for each fiscal year, expressed as a percentage of payroll, 4based on the total required State contribution for that fiscal 5year (less the amount received by the System from 6appropriations under Section 8.12 of the State Finance Act and 7Section 1 of the State Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation 8Act, if any, for the fiscal year ending on the June 30 9immediately preceding the applicable November 15 certification 10deadline), the estimated payroll (including all forms of 11compensation) for personal services rendered by eligible 12employees, and the recommendations of the actuary.13    For the purposes of this Section and Section 14.1 of the 14State Finance Act, the term "eligible employees" includes 15employees who participate in the System, persons who may elect 16to participate in the System but have not so elected, persons 17who are serving a qualifying period that is required for 18participation, and annuitants employed by a department as 19described in subdivision (a)(1) or (a)(2) of Section 14-111.20    (c) Contributions shall be made by the several departments 21for each pay period by warrants drawn by the State Comptroller 22against their respective funds or appropriations based upon 23vouchers stating the amount to be so contributed. These 24amounts shall be based on the full rate certified by the Board 25under Section 14-135.08 for that fiscal year. From March 5, 262004 (the effective date of Public Act 93-665) through the   SB1668- 10 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1payment of the final payroll from fiscal year 2004 2appropriations, the several departments shall not make 3contributions for the remainder of fiscal year 2004 but shall 4instead make payments as required under subsection (a-1) of 5Section 14.1 of the State Finance Act. The several departments 6shall resume those contributions at the commencement of fiscal 7year 2005.8    (c-1) Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this Section, for 9fiscal years 2010, 2012, and each fiscal year thereafter, 10contributions by the several departments are not required to 11be made for General Revenue Funds payrolls processed by the 12Comptroller. Payrolls paid by the several departments from all 13other State funds must continue to be processed pursuant to 14subsection (c) of this Section.15    (c-2) Unless otherwise directed by the Comptroller under 16subsection (c-3), the Board shall submit vouchers for payment 17of State contributions to the System for the applicable month 18on the 15th day of each month, or as soon thereafter as may be 19practicable. The amount vouchered for a monthly payment shall 20total one-twelfth of the fiscal year General Revenue Fund 21contribution as certified by the System pursuant to Section 2214-135.08 of this Code. 23    (c-3) Beginning in State fiscal year 2025, if the 24Comptroller requests that the Board submit, during a State 25fiscal year, vouchers for multiple monthly payments for 26advance payment of State contributions due to the System for   SB1668- 11 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1that State fiscal year, then the Board shall submit those 2additional vouchers as directed by the Comptroller, 3notwithstanding subsection (c-2). Unless an act of 4appropriations provides otherwise, nothing in this Section 5authorizes the Board to submit, in a State fiscal year, 6vouchers for the payment of State contributions to the System 7in an amount that exceeds the rate of payroll that is certified 8by the System under Section 14-135.08 for that State fiscal 9year. 10    (d) If an employee is paid from trust funds or federal 11funds, the department or other employer shall pay employer 12contributions from those funds to the System at the certified 13rate, unless the terms of the trust or the federal-State 14agreement preclude the use of the funds for that purpose, in 15which case the required employer contributions shall be paid 16by the State. 17    (e) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, except as 18otherwise provided in this Section, the minimum contribution 19to the System to be made by the State for each fiscal year 20shall be an amount determined by the System to be sufficient to 21bring the total assets of the System up to 90% of the total 22actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of State fiscal 23year 2045. In making these determinations, the required State 24contribution shall be calculated each year as a level 25percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 26including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the   SB1668- 12 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1projected unit credit actuarial cost method.2    If the System determines that the minimum contribution to 3the System is sufficient to bring the total assets of the 4System up to 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of the 5System in the following fiscal year, then the System shall 6determine the actuarially determined contribution rate for the 7following year in accordance with this paragraph. Beginning 8the first State fiscal year after the total assets of the 9System are at least 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of 10the System and each State fiscal year thereafter, the 11contribution to the System shall be calculated based on an 12actuarially determined contribution rate in accordance with 13the following:14        (1) The Board, with the consultation of a competent 15    actuary, shall calculate the actuarially determined 16    contribution rate for each fiscal year.17        (2) The System shall calculate the actuarially 18    determined contribution rate in accordance with the 19    Governmental Accounting Research System and officially 20    adopted actuarial assumptions. The System shall use this 21    valuation to calculate the actuarially determined 22    contribution rate for the next fiscal year.23        (3) No later than January 1 of each year in which this 24    paragraph applies, the System shall report the actuarially 25    determined contribution rate for the following fiscal year 26    to the Governor, the Auditor General, the State Treasurer,   SB1668- 13 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    and the General Assembly.2        (4) After the calculation of the actuarially 3    determined contribution rate under item (2), the General 4    Assembly and the System shall calculate the necessary 5    amount to account for any changes in appropriations 6    necessary to fund the minimum contribution, including 7    changes in amounts for the employer's share of the 8    actuarially determined contribution rate.9        (5) The actuarially determined contribution rate for a 10    fiscal year shall not be less than the amount for the 11    preceding fiscal year if the ratio of the System's total 12    assets to the System's total liabilities is less than 90%.13        (6) In no event shall the actuarially determined 14    contribution rate be less than the normal cost for that 15    fiscal year. 16    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 17increases or decreases the required State contribution and 18first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 19implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 20beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 21change first applies to the required State contribution.22    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 23increases or decreases the required State contribution and 24first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 252015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:26        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before   SB1668- 14 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    2018; and2        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 3    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 4    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 5    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 6    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 7    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 8    fiscal years in that 5-year period.9    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State 10contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable 11employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 12increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 13contributing at the rate required under this Section; except 14that (i) for State fiscal year 1998, for all purposes of this 15Code and any other law of this State, the certified percentage 16of the applicable employee payroll shall be 5.052% for 17employees earning eligible creditable service under Section 1814-110 and 6.500% for all other employees, notwithstanding any 19contrary certification made under Section 14-135.08 before 20July 7, 1997 (the effective date of Public Act 90-65), and (ii) 21in the following specified State fiscal years, the State 22contribution to the System shall not be less than the 23following indicated percentages of the applicable employee 24payroll, even if the indicated percentage will produce a State 25contribution in excess of the amount otherwise required under 26this subsection and subsection (a): 9.8% in FY 1999; 10.0% in   SB1668- 15 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1FY 2000; 10.2% in FY 2001; 10.4% in FY 2002; 10.6% in FY 2003; 2and 10.8% in FY 2004.3    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, except as otherwise 4provided in this Section, the minimum State contribution for 5each fiscal year shall be the amount needed to maintain the 6total assets of the System at 90% of the total actuarial 7liabilities of the System.8    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 9the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 10Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 11constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 12contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 13Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 14calculation of, the required State contributions under this 15Article in any future year until the System has reached a 16funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 17the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 18term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 19System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act. 20    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 21required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 22fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 23calculated under this Section and certified under Section 2414-135.08, shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount 25of the required State contribution that would have been 26calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the   SB1668- 16 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 2Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 3portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 4fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 5purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 6the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 7the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 87.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act.9    (f) (Blank).10    (g) For purposes of determining the required State 11contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets 12shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 13which shall be calculated as follows:14    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 15assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 16that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 17assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 18gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 19year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 205-year period following that fiscal year. 21    (h) For purposes of determining the required State 22contribution to the System for a particular year, the 23actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 24return equal to the System's actuarially assumed rate of 25return. 26    (i) (Blank).  SB1668- 17 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    (j) (Blank).2    (k) For fiscal year 2012 and each fiscal year thereafter, 3after the submission of all payments for eligible employees 4from personal services line items paid from the General 5Revenue Fund in the fiscal year have been made, the 6Comptroller shall provide to the System a certification of the 7sum of all expenditures in the fiscal year for personal 8services. Upon receipt of the certification, the System shall 9determine the amount due to the System based on the full rate 10certified by the Board under Section 14-135.08 for the fiscal 11year in order to meet the State's obligation under this 12Section. The System shall compare this amount due to the 13amount received by the System for the fiscal year. If the 14amount due is more than the amount received, the difference 15shall be termed the "Prior Fiscal Year Shortfall" for purposes 16of this Section, and the Prior Fiscal Year Shortfall shall be 17satisfied under Section 1.2 of the State Pension Funds 18Continuing Appropriation Act. If the amount due is less than 19the amount received, the difference shall be termed the "Prior 20Fiscal Year Overpayment" for purposes of this Section, and the 21Prior Fiscal Year Overpayment shall be repaid by the System to 22the General Revenue Fund as soon as practicable after the 23certification. 24(Source: P.A. 103-588, eff. 6-5-24.) 25    (40 ILCS 5/15-155)  (from Ch. 108 1/2, par. 15-155)  SB1668- 18 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    Sec. 15-155. Employer contributions. 2    (a) The State of Illinois shall make contributions by 3appropriations of amounts which, together with the other 4employer contributions from trust, federal, and other funds, 5employee contributions, income from investments, and other 6income of this System, will be sufficient to meet the cost of 7maintaining and administering the System on a 90% funded basis 8in accordance with actuarial recommendations.9    The Board shall determine the amount of State 10contributions required for each fiscal year on the basis of 11the actuarial tables and other assumptions adopted by the 12Board and the recommendations of the actuary, using the 13formula in subsection (a-1).14    (a-1) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, except as 15otherwise provided in this Section, the minimum contribution 16to the System to be made by the State for each fiscal year 17shall be an amount determined by the System to be sufficient to 18bring the total assets of the System up to 90% of the total 19actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of State fiscal 20year 2045. In making these determinations, the required State 21contribution shall be calculated each year as a level 22percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 23including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the 24projected unit credit actuarial cost method.25    If the System determines that the minimum contribution to 26the System is sufficient to bring the total assets of the   SB1668- 19 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1System up to 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of the 2System in the following fiscal year, then the System shall 3determine the actuarially determined contribution rate for the 4following year in accordance with this paragraph. Beginning 5the first State fiscal year after the total assets of the 6System are at least 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of 7the System and each State fiscal year thereafter, the 8contribution to the System shall be calculated based on an 9actuarially determined contribution rate in accordance with 10the following:11        (1) The Board, with the consultation of a competent 12    actuary, shall calculate the actuarially determined 13    contribution rate for each fiscal year.14        (2) The System shall calculate the actuarially 15    determined contribution rate in accordance with the 16    Governmental Accounting Research System and officially 17    adopted actuarial assumptions. The System shall use this 18    valuation to calculate the actuarially determined 19    contribution rate for the next fiscal year.20        (3) No later than January 1 of each year in which this 21    paragraph applies, the System shall report the actuarially 22    determined contribution rate for the following fiscal year 23    to the Governor, the Auditor General, the State Treasurer, 24    and the General Assembly.25        (4) After the calculation of the actuarially 26    determined contribution rate under item (2), the General   SB1668- 20 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    Assembly and the System shall calculate the necessary 2    amount to account for any changes in appropriations 3    necessary to fund the minimum contribution, including 4    changes in amounts for the employer's share of the 5    actuarially determined contribution rate.6        (5) The actuarially determined contribution rate for a 7    fiscal year shall not be less than the amount for the 8    preceding fiscal year if the ratio of the System's total 9    assets to the System's total liabilities is less than 90%.10        (6) In no event shall the actuarially determined 11    contribution rate be less than the normal cost for that 12    fiscal year. 13    For each of State fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 14State shall make an additional contribution to the System 15equal to 2% of the total payroll of each employee who is deemed 16to have elected the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has 17made the election under subsection (c) of Section 1-161. 18    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 19increases or decreases the required State contribution and 20first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 21implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 22beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 23change first applies to the required State contribution.24    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 25increases or decreases the required State contribution and 26first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014,   SB1668- 21 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b12015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:2        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before 3    2018; and4        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 5    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 6    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 7    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 8    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 9    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 10    fiscal years in that 5-year period.11    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State 12contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable 13employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 14increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 15contributing at the rate required under this Section.16    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 17total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2006 18is $166,641,900. 19    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 20total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2007 21is $252,064,100. 22    For each of State fiscal years 2008 through 2009, the 23State contribution to the System, as a percentage of the 24applicable employee payroll, shall be increased in equal 25annual increments from the required State contribution for 26State fiscal year 2007, so that by State fiscal year 2011, the   SB1668- 22 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1State is contributing at the rate otherwise required under 2this Section. 3    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 4total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2010 5is $702,514,000 and shall be made from the State Pensions Fund 6and proceeds of bonds sold in fiscal year 2010 pursuant to 7Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the 8pro rata share of bond sale expenses determined by the 9System's share of total bond proceeds, (ii) any amounts 10received from the General Revenue Fund in fiscal year 2010, 11(iii) any reduction in bond proceeds due to the issuance of 12discounted bonds, if applicable. 13    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 14total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2011 15is the amount recertified by the System on or before April 1, 162011 pursuant to Section 15-165 and shall be made from the 17State Pensions Fund and proceeds of bonds sold in fiscal year 182011 pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond 19Act, less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale expenses 20determined by the System's share of total bond proceeds, (ii) 21any amounts received from the General Revenue Fund in fiscal 22year 2011, and (iii) any reduction in bond proceeds due to the 23issuance of discounted bonds, if applicable. 24    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, except as otherwise 25provided in this Section, the minimum State contribution for 26each fiscal year shall be the amount needed to maintain the   SB1668- 23 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1total assets of the System at 90% of the total actuarial 2liabilities of the System.3    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 4the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 5Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 6constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 7contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 8Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 9calculation of, the required State contributions under this 10Article in any future year until the System has reached a 11funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 12the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 13term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 14System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act.15    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 16required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 17fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 18calculated under this Section and certified under Section 1915-165, shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount of 20the required State contribution that would have been 21calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 22System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 23Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 24portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 25fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 26purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by   SB1668- 24 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 2the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 37.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act. In determining this 4maximum for State fiscal years 2008 through 2010, however, the 5amount referred to in item (i) shall be increased, as a 6percentage of the applicable employee payroll, in equal 7increments calculated from the sum of the required State 8contribution for State fiscal year 2007 plus the applicable 9portion of the State's total debt service payments for fiscal 10year 2007 on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 11purposes of Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, so 12that, by State fiscal year 2011, the State is contributing at 13the rate otherwise required under this Section.14    (a-2) Beginning in fiscal year 2018, each employer under 15this Article shall pay to the System a required contribution 16determined as a percentage of projected payroll and sufficient 17to produce an annual amount equal to:18        (i) for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 19    defined benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, 20    less the employee contribution, for each employee of that 21    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 22    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 23    election under subsection (c) of Section 1-161; for fiscal 24    year 2021 and each fiscal year thereafter, the defined 25    benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, less the 26    employee contribution, plus 2%, for each employee of that   SB1668- 25 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 2    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 3    election under subsection (c) of Section 1-161; plus4        (ii) the amount required for that fiscal year to 5    amortize any unfunded actuarial accrued liability 6    associated with the present value of liabilities 7    attributable to the employer's account under Section 8    15-155.2, determined as a level percentage of payroll over 9    a 30-year rolling amortization period.10    In determining contributions required under item (i) of 11this subsection, the System shall determine an aggregate rate 12for all employers, expressed as a percentage of projected 13payroll. 14    In determining the contributions required under item (ii) 15of this subsection, the amount shall be computed by the System 16on the basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in 17the most recent actuarial valuation of the System that is 18available at the time of the computation. 19    The contributions required under this subsection (a-2) 20shall be paid by an employer concurrently with that employer's 21payroll payment period. The State, as the actual employer of 22an employee, shall make the required contributions under this 23subsection. 24    As used in this subsection, "academic year" means the 2512-month period beginning September 1. 26    (b) If an employee is paid from trust or federal funds, the   SB1668- 26 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1employer shall pay to the Board contributions from those funds 2which are sufficient to cover the accruing normal costs on 3behalf of the employee. However, universities having employees 4who are compensated out of local auxiliary funds, income 5funds, or service enterprise funds are not required to pay 6such contributions on behalf of those employees. The local 7auxiliary funds, income funds, and service enterprise funds of 8universities shall not be considered trust funds for the 9purpose of this Article, but funds of alumni associations, 10foundations, and athletic associations which are affiliated 11with the universities included as employers under this Article 12and other employers which do not receive State appropriations 13are considered to be trust funds for the purpose of this 14Article.15    (b-1) The City of Urbana and the City of Champaign shall 16each make employer contributions to this System for their 17respective firefighter employees who participate in this 18System pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 15-107. The rate 19of contributions to be made by those municipalities shall be 20determined annually by the Board on the basis of the actuarial 21assumptions adopted by the Board and the recommendations of 22the actuary, and shall be expressed as a percentage of salary 23for each such employee. The Board shall certify the rate to the 24affected municipalities as soon as may be practical. The 25employer contributions required under this subsection shall be 26remitted by the municipality to the System at the same time and   SB1668- 27 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1in the same manner as employee contributions.2    (c) Through State fiscal year 1995: The total employer 3contribution shall be apportioned among the various funds of 4the State and other employers, whether trust, federal, or 5other funds, in accordance with actuarial procedures approved 6by the Board. State of Illinois contributions for employers 7receiving State appropriations for personal services shall be 8payable from appropriations made to the employers or to the 9System. The contributions for Class I community colleges 10covering earnings other than those paid from trust and federal 11funds, shall be payable solely from appropriations to the 12Illinois Community College Board or the System for employer 13contributions.14    (d) Beginning in State fiscal year 1996, the required 15State contributions to the System shall be appropriated 16directly to the System and shall be payable through vouchers 17issued in accordance with subsection (c) of Section 15-165, 18except as provided in subsection (g).19    (e) The State Comptroller shall draw warrants payable to 20the System upon proper certification by the System or by the 21employer in accordance with the appropriation laws and this 22Code.23    (f) Normal costs under this Section means liability for 24pensions and other benefits which accrues to the System 25because of the credits earned for service rendered by the 26participants during the fiscal year and expenses of   SB1668- 28 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1administering the System, but shall not include the principal 2of or any redemption premium or interest on any bonds issued by 3the Board or any expenses incurred or deposits required in 4connection therewith.5    (g) If the amount of a participant's earnings for any 6academic year used to determine the final rate of earnings, 7determined on a full-time equivalent basis, exceeds the amount 8of his or her earnings with the same employer for the previous 9academic year, determined on a full-time equivalent basis, by 10more than 6%, the participant's employer shall pay to the 11System, in addition to all other payments required under this 12Section and in accordance with guidelines established by the 13System, the present value of the increase in benefits 14resulting from the portion of the increase in earnings that is 15in excess of 6%. This present value shall be computed by the 16System on the basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables 17used in the most recent actuarial valuation of the System that 18is available at the time of the computation. The System may 19require the employer to provide any pertinent information or 20documentation.21    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 22required under this subsection (g), the System shall calculate 23the amount of the payment and bill the employer for that 24amount. The bill shall specify the calculations used to 25determine the amount due. If the employer disputes the amount 26of the bill, it may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill,   SB1668- 29 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1apply to the System in writing for a recalculation. The 2application must specify in detail the grounds of the dispute 3and, if the employer asserts that the calculation is subject 4to subsection (h), (h-5), or (i) of this Section, must include 5an affidavit setting forth and attesting to all facts within 6the employer's knowledge that are pertinent to the 7applicability of that subsection. Upon receiving a timely 8application for recalculation, the System shall review the 9application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount due. 10    The employer contributions required under this subsection 11(g) may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 12receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 13paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 14will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 15actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 16annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 17must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 18of the bill.19    When assessing payment for any amount due under this 20subsection (g), the System shall include earnings, to the 21extent not established by a participant under Section 2215-113.11 or 15-113.12, that would have been paid to the 23participant had the participant not taken (i) periods of 24voluntary or involuntary furlough occurring on or after July 251, 2015 and on or before June 30, 2017 or (ii) periods of 26voluntary pay reduction in lieu of furlough occurring on or   SB1668- 30 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1after July 1, 2015 and on or before June 30, 2017. Determining 2earnings that would have been paid to a participant had the 3participant not taken periods of voluntary or involuntary 4furlough or periods of voluntary pay reduction shall be the 5responsibility of the employer, and shall be reported in a 6manner prescribed by the System.7    This subsection (g) does not apply to (1) Tier 2 hybrid 8plan members and (2) Tier 2 defined benefit members who first 9participate under this Article on or after the implementation 10date of the Optional Hybrid Plan. 11    (g-1) (Blank).12    (h) This subsection (h) applies only to payments made or 13salary increases given on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 141, 2011. The changes made by Public Act 94-1057 shall not 15require the System to refund any payments received before July 1631, 2006 (the effective date of Public Act 94-1057).17    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 18(g), the System shall exclude earnings increases paid to 19participants under contracts or collective bargaining 20agreements entered into, amended, or renewed before June 1, 212005. 22    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 23(g), the System shall exclude earnings increases paid to a 24participant at a time when the participant is 10 or more years 25from retirement eligibility under Section 15-135. 26    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection   SB1668- 31 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1(g), the System shall exclude earnings increases resulting 2from overload work, including a contract for summer teaching, 3or overtime when the employer has certified to the System, and 4the System has approved the certification, that: (i) in the 5case of overloads (A) the overload work is for the sole purpose 6of academic instruction in excess of the standard number of 7instruction hours for a full-time employee occurring during 8the academic year that the overload is paid and (B) the 9earnings increases are equal to or less than the rate of pay 10for academic instruction computed using the participant's 11current salary rate and work schedule; and (ii) in the case of 12overtime, the overtime was necessary for the educational 13mission.14    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 15(g), the System shall exclude any earnings increase resulting 16from (i) a promotion for which the employee moves from one 17classification to a higher classification under the State 18Universities Civil Service System, (ii) a promotion in 19academic rank for a tenured or tenure-track faculty position, 20or (iii) a promotion that the Illinois Community College Board 21has recommended in accordance with subsection (k) of this 22Section. These earnings increases shall be excluded only if 23the promotion is to a position that has existed and been filled 24by a member for no less than one complete academic year and the 25earnings increase as a result of the promotion is an increase 26that results in an amount no greater than the average salary   SB1668- 32 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1paid for other similar positions.2    (h-5) When assessing payment for any amount due under 3subsection (g), the System shall exclude any earnings increase 4paid in an academic year beginning on or after July 1, 2020 5resulting from overload work performed in an academic year 6subsequent to an academic year in which the employer was 7unable to offer or allow to be conducted overload work due to 8an emergency declaration limiting such activities. 9    (i) When assessing payment for any amount due under 10subsection (g), the System shall exclude any salary increase 11described in subsection (h) of this Section given on or after 12July 1, 2011 but before July 1, 2014 under a contract or 13collective bargaining agreement entered into, amended, or 14renewed on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 1, 2011. 15Except as provided in subsection (h-5), any payments made or 16salary increases given after June 30, 2014 shall be used in 17assessing payment for any amount due under subsection (g) of 18this Section. 19    (j) The System shall prepare a report and file copies of 20the report with the Governor and the General Assembly by 21January 1, 2007 that contains all of the following 22information:23        (1) The number of recalculations required by the 24    changes made to this Section by Public Act 94-1057 for 25    each employer.26        (2) The dollar amount by which each employer's   SB1668- 33 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    contribution to the System was changed due to 2    recalculations required by Public Act 94-1057.3        (3) The total amount the System received from each 4    employer as a result of the changes made to this Section by 5    Public Act 94-4.6        (4) The increase in the required State contribution 7    resulting from the changes made to this Section by Public 8    Act 94-1057.9    (j-5) For State fiscal years beginning on or after July 1, 102017, if the amount of a participant's earnings for any State 11fiscal year exceeds the amount of the salary set by law for the 12Governor that is in effect on July 1 of that fiscal year, the 13participant's employer shall pay to the System, in addition to 14all other payments required under this Section and in 15accordance with guidelines established by the System, an 16amount determined by the System to be equal to the employer 17normal cost, as established by the System and expressed as a 18total percentage of payroll, multiplied by the amount of 19earnings in excess of the amount of the salary set by law for 20the Governor. This amount shall be computed by the System on 21the basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in the 22most recent actuarial valuation of the System that is 23available at the time of the computation. The System may 24require the employer to provide any pertinent information or 25documentation.26    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be   SB1668- 34 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 2amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 3The bill shall specify the calculation used to determine the 4amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 5may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 6System in writing for a recalculation.

All 18payments must be received within 3 years after issuance of the 19bill. If the employer fails to make complete payment, 20including applicable interest, within 3 years, then the System 21may, after giving notice to the employer, certify the 22delinquent amount to the State Comptroller, and the 23Comptroller shall thereupon deduct the certified delinquent 24amount from State funds payable to the employer and pay them 25instead to the System. 26    This subsection (j-5) does not apply to a participant's   SB1668- 35 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1earnings to the extent an employer pays the employer normal 2cost of such earnings. 3    The changes made to this subsection (j-5) by Public Act 4100-624 are intended to apply retroactively to July 6, 2017 5(the effective date of Public Act 100-23). 6    (k) The Illinois Community College Board shall adopt rules 7for recommending lists of promotional positions submitted to 8the Board by community colleges and for reviewing the 9promotional lists on an annual basis. When recommending 10promotional lists, the Board shall consider the similarity of 11the positions submitted to those positions recognized for 12State universities by the State Universities Civil Service 13System. The Illinois Community College Board shall file a copy 14of its findings with the System. The System shall consider the 15findings of the Illinois Community College Board when making 16determinations under this Section.

On or before January 15, 2013 and each January 1615 thereafter, the Board shall certify to the Governor and the 17General Assembly the amount of the required State contribution 18for the next fiscal year. The Board's certification must note 19any deviations from the State Actuary's recommended changes, 20the reason or reasons for not following the State Actuary's 21recommended changes, and the fiscal impact of not following 22the State Actuary's recommended changes on the required State 23contribution. 24    (a-10) By November 1, 2017, the Board shall recalculate 25and recertify to the State Actuary, the Governor, and the 26General Assembly the amount of the State contribution to the   SB1668- 39 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1System for State fiscal year 2018, taking into account the 2changes in required State contributions made by Public Act 3100-23. The State Actuary shall review the assumptions and 4valuations underlying the Board's revised certification and 5issue a preliminary report concerning the proposed 6recertification and identifying, if necessary, recommended 7changes in actuarial assumptions that the Board must consider 8before finalizing its certification of the required State 9contributions. The Board's final certification must note any 10deviations from the State Actuary's recommended changes, the 11reason or reasons for not following the State Actuary's 12recommended changes, and the fiscal impact of not following 13the State Actuary's recommended changes on the required State 14contribution. 15    (a-15) On or after June 15, 2019, but no later than June 1630, 2019, the Board shall recalculate and recertify to the 17Governor and the General Assembly the amount of the State 18contribution to the System for State fiscal year 2019, taking 19into account the changes in required State contributions made 20by Public Act 100-587. The recalculation shall be made using 21assumptions adopted by the Board for the original fiscal year 222019 certification. The monthly voucher for the 12th month of 23fiscal year 2019 shall be paid by the Comptroller after the 24recertification required pursuant to this subsection is 25submitted to the Governor, Comptroller, and General Assembly. 26The recertification submitted to the General Assembly shall be   SB1668- 40 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1filed with the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the 2Secretary of the Senate in electronic form only, in the manner 3that the Clerk and the Secretary shall direct. 4    (b) Through State fiscal year 1995, the State 5contributions shall be paid to the System in accordance with 6Section 18-7 of the School Code.7    (b-1) Unless otherwise directed by the Comptroller under 8subsection (b-1.1), the Board shall submit vouchers for 9payment of State contributions to the System for the 10applicable month on the 15th day of each month, or as soon 11thereafter as may be practicable. The amount vouchered for a 12monthly payment shall total one-twelfth of the required annual 13State contribution certified under subsection (a-1). 14    (b-1.1) Beginning in State fiscal year 2025, if the 15Comptroller requests that the Board submit, during a State 16fiscal year, vouchers for multiple monthly payments for the 17advance payment of State contributions due to the System for 18that State fiscal year, then the Board shall submit those 19additional vouchers as directed by the Comptroller, 20notwithstanding subsection (b-1). Unless an act of 21appropriations provides otherwise, nothing in this Section 22authorizes the Board to submit, in a State fiscal year, 23vouchers for the payment of State contributions to the System 24in an amount that exceeds the rate of payroll that is certified 25by the System under this Section for that State fiscal year. 26    (b-1.2) The vouchers described in subsections (b-1) and   SB1668- 41 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1(b-1.1) shall be paid by the State Comptroller and Treasurer 2by warrants drawn on the funds appropriated to the System for 3that fiscal year.4    If in any month the amount remaining unexpended from all 5other appropriations to the System for the applicable fiscal 6year (including the appropriations to the System under Section 78.12 of the State Finance Act and Section 1 of the State 8Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation Act) is less than the 9amount lawfully vouchered under this subsection, the 10difference shall be paid from the Common School Fund under the 11continuing appropriation authority provided in Section 1.1 of 12the State Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation Act.13    (b-2) Allocations from the Common School Fund apportioned 14to school districts not coming under this System shall not be 15diminished or affected by the provisions of this Article.16    (b-3) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, except as 17otherwise provided in this Section, the minimum contribution 18to the System to be made by the State for each fiscal year 19shall be an amount determined by the System to be sufficient to 20bring the total assets of the System up to 90% of the total 21actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of State fiscal 22year 2045. In making these determinations, the required State 23contribution shall be calculated each year as a level 24percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 25including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the 26projected unit credit actuarial cost method.  SB1668- 42 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    If the System determines that the minimum contribution to 2the System is sufficient to bring the total assets of the 3System up to 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of the 4System in the following fiscal year, then the System shall 5determine the actuarially determined contribution rate for the 6following year in accordance with this paragraph. Beginning 7the first State fiscal year after the total assets of the 8System are at least 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of 9the System and each State fiscal year thereafter, the 10contribution to the System shall be calculated based on an 11actuarially determined contribution rate in accordance with 12the following:13        (1) The Board, with the consultation of a competent 14    actuary, shall calculate the actuarially determined 15    contribution rate for each fiscal year.16        (2) The System shall calculate the actuarially 17    determined contribution rate in accordance with the 18    Governmental Accounting Research System and officially 19    adopted actuarial assumptions. The System shall use this 20    valuation to calculate the actuarially determined 21    contribution rate for the next fiscal year.22        (3) No later than January 1 of each year in which this 23    paragraph applies, the System shall report the actuarially 24    determined contribution rate for the following fiscal year 25    to the Governor, the Auditor General, the State Treasurer, 26    and the General Assembly.  SB1668- 43 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1        (4) After the calculation of the actuarially 2    determined contribution rate under item (2), the General 3    Assembly and the System shall calculate the necessary 4    amount to account for any changes in appropriations 5    necessary to fund the minimum contribution, including 6    changes in amounts for the employer's share of the 7    actuarially determined contribution rate.8        (5) The actuarially determined contribution rate for a 9    fiscal year shall not be less than the amount for the 10    preceding fiscal year if the ratio of the System's total 11    assets to the System's total liabilities is less than 90%.12        (6) In no event shall the actuarially determined 13    contribution rate be less than the normal cost for that 14    fiscal year. 15    For each of State fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 16State shall make an additional contribution to the System 17equal to 2% of the total payroll of each employee who is deemed 18to have elected the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has 19made the election under subsection (c) of Section 1-161. 20    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 21increases or decreases the required State contribution and 22first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 23implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 24beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 25change first applies to the required State contribution.26    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that   SB1668- 44 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1increases or decreases the required State contribution and 2first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 32015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:4        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before 5    2018; and6        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 7    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 8    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 9    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 10    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 11    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 12    fiscal years in that 5-year period.13    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State 14contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable 15employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 16increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 17contributing at the rate required under this Section; except 18that in the following specified State fiscal years, the State 19contribution to the System shall not be less than the 20following indicated percentages of the applicable employee 21payroll, even if the indicated percentage will produce a State 22contribution in excess of the amount otherwise required under 23this subsection and subsection (a), and notwithstanding any 24contrary certification made under subsection (a-1) before May 2527, 1998 (the effective date of Public Act 90-582): 10.02% in 26FY 1999; 10.77% in FY 2000; 11.47% in FY 2001; 12.16% in FY   SB1668- 45 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b12002; 12.86% in FY 2003; and 13.56% in FY 2004.2    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 3total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2006 4is $534,627,700. 5    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 6total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2007 7is $738,014,500. 8    For each of State fiscal years 2008 through 2009, the 9State contribution to the System, as a percentage of the 10applicable employee payroll, shall be increased in equal 11annual increments from the required State contribution for 12State fiscal year 2007, so that by State fiscal year 2011, the 13State is contributing at the rate otherwise required under 14this Section. 15    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 16total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2010 17is $2,089,268,000 and shall be made from the proceeds of bonds 18sold in fiscal year 2010 pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General 19Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale 20expenses determined by the System's share of total bond 21proceeds, (ii) any amounts received from the Common School 22Fund in fiscal year 2010, and (iii) any reduction in bond 23proceeds due to the issuance of discounted bonds, if 24applicable. 25    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 26total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2011   SB1668- 46 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1is the amount recertified by the System on or before April 1, 22011 pursuant to subsection (a-1) of this Section and shall be 3made from the proceeds of bonds sold in fiscal year 2011 4pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, 5less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale expenses determined by 6the System's share of total bond proceeds, (ii) any amounts 7received from the Common School Fund in fiscal year 2011, and 8(iii) any reduction in bond proceeds due to the issuance of 9discounted bonds, if applicable. This amount shall include, in 10addition to the amount certified by the System, an amount 11necessary to meet employer contributions required by the State 12as an employer under paragraph (e) of this Section, which may 13also be used by the System for contributions required by 14paragraph (a) of Section 16-127. 15    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, except as otherwise 16provided in this Section, the minimum State contribution for 17each fiscal year shall be the amount needed to maintain the 18total assets of the System at 90% of the total actuarial 19liabilities of the System.20    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 21the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 22Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 23constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 24contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 25Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 26calculation of, the required State contributions under this   SB1668- 47 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1Article in any future year until the System has reached a 2funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 3the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 4term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 5System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act.6    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 7required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 8fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 9calculated under this Section and certified under subsection 10(a-1), shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount of 11the required State contribution that would have been 12calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 13System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 14Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 15portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 16fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 17purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 18the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 19the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 207.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act. In determining this 21maximum for State fiscal years 2008 through 2010, however, the 22amount referred to in item (i) shall be increased, as a 23percentage of the applicable employee payroll, in equal 24increments calculated from the sum of the required State 25contribution for State fiscal year 2007 plus the applicable 26portion of the State's total debt service payments for fiscal   SB1668- 48 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1year 2007 on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 2purposes of Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, so 3that, by State fiscal year 2011, the State is contributing at 4the rate otherwise required under this Section.5    (b-4) Beginning in fiscal year 2018, each employer under 6this Article shall pay to the System a required contribution 7determined as a percentage of projected payroll and sufficient 8to produce an annual amount equal to:9        (i) for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 10    defined benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, 11    less the employee contribution, for each employee of that 12    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 13    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 14    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; for fiscal 15    year 2021 and each fiscal year thereafter, the defined 16    benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, less the 17    employee contribution, plus 2%, for each employee of that 18    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 19    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 20    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; plus21        (ii) the amount required for that fiscal year to 22    amortize any unfunded actuarial accrued liability 23    associated with the present value of liabilities 24    attributable to the employer's account under Section 25    16-158.3, determined as a level percentage of payroll over 26    a 30-year rolling amortization period.  SB1668- 49 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    In determining contributions required under item (i) of 2this subsection, the System shall determine an aggregate rate 3for all employers, expressed as a percentage of projected 4payroll. 5    In determining the contributions required under item (ii) 6of this subsection, the amount shall be computed by the System 7on the basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in 8the most recent actuarial valuation of the System that is 9available at the time of the computation. 10    The contributions required under this subsection (b-4) 11shall be paid by an employer concurrently with that employer's 12payroll payment period. The State, as the actual employer of 13an employee, shall make the required contributions under this 14subsection. 15    (c) Payment of the required State contributions and of all 16pensions, retirement annuities, death benefits, refunds, and 17other benefits granted under or assumed by this System, and 18all expenses in connection with the administration and 19operation thereof, are obligations of the State.20    If members are paid from special trust or federal funds 21which are administered by the employing unit, whether school 22district or other unit, the employing unit shall pay to the 23System from such funds the full accruing retirement costs 24based upon that service, which, beginning July 1, 2017, shall 25be at a rate, expressed as a percentage of salary, equal to the 26total employer's normal cost, expressed as a percentage of   SB1668- 50 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1payroll, as determined by the System. Employer contributions, 2based on salary paid to members from federal funds, may be 3forwarded by the distributing agency of the State of Illinois 4to the System prior to allocation, in an amount determined in 5accordance with guidelines established by such agency and the 6System. Any contribution for fiscal year 2015 collected as a 7result of the change made by Public Act 98-674 shall be 8considered a State contribution under subsection (b-3) of this 9Section. 10    (d) Effective July 1, 1986, any employer of a teacher as 11defined in paragraph (8) of Section 16-106 shall pay the 12employer's normal cost of benefits based upon the teacher's 13service, in addition to employee contributions, as determined 14by the System. Such employer contributions shall be forwarded 15monthly in accordance with guidelines established by the 16System.17    However, with respect to benefits granted under Section 1816-133.4 or 16-133.5 to a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) 19of Section 16-106, the employer's contribution shall be 12% 20(rather than 20%) of the member's highest annual salary rate 21for each year of creditable service granted, and the employer 22shall also pay the required employee contribution on behalf of 23the teacher. For the purposes of Sections 16-133.4 and 2416-133.5, a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) of Section 2516-106 who is serving in that capacity while on leave of 26absence from another employer under this Article shall not be   SB1668- 51 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1considered an employee of the employer from which the teacher 2is on leave.3    (e) Beginning July 1, 1998, every employer of a teacher 4shall pay to the System an employer contribution computed as 5follows:6        (1) Beginning July 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999, the 7    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.3% of each 8    teacher's salary.9        (2) Beginning July 1, 1999 and thereafter, the 10    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.58% of each 11    teacher's salary.12The school district or other employing unit may pay these 13employer contributions out of any source of funding available 14for that purpose and shall forward the contributions to the 15System on the schedule established for the payment of member 16contributions.17    These employer contributions are intended to offset a 18portion of the cost to the System of the increases in 19retirement benefits resulting from Public Act 90-582.20    Each employer of teachers is entitled to a credit against 21the contributions required under this subsection (e) with 22respect to salaries paid to teachers for the period January 1, 232002 through June 30, 2003, equal to the amount paid by that 24employer under subsection (a-5) of Section 6.6 of the State 25Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971 with respect to salaries 26paid to teachers for that period.  SB1668- 52 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    The additional 1% employee contribution required under 2Section 16-152 by Public Act 90-582 is the responsibility of 3the teacher and not the teacher's employer, unless the 4employer agrees, through collective bargaining or otherwise, 5to make the contribution on behalf of the teacher.6    If an employer is required by a contract in effect on May 71, 1998 between the employer and an employee organization to 8pay, on behalf of all its full-time employees covered by this 9Article, all mandatory employee contributions required under 10this Article, then the employer shall be excused from paying 11the employer contribution required under this subsection (e) 12for the balance of the term of that contract. The employer and 13the employee organization shall jointly certify to the System 14the existence of the contractual requirement, in such form as 15the System may prescribe. This exclusion shall cease upon the 16termination, extension, or renewal of the contract at any time 17after May 1, 1998.18    (f) If the amount of a teacher's salary for any school year 19used to determine final average salary exceeds the member's 20annual full-time salary rate with the same employer for the 21previous school year by more than 6%, the teacher's employer 22shall pay to the System, in addition to all other payments 23required under this Section and in accordance with guidelines 24established by the System, the present value of the increase 25in benefits resulting from the portion of the increase in 26salary that is in excess of 6%. This present value shall be   SB1668- 53 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1computed by the System on the basis of the actuarial 2assumptions and tables used in the most recent actuarial 3valuation of the System that is available at the time of the 4computation. If a teacher's salary for the 2005-2006 school 5year is used to determine final average salary under this 6subsection (f), then the changes made to this subsection (f) 7by Public Act 94-1057 shall apply in calculating whether the 8increase in his or her salary is in excess of 6%. For the 9purposes of this Section, change in employment under Section 1010-21.12 of the School Code on or after June 1, 2005 shall 11constitute a change in employer. The System may require the 12employer to provide any pertinent information or 13documentation. The changes made to this subsection (f) by 14Public Act 94-1111 apply without regard to whether the teacher 15was in service on or after its effective date. 16    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 17required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 18amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 19The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 20amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 21may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 22System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 23specify in detail the grounds of the dispute and, if the 24employer asserts that the calculation is subject to subsection 25(g), (g-5), (g-10), (g-15), (g-20), or (h) of this Section, 26must include an affidavit setting forth and attesting to all   SB1668- 54 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1facts within the employer's knowledge that are pertinent to 2the applicability of that subsection. Upon receiving a timely 3application for recalculation, the System shall review the 4application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount due. 5    The employer contributions required under this subsection 6(f) may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 7receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 8paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 9will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 10actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 11annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 12must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 13of the bill. 14    (f-1) (Blank).15    (g) This subsection (g) applies only to payments made or 16salary increases given on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 171, 2011. The changes made by Public Act 94-1057 shall not 18require the System to refund any payments received before July 1931, 2006 (the effective date of Public Act 94-1057).20    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 21(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to 22teachers under contracts or collective bargaining agreements 23entered into, amended, or renewed before June 1, 2005. 24    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 25(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to a 26teacher at a time when the teacher is 10 or more years from   SB1668- 55 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1retirement eligibility under Section 16-132 or 16-133.2. 2    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 3(f), the System shall exclude salary increases resulting from 4overload work, including summer school, when the school 5district has certified to the System, and the System has 6approved the certification, that (i) the overload work is for 7the sole purpose of classroom instruction in excess of the 8standard number of classes for a full-time teacher in a school 9district during a school year and (ii) the salary increases 10are equal to or less than the rate of pay for classroom 11instruction computed on the teacher's current salary and work 12schedule. 13    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 14(f), the System shall exclude a salary increase resulting from 15a promotion (i) for which the employee is required to hold a 16certificate or supervisory endorsement issued by the State 17Teacher

Beginning 8the first State fiscal year after the total assets of the 9System are at least 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of 10the System and each State fiscal year thereafter, the 11contribution to the System shall be calculated based on an 12actuarially determined contribution rate in accordance with 13the following:14        (1) The Board, with the consultation of a competent 15    actuary, shall calculate the actuarially determined 16    contribution rate for each fiscal year.17        (2) The System shall calculate the actuarially 18    determined contribution rate in accordance with the 19    Governmental Accounting Research System and officially 20    adopted actuarial assumptions. The System shall use this 21    valuation to calculate the actuarially determined 22    contribution rate for the next fiscal year.23        (3) No later than January 1 of each year in which this 24    paragraph applies, the System shall report the actuarially 25    determined contribution rate for the following fiscal year 26    to the Governor, the Auditor General, the State Treasurer,   SB1668- 62 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    and the General Assembly.2        (4) After the calculation of the actuarially 3    determined contribution rate under item (2), the General 4    Assembly and the System shall calculate the necessary 5    amount to account for any changes in appropriations 6    necessary to fund the minimum contribution, including 7    changes in amounts for the employer's share of the 8    actuarially determined contribution rate.9        (5) The actuarially determined contribution rate for a 10    fiscal year shall not be less than the amount for the 11    preceding fiscal year if the ratio of the System's total 12    assets to the System's total liabilities is less than 90%.13        (6) In no event shall the actuarially determined 14    contribution rate be less than the normal cost for that 15    fiscal year. 16    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 17increases or decreases the required State contribution and 18first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 19implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 20beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 21change first applies to the required State contribution.22    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 23increases or decreases the required State contribution and 24first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 252015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:26        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before   SB1668- 63 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    2018; and2        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 3    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 4    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 5    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 6    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 7    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 8    fiscal years in that 5-year period.9    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State 10contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable 11employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 12increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 13contributing at the rate required under this Section.14    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 15total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2006 16is $29,189,400. 17    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 18total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2007 19is $35,236,800. 20    For each of State fiscal years 2008 through 2009, the 21State contribution to the System, as a percentage of the 22applicable employee payroll, shall be increased in equal 23annual increments from the required State contribution for 24State fiscal year 2007, so that by State fiscal year 2011, the 25State is contributing at the rate otherwise required under 26this Section.   SB1668- 64 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 2total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2010 3is $78,832,000 and shall be made from the proceeds of bonds 4sold in fiscal year 2010 pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General 5Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale 6expenses determined by the System's share of total bond 7proceeds, (ii) any amounts received from the General Revenue 8Fund in fiscal year 2010, and (iii) any reduction in bond 9proceeds due to the issuance of discounted bonds, if 10applicable. 11    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 12total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2011 13is the amount recertified by the System on or before April 1, 142011 pursuant to Section 18-140 and shall be made from the 15proceeds of bonds sold in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to Section 167.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the pro rata 17share of bond sale expenses determined by the System's share 18of total bond proceeds, (ii) any amounts received from the 19General Revenue Fund in fiscal year 2011, and (iii) any 20reduction in bond proceeds due to the issuance of discounted 21bonds, if applicable. 22    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, except as otherwise 23provided in this Section, the minimum State contribution for 24each fiscal year shall be the amount needed to maintain the 25total assets of the System at 90% of the total actuarial 26liabilities of the System.  SB1668- 65 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 2the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 3Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 4constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 5contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 6Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 7calculation of, the required State contributions under this 8Article in any future year until the System has reached a 9funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 10the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 11term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 12System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act. 13    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 14required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 15fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 16calculated under this Section and certified under Section 1718-140, shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount of 18the required State contribution that would have been 19calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 20System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 21Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 22portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 23fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 24purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 25the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 26the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section   SB1668- 66 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b17.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act. In determining this 2maximum for State fiscal years 2008 through 2010, however, the 3amount referred to in item (i) shall be increased, as a 4percentage of the applicable employee payroll, in equal 5increments calculated from the sum of the required State 6contribution for State fiscal year 2007 plus the applicable 7portion of the State's total debt service payments for fiscal 8year 2007 on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 9purposes of Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, so 10that, by State fiscal year 2011, the State is contributing at 11the rate otherwise required under this Section.12    (d) For purposes of determining the required State 13contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets 14shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 15which shall be calculated as follows:16    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 17assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 18that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 19assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 20gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 21year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 225-year period following that fiscal year. 23    (e) For purposes of determining the required State 24contribution to the system for a particular year, the 25actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 26return equal to the system's actuarially assumed rate of   SB1668- 67 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1return. 2(Source: P.A. 100-23, eff. 7-6-17.)

In determining the actuarial value of the System's 25assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 26gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal   SB1668- 8 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 25-year period following that fiscal year. 3    (e) For purposes of determining the required State 4contribution to the system for a particular year, the 5actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 6return equal to the system's actuarially assumed rate of 7return. 8(Source: P.A. 100-23, eff. 7-6-17.) 9    (40 ILCS 5/14-131)10    Sec. 14-131. Contributions by State. 11    (a) The State shall make contributions to the System by 12appropriations of amounts which, together with other employer 13contributions from trust, federal, and other funds, employee 14contributions, investment income, and other income, will be 15sufficient to meet the cost of maintaining and administering 16the System on a 90% funded basis in accordance with actuarial 17recommendations.18    For the purposes of this Section and Section 14-135.08, 19references to State contributions refer only to employer 20contributions and do not include employee contributions that 21are picked up or otherwise paid by the State or a department on 22behalf of the employee.23    (b) The Board shall determine the total amount of State 24contributions required for each fiscal year on the basis of 25the actuarial tables and other assumptions adopted by the   SB1668- 9 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1Board, using the formula in subsection (e).2    The Board shall also determine a State contribution rate 3for each fiscal year, expressed as a percentage of payroll, 4based on the total required State contribution for that fiscal 5year (less the amount received by the System from 6appropriations under Section 8.12 of the State Finance Act and 7Section 1 of the State Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation 8Act, if any, for the fiscal year ending on the June 30 9immediately preceding the applicable November 15 certification 10deadline), the estimated payroll (including all forms of 11compensation) for personal services rendered by eligible 12employees, and the recommendations of the actuary.13    For the purposes of this Section and Section 14.1 of the 14State Finance Act, the term "eligible employees" includes 15employees who participate in the System, persons who may elect 16to participate in the System but have not so elected, persons 17who are serving a qualifying period that is required for 18participation, and annuitants employed by a department as 19described in subdivision (a)(1) or (a)(2) of Section 14-111.20    (c) Contributions shall be made by the several departments 21for each pay period by warrants drawn by the State Comptroller 22against their respective funds or appropriations based upon 23vouchers stating the amount to be so contributed. These 24amounts shall be based on the full rate certified by the Board 25under Section 14-135.08 for that fiscal year. From March 5, 262004 (the effective date of Public Act 93-665) through the   SB1668- 10 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1payment of the final payroll from fiscal year 2004 2appropriations, the several departments shall not make 3contributions for the remainder of fiscal year 2004 but shall 4instead make payments as required under subsection (a-1) of 5Section 14.1 of the State Finance Act. The several departments 6shall resume those contributions at the commencement of fiscal 7year 2005.8    (c-1) Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this Section, for 9fiscal years 2010, 2012, and each fiscal year thereafter, 10contributions by the several departments are not required to 11be made for General Revenue Funds payrolls processed by the 12Comptroller. Payrolls paid by the several departments from all 13other State funds must continue to be processed pursuant to 14subsection (c) of this Section.15    (c-2) Unless otherwise directed by the Comptroller under 16subsection (c-3), the Board shall submit vouchers for payment 17of State contributions to the System for the applicable month 18on the 15th day of each month, or as soon thereafter as may be 19practicable. The amount vouchered for a monthly payment shall 20total one-twelfth of the fiscal year General Revenue Fund 21contribution as certified by the System pursuant to Section 2214-135.08 of this Code. 23    (c-3) Beginning in State fiscal year 2025, if the 24Comptroller requests that the Board submit, during a State 25fiscal year, vouchers for multiple monthly payments for 26advance payment of State contributions due to the System for   SB1668- 11 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1that State fiscal year, then the Board shall submit those 2additional vouchers as directed by the Comptroller, 3notwithstanding subsection (c-2). Unless an act of 4appropriations provides otherwise, nothing in this Section 5authorizes the Board to submit, in a State fiscal year, 6vouchers for the payment of State contributions to the System 7in an amount that exceeds the rate of payroll that is certified 8by the System under Section 14-135.08 for that State fiscal 9year. 10    (d) If an employee is paid from trust funds or federal 11funds, the department or other employer shall pay employer 12contributions from those funds to the System at the certified 13rate, unless the terms of the trust or the federal-State 14agreement preclude the use of the funds for that purpose, in 15which case the required employer contributions shall be paid 16by the State. 17    (e) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, except as 18otherwise provided in this Section, the minimum contribution 19to the System to be made by the State for each fiscal year 20shall be an amount determined by the System to be sufficient to 21bring the total assets of the System up to 90% of the total 22actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of State fiscal 23year 2045. In making these determinations, the required State 24contribution shall be calculated each year as a level 25percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 26including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the   SB1668- 12 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1projected unit credit actuarial cost method.2    If the System determines that the minimum contribution to 3the System is sufficient to bring the total assets of the 4System up to 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of the 5System in the following fiscal year, then the System shall 6determine the actuarially determined contribution rate for the 7following year in accordance with this paragraph. Beginning 8the first State fiscal year after the total assets of the 9System are at least 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of 10the System and each State fiscal year thereafter, the 11contribution to the System shall be calculated based on an 12actuarially determined contribution rate in accordance with 13the following:14        (1) The Board, with the consultation of a competent 15    actuary, shall calculate the actuarially determined 16    contribution rate for each fiscal year.17        (2) The System shall calculate the actuarially 18    determined contribution rate in accordance with the 19    Governmental Accounting Research System and officially 20    adopted actuarial assumptions. The System shall use this 21    valuation to calculate the actuarially determined 22    contribution rate for the next fiscal year.23        (3) No later than January 1 of each year in which this 24    paragraph applies, the System shall report the actuarially 25    determined contribution rate for the following fiscal year 26    to the Governor, the Auditor General, the State Treasurer,   SB1668- 13 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    and the General Assembly.2        (4) After the calculation of the actuarially 3    determined contribution rate under item (2), the General 4    Assembly and the System shall calculate the necessary 5    amount to account for any changes in appropriations 6    necessary to fund the minimum contribution, including 7    changes in amounts for the employer's share of the 8    actuarially determined contribution rate.9        (5) The actuarially determined contribution rate for a 10    fiscal year shall not be less than the amount for the 11    preceding fiscal year if the ratio of the System's total 12    assets to the System's total liabilities is less than 90%.13        (6) In no event shall the actuarially determined 14    contribution rate be less than the normal cost for that 15    fiscal year. 16    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 17increases or decreases the required State contribution and 18first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 19implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 20beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 21change first applies to the required State contribution.22    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 23increases or decreases the required State contribution and 24first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 252015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:26        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before   SB1668- 14 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    2018; and2        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 3    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 4    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 5    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 6    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 7    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 8    fiscal years in that 5-year period.9    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State 10contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable 11employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 12increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 13contributing at the rate required under this Section; except 14that (i) for State fiscal year 1998, for all purposes of this 15Code and any other law of this State, the certified percentage 16of the applicable employee payroll shall be 5.052% for 17employees earning eligible creditable service under Section 1814-110 and 6.500% for all other employees, notwithstanding any 19contrary certification made under Section 14-135.08 before 20July 7, 1997 (the effective date of Public Act 90-65), and (ii) 21in the following specified State fiscal years, the State 22contribution to the System shall not be less than the 23following indicated percentages of the applicable employee 24payroll, even if the indicated percentage will produce a State 25contribution in excess of the amount otherwise required under 26this subsection and subsection (a): 9.8% in FY 1999; 10.0% in   SB1668- 15 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1FY 2000; 10.2% in FY 2001; 10.4% in FY 2002; 10.6% in FY 2003; 2and 10.8% in FY 2004.3    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, except as otherwise 4provided in this Section, the minimum State contribution for 5each fiscal year shall be the amount needed to maintain the 6total assets of the System at 90% of the total actuarial 7liabilities of the System.8    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 9the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 10Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 11constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 12contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 13Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 14calculation of, the required State contributions under this 15Article in any future year until the System has reached a 16funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 17the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 18term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 19System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act. 20    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 21required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 22fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 23calculated under this Section and certified under Section 2414-135.08, shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount 25of the required State contribution that would have been 26calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the   SB1668- 16 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 2Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 3portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 4fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 5purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 6the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 7the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 87.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act.9    (f) (Blank).10    (g) For purposes of determining the required State 11contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets 12shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 13which shall be calculated as follows:14    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 15assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 16that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 17assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 18gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 19year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 205-year period following that fiscal year. 21    (h) For purposes of determining the required State 22contribution to the System for a particular year, the 23actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 24return equal to the System's actuarially assumed rate of 25return. 26    (i) (Blank).  SB1668- 17 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    (j) (Blank).2    (k) For fiscal year 2012 and each fiscal year thereafter, 3after the submission of all payments for eligible employees 4from personal services line items paid from the General 5Revenue Fund in the fiscal year have been made, the 6Comptroller shall provide to the System a certification of the 7sum of all expenditures in the fiscal year for personal 8services. Upon receipt of the certification, the System shall 9determine the amount due to the System based on the full rate 10certified by the Board under Section 14-135.08 for the fiscal 11year in order to meet the State's obligation under this 12Section. The System shall compare this amount due to the 13amount received by the System for the fiscal year. If the 14amount due is more than the amount received, the difference 15shall be termed the "Prior Fiscal Year Shortfall" for purposes 16of this Section, and the Prior Fiscal Year Shortfall shall be 17satisfied under Section 1.2 of the State Pension Funds 18Continuing Appropriation Act. If the amount due is less than 19the amount received, the difference shall be termed the "Prior 20Fiscal Year Overpayment" for purposes of this Section, and the 21Prior Fiscal Year Overpayment shall be repaid by the System to 22the General Revenue Fund as soon as practicable after the 23certification. 24(Source: P.A. 103-588, eff. 6-5-24.) 25    (40 ILCS 5/15-155)  (from Ch. 108 1/2, par. 15-155)  SB1668- 18 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    Sec. 15-155. Employer contributions. 2    (a) The State of Illinois shall make contributions by 3appropriations of amounts which, together with the other 4employer contributions from trust, federal, and other funds, 5employee contributions, income from investments, and other 6income of this System, will be sufficient to meet the cost of 7maintaining and administering the System on a 90% funded basis 8in accordance with actuarial recommendations.9    The Board shall determine the amount of State 10contributions required for each fiscal year on the basis of 11the actuarial tables and other assumptions adopted by the 12Board and the recommendations of the actuary, using the 13formula in subsection (a-1).14    (a-1) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, except as 15otherwise provided in this Section, the minimum contribution 16to the System to be made by the State for each fiscal year 17shall be an amount determined by the System to be sufficient to 18bring the total assets of the System up to 90% of the total 19actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of State fiscal 20year 2045. In making these determinations, the required State 21contribution shall be calculated each year as a level 22percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 23including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the 24projected unit credit actuarial cost method.25    If the System determines that the minimum contribution to 26the System is sufficient to bring the total assets of the   SB1668- 19 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1System up to 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of the 2System in the following fiscal year, then the System shall 3determine the actuarially determined contribution rate for the 4following year in accordance with this paragraph. Beginning 5the first State fiscal year after the total assets of the 6System are at least 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of 7the System and each State fiscal year thereafter, the 8contribution to the System shall be calculated based on an 9actuarially determined contribution rate in accordance with 10the following:11        (1) The Board, with the consultation of a competent 12    actuary, shall calculate the actuarially determined 13    contribution rate for each fiscal year.14        (2) The System shall calculate the actuarially 15    determined contribution rate in accordance with the 16    Governmental Accounting Research System and officially 17    adopted actuarial assumptions.

The local 7auxiliary funds, income funds, and service enterprise funds of 8universities shall not be considered trust funds for the 9purpose of this Article, but funds of alumni associations, 10foundations, and athletic associations which are affiliated 11with the universities included as employers under this Article 12and other employers which do not receive State appropriations 13are considered to be trust funds for the purpose of this 14Article.15    (b-1) The City of Urbana and the City of Champaign shall 16each make employer contributions to this System for their 17respective firefighter employees who participate in this 18System pursuant to subsection (h) of Section 15-107. The rate 19of contributions to be made by those municipalities shall be 20determined annually by the Board on the basis of the actuarial 21assumptions adopted by the Board and the recommendations of 22the actuary, and shall be expressed as a percentage of salary 23for each such employee. The Board shall certify the rate to the 24affected municipalities as soon as may be practical. The 25employer contributions required under this subsection shall be 26remitted by the municipality to the System at the same time and   SB1668- 27 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1in the same manner as employee contributions.2    (c) Through State fiscal year 1995: The total employer 3contribution shall be apportioned among the various funds of 4the State and other employers, whether trust, federal, or 5other funds, in accordance with actuarial procedures approved 6by the Board.

This present value shall be computed by the 16System on the basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables 17used in the most recent actuarial valuation of the System that 18is available at the time of the computation. The System may 19require the employer to provide any pertinent information or 20documentation.21    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 22required under this subsection (g), the System shall calculate 23the amount of the payment and bill the employer for that 24amount. The bill shall specify the calculations used to 25determine the amount due. If the employer disputes the amount 26of the bill, it may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill,   SB1668- 29 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1apply to the System in writing for a recalculation. The 2application must specify in detail the grounds of the dispute 3and, if the employer asserts that the calculation is subject 4to subsection (h), (h-5), or (i) of this Section, must include 5an affidavit setting forth and attesting to all facts within 6the employer's knowledge that are pertinent to the 7applicability of that subsection. Upon receiving a timely 8application for recalculation, the System shall review the 9application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount due. 10    The employer contributions required under this subsection 11(g) may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 12receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 13paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 14will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 15actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 16annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 17must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 18of the bill.19    When assessing payment for any amount due under this 20subsection (g), the System shall include earnings, to the 21extent not established by a participant under Section 2215-113.11 or 15-113.12, that would have been paid to the 23participant had the participant not taken (i) periods of 24voluntary or involuntary furlough occurring on or after July 251, 2015 and on or before June 30, 2017 or (ii) periods of 26voluntary pay reduction in lieu of furlough occurring on or   SB1668- 30 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1after July 1, 2015 and on or before June 30, 2017. Determining 2earnings that would have been paid to a participant had the 3participant not taken periods of voluntary or involuntary 4furlough or periods of voluntary pay reduction shall be the 5responsibility of the employer, and shall be reported in a 6manner prescribed by the System.7    This subsection (g) does not apply to (1) Tier 2 hybrid 8plan members and (2) Tier 2 defined benefit members who first 9participate under this Article on or after the implementation 10date of the Optional Hybrid Plan. 11    (g-1) (Blank).12    (h) This subsection (h) applies only to payments made or 13salary increases given on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 141, 2011. The changes made by Public Act 94-1057 shall not 15require the System to refund any payments received before July 1631, 2006 (the effective date of Public Act 94-1057).17    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 18(g), the System shall exclude earnings increases paid to 19participants under contracts or collective bargaining 20agreements entered into, amended, or renewed before June 1, 212005. 22    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 23(g), the System shall exclude earnings increases paid to a 24participant at a time when the participant is 10 or more years 25from retirement eligibility under Section 15-135. 26    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection   SB1668- 31 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1(g), the System shall exclude earnings increases resulting 2from overload work, including a contract for summer teaching, 3or overtime when the employer has certified to the System, and 4the System has approved the certification, that: (i) in the 5case of overloads (A) the overload work is for the sole purpose 6of academic instruction in excess of the standard number of 7instruction hours for a full-time employee occurring during 8the academic year that the overload is paid and (B) the 9earnings increases are equal to or less than the rate of pay 10for academic instruction computed using the participant's 11current salary rate and work schedule; and (ii) in the case of 12overtime, the overtime was necessary for the educational 13mission.14    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 15(g), the System shall exclude any earnings increase resulting 16from (i) a promotion for which the employee moves from one 17classification to a higher classification under the State 18Universities Civil Service System, (ii) a promotion in 19academic rank for a tenured or tenure-track faculty position, 20or (iii) a promotion that the Illinois Community College Board 21has recommended in accordance with subsection (k) of this 22Section.

This amount shall be computed by the System on 21the basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in the 22most recent actuarial valuation of the System that is 23available at the time of the computation. The System may 24require the employer to provide any pertinent information or 25documentation.26    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be   SB1668- 34 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 2amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 3The bill shall specify the calculation used to determine the 4amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 5may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 6System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 7specify in detail the grounds of the dispute. Upon receiving a 8timely application for recalculation, the System shall review 9the application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount 10due. 11    The employer contributions required under this subsection 12may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 13issuance of the bill.

All 18payments must be received within 3 years after issuance of the 19bill. If the employer fails to make complete payment, 20including applicable interest, within 3 years, then the System 21may, after giving notice to the employer, certify the 22delinquent amount to the State Comptroller, and the 23Comptroller shall thereupon deduct the certified delinquent 24amount from State funds payable to the employer and pay them 25instead to the System. 26    This subsection (j-5) does not apply to a participant's   SB1668- 35 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1earnings to the extent an employer pays the employer normal 2cost of such earnings. 3    The changes made to this subsection (j-5) by Public Act 4100-624 are intended to apply retroactively to July 6, 2017 5(the effective date of Public Act 100-23). 6    (k) The Illinois Community College Board shall adopt rules 7for recommending lists of promotional positions submitted to 8the Board by community colleges and for reviewing the 9promotional lists on an annual basis. When recommending 10promotional lists, the Board shall consider the similarity of 11the positions submitted to those positions recognized for 12State universities by the State Universities Civil Service 13System. The Illinois Community College Board shall file a copy 14of its findings with the System. The System shall consider the 15findings of the Illinois Community College Board when making 16determinations under this Section. The System shall not 17exclude any earnings increases resulting from a promotion when 18the promotion was not submitted by a community college. 19Nothing in this subsection (k) shall require any community 20college to submit any information to the Community College 21Board. 22    (l) For purposes of determining the required State 23contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets 24shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 25which shall be calculated as follows:26    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's   SB1668- 36 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 2that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 3assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 4gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 5year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 65-year period following that fiscal year. 7    (m) For purposes of determining the required State 8contribution to the system for a particular year, the 9actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 10return equal to the system's actuarially assumed rate of 11return. 12(Source: P.A. 101-10, eff. 6-5-19; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 13102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-764, eff. 145-13-22.) 15    (40 ILCS 5/16-158)  (from Ch. 108 1/2, par. 16-158)16    Sec. 16-158.

On or before January 1 of 10each year, beginning January 1, 2013, the State Actuary shall 11issue a preliminary report concerning the proposed 12certification and identifying, if necessary, recommended 13changes in actuarial assumptions that the Board must consider 14before finalizing its certification of the required State 15contributions. On or before January 15, 2013 and each January 1615 thereafter, the Board shall certify to the Governor and the 17General Assembly the amount of the required State contribution 18for the next fiscal year. The Board's certification must note 19any deviations from the State Actuary's recommended changes, 20the reason or reasons for not following the State Actuary's 21recommended changes, and the fiscal impact of not following 22the State Actuary's recommended changes on the required State 23contribution. 24    (a-10) By November 1, 2017, the Board shall recalculate 25and recertify to the State Actuary, the Governor, and the 26General Assembly the amount of the State contribution to the   SB1668- 39 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1System for State fiscal year 2018, taking into account the 2changes in required State contributions made by Public Act 3100-23. The State Actuary shall review the assumptions and 4valuations underlying the Board's revised certification and 5issue a preliminary report concerning the proposed 6recertification and identifying, if necessary, recommended 7changes in actuarial assumptions that the Board must consider 8before finalizing its certification of the required State 9contributions. The Board's final certification must note any 10deviations from the State Actuary's recommended changes, the 11reason or reasons for not following the State Actuary's 12recommended changes, and the fiscal impact of not following 13the State Actuary's recommended changes on the required State 14contribution. 15    (a-15) On or after June 15, 2019, but no later than June 1630, 2019, the Board shall recalculate and recertify to the 17Governor and the General Assembly the amount of the State 18contribution to the System for State fiscal year 2019, taking 19into account the changes in required State contributions made 20by Public Act 100-587. The recalculation shall be made using 21assumptions adopted by the Board for the original fiscal year 222019 certification. The monthly voucher for the 12th month of 23fiscal year 2019 shall be paid by the Comptroller after the 24recertification required pursuant to this subsection is 25submitted to the Governor, Comptroller, and General Assembly. 26The recertification submitted to the General Assembly shall be   SB1668- 40 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1filed with the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the 2Secretary of the Senate in electronic form only, in the manner 3that the Clerk and the Secretary shall direct. 4    (b) Through State fiscal year 1995, the State 5contributions shall be paid to the System in accordance with 6Section 18-7 of the School Code.7    (b-1) Unless otherwise directed by the Comptroller under 8subsection (b-1.1), the Board shall submit vouchers for 9payment of State contributions to the System for the 10applicable month on the 15th day of each month, or as soon 11thereafter as may be practicable. The amount vouchered for a 12monthly payment shall total one-twelfth of the required annual 13State contribution certified under subsection (a-1). 14    (b-1.1) Beginning in State fiscal year 2025, if the 15Comptroller requests that the Board submit, during a State 16fiscal year, vouchers for multiple monthly payments for the 17advance payment of State contributions due to the System for 18that State fiscal year, then the Board shall submit those 19additional vouchers as directed by the Comptroller, 20notwithstanding subsection (b-1). Unless an act of 21appropriations provides otherwise, nothing in this Section 22authorizes the Board to submit, in a State fiscal year, 23vouchers for the payment of State contributions to the System 24in an amount that exceeds the rate of payroll that is certified 25by the System under this Section for that State fiscal year. 26    (b-1.2) The vouchers described in subsections (b-1) and   SB1668- 41 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1(b-1.1) shall be paid by the State Comptroller and Treasurer 2by warrants drawn on the funds appropriated to the System for 3that fiscal year.4    If in any month the amount remaining unexpended from all 5other appropriations to the System for the applicable fiscal 6year (including the appropriations to the System under Section 78.12 of the State Finance Act and Section 1 of the State 8Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation Act) is less than the 9amount lawfully vouchered under this subsection, the 10difference shall be paid from the Common School Fund under the 11continuing appropriation authority provided in Section 1.1 of 12the State Pension Funds Continuing Appropriation Act.13    (b-2) Allocations from the Common School Fund apportioned 14to school districts not coming under this System shall not be 15diminished or affected by the provisions of this Article.16    (b-3) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, except as 17otherwise provided in this Section, the minimum contribution 18to the System to be made by the State for each fiscal year 19shall be an amount determined by the System to be sufficient to 20bring the total assets of the System up to 90% of the total 21actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of State fiscal 22year 2045. In making these determinations, the required State 23contribution shall be calculated each year as a level 24percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 25including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the 26projected unit credit actuarial cost method.  SB1668- 42 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    If the System determines that the minimum contribution to 2the System is sufficient to bring the total assets of the 3System up to 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of the 4System in the following fiscal year, then the System shall 5determine the actuarially determined contribution rate for the 6following year in accordance with this paragraph. Beginning 7the first State fiscal year after the total assets of the 8System are at least 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of 9the System and each State fiscal year thereafter, the 10contribution to the System shall be calculated based on an 11actuarially determined contribution rate in accordance with 12the following:13        (1) The Board, with the consultation of a competent 14    actuary, shall calculate the actuarially determined 15    contribution rate for each fiscal year.16        (2) The System shall calculate the actuarially 17    determined contribution rate in accordance with the 18    Governmental Accounting Research System and officially 19    adopted actuarial assumptions. The System shall use this 20    valuation to calculate the actuarially determined 21    contribution rate for the next fiscal year.22        (3) No later than January 1 of each year in which this 23    paragraph applies, the System shall report the actuarially 24    determined contribution rate for the following fiscal year 25    to the Governor, the Auditor General, the State Treasurer, 26    and the General Assembly.  SB1668- 43 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1        (4) After the calculation of the actuarially 2    determined contribution rate under item (2), the General 3    Assembly and the System shall calculate the necessary 4    amount to account for any changes in appropriations 5    necessary to fund the minimum contribution, including 6    changes in amounts for the employer's share of the 7    actuarially determined contribution rate.8        (5) The actuarially determined contribution rate for a 9    fiscal year shall not be less than the amount for the 10    preceding fiscal year if the ratio of the System's total 11    assets to the System's total liabilities is less than 90%.12        (6) In no event shall the actuarially determined 13    contribution rate be less than the normal cost for that 14    fiscal year. 15    For each of State fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 16State shall make an additional contribution to the System 17equal to 2% of the total payroll of each employee who is deemed 18to have elected the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has 19made the election under subsection (c) of Section 1-161. 20    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 21increases or decreases the required State contribution and 22first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 23implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 24beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 25change first applies to the required State contribution.26    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that   SB1668- 44 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1increases or decreases the required State contribution and 2first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 32015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:4        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before 5    2018;

except 18that in the following specified State fiscal years, the State 19contribution to the System shall not be less than the 20following indicated percentages of the applicable employee 21payroll, even if the indicated percentage will produce a State 22contribution in excess of the amount otherwise required under 23this subsection and subsection (a), and notwithstanding any 24contrary certification made under subsection (a-1) before May 2527, 1998 (the effective date of Public Act 90-582): 10.02% in 26FY 1999;

This amount shall include, in 10addition to the amount certified by the System, an amount 11necessary to meet employer contributions required by the State 12as an employer under paragraph (e) of this Section, which may 13also be used by the System for contributions required by 14paragraph (a) of Section 16-127. 15    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, except as otherwise 16provided in this Section, the minimum State contribution for 17each fiscal year shall be the amount needed to maintain the 18total assets of the System at 90% of the total actuarial 19liabilities of the System.20    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 21the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 22Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 23constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 24contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 25Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 26calculation of, the required State contributions under this   SB1668- 47 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1Article in any future year until the System has reached a 2funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 3the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 4term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 5System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act.6    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 7required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 8fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 9calculated under this Section and certified under subsection 10(a-1), shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount of 11the required State contribution that would have been 12calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 13System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 14Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 15portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 16fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 17purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 18the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 19the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section 207.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act. In determining this 21maximum for State fiscal years 2008 through 2010, however, the 22amount referred to in item (i) shall be increased, as a 23percentage of the applicable employee payroll, in equal 24increments calculated from the sum of the required State 25contribution for State fiscal year 2007 plus the applicable 26portion of the State's total debt service payments for fiscal   SB1668- 48 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1year 2007 on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 2purposes of Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, so 3that, by State fiscal year 2011, the State is contributing at 4the rate otherwise required under this Section.5    (b-4) Beginning in fiscal year 2018, each employer under 6this Article shall pay to the System a required contribution 7determined as a percentage of projected payroll and sufficient 8to produce an annual amount equal to:9        (i) for each of fiscal years 2018, 2019, and 2020, the 10    defined benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, 11    less the employee contribution, for each employee of that 12    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 13    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 14    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; for fiscal 15    year 2021 and each fiscal year thereafter, the defined 16    benefit normal cost of the defined benefit plan, less the 17    employee contribution, plus 2%, for each employee of that 18    employer who has elected or who is deemed to have elected 19    the benefits under Section 1-161 or who has made the 20    election under subsection (b) of Section 1-161; plus21        (ii) the amount required for that fiscal year to 22    amortize any unfunded actuarial accrued liability 23    associated with the present value of liabilities 24    attributable to the employer's account under Section 25    16-158.3, determined as a level percentage of payroll over 26    a 30-year rolling amortization period.  SB1668- 49 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    In determining contributions required under item (i) of 2this subsection, the System shall determine an aggregate rate 3for all employers, expressed as a percentage of projected 4payroll. 5    In determining the contributions required under item (ii) 6of this subsection, the amount shall be computed by the System 7on the basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in 8the most recent actuarial valuation of the System that is 9available at the time of the computation. 10    The contributions required under this subsection (b-4) 11shall be paid by an employer concurrently with that employer's 12payroll payment period. The State, as the actual employer of 13an employee, shall make the required contributions under this 14subsection. 15    (c) Payment of the required State contributions and of all 16pensions, retirement annuities, death benefits, refunds, and 17other benefits granted under or assumed by this System, and 18all expenses in connection with the administration and 19operation thereof, are obligations of the State.20    If members are paid from special trust or federal funds 21which are administered by the employing unit, whether school 22district or other unit, the employing unit shall pay to the 23System from such funds the full accruing retirement costs 24based upon that service, which, beginning July 1, 2017, shall 25be at a rate, expressed as a percentage of salary, equal to the 26total employer's normal cost, expressed as a percentage of   SB1668- 50 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1payroll, as determined by the System. Employer contributions, 2based on salary paid to members from federal funds, may be 3forwarded by the distributing agency of the State of Illinois 4to the System prior to allocation, in an amount determined in 5accordance with guidelines established by such agency and the 6System. Any contribution for fiscal year 2015 collected as a 7result of the change made by Public Act 98-674 shall be 8considered a State contribution under subsection (b-3) of this 9Section. 10    (d) Effective July 1, 1986, any employer of a teacher as 11defined in paragraph (8) of Section 16-106 shall pay the 12employer's normal cost of benefits based upon the teacher's 13service, in addition to employee contributions, as determined 14by the System. Such employer contributions shall be forwarded 15monthly in accordance with guidelines established by the 16System.17    However, with respect to benefits granted under Section 1816-133.4 or 16-133.5 to a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) 19of Section 16-106, the employer's contribution shall be 12% 20(rather than 20%) of the member's highest annual salary rate 21for each year of creditable service granted, and the employer 22shall also pay the required employee contribution on behalf of 23the teacher. For the purposes of Sections 16-133.4 and 2416-133.5, a teacher as defined in paragraph (8) of Section 2516-106 who is serving in that capacity while on leave of 26absence from another employer under this Article shall not be   SB1668- 51 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1considered an employee of the employer from which the teacher 2is on leave.3    (e) Beginning July 1, 1998, every employer of a teacher 4shall pay to the System an employer contribution computed as 5follows:6        (1) Beginning July 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999, the 7    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.3% of each 8    teacher's salary.9        (2) Beginning July 1, 1999 and thereafter, the 10    employer contribution shall be equal to 0.58% of each 11    teacher's salary.12The school district or other employing unit may pay these 13employer contributions out of any source of funding available 14for that purpose and shall forward the contributions to the 15System on the schedule established for the payment of member 16contributions.17    These employer contributions are intended to offset a 18portion of the cost to the System of the increases in 19retirement benefits resulting from Public Act 90-582.20    Each employer of teachers is entitled to a credit against 21the contributions required under this subsection (e) with 22respect to salaries paid to teachers for the period January 1, 232002 through June 30, 2003, equal to the amount paid by that 24employer under subsection (a-5) of Section 6.6 of the State 25Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971 with respect to salaries 26paid to teachers for that period.  SB1668- 52 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    The additional 1% employee contribution required under 2Section 16-152 by Public Act 90-582 is the responsibility of 3the teacher and not the teacher's employer, unless the 4employer agrees, through collective bargaining or otherwise, 5to make the contribution on behalf of the teacher.6    If an employer is required by a contract in effect on May 71, 1998 between the employer and an employee organization to 8pay, on behalf of all its full-time employees covered by this 9Article, all mandatory employee contributions required under 10this Article, then the employer shall be excused from paying 11the employer contribution required under this subsection (e) 12for the balance of the term of that contract. The employer and 13the employee organization shall jointly certify to the System 14the existence of the contractual requirement, in such form as 15the System may prescribe. This exclusion shall cease upon the 16termination, extension, or renewal of the contract at any time 17after May 1, 1998.18    (f) If the amount of a teacher's salary for any school year 19used to determine final average salary exceeds the member's 20annual full-time salary rate with the same employer for the 21previous school year by more than 6%, the teacher's employer 22shall pay to the System, in addition to all other payments 23required under this Section and in accordance with guidelines 24established by the System, the present value of the increase 25in benefits resulting from the portion of the increase in 26salary that is in excess of 6%. This present value shall be   SB1668- 53 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1computed by the System on the basis of the actuarial 2assumptions and tables used in the most recent actuarial 3valuation of the System that is available at the time of the 4computation. If a teacher's salary for the 2005-2006 school 5year is used to determine final average salary under this 6subsection (f), then the changes made to this subsection (f) 7by Public Act 94-1057 shall apply in calculating whether the 8increase in his or her salary is in excess of 6%. For the 9purposes of this Section, change in employment under Section 1010-21.12 of the School Code on or after June 1, 2005 shall 11constitute a change in employer. The System may require the 12employer to provide any pertinent information or 13documentation. The changes made to this subsection (f) by 14Public Act 94-1111 apply without regard to whether the teacher 15was in service on or after its effective date. 16    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 17required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 18amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 19The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 20amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 21may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 22System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 23specify in detail the grounds of the dispute and, if the 24employer asserts that the calculation is subject to subsection 25(g), (g-5), (g-10), (g-15), (g-20), or (h) of this Section, 26must include an affidavit setting forth and attesting to all   SB1668- 54 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1facts within the employer's knowledge that are pertinent to 2the applicability of that subsection. Upon receiving a timely 3application for recalculation, the System shall review the 4application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount due. 5    The employer contributions required under this subsection 6(f) may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 7receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 8paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 9will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 10actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 11annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 12must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 13of the bill. 14    (f-1) (Blank).15    (g) This subsection (g) applies only to payments made or 16salary increases given on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 171, 2011. The changes made by Public Act 94-1057 shall not 18require the System to refund any payments received before July 1931, 2006 (the effective date of Public Act 94-1057).20    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 21(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to 22teachers under contracts or collective bargaining agreements 23entered into, amended, or renewed before June 1, 2005. 24    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 25(f), the System shall exclude salary increases paid to a 26teacher at a time when the teacher is 10 or more years from   SB1668- 55 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1retirement eligibility under Section 16-132 or 16-133.2. 2    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 3(f), the System shall exclude salary increases resulting from 4overload work, including summer school, when the school 5district has certified to the System, and the System has 6approved the certification, that (i) the overload work is for 7the sole purpose of classroom instruction in excess of the 8standard number of classes for a full-time teacher in a school 9district during a school year and (ii) the salary increases 10are equal to or less than the rate of pay for classroom 11instruction computed on the teacher's current salary and work 12schedule. 13    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 14(f), the System shall exclude a salary increase resulting from 15a promotion (i) for which the employee is required to hold a 16certificate or supervisory endorsement issued by the State 17Teacher Certification Board that is a different certification 18or supervisory endorsement than is required for the teacher's 19previous position and (ii) to a position that has existed and 20been filled by a member for no less than one complete academic 21year and the salary increase from the promotion is an increase 22that results in an amount no greater than the lesser of the 23average salary paid for other similar positions in the 24district requiring the same certification or the amount 25stipulated in the collective bargaining agreement for a 26similar position requiring the same certification.   SB1668- 56 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    When assessing payment for any amount due under subsection 2(f), the System shall exclude any payment to the teacher from 3the State of Illinois or the State Board of Education over 4which the employer does not have discretion, notwithstanding 5that the payment is included in the computation of final 6average salary. 7    (g-5) When assessing payment for any amount due under 8subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 9resulting from overload or stipend work performed in a school 10year subsequent to a school year in which the employer was 11unable to offer or allow to be conducted overload or stipend 12work due to an emergency declaration limiting such activities.13    (g-10) When assessing payment for any amount due under 14subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 15resulting from increased instructional time that exceeded the 16instructional time required during the 2019-2020 school year. 17    (g-15) When assessing payment for any amount due under 18subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 19resulting from teaching summer school on or after May 1, 2021 20and before September 15, 2022. 21    (g-20) When assessing payment for any amount due under 22subsection (f), the System shall exclude salary increases 23necessary to bring a school board in compliance with Public 24Act 101-443 or this amendatory Act of the 103rd General 25Assembly. 26    (h) When assessing payment for any amount due under   SB1668- 57 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1subsection (f), the System shall exclude any salary increase 2described in subsection (g) of this Section given on or after 3July 1, 2011 but before July 1, 2014 under a contract or 4collective bargaining agreement entered into, amended, or 5renewed on or after June 1, 2005 but before July 1, 2011. 6Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, any 7payments made or salary increases given after June 30, 2014 8shall be used in assessing payment for any amount due under 9subsection (f) of this Section. 10    (i) The System shall prepare a report and file copies of 11the report with the Governor and the General Assembly by 12January 1, 2007 that contains all of the following 13information:14        (1) The number of recalculations required by the 15    changes made to this Section by Public Act 94-1057 for 16    each employer.17        (2) The dollar amount by which each employer's 18    contribution to the System was changed due to 19    recalculations required by Public Act 94-1057.20        (3) The total amount the System received from each 21    employer as a result of the changes made to this Section by 22    Public Act 94-4.23        (4) The increase in the required State contribution 24    resulting from the changes made to this Section by Public 25    Act 94-1057. 26    (i-5) For school years beginning on or after July 1, 2017,   SB1668- 58 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1if the amount of a participant's salary for any school year 2exceeds the amount of the salary set for the Governor, the 3participant's employer shall pay to the System, in addition to 4all other payments required under this Section and in 5accordance with guidelines established by the System, an 6amount determined by the System to be equal to the employer 7normal cost, as established by the System and expressed as a 8total percentage of payroll, multiplied by the amount of 9salary in excess of the amount of the salary set for the 10Governor. This amount shall be computed by the System on the 11basis of the actuarial assumptions and tables used in the most 12recent actuarial valuation of the System that is available at 13the time of the computation. The System may require the 14employer to provide any pertinent information or 15documentation.16    Whenever it determines that a payment is or may be 17required under this subsection, the System shall calculate the 18amount of the payment and bill the employer for that amount. 19The bill shall specify the calculations used to determine the 20amount due. If the employer disputes the amount of the bill, it 21may, within 30 days after receipt of the bill, apply to the 22System in writing for a recalculation. The application must 23specify in detail the grounds of the dispute. Upon receiving a 24timely application for recalculation, the System shall review 25the application and, if appropriate, recalculate the amount 26due.   SB1668- 59 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    The employer contributions required under this subsection 2may be paid in the form of a lump sum within 90 days after 3receipt of the bill. If the employer contributions are not 4paid within 90 days after receipt of the bill, then interest 5will be charged at a rate equal to the System's annual 6actuarially assumed rate of return on investment compounded 7annually from the 91st day after receipt of the bill. Payments 8must be concluded within 3 years after the employer's receipt 9of the bill. 10    (j) For purposes of determining the required State 11contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets 12shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 13which shall be calculated as follows:14    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 15assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 16that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 17assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 18gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 19year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 205-year period following that fiscal year. 21    (k) For purposes of determining the required State 22contribution to the system for a particular year, the 23actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 24return equal to the system's actuarially assumed rate of 25return. 26(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-525, eff. 8-20-21;   SB1668- 60 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-515, eff. 28-11-23; 103-588, eff. 6-5-24.) 3    (40 ILCS 5/18-131)  (from Ch. 108 1/2, par. 18-131)4    Sec. 18-131. Financing; employer contributions. 5    (a) The State of Illinois shall make contributions to this 6System by appropriations of the amounts which, together with 7the contributions of participants, net earnings on 8investments, and other income, will meet the costs of 9maintaining and administering this System on a 90% funded 10basis in accordance with actuarial recommendations.11    (b) The Board shall determine the amount of State 12contributions required for each fiscal year on the basis of 13the actuarial tables and other assumptions adopted by the 14Board and the prescribed rate of interest, using the formula 15in subsection (c).16    (c) For State fiscal years 2012 through 2045, except as 17otherwise provided in this Section, the minimum contribution 18to the System to be made by the State for each fiscal year 19shall be an amount determined by the System to be sufficient to 20bring the total assets of the System up to 90% of the total 21actuarial liabilities of the System by the end of State fiscal 22year 2045. In making these determinations, the required State 23contribution shall be calculated each year as a level 24percentage of payroll over the years remaining to and 25including fiscal year 2045 and shall be determined under the   SB1668- 61 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1projected unit credit actuarial cost method.2    If the System determines that the minimum contribution to 3the System is sufficient to bring the total assets of the 4System up to 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of the 5System in the following fiscal year, then the System shall 6determine the actuarially determined contribution rate for the 7following year in accordance with this paragraph. Beginning 8the first State fiscal year after the total assets of the 9System are at least 90% of the total actuarial liabilities of 10the System and each State fiscal year thereafter, the 11contribution to the System shall be calculated based on an 12actuarially determined contribution rate in accordance with 13the following:14        (1) The Board, with the consultation of a competent 15    actuary, shall calculate the actuarially determined 16    contribution rate for each fiscal year.17        (2) The System shall calculate the actuarially 18    determined contribution rate in accordance with the 19    Governmental Accounting Research System and officially 20    adopted actuarial assumptions. The System shall use this 21    valuation to calculate the actuarially determined 22    contribution rate for the next fiscal year.23        (3) No later than January 1 of each year in which this 24    paragraph applies, the System shall report the actuarially 25    determined contribution rate for the following fiscal year 26    to the Governor, the Auditor General, the State Treasurer,   SB1668- 62 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    and the General Assembly.2        (4) After the calculation of the actuarially 3    determined contribution rate under item (2), the General 4    Assembly and the System shall calculate the necessary 5    amount to account for any changes in appropriations 6    necessary to fund the minimum contribution, including 7    changes in amounts for the employer's share of the 8    actuarially determined contribution rate.9        (5) The actuarially determined contribution rate for a 10    fiscal year shall not be less than the amount for the 11    preceding fiscal year if the ratio of the System's total 12    assets to the System's total liabilities is less than 90%.13        (6) In no event shall the actuarially determined 14    contribution rate be less than the normal cost for that 15    fiscal year. 16    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 17increases or decreases the required State contribution and 18first applies in State fiscal year 2018 or thereafter shall be 19implemented in equal annual amounts over a 5-year period 20beginning in the State fiscal year in which the actuarial 21change first applies to the required State contribution.22    A change in an actuarial or investment assumption that 23increases or decreases the required State contribution and 24first applied to the State contribution in fiscal year 2014, 252015, 2016, or 2017 shall be implemented:26        (i) as already applied in State fiscal years before   SB1668- 63 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    2018; and2        (ii) in the portion of the 5-year period beginning in 3    the State fiscal year in which the actuarial change first 4    applied that occurs in State fiscal year 2018 or 5    thereafter, by calculating the change in equal annual 6    amounts over that 5-year period and then implementing it 7    at the resulting annual rate in each of the remaining 8    fiscal years in that 5-year period.9    For State fiscal years 1996 through 2005, the State 10contribution to the System, as a percentage of the applicable 11employee payroll, shall be increased in equal annual 12increments so that by State fiscal year 2011, the State is 13contributing at the rate required under this Section.14    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 15total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2006 16is $29,189,400. 17    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 18total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2007 19is $35,236,800. 20    For each of State fiscal years 2008 through 2009, the 21State contribution to the System, as a percentage of the 22applicable employee payroll, shall be increased in equal 23annual increments from the required State contribution for 24State fiscal year 2007, so that by State fiscal year 2011, the 25State is contributing at the rate otherwise required under 26this Section.   SB1668- 64 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 2total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2010 3is $78,832,000 and shall be made from the proceeds of bonds 4sold in fiscal year 2010 pursuant to Section 7.2 of the General 5Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the pro rata share of bond sale 6expenses determined by the System's share of total bond 7proceeds, (ii) any amounts received from the General Revenue 8Fund in fiscal year 2010, and (iii) any reduction in bond 9proceeds due to the issuance of discounted bonds, if 10applicable. 11    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the 12total required State contribution for State fiscal year 2011 13is the amount recertified by the System on or before April 1, 142011 pursuant to Section 18-140 and shall be made from the 15proceeds of bonds sold in fiscal year 2011 pursuant to Section 167.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, less (i) the pro rata 17share of bond sale expenses determined by the System's share 18of total bond proceeds, (ii) any amounts received from the 19General Revenue Fund in fiscal year 2011, and (iii) any 20reduction in bond proceeds due to the issuance of discounted 21bonds, if applicable. 22    Beginning in State fiscal year 2046, except as otherwise 23provided in this Section, the minimum State contribution for 24each fiscal year shall be the amount needed to maintain the 25total assets of the System at 90% of the total actuarial 26liabilities of the System.  SB1668- 65 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1    Amounts received by the System pursuant to Section 25 of 2the Budget Stabilization Act or Section 8.12 of the State 3Finance Act in any fiscal year do not reduce and do not 4constitute payment of any portion of the minimum State 5contribution required under this Article in that fiscal year. 6Such amounts shall not reduce, and shall not be included in the 7calculation of, the required State contributions under this 8Article in any future year until the System has reached a 9funding ratio of at least 90%. A reference in this Article to 10the "required State contribution" or any substantially similar 11term does not include or apply to any amounts payable to the 12System under Section 25 of the Budget Stabilization Act. 13    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the 14required State contribution for State fiscal year 2005 and for 15fiscal year 2008 and each fiscal year thereafter, as 16calculated under this Section and certified under Section 1718-140, shall not exceed an amount equal to (i) the amount of 18the required State contribution that would have been 19calculated under this Section for that fiscal year if the 20System had not received any payments under subsection (d) of 21Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, minus (ii) the 22portion of the State's total debt service payments for that 23fiscal year on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 24purposes of that Section 7.2, as determined and certified by 25the Comptroller, that is the same as the System's portion of 26the total moneys distributed under subsection (d) of Section   SB1668- 66 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b17.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act. In determining this 2maximum for State fiscal years 2008 through 2010, however, the 3amount referred to in item (i) shall be increased, as a 4percentage of the applicable employee payroll, in equal 5increments calculated from the sum of the required State 6contribution for State fiscal year 2007 plus the applicable 7portion of the State's total debt service payments for fiscal 8year 2007 on the bonds issued in fiscal year 2003 for the 9purposes of Section 7.2 of the General Obligation Bond Act, so 10that, by State fiscal year 2011, the State is contributing at 11the rate otherwise required under this Section.12    (d) For purposes of determining the required State 13contribution to the System, the value of the System's assets 14shall be equal to the actuarial value of the System's assets, 15which shall be calculated as follows:16    As of June 30, 2008, the actuarial value of the System's 17assets shall be equal to the market value of the assets as of 18that date. In determining the actuarial value of the System's 19assets for fiscal years after June 30, 2008, any actuarial 20gains or losses from investment return incurred in a fiscal 21year shall be recognized in equal annual amounts over the 225-year period following that fiscal year. 23    (e) For purposes of determining the required State 24contribution to the system for a particular year, the 25actuarial value of assets shall be assumed to earn a rate of 26return equal to the system's actuarially assumed rate of   SB1668- 67 -LRB104 09615 RPS 19680 b1return. 2(Source: P.A. 100-23, eff. 7-6-17.)
