Requirements. 8    (a) The Board shall develop basic guidelines for the use 9of officer-worn body cameras by law enforcement agencies. The 10guidelines developed by the Board shall be the basis for the 11written policy which must be adopted by each law enforcement 12agency which employs the use of officer-worn body cameras. The 13written policy adopted by the law enforcement agency must 14include, at a minimum, all of the following:15        (1) Cameras must be equipped with pre-event recording, 16    capable of recording at least the 30 seconds prior to   10400SB1796sam001- 2 -LRB104 09386 RTM 24923 a1    camera activation, unless the officer-worn body camera was 2    purchased and acquired by the law enforcement agency prior 3    to July 1, 2015.4        (2) Cameras must be capable of recording for a period 5    of 10 hours or more, unless the officer-worn body camera 6    was purchased and acquired by the law enforcement agency 7    prior to July 1, 2015.8        (3) Cameras must be turned on at all times when the 9    officer is in uniform and is responding to calls for 10    service or engaged in any law enforcement-related 11    encounter or activity that occurs while the officer is on 12    duty.13            (A) If exigent circumstances exist which prevent 14        the camera from being turned on, the camera must be 15        turned on as soon as practicable.16            (B) Officer-worn body cameras may be turned off 17        when the officer is inside of a patrol car which is 18        equipped with a functioning in-car camera; however, 19        the officer must turn on the camera upon exiting the 20        patrol vehicle for law enforcement-related encounters.21            (C) Officer-worn body cameras may be turned off 22        when the officer is inside a correctional facility or 23        courthouse which is equipped with a functioning camera 24        system. 25        (4) Cameras must be turned off when: 26            (A) the victim of a crime requests that the camera   10400SB1796sam001- 3 -LRB104 09386 RTM 24923 a1        be turned off, and unless impractical or impossible, 2        that request is made on the recording;3            (B) a witness of a crime or a community member who 4        wishes to report a crime requests that the camera be 5        turned off, and unless impractical or impossible that 6        request is made on the recording; 7            (C) the officer is interacting with a confidential 8        informant used by the law enforcement agency; or9            (D) an officer of the Department of Revenue enters 10        a Department of Revenue facility or conducts an 11        interview during which return information will be 12        discussed or visible. 13        However, an officer may continue to record or resume 14    recording a victim or a witness, if exigent circumstances 15    exist, or if the officer has reasonable articulable 16    suspicion that a victim or witness, or confidential 17    informant has committed or is in the process of committing 18    a crime.

However, the 24    camera must be turned on when the officer has reason to 25    believe that the person on whose behalf the officer is 26    performing a community caretaking function has committed   10400SB1796sam001- 4 -LRB104 09386 RTM 24923 a1    or is in the process of committing a crime. If exigent 2    circumstances exist which prevent the camera from being 3    turned on, the camera must be turned on as soon as 4    practicable.5        (5) The officer must provide notice of recording to 6    any person if the person has a reasonable expectation of 7    privacy and proof of notice must be evident in the 8    recording. If exigent circumstances exist which prevent 9    the officer from providing notice, notice must be provided 10    as soon as practicable.11        (6) (A) For the purposes of redaction or duplicating 12    recordings, access to camera recordings shall be 13    restricted to only those personnel responsible for those 14    purposes. The recording officer or his or her supervisor 15    may not redact, duplicate, or otherwise alter the 16    recording officer's camera recordings. Except as otherwise 17    provided in this Section, the recording officer and his or 18    her supervisor may access and review recordings prior to 19    completing incident reports or other documentation, 20    provided that the supervisor discloses that fact in the 21    report or documentation.22            (i) A law enforcement officer shall not have 23        access to or review his or her body-worn camera 24        recordings or the body-worn camera recordings of 25        another officer prior to completing incident reports 26        or other documentation when the officer:   10400SB1796sam001- 5 -LRB104 09386 RTM 24923 a1                (a) has been involved in or is a witness to an 2            officer-involved shooting, use of deadly force 3            incident, or use of force incidents resulting in 4            great bodily harm;5                (b) is ordered to write a report in response 6            to or during the investigation of a misconduct 7            complaint against the officer.8            (ii) If the officer subject to subparagraph (i) 9        prepares a report, any report shall be prepared 10        without viewing body-worn camera recordings, and 11        subject to supervisor's approval, officers may file 12        amendatory reports after viewing body-worn camera 13        recordings.

If the flagged 18        recording was used in a criminal, civil, or 19        administrative proceeding, the recording shall not be 20        destroyed except upon a final disposition and order 21        from the court.22            (D) Nothing in this Act prohibits law enforcement 23        agencies from labeling officer-worn body camera video 24        within the recording medium; provided that the 25        labeling does not alter the actual recording of the 26        incident captured on the officer-worn body camera. The   10400SB1796sam001- 8 -LRB104 09386 RTM 24923 a1        labels, titles, and tags shall not be construed as 2        altering the officer-worn body camera video in any 3        way. 4        (8) Following the 90-day storage period, recordings 5    may be retained if a supervisor at the law enforcement 6    agency designates the recording for training purposes. If 7    the recording is designated for training purposes, the 8    recordings may be viewed by officers, in the presence of a 9    supervisor or training instructor, for the purposes of 10    instruction, training, or ensuring compliance with agency 11    policies. 12        (9) Recordings shall not be used to discipline law 13    enforcement officers unless:14            (A) a formal or informal complaint of misconduct 15        has been made;16            (B) a use of force incident has occurred;17            (C) the encounter on the recording could result in 18        a formal investigation under the Uniform Peace 19        Officers' Disciplinary Act; or20            (D) as corroboration of other evidence of 21        misconduct.22        Nothing in this paragraph (9) shall be construed to 23    limit or prohibit a law enforcement officer from being 24    subject to an action that does not amount to discipline.25        (10) The law enforcement agency shall ensure proper 26    care and maintenance of officer-worn body cameras. Upon   10400SB1796sam001- 9 -LRB104 09386 RTM 24923 a1    becoming aware, officers must as soon as practical 2    document and notify the appropriate supervisor of any 3    technical difficulties, failures, or problems with the 4    officer-worn body camera or associated equipment. Upon 5    receiving notice, the appropriate supervisor shall make 6    every reasonable effort to correct and repair any of the 7    officer-worn body camera equipment.8        (11) No officer may hinder or prohibit any person, not 9    a law enforcement officer, from recording a law 10    enforcement officer in the performance of his or her 11    duties in a public place or when the officer has no 12    reasonable expectation of privacy. The law enforcement 13    agency's written policy shall indicate the potential 14    criminal penalties, as well as any departmental 15    discipline, which may result from unlawful confiscation or 16    destruction of the recording medium of a person who is not 17    a law enforcement officer. However, an officer may take 18    reasonable action to maintain safety and control, secure 19    crime scenes and accident sites, protect the integrity and 20    confidentiality of investigations, and protect the public 21    safety and order.22    (b) Recordings made with the use of an officer-worn body 23camera are not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of 24Information Act, except that:25        (1) if the subject of the encounter has a reasonable 26    expectation of privacy, at the time of the recording, any   10400SB1796sam001- 10 -LRB104 09386 RTM 24923 a1    recording which is flagged, due to the filing of a 2    complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of force, arrest or 3    detention, or resulting death or bodily harm, shall be 4    disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information 5    Act if:6            (A) the subject of the encounter captured on the 7        recording is a victim or witness; and8            (B) the law enforcement agency obtains written 9        permission of the subject or the subject's legal 10        representative;11        (2) except as provided in paragraph (1) of this 12    subsection (b), upon request, any recording which is 13    flagged due to the filing of a complaint, discharge of a 14    firearm, use of force, arrest or detention, or resulting 15    death or bodily harm shall be disclosed in accordance with 16    the Freedom of Information Act if the request is made by:17            (A) court order;18            (B) a person involved in the encounter that 19        resulted in the recording being flagged;20            (C) a legal representative of a person involved in 21        the encounter that resulted in the recording being 22        flagged;23            (D) a witness of the encounter that resulted in 24        the recording being flagged;25            (E) a legal representative of a witness of the 26        encounter that resulted in the recording being   10400SB1796sam001- 11 -LRB104 09386 RTM 24923 a1        flagged;2            (F) a representative of news media, as defined in 3        subsection (f) of Section 2 of the Freedom of 4        Information Act; or5            (G) a representative of a non-profit, scientific, 6        or academic organization; and7        (3) upon request, the law enforcement agency shall 8    disclose, in accordance with the Freedom of Information 9    Act, the recording to the subject of the encounter 10    captured on the recording or to the subject's attorney, or 11    the officer or his or her legal representative.12    For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection (b), 13the subject of the encounter does not have a reasonable 14expectation of privacy if the subject was arrested as a result 15of the encounter. For purposes of subparagraph (A) of 16paragraph (1) of this subsection (b), "witness" does not 17include a person who is a victim or who was arrested as a 18result of the encounter. 19    Only recordings or portions of recordings responsive to 20the request shall be available for inspection or reproduction. 21Any recording disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act 22shall be redacted to remove identification of any person that 23appears on the recording and is not the officer, a subject of 24the encounter, or directly involved in the encounter. Nothing 25in this subsection (b) shall require the disclosure of any 26recording or portion of any recording which would be exempt   10400SB1796sam001- 12 -LRB104 09386 RTM 24923 a1from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.2    (c) Nothing in this Section shall limit access to a camera 3recording for the purposes of complying with Supreme Court 4rules or the rules of evidence.5(Source: P.A. 101-652, eff. 7-1-21; 102-28, eff. 6-25-21; 6102-687, eff. 12-17-21; 102-694, eff. 1-7-22; 102-1104, eff. 712-6-22.)".
