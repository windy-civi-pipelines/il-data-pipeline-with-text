Upon 16    becoming aware, officers must as soon as practical 17    document and notify the appropriate supervisor of any 18    technical difficulties, failures, or problems with the 19    officer-worn body camera or associated equipment. Upon 20    receiving notice, the appropriate supervisor shall make 21    every reasonable effort to correct and repair any of the 22    officer-worn body camera equipment.23        (11) No officer may hinder or prohibit any person, not 24    a law enforcement officer, from recording a law 25    enforcement officer in the performance of his or her 26    duties in a public place or when the officer has no   SB1796- 12 -LRB104 09386 RTM 19445 b1    reasonable expectation of privacy. The law enforcement 2    agency's written policy shall indicate the potential 3    criminal penalties, as well as any departmental 4    discipline, which may result from unlawful confiscation or 5    destruction of the recording medium of a person who is not 6    a law enforcement officer. However, an officer may take 7    reasonable action to maintain safety and control, secure 8    crime scenes and accident sites, protect the integrity and 9    confidentiality of investigations, and protect the public 10    safety and order.11    (b) Recordings made with the use of an officer-worn body 12camera are not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of 13Information Act, except that, upon request, the law 14enforcement agency shall disclose, in accordance with the 15Freedom of Information Act, the recording to (i) the subject 16of the encounter captured on the recording, (ii) the legal 17representative of the subject of the encounter captured on the 18recording, (iii) the officer who wore the camera that made the 19recording, (iv) the legal representative of the officer who 20wore the camera that made the recording, (v) a person who has 21written permission from the subject of the encounter to 22receive the recording, or (vi) a person who has written 23permission from the officer who wore the camera that made the 24recording to receive the recording. :25        (1) if the subject of the encounter has a reasonable 26    expectation of privacy, at the time of the recording, any   SB1796- 13 -LRB104 09386 RTM 19445 b1    recording which is flagged, due to the filing of a 2    complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of force, arrest or 3    detention, or resulting death or bodily harm, shall be 4    disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information 5    Act if:6            (A) the subject of the encounter captured on the 7        recording is a victim or witness; and8            (B) the law enforcement agency obtains written 9        permission of the subject or the subject's legal 10        representative;11        (2) except as provided in paragraph (1) of this 12    subsection (b), any recording which is flagged due to the 13    filing of a complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of 14    force, arrest or detention, or resulting death or bodily 15    harm shall be disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of 16    Information Act; and17        (3) upon request, the law enforcement agency shall 18    disclose, in accordance with the Freedom of Information 19    Act, the recording to the subject of the encounter 20    captured on the recording or to the subject's attorney, or 21    the officer or his or her legal representative.22    For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection (b), 23the subject of the encounter does not have a reasonable 24expectation of privacy if the subject was arrested as a result 25of the encounter.

The 11written policy adopted by the law enforcement agency must 12include, at a minimum, all of the following:13        (1) Cameras must be equipped with pre-event recording, 14    capable of recording at least the 30 seconds prior to 15    camera activation, unless the officer-worn body camera was 16    purchased and acquired by the law enforcement agency prior 17    to July 1, 2015.18        (2) Cameras must be capable of recording for a period 19    of 10 hours or more, unless the officer-worn body camera 20    was purchased and acquired by the law enforcement agency 21    prior to July 1, 2015.22        (3) Cameras must be turned on at all times when the 23    officer is in uniform and is responding to calls for 24    service or engaged in any law enforcement-related 25    encounter or activity that occurs while the officer is on   SB1796- 5 -LRB104 09386 RTM 19445 b1    duty.2            (A) If exigent circumstances exist which prevent 3        the camera from being turned on, the camera must be 4        turned on as soon as practicable.5            (B) Officer-worn body cameras may be turned off 6        when the officer is inside of a patrol car which is 7        equipped with a functioning in-car camera; however, 8        the officer must turn on the camera upon exiting the 9        patrol vehicle for law enforcement-related encounters.10            (C) Officer-worn body cameras may be turned off 11        when the officer is inside a correctional facility or 12        courthouse which is equipped with a functioning camera 13        system. 14        (4) Cameras must be turned off when: 15            (A) the victim of a crime requests that the camera 16        be turned off, and unless impractical or impossible, 17        that request is made on the recording;18            (B) a witness of a crime or a community member who 19        wishes to report a crime requests that the camera be 20        turned off, and unless impractical or impossible that 21        request is made on the recording; 22            (C) the officer is interacting with a confidential 23        informant used by the law enforcement agency; or24            (D) an officer of the Department of Revenue enters 25        a Department of Revenue facility or conducts an 26        interview during which return information will be   SB1796- 6 -LRB104 09386 RTM 19445 b1        discussed or visible. 2        However, an officer may continue to record or resume 3    recording a victim or a witness, if exigent circumstances 4    exist, or if the officer has reasonable articulable 5    suspicion that a victim or witness, or confidential 6    informant has committed or is in the process of committing 7    a crime. Under these circumstances, and unless impractical 8    or impossible, the officer must indicate on the recording 9    the reason for continuing to record despite the request of 10    the victim or witness.11        (4.5) Cameras may be turned off when the officer is 12    engaged in community caretaking functions. However, the 13    camera must be turned on when the officer has reason to 14    believe that the person on whose behalf the officer is 15    performing a community caretaking function has committed 16    or is in the process of committing a crime. If exigent 17    circumstances exist which prevent the camera from being 18    turned on, the camera must be turned on as soon as 19    practicable.20        (5) The officer must provide notice of recording to 21    any person if the person has a reasonable expectation of 22    privacy and proof of notice must be evident in the 23    recording. If exigent circumstances exist which prevent 24    the officer from providing notice, notice must be provided 25    as soon as practicable.26        (6) (A) For the purposes of redaction or duplicating   SB1796- 7 -LRB104 09386 RTM 19445 b1    recordings, access to camera recordings shall be 2    restricted to only those personnel responsible for those 3    purposes.

Supplemental reports under this provision 3        shall also contain documentation regarding access to 4        the video footage. 5            (B) The recording officer's assigned field 6        training officer may access and review recordings for 7        training purposes. Any detective or investigator 8        directly involved in the investigation of a matter may 9        access and review recordings which pertain to that 10        investigation but may not have access to delete or 11        alter such recordings. 12        (7) Recordings made on officer-worn cameras must be 13    retained by the law enforcement agency or by the camera 14    vendor used by the agency, on a recording medium for a 15    period of no less than 90 days.16            (A) Under no circumstances shall any recording, 17        except for a non-law enforcement related activity or 18        encounter, made with an officer-worn body camera be 19        altered, erased, or destroyed prior to the expiration 20        of the 90-day storage period. In the event any 21        recording made with an officer-worn body camera is 22        altered, erased, or destroyed prior to the expiration 23        of the 90-day storage period, the law enforcement 24        agency shall maintain, for a period of one year, a 25        written record including (i) the name of the 26        individual who made such alteration, erasure, or   SB1796- 9 -LRB104 09386 RTM 19445 b1        destruction, and (ii) the reason for any such 2        alteration, erasure, or destruction. 3            (B) Following the 90-day storage period, any and 4        all recordings made with an officer-worn body camera 5        may must be destroyed, unless any encounter captured 6        on the recording has been flagged. An encounter is 7        deemed to be flagged when: 8                (i) a formal or informal complaint has been 9            filed;10                (ii) the officer discharged his or her firearm 11            or used force during the encounter; 12                (iii) death or great bodily harm occurred to 13            any person in the recording; 14                (iv) the encounter resulted in a detention or 15            an arrest, excluding traffic stops which resulted 16            in only a minor traffic offense or business 17            offense;18                (v) the officer is the subject of an internal 19            investigation or otherwise being investigated for 20            possible misconduct; 21                (vi) the supervisor of the officer, 22            prosecutor, defendant, or court determines that 23            the encounter has evidentiary value in a criminal 24            prosecution; or25                (vii) the recording officer requests that the 26            video be flagged for official purposes related to   SB1796- 10 -LRB104 09386 RTM 19445 b1            his or her official duties or believes it may have 2            evidentiary value in a criminal prosecution.3            (C) Under no circumstances shall any recording 4        made with an officer-worn body camera relating to a 5        flagged encounter be altered or destroyed prior to 2 6        years after the recording was flagged. If the flagged 7        recording was used in a criminal, civil, or 8        administrative proceeding, the recording shall not be 9        destroyed except upon a final disposition and order 10        from the court.11            (D) Nothing in this Act prohibits law enforcement 12        agencies from labeling officer-worn body camera video 13        within the recording medium; provided that the 14        labeling does not alter the actual recording of the 15        incident captured on the officer-worn body camera. The 16        labels, titles, and tags shall not be construed as 17        altering the officer-worn body camera video in any 18        way. 19        (8) Following the 90-day storage period, recordings 20    may be retained if a supervisor at the law enforcement 21    agency designates the recording for training purposes. If 22    the recording is designated for training purposes, the 23    recordings may be viewed by officers, in the presence of a 24    supervisor or training instructor, for the purposes of 25    instruction, training, or ensuring compliance with agency 26    policies.   SB1796- 11 -LRB104 09386 RTM 19445 b1        (9) Recordings shall not be used to discipline law 2    enforcement officers unless:3            (A) a formal or informal complaint of misconduct 4        has been made;5            (B) a use of force incident has occurred;6            (C) the encounter on the recording could result in 7        a formal investigation under the Uniform Peace 8        Officers' Disciplinary Act; or9            (D) as corroboration of other evidence of 10        misconduct.11        Nothing in this paragraph (9) shall be construed to 12    limit or prohibit a law enforcement officer from being 13    subject to an action that does not amount to discipline.14        (10) The law enforcement agency shall ensure proper 15    care and maintenance of officer-worn body cameras. Upon 16    becoming aware, officers must as soon as practical 17    document and notify the appropriate supervisor of any 18    technical difficulties, failures, or problems with the 19    officer-worn body camera or associated equipment. Upon 20    receiving notice, the appropriate supervisor shall make 21    every reasonable effort to correct and repair any of the 22    officer-worn body camera equipment.23        (11) No officer may hinder or prohibit any person, not 24    a law enforcement officer, from recording a law 25    enforcement officer in the performance of his or her 26    duties in a public place or when the officer has no   SB1796- 12 -LRB104 09386 RTM 19445 b1    reasonable expectation of privacy. The law enforcement 2    agency's written policy shall indicate the potential 3    criminal penalties, as well as any departmental 4    discipline, which may result from unlawful confiscation or 5    destruction of the recording medium of a person who is not 6    a law enforcement officer. However, an officer may take 7    reasonable action to maintain safety and control, secure 8    crime scenes and accident sites, protect the integrity and 9    confidentiality of investigations, and protect the public 10    safety and order.11    (b) Recordings made with the use of an officer-worn body 12camera are not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of 13Information Act, except that, upon request, the law 14enforcement agency shall disclose, in accordance with the 15Freedom of Information Act, the recording to (i) the subject 16of the encounter captured on the recording, (ii) the legal 17representative of the subject of the encounter captured on the 18recording, (iii) the officer who wore the camera that made the 19recording, (iv) the legal representative of the officer who 20wore the camera that made the recording, (v) a person who has 21written permission from the subject of the encounter to 22receive the recording, or (vi) a person who has written 23permission from the officer who wore the camera that made the 24recording to receive the recording. :25        (1) if the subject of the encounter has a reasonable 26    expectation of privacy, at the time of the recording, any   SB1796- 13 -LRB104 09386 RTM 19445 b1    recording which is flagged, due to the filing of a 2    complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of force, arrest or 3    detention, or resulting death or bodily harm, shall be 4    disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information 5    Act if:6            (A) the subject of the encounter captured on the 7        recording is a victim or witness; and8            (B) the law enforcement agency obtains written 9        permission of the subject or the subject's legal 10        representative;11        (2) except as provided in paragraph (1) of this 12    subsection (b), any recording which is flagged due to the 13    filing of a complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of 14    force, arrest or detention, or resulting death or bodily 15    harm shall be disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of 16    Information Act; and17        (3) upon request, the law enforcement agency shall 18    disclose, in accordance with the Freedom of Information 19    Act, the recording to the subject of the encounter 20    captured on the recording or to the subject's attorney, or 21    the officer or his or her legal representative.22    For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection (b), 23the subject of the encounter does not have a reasonable 24expectation of privacy if the subject was arrested as a result 25of the encounter. For purposes of subparagraph (A) of 26paragraph (1) of this subsection (b), "witness" does not   SB1796- 14 -LRB104 09386 RTM 19445 b1include a person who is a victim or who was arrested as a 2result of the encounter. 3    Only recordings or portions of recordings responsive to 4the request shall be available for inspection or reproduction. 5Any recording disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act 6shall be redacted to remove identification of any person that 7appears on the recording and is not the officer, a subject of 8the encounter, or directly involved in the encounter.
