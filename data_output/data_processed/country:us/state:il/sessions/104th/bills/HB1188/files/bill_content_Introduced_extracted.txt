If the amount of the credit exceeds the 14total amount due under this Article with respect to amounts 15withheld during the first reporting period to occur after the 16date on which a tax credit certificate is issued, the excess 17may be carried forward and applied against the taxpayer's 18liability under this Section for reporting periods that occur 19in the 5 succeeding calendar years.
