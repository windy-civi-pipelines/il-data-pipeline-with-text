The State Property Control Act is amended by   10400SB1343ham001- 8 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1changing Section 7.1 as follows: 2    (30 ILCS 605/7.1)  (from Ch. 127, par. 133b10.1)3    Sec. 7.1. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, all 4surplus real property held by the State of Illinois shall be 5disposed of by the administrator as provided in this Section. 6"Surplus real property," as used in this Section, means any 7real property to which the State holds fee simple title or 8lesser interest, and is vacant and determined by the head of 9the owning agency to no longer be required for the State 10agency's needs and responsibilities and has no foreseeable use 11by the owning agency. Title to the surplus real property may 12remain with the owning agency throughout the disposition 13process if approved by the Administrator; however, the 14Administrator and the Department of Central Management 15Services shall have sole responsibility and authority for 16disposing of the property as set out in this Section.17    (b) All responsible officers shall submit an Annual Real 18Property Utilization Report to the Administrator, or annual 19update of such report, on forms required by the Administrator, 20by August July 31 of each year. The Administrator may require 21such documentation as he deems reasonably necessary in 22connection with this Report, and shall require that such 23Report include the following information:24        (1) A legal description of all real property owned by 25    the State under the control of the responsible officer.  10400SB1343ham001- 9 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1        (2) A description of the use of the real property 2    listed under (1).3        (3) A list of any improvements made to such real 4    property during the previous year.5        (4) The dates on which the State first acquired its 6    interest in such real property, and the purchase price and 7    source of the funds used to acquire the property.8        (5) Plans for the future use of currently unused real 9    property.10        (6) A declaration of any surplus real property. On or 11    before October 31 of each year the Administrator shall 12    furnish copies of each responsible officer's report along 13    with a list of surplus property indexed by legislative 14    district to the General Assembly.15    This report shall be filed with the Speaker, the Minority 16Leader and the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the 17President, the Minority Leader and the Secretary of the Senate 18and shall be duplicated and made available to the members of 19the General Assembly for evaluation by such members for 20possible liquidation of unused public property at public sale.21    (c) Following receipt of the Annual Real Property 22Utilization Report required under paragraph (b), the 23Administrator shall notify all State agencies by October 31 of 24all declared surplus real property.25    (d) Any surplus real property shall be disposed of by the 26Administrator. No appraisal is required if during his initial   10400SB1343ham001- 10 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1survey of surplus real property the Administrator determines 2such property has a fair market value of less than $5,000. If 3the value of such property is determined by the Administrator 4in his initial survey to be $5,000 or more, then the 5Administrator shall obtain 2 appraisals of such real property, 6which shall include known liabilities, including, but not 7limited to, environmental costs. The average of these 2 8appraisals shall represent the fair market value of the 9surplus real property. 10    No surplus real property may be conveyed by the 11Administrator for less than the fair market value, unless the 12Administrator makes a written determination that it is in the 13best interests of the State to establish a different value. 14That written determination shall be published in the Illinois 15Procurement Bulletin. Such written determination, along with 16an affidavit setting forth the conditions and circumstances 17that make the use of a different value in the best interests of 18the State, shall also be filed with the Executive Ethics 19Commission. The Executive Ethics Commission shall have 30 days 20to review the written determination. The Executive Ethics 21Commission may order an additional 30 days to review the 22written determination. The Administrator shall provide the 23Executive Ethics Commission with any information requested by 24the Executive Ethics Commission related to the Administrator's 25determination of the value of the surplus real property. If 26the Executive Ethics Commission objects in writing to the   10400SB1343ham001- 11 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1value determined by the Administrator, then the Administrator 2shall not convey the surplus real property for less than 3either the fair market value as determined by the average of 4appraisals or an amount agreed upon by the Executive Ethics 5Commission and the Administrator. Circumstances in which it is 6in the best interests of the State to establish a different 7value may include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) 8an auction did not yield any bids at the established fair 9market value; (ii) a unit of local government is interested in 10acquiring the surplus real property; or (iii) the costs to the 11State of maintaining such surplus real property are 12sufficiently high that it would be reasonable to a prudent 13person to sell such surplus real property for less than the 14fair market value established by the average of the 15appraisals. In no event shall the Administrator sell surplus 16real property for less than 75% of fair market value and before 17such property has been offered to an interested unit of local 18government or made available at public auction. 19    Prior to offering the surplus real property for sale to 20the public the Administrator shall give notice in writing of 21the existence of the surplus real property to each State 22agency and to the governing bodies of the county and of all 23cities, villages and incorporated towns in the county in which 24such real property is located. Any such State agency or 25governing body may notify the Administrator of its interest in 26acquiring the surplus real property within a notice period set   10400SB1343ham001- 12 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1by the Administrator of at least 30 days. If any State agency 2notifies the Administrator of its interest in acquiring the 3surplus property, the Administrator may deny any such requests 4by such agency if the Administrator determines that it is more 5advantageous to the State to dispose of the surplus real 6property to a governing body or the public. If a governing body 7notifies the Administrator of its interest in acquiring the 8property, then the Administrator shall wait a minimum of 30 9additional days during which the Administrator may engage in 10negotiations with such governing body for the sale of the 11surplus real property. After the notice period set by the 12Administrator of at least 30 days has passed, the 13Administrator may sell the surplus real property by public 14auction, which may include an electronic auction or the use of 15sealed bids, following notice of such sale by publication on 3 16separate days not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to 17the sale in the State newspaper and in a newspaper having 18general circulation in the county in which the surplus real 19property is located. The Administrator shall post "For Sale" 20signs of a conspicuous nature on such surplus real property 21offered for sale to the public. If no acceptable offers for the 22surplus real property are received, the Administrator may have 23new appraisals of such property made. The Administrator shall 24have all power necessary to convey surplus real property under 25this Section. All moneys received for the sale of surplus real 26property shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund,   10400SB1343ham001- 13 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1except that: 2        (1) Where moneys expended for the acquisition of such 3    real property were from a special fund which is still a 4    special fund in the State treasury, this special fund 5    shall be reimbursed in the amount of the original 6    expenditure and any amount in excess thereof shall be 7    deposited in the General Revenue Fund.8        (2) Whenever a State mental health facility operated 9    by the Department of Human Services is closed and the real 10    estate on which the facility is located is sold by the 11    State, the net proceeds of the sale of the real estate 12    shall be deposited into the Community Mental Health 13    Medicaid Trust Fund.14        (3) Whenever a State developmental disabilities 15    facility operated by the Department of Human Services is 16    closed and the real estate on which the facility is 17    located is sold by the State, the net proceeds of the sale 18    of the real estate shall be deposited into the Community 19    Developmental Disability Services Medicaid Trust Fund. 20    The Administrator shall have authority to order such 21surveys, abstracts of title, or commitments for title 22insurance as may, in his reasonable discretion, be deemed 23necessary to demonstrate to prospective purchasers or bidders 24good and marketable title in any property offered for sale 25pursuant to this Section. Unless otherwise specifically 26authorized by the General Assembly, all conveyances of   10400SB1343ham001- 14 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1property made by the Administrator shall be by quit claim 2deed.3    (e) The Administrator shall submit an annual report on or 4before February 1 to the Governor and the General Assembly 5containing a detailed statement of surplus real property 6either transferred or conveyed under this Section.7(Source: P.A. 102-280, eff. 8-6-21.)".

The State Property Control Act is amended by   10400SB1343ham001- 8 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1changing Section 7.1 as follows: 2    (30 ILCS 605/7.1)  (from Ch. 127, par. 133b10.1)3    Sec. 7.1. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, all 4surplus real property held by the State of Illinois shall be 5disposed of by the administrator as provided in this Section. 6"Surplus real property," as used in this Section, means any 7real property to which the State holds fee simple title or 8lesser interest, and is vacant and determined by the head of 9the owning agency to no longer be required for the State 10agency's needs and responsibilities and has no foreseeable use 11by the owning agency. Title to the surplus real property may 12remain with the owning agency throughout the disposition 13process if approved by the Administrator; however, the 14Administrator and the Department of Central Management 15Services shall have sole responsibility and authority for 16disposing of the property as set out in this Section.17    (b) All responsible officers shall submit an Annual Real 18Property Utilization Report to the Administrator, or annual 19update of such report, on forms required by the Administrator, 20by August July 31 of each year. The Administrator may require 21such documentation as he deems reasonably necessary in 22connection with this Report, and shall require that such 23Report include the following information:24        (1) A legal description of all real property owned by 25    the State under the control of the responsible officer.  10400SB1343ham001- 9 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1        (2) A description of the use of the real property 2    listed under (1).3        (3) A list of any improvements made to such real 4    property during the previous year.5        (4) The dates on which the State first acquired its 6    interest in such real property, and the purchase price and 7    source of the funds used to acquire the property.8        (5) Plans for the future use of currently unused real 9    property.10        (6) A declaration of any surplus real property. On or 11    before October 31 of each year the Administrator shall 12    furnish copies of each responsible officer's report along 13    with a list of surplus property indexed by legislative 14    district to the General Assembly.15    This report shall be filed with the Speaker, the Minority 16Leader and the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the 17President, the Minority Leader and the Secretary of the Senate 18and shall be duplicated and made available to the members of 19the General Assembly for evaluation by such members for 20possible liquidation of unused public property at public sale.21    (c) Following receipt of the Annual Real Property 22Utilization Report required under paragraph (b), the 23Administrator shall notify all State agencies by October 31 of 24all declared surplus real property.25    (d) Any surplus real property shall be disposed of by the 26Administrator. No appraisal is required if during his initial   10400SB1343ham001- 10 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1survey of surplus real property the Administrator determines 2such property has a fair market value of less than $5,000. If 3the value of such property is determined by the Administrator 4in his initial survey to be $5,000 or more, then the 5Administrator shall obtain 2 appraisals of such real property, 6which shall include known liabilities, including, but not 7limited to, environmental costs. The average of these 2 8appraisals shall represent the fair market value of the 9surplus real property. 10    No surplus real property may be conveyed by the 11Administrator for less than the fair market value, unless the 12Administrator makes a written determination that it is in the 13best interests of the State to establish a different value. 14That written determination shall be published in the Illinois 15Procurement Bulletin. Such written determination, along with 16an affidavit setting forth the conditions and circumstances 17that make the use of a different value in the best interests of 18the State, shall also be filed with the Executive Ethics 19Commission. The Executive Ethics Commission shall have 30 days 20to review the written determination. The Executive Ethics 21Commission may order an additional 30 days to review the 22written determination. The Administrator shall provide the 23Executive Ethics Commission with any information requested by 24the Executive Ethics Commission related to the Administrator's 25determination of the value of the surplus real property. If 26the Executive Ethics Commission objects in writing to the   10400SB1343ham001- 11 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1value determined by the Administrator, then the Administrator 2shall not convey the surplus real property for less than 3either the fair market value as determined by the average of 4appraisals or an amount agreed upon by the Executive Ethics 5Commission and the Administrator. Circumstances in which it is 6in the best interests of the State to establish a different 7value may include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) 8an auction did not yield any bids at the established fair 9market value; (ii) a unit of local government is interested in 10acquiring the surplus real property; or (iii) the costs to the 11State of maintaining such surplus real property are 12sufficiently high that it would be reasonable to a prudent 13person to sell such surplus real property for less than the 14fair market value established by the average of the 15appraisals. In no event shall the Administrator sell surplus 16real property for less than 75% of fair market value and before 17such property has been offered to an interested unit of local 18government or made available at public auction. 19    Prior to offering the surplus real property for sale to 20the public the Administrator shall give notice in writing of 21the existence of the surplus real property to each State 22agency and to the governing bodies of the county and of all 23cities, villages and incorporated towns in the county in which 24such real property is located. Any such State agency or 25governing body may notify the Administrator of its interest in 26acquiring the surplus real property within a notice period set   10400SB1343ham001- 12 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1by the Administrator of at least 30 days. If any State agency 2notifies the Administrator of its interest in acquiring the 3surplus property, the Administrator may deny any such requests 4by such agency if the Administrator determines that it is more 5advantageous to the State to dispose of the surplus real 6property to a governing body or the public. If a governing body 7notifies the Administrator of its interest in acquiring the 8property, then the Administrator shall wait a minimum of 30 9additional days during which the Administrator may engage in 10negotiations with such governing body for the sale of the 11surplus real property. After the notice period set by the 12Administrator of at least 30 days has passed, the 13Administrator may sell the surplus real property by public 14auction, which may include an electronic auction or the use of 15sealed bids, following notice of such sale by publication on 3 16separate days not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to 17the sale in the State newspaper and in a newspaper having 18general circulation in the county in which the surplus real 19property is located. The Administrator shall post "For Sale" 20signs of a conspicuous nature on such surplus real property 21offered for sale to the public. If no acceptable offers for the 22surplus real property are received, the Administrator may have 23new appraisals of such property made. The Administrator shall 24have all power necessary to convey surplus real property under 25this Section. All moneys received for the sale of surplus real 26property shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund,   10400SB1343ham001- 13 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1except that: 2        (1) Where moneys expended for the acquisition of such 3    real property were from a special fund which is still a 4    special fund in the State treasury, this special fund 5    shall be reimbursed in the amount of the original 6    expenditure and any amount in excess thereof shall be 7    deposited in the General Revenue Fund.8        (2) Whenever a State mental health facility operated 9    by the Department of Human Services is closed and the real 10    estate on which the facility is located is sold by the 11    State, the net proceeds of the sale of the real estate 12    shall be deposited into the Community Mental Health 13    Medicaid Trust Fund.14        (3) Whenever a State developmental disabilities 15    facility operated by the Department of Human Services is 16    closed and the real estate on which the facility is 17    located is sold by the State, the net proceeds of the sale 18    of the real estate shall be deposited into the Community 19    Developmental Disability Services Medicaid Trust Fund. 20    The Administrator shall have authority to order such 21surveys, abstracts of title, or commitments for title 22insurance as may, in his reasonable discretion, be deemed 23necessary to demonstrate to prospective purchasers or bidders 24good and marketable title in any property offered for sale 25pursuant to this Section. Unless otherwise specifically 26authorized by the General Assembly, all conveyances of   10400SB1343ham001- 14 -LRB104 06300 BDA 25530 a1property made by the Administrator shall be by quit claim 2deed.3    (e) The Administrator shall submit an annual report on or 4before February 1 to the Governor and the General Assembly 5containing a detailed statement of surplus real property 6either transferred or conveyed under this Section.7(Source: P.A. 102-280, eff. 8-6-21.)".
