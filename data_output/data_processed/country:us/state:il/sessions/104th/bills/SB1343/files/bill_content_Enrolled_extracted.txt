The State Property Control Act is amended by 19changing Section 7.1 as follows: 20    (30 ILCS 605/7.1)  (from Ch. 127, par. 133b10.1)21    Sec. 7.1. (a) Except as otherwise provided by law, all 22surplus real property held by the State of Illinois shall be 23disposed of by the administrator as provided in this Section. 24"Surplus real property," as used in this Section, means any   SB1343 Enrolled- 8 -LRB104 06300 BDA 16335 b1real property to which the State holds fee simple title or 2lesser interest, and is vacant and determined by the head of 3the owning agency to no longer be required for the State 4agency's needs and responsibilities and has no foreseeable use 5by the owning agency. Title to the surplus real property may 6remain with the owning agency throughout the disposition 7process if approved by the Administrator; however, the 8Administrator and the Department of Central Management 9Services shall have sole responsibility and authority for 10disposing of the property as set out in this Section.11    (b) All responsible officers shall submit an Annual Real 12Property Utilization Report to the Administrator, or annual 13update of such report, on forms required by the Administrator, 14by August July 31 of each year. The Administrator may require 15such documentation as he deems reasonably necessary in 16connection with this Report, and shall require that such 17Report include the following information:18        (1) A legal description of all real property owned by 19    the State under the control of the responsible officer.20        (2) A description of the use of the real property 21    listed under (1).22        (3) A list of any improvements made to such real 23    property during the previous year.24        (4) The dates on which the State first acquired its 25    interest in such real property, and the purchase price and 26    source of the funds used to acquire the property.  SB1343 Enrolled- 9 -LRB104 06300 BDA 16335 b1        (5) Plans for the future use of currently unused real 2    property.3        (6) A declaration of any surplus real property. On or 4    before October 31 of each year the Administrator shall 5    furnish copies of each responsible officer's report along 6    with a list of surplus property indexed by legislative 7    district to the General Assembly.8    This report shall be filed with the Speaker, the Minority 9Leader and the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the 10President, the Minority Leader and the Secretary of the Senate 11and shall be duplicated and made available to the members of 12the General Assembly for evaluation by such members for 13possible liquidation of unused public property at public sale.14    (c) Following receipt of the Annual Real Property 15Utilization Report required under paragraph (b), the 16Administrator shall notify all State agencies by October 31 of 17all declared surplus real property.18    (d) Any surplus real property shall be disposed of by the 19Administrator. No appraisal is required if during his initial 20survey of surplus real property the Administrator determines 21such property has a fair market value of less than $5,000. If 22the value of such property is determined by the Administrator 23in his initial survey to be $5,000 or more, then the 24Administrator shall obtain 2 appraisals of such real property, 25which shall include known liabilities, including, but not 26limited to, environmental costs. The average of these 2   SB1343 Enrolled- 10 -LRB104 06300 BDA 16335 b1appraisals shall represent the fair market value of the 2surplus real property. 3    No surplus real property may be conveyed by the 4Administrator for less than the fair market value, unless the 5Administrator makes a written determination that it is in the 6best interests of the State to establish a different value. 7That written determination shall be published in the Illinois 8Procurement Bulletin. Such written determination, along with 9an affidavit setting forth the conditions and circumstances 10that make the use of a different value in the best interests of 11the State, shall also be filed with the Executive Ethics 12Commission. The Executive Ethics Commission shall have 30 days 13to review the written determination. The Executive Ethics 14Commission may order an additional 30 days to review the 15written determination. The Administrator shall provide the 16Executive Ethics Commission with any information requested by 17the Executive Ethics Commission related to the Administrator's 18determination of the value of the surplus real property. If 19the Executive Ethics Commission objects in writing to the 20value determined by the Administrator, then the Administrator 21shall not convey the surplus real property for less than 22either the fair market value as determined by the average of 23appraisals or an amount agreed upon by the Executive Ethics 24Commission and the Administrator. Circumstances in which it is 25in the best interests of the State to establish a different 26value may include, but are not limited to, the following: (i)   SB1343 Enrolled- 11 -LRB104 06300 BDA 16335 b1an auction did not yield any bids at the established fair 2market value; (ii) a unit of local government is interested in 3acquiring the surplus real property; or (iii) the costs to the 4State of maintaining such surplus real property are 5sufficiently high that it would be reasonable to a prudent 6person to sell such surplus real property for less than the 7fair market value established by the average of the 8appraisals. In no event shall the Administrator sell surplus 9real property for less than 75% of fair market value and before 10such property has been offered to an interested unit of local 11government or made available at public auction. 12    Prior to offering the surplus real property for sale to 13the public the Administrator shall give notice in writing of 14the existence of the surplus real property to each State 15agency and to the governing bodies of the county and of all 16cities, villages and incorporated towns in the county in which 17such real property is located. Any such State agency or 18governing body may notify the Administrator of its interest in 19acquiring the surplus real property within a notice period set 20by the Administrator of at least 30 days. If any State agency 21notifies the Administrator of its interest in acquiring the 22surplus property, the Administrator may deny any such requests 23by such agency if the Administrator determines that it is more 24advantageous to the State to dispose of the surplus real 25property to a governing body or the public. If a governing body 26notifies the Administrator of its interest in acquiring the   SB1343 Enrolled- 12 -LRB104 06300 BDA 16335 b1property, then the Administrator shall wait a minimum of 30 2additional days during which the Administrator may engage in 3negotiations with such governing body for the sale of the 4surplus real property. After the notice period set by the 5Administrator of at least 30 days has passed, the 6Administrator may sell the surplus real property by public 7auction, which may include an electronic auction or the use of 8sealed bids, following notice of such sale by publication on 3 9separate days not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to 10the sale in the State newspaper and in a newspaper having 11general circulation in the county in which the surplus real 12property is located. The Administrator shall post "For Sale" 13signs of a conspicuous nature on such surplus real property 14offered for sale to the public. If no acceptable offers for the 15surplus real property are received, the Administrator may have 16new appraisals of such property made. The Administrator shall 17have all power necessary to convey surplus real property under 18this Section. All moneys received for the sale of surplus real 19property shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund, 20except that: 21        (1) Where moneys expended for the acquisition of such 22    real property were from a special fund which is still a 23    special fund in the State treasury, this special fund 24    shall be reimbursed in the amount of the original 25    expenditure and any amount in excess thereof shall be 26    deposited in the General Revenue Fund.  SB1343 Enrolled- 13 -LRB104 06300 BDA 16335 b1        (2) Whenever a State mental health facility operated 2    by the Department of Human Services is closed and the real 3    estate on which the facility is located is sold by the 4    State, the net proceeds of the sale of the real estate 5    shall be deposited into the Community Mental Health 6    Medicaid Trust Fund.7        (3) Whenever a State developmental disabilities 8    facility operated by the Department of Human Services is 9    closed and the real estate on which the facility is 10    located is sold by the State, the net proceeds of the sale 11    of the real estate shall be deposited into the Community 12    Developmental Disability Services Medicaid Trust Fund. 13    The Administrator shall have authority to order such 14surveys, abstracts of title, or commitments for title 15insurance as may, in his reasonable discretion, be deemed 16necessary to demonstrate to prospective purchasers or bidders 17good and marketable title in any property offered for sale 18pursuant to this Section. Unless otherwise specifically 19authorized by the General Assembly, all conveyances of 20property made by the Administrator shall be by quit claim 21deed.22    (e) The Administrator shall submit an annual report on or 23before February 1 to the Governor and the General Assembly 24containing a detailed statement of surplus real property 25either transferred or conveyed under this Section.26(Source: P.A. 102-280, eff. 8-6-21.)

Title to the surplus real property may 6remain with the owning agency throughout the disposition 7process if approved by the Administrator; however, the 8Administrator and the Department of Central Management 9Services shall have sole responsibility and authority for 10disposing of the property as set out in this Section.11    (b) All responsible officers shall submit an Annual Real 12Property Utilization Report to the Administrator, or annual 13update of such report, on forms required by the Administrator, 14by August July 31 of each year. The Administrator may require 15such documentation as he deems reasonably necessary in 16connection with this Report, and shall require that such 17Report include the following information:18        (1) A legal description of all real property owned by 19    the State under the control of the responsible officer.20        (2) A description of the use of the real property 21    listed under (1).22        (3) A list of any improvements made to such real 23    property during the previous year.24        (4) The dates on which the State first acquired its 25    interest in such real property, and the purchase price and 26    source of the funds used to acquire the property.  SB1343 Enrolled- 9 -LRB104 06300 BDA 16335 b1        (5) Plans for the future use of currently unused real 2    property.3        (6) A declaration of any surplus real property. On or 4    before October 31 of each year the Administrator shall 5    furnish copies of each responsible officer's report along 6    with a list of surplus property indexed by legislative 7    district to the General Assembly.8    This report shall be filed with the Speaker, the Minority 9Leader and the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the 10President, the Minority Leader and the Secretary of the Senate 11and shall be duplicated and made available to the members of 12the General Assembly for evaluation by such members for 13possible liquidation of unused public property at public sale.14    (c) Following receipt of the Annual Real Property 15Utilization Report required under paragraph (b), the 16Administrator shall notify all State agencies by October 31 of 17all declared surplus real property.18    (d) Any surplus real property shall be disposed of by the 19Administrator. No appraisal is required if during his initial 20survey of surplus real property the Administrator determines 21such property has a fair market value of less than $5,000. If 22the value of such property is determined by the Administrator 23in his initial survey to be $5,000 or more, then the 24Administrator shall obtain 2 appraisals of such real property, 25which shall include known liabilities, including, but not 26limited to, environmental costs. The average of these 2   SB1343 Enrolled- 10 -LRB104 06300 BDA 16335 b1appraisals shall represent the fair market value of the 2surplus real property. 3    No surplus real property may be conveyed by the 4Administrator for less than the fair market value, unless the 5Administrator makes a written determination that it is in the 6best interests of the State to establish a different value. 7That written determination shall be published in the Illinois 8Procurement Bulletin. Such written determination, along with 9an affidavit setting forth the conditions and circumstances 10that make the use of a different value in the best interests of 11the State, shall also be filed with the Executive Ethics 12Commission. The Executive Ethics Commission shall have 30 days 13to review the written determination. The Executive Ethics 14Commission may order an additional 30 days to review the 15written determination. The Administrator shall provide the 16Executive Ethics Commission with any information requested by 17the Executive Ethics Commission related to the Administrator's 18determination of the value of the surplus real property. If 19the Executive Ethics Commission objects in writing to the 20value determined by the Administrator, then the Administrator 21shall not convey the surplus real property for less than 22either the fair market value as determined by the average of 23appraisals or an amount agreed upon by the Executive Ethics 24Commission and the Administrator. Circumstances in which it is 25in the best interests of the State to establish a different 26value may include, but are not limited to, the following: (i)   SB1343 Enrolled- 11 -LRB104 06300 BDA 16335 b1an auction did not yield any bids at the established fair 2market value; (ii) a unit of local government is interested in 3acquiring the surplus real property; or (iii) the costs to the 4State of maintaining such surplus real property are 5sufficiently high that it would be reasonable to a prudent 6person to sell such surplus real property for less than the 7fair market value established by the average of the 8appraisals. In no event shall the Administrator sell surplus 9real property for less than 75% of fair market value and before 10such property has been offered to an interested unit of local 11government or made available at public auction. 12    Prior to offering the surplus real property for sale to 13the public the Administrator shall give notice in writing of 14the existence of the surplus real property to each State 15agency and to the governing bodies of the county and of all 16cities, villages and incorporated towns in the county in which 17such real property is located. Any such State agency or 18governing body may notify the Administrator of its interest in 19acquiring the surplus real property within a notice period set 20by the Administrator of at least 30 days. If any State agency 21notifies the Administrator of its interest in acquiring the 22surplus property, the Administrator may deny any such requests 23by such agency if the Administrator determines that it is more 24advantageous to the State to dispose of the surplus real 25property to a governing body or the public. If a governing body 26notifies the Administrator of its interest in acquiring the   SB1343 Enrolled- 12 -LRB104 06300 BDA 16335 b1property, then the Administrator shall wait a minimum of 30 2additional days during which the Administrator may engage in 3negotiations with such governing body for the sale of the 4surplus real property. After the notice period set by the 5Administrator of at least 30 days has passed, the 6Administrator may sell the surplus real property by public 7auction, which may include an electronic auction or the use of 8sealed bids, following notice of such sale by publication on 3 9separate days not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to 10the sale in the State newspaper and in a newspaper having 11general circulation in the county in which the surplus real 12property is located. The Administrator shall post "For Sale" 13signs of a conspicuous nature on such surplus real property 14offered for sale to the public. If no acceptable offers for the 15surplus real property are received, the Administrator may have 16new appraisals of such property made. The Administrator shall 17have all power necessary to convey surplus real property under 18this Section. All moneys received for the sale of surplus real 19property shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund, 20except that: 21        (1) Where moneys expended for the acquisition of such 22    real property were from a special fund which is still a 23    special fund in the State treasury, this special fund 24    shall be reimbursed in the amount of the original 25    expenditure and any amount in excess thereof shall be 26    deposited in the General Revenue Fund.  SB1343 Enrolled- 13 -LRB104 06300 BDA 16335 b1        (2) Whenever a State mental health facility operated 2    by the Department of Human Services is closed and the real 3    estate on which the facility is located is sold by the 4    State, the net proceeds of the sale of the real estate 5    shall be deposited into the Community Mental Health 6    Medicaid Trust Fund.7        (3) Whenever a State developmental disabilities 8    facility operated by the Department of Human Services is 9    closed and the real estate on which the facility is 10    located is sold by the State, the net proceeds of the sale 11    of the real estate shall be deposited into the Community 12    Developmental Disability Services Medicaid Trust Fund. 13    The Administrator shall have authority to order such 14surveys, abstracts of title, or commitments for title 15insurance as may, in his reasonable discretion, be deemed 16necessary to demonstrate to prospective purchasers or bidders 17good and marketable title in any property offered for sale 18pursuant to this Section. Unless otherwise specifically 19authorized by the General Assembly, all conveyances of 20property made by the Administrator shall be by quit claim 21deed.22    (e) The Administrator shall submit an annual report on or 23before February 1 to the Governor and the General Assembly 24containing a detailed statement of surplus real property 25either transferred or conveyed under this Section.26(Source: P.A. 102-280, eff. 8-6-21.)
