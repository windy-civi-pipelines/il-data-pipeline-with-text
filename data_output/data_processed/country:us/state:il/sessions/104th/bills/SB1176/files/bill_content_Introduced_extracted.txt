Any such State agency or 5governing body may notify the Administrator of its interest in 6acquiring the surplus real property within a notice period set 7by the Administrator of at least 30 days. If any State agency 8notifies the Administrator of its interest in acquiring the 9surplus property, the Administrator may deny any such requests 10by such agency if the Administrator determines that it is more 11advantageous to the State to dispose of the surplus real 12property to a governing body or the public. If a governing body 13notifies the Administrator of its interest in acquiring the 14property, then the Administrator shall wait a minimum of 30 15additional days during which the Administrator may engage in 16negotiations with such governing body for the sale of the 17surplus real property. After the notice period set by the 18Administrator of at least 30 days has passed, the 19Administrator may sell the surplus real property by public 20auction, which may include an electronic auction or the use of 21sealed bids, following notice of such sale by publication on 3 22separate days not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior to 23the sale in the State newspaper and in a newspaper having 24general circulation in the county in which the surplus real 25property is located.

All moneys received for the sale of surplus real 6property shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund, 7except that: 8        (1) Where moneys expended for the acquisition of such 9    real property were from a special fund which is still a 10    special fund in the State treasury, this special fund 11    shall be reimbursed in the amount of the original 12    expenditure and any amount in excess thereof shall be 13    deposited in the General Revenue Fund.14        (2) Whenever a State mental health facility operated 15    by the Department of Human Services is closed and the real 16    estate on which the facility is located is sold by the 17    State, the net proceeds of the sale of the real estate 18    shall be deposited into the Community Mental Health 19    Medicaid Trust Fund.20        (3) Whenever a State developmental disabilities 21    facility operated by the Department of Human Services is 22    closed and the real estate on which the facility is 23    located is sold by the State, the net proceeds of the sale 24    of the real estate shall be deposited into the Community 25    Developmental Disability Services Medicaid Trust Fund. 26    The Administrator shall have authority to order such   SB1176- 7 -LRB104 06302 BDA 16337 b1surveys, abstracts of title, or commitments for title 2insurance as may, in his reasonable discretion, be deemed 3necessary to demonstrate to prospective purchasers or bidders 4good and marketable title in any property offered for sale 5pursuant to this Section. Unless otherwise specifically 6authorized by the General Assembly, all conveyances of 7property made by the Administrator shall be by quit claim 8deed.9    (e) The Administrator shall submit an annual report on or 10before February 1 to the Governor and the General Assembly 11containing a detailed statement of surplus real property 12either transferred or conveyed under this Section.13(Source: P.A. 102-280, eff. 8-6-21.)
