The 21certificate shall be signed by a licensed physician, physician 22assistant, or nurse practitioner who, within 7 days, has 23examined the defendant. A disability is a mental or physical 24condition that, in the opinion of a physician, physician 25assistant, or nurse practitioner, prevents the defendant from 26safely attending a hearing in person. The defendant's mere   SB2373- 12 -LRB104 10122 RLC 20194 b1refusal to attend a hearing shall not by itself constitute a 2disability, regardless of the person's mental state. 3    (d) On the basis of the evidence before it, the court or 4jury shall determine whether the defendant is fit to stand 5trial, or to plead, or to be sentenced.

If the court or the jury finds that there is not a 13substantial probability, the court shall proceed as provided 14in Section 104-23. If such probability is found or if the court 15or the jury is unable to determine whether a substantial 16probability exists, the court shall order the defendant to 17undergo treatment for the purpose of rendering the defendant 18him fit. In the event that a defendant is ordered to undergo 19treatment with when there has been no initial determination as 20to the probability of his attaining fitness within the 21statutory timeframe, the court shall conduct a hearing as soon 22as possible following the receipt of the treatment 23supervisor's report filed pursuant to subsection (g) paragraph 24(d) of Section 104-17, unless the hearing is waived by the 25defense, and shall make a determination as to whether a 26substantial probability of attaining fitness within the   SB2373- 13 -LRB104 10122 RLC 20194 b1statutory timeframe exists. If the court or the jury finds 2that there is not a substantial probability that the defendant 3may be rendered fit within the statutory limitations, the 4court shall proceed as provided in Section 104-23. 5    (e) An order finding the defendant unfit is a final order 6for purposes of appeal by the State or the defendant.7(Source: P.A. 81-1217.) 8    (725 ILCS 5/104-17)  (from Ch. 38, par. 104-17)9    Sec. 104-17.

If during the course of 14screening evaluating the defendant for placement, the 15Department of Human Services determines that the defendant is 16currently fit to stand trial, suitable for outpatient 17treatment, or unfit without a substantial probability of being 18rendered fit within the statutory timeframe, it shall 19immediately notify the court, the State, and the defense court 20and shall submit a written report within 7 days. In any of 21those circumstances, that circumstance the placement shall be 22held pending a court hearing on the Department's report. 23Otherwise, upon completion of the placement process, including 24identifying bed and placement availability, the sheriff shall 25be notified and shall transport the defendant to the 26designated facility. If, within 60 days of the successful   SB2373- 16 -LRB104 10122 RLC 20194 b1transmittal by the clerk of the circuit court of the court's 2remand court's placement order, the Department has not 3provided the court fails to provide the sheriff with notice of 4bed and placement availability at the designated facility, the 5sheriff shall contact the Department to inquire about when a 6placement will become available at the designated facility as 7well as bed and placement availability at other secure 8facilities.

The placement may be ordered either on an inpatient 20or an outpatient basis.21    (c) If the defendant's disability is physical, the court 22may order placement at a medical hospital or other residential 23care facility or program that has agreed to provide treatment 24to the defendant. Only such physical conditions that may be 25overcome by special assistance or provisions as referenced in 26Section 104-22 qualify as physical disabilities under this   SB2373- 17 -LRB104 10122 RLC 20194 b1subsection. him placed under the supervision of the Department 2of Human Services which shall place and maintain the defendant 3in a suitable treatment facility or program, or the court may 4order him placed in an appropriate public or private facility 5or treatment program which has agreed to provide treatment to 6the defendant.
