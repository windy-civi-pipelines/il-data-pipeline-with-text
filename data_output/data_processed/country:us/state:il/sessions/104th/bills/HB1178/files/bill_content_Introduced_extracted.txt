However, any juvenile confined in the county 24jail under this provision shall be separated from adults who 25are confined in the county jail in such a manner that there 26will be no contact by sight, sound, or otherwise between the   HB1178- 11 -LRB104 04970 RLC 14997 b1juvenile and adult prisoners.2    (f) For purposes of appearing in a physical lineup, the 3minor may be taken to a county jail or municipal lockup under 4the direct and constant supervision of a juvenile police 5officer.

Minors under 18 years 2    of age shall be kept separate from confined adults and may 3    not at any time be kept in the same cell, room, or yard 4    with adults confined pursuant to criminal law. Persons 18 5    years of age and older who have a petition of delinquency 6    filed against them may be confined in an adult detention 7    facility. In making a determination whether to confine a 8    person 18 years of age or older who has a petition of 9    delinquency filed against the person, these factors, among 10    other matters, shall be considered:11            (A) the age of the person;12            (B) any previous delinquent or criminal history of 13        the person;14            (C) any previous abuse or neglect history of the 15        person; and16            (D) any mental health or educational history of 17        the person, or both.18    (d)(i) If a minor 12 years of age or older is confined in a 19county jail in a county with a population below 3,000,000 20inhabitants, then the minor's confinement shall be implemented 21in such a manner that there will be no contact by sight, sound, 22or otherwise between the minor and adult prisoners.

However, any juvenile confined in the county 24jail under this provision shall be separated from adults who 25are confined in the county jail in such a manner that there 26will be no contact by sight, sound, or otherwise between the   HB1178- 11 -LRB104 04970 RLC 14997 b1juvenile and adult prisoners.2    (f) For purposes of appearing in a physical lineup, the 3minor may be taken to a county jail or municipal lockup under 4the direct and constant supervision of a juvenile police 5officer.

During such time as is necessary to 12process the minor, and while supervised by a law enforcement 13officer or correctional officer, the sight and sound 14separation provisions shall not apply.15    (3) If the probation officer or State's Attorney (or such 16other public officer designated by the court in a county 17having 3,000,000 or more inhabitants) determines that the 18minor may be a delinquent minor as described in subsection (3) 19of Section 5-105, and should be retained in custody but does 20not require physical restriction, the minor may be placed in 21non-secure custody for up to 40 hours pending a detention 22hearing.23    (4) Any minor taken into temporary custody, not requiring 24secure detention, may, however, be detained in the home of the 25minor's parent or guardian subject to such conditions as the 26court may impose.  HB1178- 12 -LRB104 04970 RLC 14997 b1    (5) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 2apply to a minor who has been arrested or taken into custody on 3or after January 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 498-61). 5(Source: P.A. 103-22, eff. 8-8-23; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24.)
