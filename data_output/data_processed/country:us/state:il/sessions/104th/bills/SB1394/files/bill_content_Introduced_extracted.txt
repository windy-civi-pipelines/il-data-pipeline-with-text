Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Household Hazardous Waste Stewardship Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that:7    (1) It is in the best interest of the State of Illinois for 8manufacturers of products for household use that contain 9hazardous substances to assume responsibility for the 10development, financing, and implementation of a statewide 11stewardship program that conveniently serves all areas of the 12State for the collection and environmentally sound management 13of waste from those products. There are hundreds of products 14purchased by consumers that contain hazardous substances, 15including, but not limited to, aerosol products, fertilizers, 16herbicides, pesticides, fluorescent lamps, furniture stripper 17and varnish, gasoline, kerosene, used oil, antifreeze, 18electronic cigarettes, household cleaners, solvent cleaners, 19and pool or hot tub chemicals. 20    (2) Improper management and disposal of household 21hazardous waste is a threat to public health and the 22environment. 23    (3) In 1991, the need for household hazardous waste   SB1394- 2 -LRB104 06517 BDA 16553 b1collection programs throughout the State was recognized and 2the Household Hazardous Waste Collection Act was enacted. 3Since then, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency and 4local governments have worked together to support collection 5events and develop 5 permanent household hazardous waste 6collection facilities.
