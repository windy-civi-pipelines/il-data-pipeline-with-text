Short title. This Act may be cited as the 5Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism Act. 6    Section 5. Legislative intent. Across the country, 7ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have 8increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to 9permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to 10intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, 11from women's domestic abuse shelters to women's workplace 12showers. This is wrong. Efforts to eradicate the biological 13reality of sex fundamentally attack women by depriving them of 14their dignity, safety, and well-being. The erasure of sex in 15language and policy has a corrosive impact not just on women 16but on the validity of the entire American system. Basing 17policy on truth is critical to scientific inquiry, public 18safety, morale, and trust in government itself.19    This unhealthy road is paved by an ongoing and purposeful 20attack against the ordinary and longstanding use and 21understanding of biological and scientific terms, replacing 22the immutable biological reality of sex with an internal, 23fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological   SB2078- 2 -LRB104 11327 JRC 21414 b1facts. Invalidating the true and biological category of 2"woman" improperly transforms laws and policies designed to 3protect sex-based opportunities into laws and policies that 4undermine them, replacing longstanding, cherished legal rights 5and values with an identity-based, inchoate social concept.6    It is the policy of the State to recognize 2 sexes: male 7and female. These sexes are not changeable and are grounded in 8fundamental and incontrovertible reality. Accordingly, the 9State will defend women's rights and protect freedom of 10conscience by using clear and accurate language and policies 11that recognize women are biologically female, and men are 12biologically male.  13    Section 10. Definitions. As used in this Act:14    "Female" means a person belonging, at conception, to the 15sex that produces the large reproductive cell. 16    "Gender identity" means a fully internal and subjective 17sense of self disconnected from biological reality and sex and 18existing on an infinite continuum that does not provide a 19meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized 20as a replacement for sex.21    "Gender ideology" means the replacement of the biological 22category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed 23gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can 24identify as and thus become women and vice versa, and 25requiring all institutions of society to regard this false   SB2078- 3 -LRB104 11327 JRC 21414 b1claim as true. "Gender ideology" includes the idea that there 2is a vast spectrum of genders that are disconnected from one's 3sex. "Gender ideology" is internally inconsistent in that it 4diminishes sex as an identifiable or useful category but 5nevertheless maintains that it is possible for a person to be 6born in the wrong sexed body. 7    "Male" means a person belonging, at conception, to the sex 8that produces the small reproductive cell. 9    "Men" or "man" and "boys" or "boy" means adult and 10juvenile human males, respectively. 11    "Sex" means an individual's immutable biological 12classification as either male or female. "Sex" is not a 13synonym for and does not include the concept of gender 14identity. 15    "Women" or "woman" and "girls" or "girl" means adult and 16juvenile human females, respectively.  17    Section 15. Recognizing women are biologically distinct 18from men. 19    (a) Within 30 days of the date of this Act, the Secretary 20of the Department of Human Services shall provide to State 21agencies and employees, contractors, and the public clear 22guidance expanding on the sex-based definitions set forth in 23this Act. 24    (b) Each agency and all State employees shall enforce this 25Act governing sex-based rights, protections, opportunities,   SB2078- 4 -LRB104 11327 JRC 21414 b1and accommodations to protect men and women as biologically 2distinct sexes. Each agency shall give the terms "sex", 3"male", "female", "men", "women", "boys" and "girls" the 4meanings set forth in Section 5 when interpreting or applying 5statutes, regulations, rules, or guidance and in all other 6official agency business, documents, and communications. 7    (c) When administering or enforcing sex-based 8distinctions, every State agency and all State employees 9acting in an official capacity on behalf of their agency shall 10use the term "sex" and not "gender" in all applicable State 11policies and documents. 12    (d) The Secretary of State shall implement changes to 13require that government-issued identification documents to 14accurately reflect the holder's sex, as defined under Section 155, and the Director of Central Management Services shall 16ensure that applicable personnel records accurately report 17State employees' sex, as defined by Section 5. 18    (e) State agencies shall remove all statements, policies, 19regulations, rules, forms, communications, or other internal 20and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate 21gender ideology and shall cease issuing such statements, 22policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other 23messages. State agency forms that require an individual's sex 24shall list male or female and may not request gender identity. 25State agencies shall take all necessary steps, as permitted by 26law, to end the State funding of gender ideology. Each State   SB2078- 5 -LRB104 11327 JRC 21414 b1agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences 2and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology. 3    Section 20. Privacy in intimate spaces. 4    (a) The Director of the Department of Corrections shall 5ensure that males are not detained in women's prisons or 6housed in women's detention centers, revise its policies 7concerning medical care to be consistent with this Act, and 8shall ensure that no State funds are expended for any medical 9procedure, treatment, or drug for the purpose of conforming an 10inmate's appearance to that of the opposite sex. 11    (b) State agencies shall effectuate this policy by taking 12appropriate action to ensure that intimate spaces designated 13for women, girls, or females, or for men, boys, or males, are 14designated by sex and not identity. 15    Section 25. Protecting rights. The Department of Human 16Rights shall issue guidance to ensure the freedom to express 17the binary nature of sex and the right to single-sex spaces in 18workplaces. The Department shall prioritize investigations and 19litigation to enforce the rights and freedoms identified and 20created under this Act. 21    Section 30. Agency implementation and reporting. 22    (a) Within 120 days of the date of this Act, each State 23Agency shall submit an update on implementation of this order   SB2078- 6 -LRB104 11327 JRC 21414 b1to the Governor, the Senate President, the Minority Leader of 2the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and 3the Minority Leader of the House of Representatives.

General provisions. 16    (a) Nothing in this Act may be construed to impair or 17otherwise affect the authority granted by law to a 18constitutional officer, State agency, or director of any State 19agency. 20    (b) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any 21right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at 22law or in equity by any party against the State, its 23departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, 24or agents, or any other person.   SB2078- 7 -LRB104 11327 JRC 21414 b1    Section 95.

If any provision of this Act or 5its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, 6the invalidity of that provision or application does not 7affect other provisions or applications of this Act that can 8be given effect without the invalid provision or application.  9    (410 ILCS 35/Act rep.)10    Section 900.
