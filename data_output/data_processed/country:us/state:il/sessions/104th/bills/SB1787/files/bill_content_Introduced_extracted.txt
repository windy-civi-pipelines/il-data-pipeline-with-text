Any oral, written, or sign language statement of a 18minor made as a result of an interrogation under this 19subsection shall be presumed to be inadmissible as evidence 20against the minor in any criminal proceeding or juvenile court 21proceeding, unless the recording is substantially accurate and 22not intentionally altered.23    (c) Every electronic recording made under this Section 24must be preserved until such time as the minor's adjudication 25for any offense relating to the statement is final and all 26direct and habeas corpus appeals are exhausted, or the   SB1787- 7 -LRB104 09199 RLC 19256 b1prosecution of such offenses is barred by law.2    (d) If the court finds, by a preponderance of the 3evidence, that the minor was subjected to a custodial 4interrogation in violation of this Section, then any 5statements made by the minor during or following that 6non-recorded custodial interrogation, even if otherwise in 7compliance with this Section, are presumed to be inadmissible 8in any criminal proceeding or juvenile court proceeding 9against the minor except for the purposes of impeachment. 10    (d-5) An oral, written, or sign language statement of a 11minor made without counsel present throughout the entire 12custodial interrogation of the minor shall be inadmissible as 13evidence against the minor in any juvenile court proceeding or 14criminal proceeding. 15    (e) Nothing in this Section precludes the admission (i) of 16a statement made by the minor in open court in any criminal 17proceeding or juvenile court proceeding, before a grand jury, 18or at a preliminary hearing, (ii) of a statement made during a 19custodial interrogation that was not recorded as required by 20this Section because electronic recording was not feasible, 21(iii) of a voluntary statement, whether or not the result of a 22custodial interrogation, that has a bearing on the credibility 23of the accused as a witness, (iv) of a spontaneous statement 24that is not made in response to a question, (v) of a statement 25made after questioning that is routinely asked during the 26processing of the arrest of the suspect, (vi) of a statement   SB1787- 8 -LRB104 09199 RLC 19256 b1made during a custodial interrogation by a suspect who 2requests, prior to making the statement, to respond to the 3interrogator's questions only if an electronic recording is 4not made of the statement, provided that an electronic 5recording is made of the statement of agreeing to respond to 6the interrogator's question, only if a recording is not made 7of the statement, (vii) of a statement made during a custodial 8interrogation that is conducted out-of-state, (viii) of a 9statement given in violation of subsection (b) at a time when 10the interrogators are unaware that a death has in fact 11occurred, (ix) (blank), or (x) of any other statement that may 12be admissible under law. The State shall bear the burden of 13proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that one of the 14exceptions described in this subsection (e) is applicable. 15Nothing in this Section precludes the admission of a 16statement, otherwise inadmissible under this Section, that is 17used only for impeachment and not as substantive evidence.18    (f) (Blank). The presumption of inadmissibility of a 19statement made by a suspect at a custodial interrogation at a 20police station or other place of detention may be overcome by a 21preponderance of the evidence that the statement was 22voluntarily given and is reliable, based on the totality of 23the circumstances.24    (g) Any electronic recording of any statement made by a 25minor during a custodial interrogation that is compiled by any 26law enforcement agency as required by this Section for the   SB1787- 9 -LRB104 09199 RLC 19256 b1purposes of fulfilling the requirements of this Section shall 2be confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying, 3as provided under Section 7 of the Freedom of Information Act, 4and the information shall not be transmitted to anyone except 5as needed to comply with this Section.6    (h) A statement, admission, confession, or incriminating 7information made by or obtained from a minor related to the 8instant offense, as part of any behavioral health screening, 9assessment, evaluation, or treatment, whether or not 10court-ordered, shall not be admissible as evidence against the 11minor on the issue of guilt only in the instant juvenile court 12proceeding. The provisions of this subsection (h) are in 13addition to and do not override any existing statutory and 14constitutional prohibition on the admission into evidence in 15delinquency proceedings of information obtained during 16screening, assessment, or treatment. 17    (i) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 98-61 18apply to statements of a minor made on or after January 1, 2014 19(the effective date of Public Act 98-61). 20(Source: P.A. 103-22, eff. 8-8-23.)
