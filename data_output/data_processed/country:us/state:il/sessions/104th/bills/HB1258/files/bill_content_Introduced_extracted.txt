The Workers' Compensation Act is amended by 5changing Section 8 as follows: 6    (820 ILCS 305/8)  (from Ch. 48, par. 138.8)7    Sec. 8. The amount of compensation which shall be paid to 8the employee for an accidental injury not resulting in death 9is:10    (a) The employer shall provide and pay the negotiated 11rate, if applicable, or the lesser of the health care 12provider's actual charges or according to a fee schedule, 13subject to Section 8.2, in effect at the time the service was 14rendered for all the necessary first aid, medical and surgical 15services, and all necessary medical, surgical and hospital 16services thereafter incurred, limited, however, to that which 17is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of 18the accidental injury, even if a health care provider sells, 19transfers, or otherwise assigns an account receivable for 20procedures, treatments, or services covered under this Act. If 21the employer does not dispute payment of first aid, medical, 22surgical, and hospital services, the employer shall make such 23payment to the provider on behalf of the employee. The   HB1258- 2 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1employer shall also pay for treatment, instruction and 2training necessary for the physical, mental and vocational 3rehabilitation of the employee, including all maintenance 4costs and expenses incidental thereto. If as a result of the 5injury the employee is unable to be self-sufficient the 6employer shall further pay for such maintenance or 7institutional care as shall be required.8    The employee may at any time elect to secure his own 9physician, surgeon and hospital services at the employer's 10expense, or, 11    Upon agreement between the employer and the employees, or 12the employees' exclusive representative, and subject to the 13approval of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the 14employer shall maintain a list of physicians, to be known as a 15Panel of Physicians, who are accessible to the employees. The 16employer shall post this list in a place or places easily 17accessible to his employees. The employee shall have the right 18to make an alternative choice of physician from such Panel if 19he is not satisfied with the physician first selected. If, due 20to the nature of the injury or its occurrence away from the 21employer's place of business, the employee is unable to make a 22selection from the Panel, the selection process from the Panel 23shall not apply. The physician selected from the Panel may 24arrange for any consultation, referral or other specialized 25medical services outside the Panel at the employer's expense. 26Provided that, in the event the Commission shall find that a   HB1258- 3 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1doctor selected by the employee is rendering improper or 2inadequate care, the Commission may order the employee to 3select another doctor certified or qualified in the medical 4field for which treatment is required. If the employee refuses 5to make such change the Commission may relieve the employer of 6his obligation to pay the doctor's charges from the date of 7refusal to the date of compliance.8    Any vocational rehabilitation counselors who provide 9service under this Act shall have appropriate certifications 10which designate the counselor as qualified to render opinions 11relating to vocational rehabilitation. Vocational 12rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, counseling 13for job searches, supervising a job search program, and 14vocational retraining including education at an accredited 15learning institution. The employee or employer may petition to 16the Commission to decide disputes relating to vocational 17rehabilitation and the Commission shall resolve any such 18dispute, including payment of the vocational rehabilitation 19program by the employer.20    The maintenance benefit shall not be less than the 21temporary total disability rate determined for the employee. 22In addition, maintenance shall include costs and expenses 23incidental to the vocational rehabilitation program.24    When the employee is working light duty on a part-time 25basis or full-time basis and earns less than he or she would be 26earning if employed in the full capacity of the job or jobs,   HB1258- 4 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1then the employee shall be entitled to temporary partial 2disability benefits. Temporary partial disability benefits 3shall be equal to two-thirds of the difference between the 4average amount that the employee would be able to earn in the 5full performance of his or her duties in the occupation in 6which he or she was engaged at the time of accident and the 7gross amount which he or she is earning in the modified job 8provided to the employee by the employer or in any other job 9that the employee is working.10    Every hospital, physician, surgeon or other person 11rendering treatment or services in accordance with the 12provisions of this Section shall upon written request furnish 13full and complete reports thereof to, and permit their records 14to be copied by, the employer, the employee or his dependents, 15as the case may be, or any other party to any proceeding for 16compensation before the Commission, or their attorneys.17    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer's liability to 18pay for such medical services selected by the employee shall 19be limited to:20        (1) all first aid and emergency treatment; plus21        (2) all medical, surgical and hospital services 22    provided by the physician, surgeon or hospital initially 23    chosen by the employee or by any other physician, 24    consultant, expert, institution or other provider of 25    services recommended by said initial service provider or 26    any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain   HB1258- 5 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1    of referrals from said initial service provider; plus2        (3) all medical, surgical and hospital services 3    provided by any second physician, surgeon or hospital 4    subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other 5    physician, consultant, expert, institution or other 6    provider of services recommended by said second service 7    provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in 8    the chain of referrals from said second service provider. 9    Thereafter the employer shall select and pay for all 10    necessary medical, surgical and hospital treatment and the 11    employee may not select a provider of medical services at 12    the employer's expense unless the employer agrees to such 13    selection. At any time the employee may obtain any medical 14    treatment he desires at his own expense. This paragraph 15    shall not affect the duty to pay for rehabilitation 16    referred to above.17        (4) The following shall apply for injuries occurring 18    on or after June 28, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 19    97-18) and only when an employer has an approved preferred 20    provider program pursuant to Section 8.1a on the date the 21    employee sustained his or her accidental injuries:22            (A) The employer shall, in writing, on a form 23        promulgated by the Commission, inform the employee of 24        the preferred provider program;25            (B) Subsequent to the report of an injury by an 26        employee, the employee may choose in writing at any   HB1258- 6 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1        time to decline the preferred provider program, in 2        which case that would constitute one of the two 3        choices of medical providers to which the employee is 4        entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3); and5            (C) Prior to the report of an injury by an 6        employee, when an employee chooses non-emergency 7        treatment from a provider not within the preferred 8        provider program, that would constitute the employee's 9        one choice of medical providers to which the employee 10        is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3). 11    When an employer and employee so agree in writing, nothing 12in this Act prevents an employee whose injury or disability 13has been established under this Act, from relying in good 14faith, on treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone, in 15accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church 16or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner 17thereof, and having nursing services appropriate therewith, 18without suffering loss or diminution of the compensation 19benefits under this Act. However, the employee shall submit to 20all physical examinations required by this Act. The cost of 21such treatment and nursing care shall be paid by the employee 22unless the employer agrees to make such payment.23    Where the accidental injury results in the amputation of 24an arm, hand, leg or foot, or the enucleation of an eye, or the 25loss of any of the natural teeth, the employer shall furnish an 26artificial of any such members lost or damaged in accidental   HB1258- 7 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and 2shall also furnish the necessary braces in all proper and 3necessary cases.

Where the accidental injury 7accompanied by physical injury results in damage to a denture, 8eye glasses or contact eye lenses, or where the accidental 9injury results in damage to an artificial member, the employer 10shall replace or repair such denture, glasses, lenses, or 11artificial member.12    The furnishing by the employer of any such services or 13appliances is not an admission of liability on the part of the 14employer to pay compensation.15    The furnishing of any such services or appliances or the 16servicing thereof by the employer is not the payment of 17compensation.18    (b) If the period of temporary total incapacity for work 19lasts more than 3 working days, weekly compensation as 20hereinafter provided shall be paid beginning on the 4th day of 21such temporary total incapacity and continuing as long as the 22total temporary incapacity lasts. In cases where the temporary 23total incapacity for work continues for a period of 14 days or 24more from the day of the accident compensation shall commence 25on the day after the accident.26        1.

For the permanent partial loss of use of a member 18    or sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, compensation 19    during that proportion of the number of weeks in the 20    foregoing schedule provided for the loss of such member or 21    sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, which the partial 22    loss of use thereof bears to the total loss of use of such 23    member, or sight of eye, or hearing of an ear.24            (a) Loss of hearing for compensation purposes 25        shall be confined to the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 26        and 3,000 cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability   HB1258- 24 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1        for frequency tones above 3,000 cycles per second are 2        not to be considered as constituting disability for 3        hearing.4            (b) The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of 5        the determination of compensation claims for 6        occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the 7        average in decibels for the thresholds of hearing for 8        the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 cycles per 9        second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric 10        instruments, approved by nationally recognized 11        authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring 12        hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 30 13        decibels or less in the 3 frequencies, such losses of 14        hearing shall not then constitute any compensable 15        hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 16        85 decibels or more in the 3 frequencies, then the same 17        shall constitute and be total or 100% compensable 18        hearing loss.19            (c) In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest 20        measured losses in each of the 3 frequencies shall be 21        added together and divided by 3 to determine the 22        average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss 23        exceeding 30 decibels an allowance of 1.82% shall be 24        made up to the maximum of 100% which is reached at 85 25        decibels.26            (d) If a hearing loss is established to have   HB1258- 25 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1        existed on July 1, 1975 by audiometric testing the 2        employer shall not be liable for the previous loss so 3        established nor shall he be liable for any loss for 4        which compensation has been paid or awarded.5            (e) No consideration shall be given to the 6        question of whether or not the ability of an employee 7        to understand speech is improved by the use of a 8        hearing aid.9            (f) No claim for loss of hearing due to industrial 10        noise shall be brought against an employer or allowed 11        unless the employee has been exposed for a period of 12        time sufficient to cause permanent impairment to noise 13        levels in excess of the following: 14Sound Level DBA15Slow ResponseHours Per Day16908179261895419973201002211021-1/2221051231101/2241151/425        This subparagraph (f) shall not be applied in cases of 26    hearing loss resulting from trauma or explosion.  HB1258- 26 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1        17. In computing the compensation to be paid to any 2    employee who, before the accident for which he claims 3    compensation, had before that time sustained an injury 4    resulting in the loss by amputation or partial loss by 5    amputation of any member, including hand, arm, thumb or 6    fingers, leg, foot or any toes, such loss or partial loss 7    of any such member shall be deducted from any award made 8    for the subsequent injury. For the permanent loss of use 9    or the permanent partial loss of use of any such member or 10    the partial loss of sight of an eye, for which 11    compensation has been paid, then such loss shall be taken 12    into consideration and deducted from any award for the 13    subsequent injury.14        18. The specific case of loss of both hands, both 15    arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any 16    two thereof, or the permanent and complete loss of the use 17    thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be 18    compensated according to the compensation fixed by 19    paragraph (f) of this Section. These specific cases of 20    total and permanent disability do not exclude other cases.21        Any employee who has previously suffered the loss or 22    permanent and complete loss of the use of any of such 23    members, and in a subsequent independent accident loses 24    another or suffers the permanent and complete loss of the 25    use of any one of such members the employer for whom the 26    injured employee is working at the time of the last   HB1258- 27 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1    independent accident is liable to pay compensation only 2    for the loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of 3    the member occasioned by the last independent accident.4        19. In a case of specific loss and the subsequent 5    death of such injured employee from other causes than such 6    injury leaving a widow, widower, or dependents surviving 7    before payment or payment in full for such injury, then 8    the amount due for such injury is payable to the widow or 9    widower and, if there be no widow or widower, then to such 10    dependents, in the proportion which such dependency bears 11    to total dependency.12    Beginning July 1, 1980, and every 6 months thereafter, the 13Commission shall examine the Second Injury Fund and when, 14after deducting all advances or loans made to such Fund, the 15amount therein is $500,000 then the amount required to be paid 16by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 17reduced by one-half. When the Second Injury Fund reaches the 18sum of $600,000 then the payments shall cease entirely. 19However, when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to 20$400,000, payment of one-half of the amounts required by 21paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 22herein provided, and when the Second Injury Fund has been 23reduced to $300,000, payment of the full amounts required by 24paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 25herein provided. The Commission shall make the changes in 26payment effective by general order, and the changes in payment   HB1258- 28 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1become immediately effective for all cases coming before the 2Commission thereafter either by settlement agreement or final 3order, irrespective of the date of the accidental injury.4    On August 1, 1996 and on February 1 and August 1 of each 5subsequent year, the Commission shall examine the special fund 6designated as the "Rate Adjustment Fund" and when, after 7deducting all advances or loans made to said fund, the amount 8therein is $4,000,000, the amount required to be paid by 9employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 10reduced by one-half. When the Rate Adjustment Fund reaches the 11sum of $5,000,000 the payment therein shall cease entirely. 12However, when said Rate Adjustment Fund has been reduced to 13$3,000,000 the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 14shall be resumed in the manner herein provided.15    (f) In case of complete disability, which renders the 16employee wholly and permanently incapable of work, or in the 17specific case of total and permanent disability as provided in 18subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section, compensation 19shall be payable at the rate provided in subparagraph 2 of 20paragraph (b) of this Section for life.21    An employee entitled to benefits under paragraph (f) of 22this Section shall also be entitled to receive from the Rate 23Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of the 24supplementary benefits provided in paragraph (g) of this 25Section 8.26    If any employee who receives an award under this paragraph   HB1258- 29 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1afterwards returns to work or is able to do so, and earns or is 2able to earn as much as before the accident, payments under 3such award shall cease. If such employee returns to work, or is 4able to do so, and earns or is able to earn part but not as 5much as before the accident, such award shall be modified so as 6to conform to an award under paragraph (d) of this Section. If 7such award is terminated or reduced under the provisions of 8this paragraph, such employees have the right at any time 9within 30 months after the date of such termination or 10reduction to file petition with the Commission for the purpose 11of determining whether any disability exists as a result of 12the original accidental injury and the extent thereof.13    Disability as enumerated in subdivision 18, paragraph (e) 14of this Section is considered complete disability.15    If an employee who had previously incurred loss or the 16permanent and complete loss of use of one member, through the 17loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one hand, 18one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent and 19complete disability through the loss or the permanent and 20complete loss of the use of another member, he shall receive, 21in addition to the compensation payable by the employer and 22after such payments have ceased, an amount from the Second 23Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7, which, 24together with the compensation payable from the employer in 25whose employ he was when the last accidental injury was 26incurred, will equal the amount payable for permanent and   HB1258- 30 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1complete disability as provided in this paragraph of this 2Section.3    The custodian of the Second Injury Fund provided for in 4paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be joined with the employer as 5a party respondent in the application for adjustment of claim. 6The application for adjustment of claim shall state briefly 7and in general terms the approximate time and place and manner 8of the loss of the first member.9    In its award the Commission or the Arbitrator shall 10specifically find the amount the injured employee shall be 11weekly paid, the number of weeks compensation which shall be 12paid by the employer, the date upon which payments begin out of 13the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of 14Section 7 of this Act, the length of time the weekly payments 15continue, the date upon which the pension payments commence 16and the monthly amount of the payments. The Commission shall 1730 days after the date upon which payments out of the Second 18Injury Fund have begun as provided in the award, and every 19month thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Comptroller 20a voucher for payment for all compensation accrued to that 21date at the rate fixed by the Commission. The State 22Comptroller shall draw a warrant to the injured employee along 23with a receipt to be executed by the injured employee and 24returned to the Commission. The endorsed warrant and receipt 25is a full and complete acquittance to the Commission for the 26payment out of the Second Injury Fund. No other appropriation   HB1258- 31 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1or warrant is necessary for payment out of the Second Injury 2Fund. The Second Injury Fund is appropriated for the purpose 3of making payments according to the terms of the awards.4    As of July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1982, all claims against and 5obligations of the Second Injury Fund shall become claims 6against and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund to the 7extent there is insufficient money in the Second Injury Fund 8to pay such claims and obligations. In that case, all 9references to "Second Injury Fund" in this Section shall also 10include the Rate Adjustment Fund.11    (g) Every award for permanent total disability entered by 12the Commission on and after July 1, 1965 under which 13compensation payments shall become due and payable after the 14effective date of this amendatory Act, and every award for 15death benefits or permanent total disability entered by the 16Commission on and after the effective date of this amendatory 17Act shall be subject to annual adjustments as to the amount of 18the compensation rate therein provided. Such adjustments shall 19first be made on July 15, 1977, and all awards made and entered 20prior to July 1, 1975 and on July 15 of each year thereafter. 21In all other cases such adjustment shall be made on July 15 of 22the second year next following the date of the entry of the 23award and shall further be made on July 15 annually 24thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of 25the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there 26shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage   HB1258- 32 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 2the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately 3increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase 4in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under 5the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the 6compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring 7the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the 8prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment 9is made. Such increase shall be paid in the same manner as 10herein provided for payments under the Second Injury Fund to 11the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, 12out of the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of 13Section 7 of this Act. Payments shall be made at the same 14intervals as provided in the award or, at the option of the 15Commission, may be made in quarterly payment on the 15th day of 16January, April, July and October of each year. In the event of 17a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change 18in the then existing compensation rate. The within paragraph 19shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and 20in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer 21and the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may 22be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' 23Compensation Commission.24    Provided, that in cases of awards entered by the 25Commission for injuries occurring before July 1, 1975, the 26increases in the compensation rate adjusted under the   HB1258- 33 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1foregoing provision of this paragraph (g) shall be limited to 2increases in the State's average weekly wage in covered 3industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act occurring 4after July 1, 1975.5    For every accident occurring on or after July 20, 2005 but 6before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 7General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General 8Assembly), the annual adjustments to the compensation rate in 9awards for death benefits or permanent total disability, as 10provided in this Act, shall be paid by the employer. The 11adjustment shall be made by the employer on July 15 of the 12second year next following the date of the entry of the award 13and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If 14during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the 15award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been 16an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 17industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the employer 18shall increase the weekly compensation rate proportionately by 19the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the 20State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the 21Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation 22rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total 23compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing 24maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. In 25the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall 26be no change in the then existing compensation rate. Such   HB1258- 34 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1increase shall be paid by the employer in the same manner and 2at the same intervals as the payment of compensation in the 3award. This paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is 4disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum 5settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or 6his or her dependents, as the case may be, has been duly 7approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.8    The annual adjustments for every award of death benefits 9or permanent total disability involving accidents occurring 10before July 20, 2005 and accidents occurring on or after the 11effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General 12Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly) shall 13continue to be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund pursuant to 14this paragraph and Section 7(f) of this Act. 15    (h) In case death occurs from any cause before the total 16compensation to which the employee would have been entitled 17has been paid, then in case the employee leaves any widow, 18widower, child, parent (or any grandchild, grandparent or 19other lineal heir or any collateral heir dependent at the time 20of the accident upon the earnings of the employee to the extent 21of 50% or more of total dependency) such compensation shall be 22paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased employee and 23distributed as provided in paragraph (g) of Section 7.24    (h-1) In case an injured employee is under legal 25disability at the time when any right or privilege accrues to 26him or her under this Act, a guardian may be appointed pursuant   HB1258- 35 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1to law, and may, on behalf of such person under legal 2disability, claim and exercise any such right or privilege 3with the same effect as if the employee himself or herself had 4claimed or exercised the right or privilege. No limitations of 5time provided by this Act run so long as the employee who is 6under legal disability is without a conservator or guardian.7    (i) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age 8at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the 9amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 10(e) and (f) of this Section is increased 50%.11    However, where an employer has on file an employment 12certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law of 2024 or 13work permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor 14Standards Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and 15duly issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is 16conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor 17employee for the purposes of this Section.18    Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions 19of the Child Labor Law of 2024 relating to the employment of 20minors under the age of 16 years.21    (j) 1. In the event the injured employee receives 22benefits, including medical, surgical or hospital benefits 23under any group plan covering non-occupational disabilities 24contributed to wholly or partially by the employer, which 25benefits should not have been payable if any rights of 26recovery existed under this Act, then such amounts so paid to   HB1258- 36 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1the employee from any such group plan as shall be consistent 2with, and limited to, the provisions of paragraph 2 hereof, 3shall be credited to or against any compensation payment for 4temporary total incapacity for work or any medical, surgical 5or hospital benefits made or to be made under this Act. In such 6event, the period of time for giving notice of accidental 7injury and filing application for adjustment of claim does not 8commence to run until the termination of such payments. This 9paragraph does not apply to payments made under any group plan 10which would have been payable irrespective of an accidental 11injury under this Act. Any employer receiving such credit 12shall keep such employee safe and harmless from any and all 13claims or liabilities that may be made against him by reason of 14having received such payments only to the extent of such 15credit.16    Any excess benefits paid to or on behalf of a State 17employee by the State Employees' Retirement System under 18Article 14 of the Illinois Pension Code on a death claim or 19disputed disability claim shall be credited against any 20payments made or to be made by the State of Illinois to or on 21behalf of such employee under this Act, except for payments 22for medical expenses which have already been incurred at the 23time of the award. The State of Illinois shall directly 24reimburse the State Employees' Retirement System to the extent 25of such credit.26    2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to   HB1258- 37 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1give the employer or the insurance carrier the right to credit 2for any benefits or payments received by the employee other 3than compensation payments provided by this Act, and where the 4employee receives payments other than compensation payments, 5whether as full or partial salary, group insurance benefits, 6bonuses, annuities or any other payments, the employer or 7insurance carrier shall receive credit for each such payment 8only to the extent of the compensation that would have been 9payable during the period covered by such payment.10    3. The extension of time for the filing of an Application 11for Adjustment of Claim as provided in paragraph 1 above shall 12not apply to those cases where the time for such filing had 13expired prior to the date on which payments or benefits 14enumerated herein have been initiated or resumed. Provided 15however that this paragraph 3 shall apply only to cases 16wherein the payments or benefits hereinabove enumerated shall 17be received after July 1, 1969.18(Source: P.A. 103-721, eff. 1-1-25.) 19    Section 99.

Effective immediately.LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b  A BILL FOR HB1258LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1    AN ACT concerning employment. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Workers' Compensation Act is amended by 5changing Section 8 as follows: 6    (820 ILCS 305/8)  (from Ch. 48, par. 138.8)7    Sec. 8. The amount of compensation which shall be paid to 8the employee for an accidental injury not resulting in death 9is:10    (a) The employer shall provide and pay the negotiated 11rate, if applicable, or the lesser of the health care 12provider's actual charges or according to a fee schedule, 13subject to Section 8.2, in effect at the time the service was 14rendered for all the necessary first aid, medical and surgical 15services, and all necessary medical, surgical and hospital 16services thereafter incurred, limited, however, to that which 17is reasonably required to cure or relieve from the effects of 18the accidental injury, even if a health care provider sells, 19transfers, or otherwise assigns an account receivable for 20procedures, treatments, or services covered under this Act. If 21the employer does not dispute payment of first aid, medical, 22surgical, and hospital services, the employer shall make such 23payment to the provider on behalf of the employee. The   HB1258- 2 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1employer shall also pay for treatment, instruction and 2training necessary for the physical, mental and vocational 3rehabilitation of the employee, including all maintenance 4costs and expenses incidental thereto. If as a result of the 5injury the employee is unable to be self-sufficient the 6employer shall further pay for such maintenance or 7institutional care as shall be required.8    The employee may at any time elect to secure his own 9physician, surgeon and hospital services at the employer's 10expense, or, 11    Upon agreement between the employer and the employees, or 12the employees' exclusive representative, and subject to the 13approval of the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the 14employer shall maintain a list of physicians, to be known as a 15Panel of Physicians, who are accessible to the employees. The 16employer shall post this list in a place or places easily 17accessible to his employees. The employee shall have the right 18to make an alternative choice of physician from such Panel if 19he is not satisfied with the physician first selected. If, due 20to the nature of the injury or its occurrence away from the 21employer's place of business, the employee is unable to make a 22selection from the Panel, the selection process from the Panel 23shall not apply. The physician selected from the Panel may 24arrange for any consultation, referral or other specialized 25medical services outside the Panel at the employer's expense. 26Provided that, in the event the Commission shall find that a   HB1258- 3 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1doctor selected by the employee is rendering improper or 2inadequate care, the Commission may order the employee to 3select another doctor certified or qualified in the medical 4field for which treatment is required. If the employee refuses 5to make such change the Commission may relieve the employer of 6his obligation to pay the doctor's charges from the date of 7refusal to the date of compliance.8    Any vocational rehabilitation counselors who provide 9service under this Act shall have appropriate certifications 10which designate the counselor as qualified to render opinions 11relating to vocational rehabilitation. Vocational 12rehabilitation may include, but is not limited to, counseling 13for job searches, supervising a job search program, and 14vocational retraining including education at an accredited 15learning institution. The employee or employer may petition to 16the Commission to decide disputes relating to vocational 17rehabilitation and the Commission shall resolve any such 18dispute, including payment of the vocational rehabilitation 19program by the employer.20    The maintenance benefit shall not be less than the 21temporary total disability rate determined for the employee. 22In addition, maintenance shall include costs and expenses 23incidental to the vocational rehabilitation program.24    When the employee is working light duty on a part-time 25basis or full-time basis and earns less than he or she would be 26earning if employed in the full capacity of the job or jobs,   HB1258- 4 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1then the employee shall be entitled to temporary partial 2disability benefits. Temporary partial disability benefits 3shall be equal to two-thirds of the difference between the 4average amount that the employee would be able to earn in the 5full performance of his or her duties in the occupation in 6which he or she was engaged at the time of accident and the 7gross amount which he or she is earning in the modified job 8provided to the employee by the employer or in any other job 9that the employee is working.10    Every hospital, physician, surgeon or other person 11rendering treatment or services in accordance with the 12provisions of this Section shall upon written request furnish 13full and complete reports thereof to, and permit their records 14to be copied by, the employer, the employee or his dependents, 15as the case may be, or any other party to any proceeding for 16compensation before the Commission, or their attorneys.17    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the employer's liability to 18pay for such medical services selected by the employee shall 19be limited to:20        (1) all first aid and emergency treatment; plus21        (2) all medical, surgical and hospital services 22    provided by the physician, surgeon or hospital initially 23    chosen by the employee or by any other physician, 24    consultant, expert, institution or other provider of 25    services recommended by said initial service provider or 26    any subsequent provider of medical services in the chain   HB1258- 5 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1    of referrals from said initial service provider; plus2        (3) all medical, surgical and hospital services 3    provided by any second physician, surgeon or hospital 4    subsequently chosen by the employee or by any other 5    physician, consultant, expert, institution or other 6    provider of services recommended by said second service 7    provider or any subsequent provider of medical services in 8    the chain of referrals from said second service provider. 9    Thereafter the employer shall select and pay for all 10    necessary medical, surgical and hospital treatment and the 11    employee may not select a provider of medical services at 12    the employer's expense unless the employer agrees to such 13    selection. At any time the employee may obtain any medical 14    treatment he desires at his own expense. This paragraph 15    shall not affect the duty to pay for rehabilitation 16    referred to above.17        (4) The following shall apply for injuries occurring 18    on or after June 28, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 19    97-18) and only when an employer has an approved preferred 20    provider program pursuant to Section 8.1a on the date the 21    employee sustained his or her accidental injuries:22            (A) The employer shall, in writing, on a form 23        promulgated by the Commission, inform the employee of 24        the preferred provider program;25            (B) Subsequent to the report of an injury by an 26        employee, the employee may choose in writing at any   HB1258- 6 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1        time to decline the preferred provider program, in 2        which case that would constitute one of the two 3        choices of medical providers to which the employee is 4        entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3); and5            (C) Prior to the report of an injury by an 6        employee, when an employee chooses non-emergency 7        treatment from a provider not within the preferred 8        provider program, that would constitute the employee's 9        one choice of medical providers to which the employee 10        is entitled under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3). 11    When an employer and employee so agree in writing, nothing 12in this Act prevents an employee whose injury or disability 13has been established under this Act, from relying in good 14faith, on treatment by prayer or spiritual means alone, in 15accordance with the tenets and practice of a recognized church 16or religious denomination, by a duly accredited practitioner 17thereof, and having nursing services appropriate therewith, 18without suffering loss or diminution of the compensation 19benefits under this Act. However, the employee shall submit to 20all physical examinations required by this Act. The cost of 21such treatment and nursing care shall be paid by the employee 22unless the employer agrees to make such payment.23    Where the accidental injury results in the amputation of 24an arm, hand, leg or foot, or the enucleation of an eye, or the 25loss of any of the natural teeth, the employer shall furnish an 26artificial of any such members lost or damaged in accidental   HB1258- 7 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1injury arising out of and in the course of employment, and 2shall also furnish the necessary braces in all proper and 3necessary cases. In cases of the loss of a member or members by 4amputation, the employer shall, whenever necessary, maintain 5in good repair, refit or replace the artificial limbs during 6the lifetime of the employee. Where the accidental injury 7accompanied by physical injury results in damage to a denture, 8eye glasses or contact eye lenses, or where the accidental 9injury results in damage to an artificial member, the employer 10shall replace or repair such denture, glasses, lenses, or 11artificial member.12    The furnishing by the employer of any such services or 13appliances is not an admission of liability on the part of the 14employer to pay compensation.15    The furnishing of any such services or appliances or the 16servicing thereof by the employer is not the payment of 17compensation.18    (b) If the period of temporary total incapacity for work 19lasts more than 3 working days, weekly compensation as 20hereinafter provided shall be paid beginning on the 4th day of 21such temporary total incapacity and continuing as long as the 22total temporary incapacity lasts. In cases where the temporary 23total incapacity for work continues for a period of 14 days or 24more from the day of the accident compensation shall commence 25on the day after the accident.26        1.

This percentage 25    rate shall be increased by 10% for each spouse and child, 26    not to exceed 100% of the total minimum wage calculation,   HB1258- 9 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1    nor exceed the employee's average weekly wage computed in 2    accordance with the provisions of Section 10, whichever is 3    less.4        2.1.

Testicle-6            50 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 7        after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 8        94th General Assembly but before February 1, 2006. 9            54 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 10        after February 1, 2006. 11        Both testicles-12            150 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 13        after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 14        94th General Assembly but before February 1, 2006. 15            162 weeks if the accidental injury occurs on or 16        after February 1, 2006.17        16. For the permanent partial loss of use of a member 18    or sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, compensation 19    during that proportion of the number of weeks in the 20    foregoing schedule provided for the loss of such member or 21    sight of an eye, or hearing of an ear, which the partial 22    loss of use thereof bears to the total loss of use of such 23    member, or sight of eye, or hearing of an ear.24            (a) Loss of hearing for compensation purposes 25        shall be confined to the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 26        and 3,000 cycles per second. Loss of hearing ability   HB1258- 24 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1        for frequency tones above 3,000 cycles per second are 2        not to be considered as constituting disability for 3        hearing.4            (b) The percent of hearing loss, for purposes of 5        the determination of compensation claims for 6        occupational deafness, shall be calculated as the 7        average in decibels for the thresholds of hearing for 8        the frequencies of 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 cycles per 9        second. Pure tone air conduction audiometric 10        instruments, approved by nationally recognized 11        authorities in this field, shall be used for measuring 12        hearing loss. If the losses of hearing average 30 13        decibels or less in the 3 frequencies, such losses of 14        hearing shall not then constitute any compensable 15        hearing disability. If the losses of hearing average 16        85 decibels or more in the 3 frequencies, then the same 17        shall constitute and be total or 100% compensable 18        hearing loss.19            (c) In measuring hearing impairment, the lowest 20        measured losses in each of the 3 frequencies shall be 21        added together and divided by 3 to determine the 22        average decibel loss. For every decibel of loss 23        exceeding 30 decibels an allowance of 1.82% shall be 24        made up to the maximum of 100% which is reached at 85 25        decibels.26            (d) If a hearing loss is established to have   HB1258- 25 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1        existed on July 1, 1975 by audiometric testing the 2        employer shall not be liable for the previous loss so 3        established nor shall he be liable for any loss for 4        which compensation has been paid or awarded.5            (e) No consideration shall be given to the 6        question of whether or not the ability of an employee 7        to understand speech is improved by the use of a 8        hearing aid.9            (f) No claim for loss of hearing due to industrial 10        noise shall be brought against an employer or allowed 11        unless the employee has been exposed for a period of 12        time sufficient to cause permanent impairment to noise 13        levels in excess of the following: 14Sound Level DBA15Slow ResponseHours Per Day16908179261895419973201002211021-1/2221051231101/2241151/425        This subparagraph (f) shall not be applied in cases of 26    hearing loss resulting from trauma or explosion.  HB1258- 26 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1        17. In computing the compensation to be paid to any 2    employee who, before the accident for which he claims 3    compensation, had before that time sustained an injury 4    resulting in the loss by amputation or partial loss by 5    amputation of any member, including hand, arm, thumb or 6    fingers, leg, foot or any toes, such loss or partial loss 7    of any such member shall be deducted from any award made 8    for the subsequent injury. For the permanent loss of use 9    or the permanent partial loss of use of any such member or 10    the partial loss of sight of an eye, for which 11    compensation has been paid, then such loss shall be taken 12    into consideration and deducted from any award for the 13    subsequent injury.14        18. The specific case of loss of both hands, both 15    arms, or both feet, or both legs, or both eyes, or of any 16    two thereof, or the permanent and complete loss of the use 17    thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability, to be 18    compensated according to the compensation fixed by 19    paragraph (f) of this Section. These specific cases of 20    total and permanent disability do not exclude other cases.21        Any employee who has previously suffered the loss or 22    permanent and complete loss of the use of any of such 23    members, and in a subsequent independent accident loses 24    another or suffers the permanent and complete loss of the 25    use of any one of such members the employer for whom the 26    injured employee is working at the time of the last   HB1258- 27 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1    independent accident is liable to pay compensation only 2    for the loss or permanent and complete loss of the use of 3    the member occasioned by the last independent accident.4        19. In a case of specific loss and the subsequent 5    death of such injured employee from other causes than such 6    injury leaving a widow, widower, or dependents surviving 7    before payment or payment in full for such injury, then 8    the amount due for such injury is payable to the widow or 9    widower and, if there be no widow or widower, then to such 10    dependents, in the proportion which such dependency bears 11    to total dependency.12    Beginning July 1, 1980, and every 6 months thereafter, the 13Commission shall examine the Second Injury Fund and when, 14after deducting all advances or loans made to such Fund, the 15amount therein is $500,000 then the amount required to be paid 16by employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 17reduced by one-half. When the Second Injury Fund reaches the 18sum of $600,000 then the payments shall cease entirely. 19However, when the Second Injury Fund has been reduced to 20$400,000, payment of one-half of the amounts required by 21paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 22herein provided, and when the Second Injury Fund has been 23reduced to $300,000, payment of the full amounts required by 24paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be resumed, in the manner 25herein provided. The Commission shall make the changes in 26payment effective by general order, and the changes in payment   HB1258- 28 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1become immediately effective for all cases coming before the 2Commission thereafter either by settlement agreement or final 3order, irrespective of the date of the accidental injury.4    On August 1, 1996 and on February 1 and August 1 of each 5subsequent year, the Commission shall examine the special fund 6designated as the "Rate Adjustment Fund" and when, after 7deducting all advances or loans made to said fund, the amount 8therein is $4,000,000, the amount required to be paid by 9employers pursuant to paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be 10reduced by one-half. When the Rate Adjustment Fund reaches the 11sum of $5,000,000 the payment therein shall cease entirely. 12However, when said Rate Adjustment Fund has been reduced to 13$3,000,000 the amounts required by paragraph (f) of Section 7 14shall be resumed in the manner herein provided.15    (f) In case of complete disability, which renders the 16employee wholly and permanently incapable of work, or in the 17specific case of total and permanent disability as provided in 18subparagraph 18 of paragraph (e) of this Section, compensation 19shall be payable at the rate provided in subparagraph 2 of 20paragraph (b) of this Section for life.21    An employee entitled to benefits under paragraph (f) of 22this Section shall also be entitled to receive from the Rate 23Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of Section 7 of the 24supplementary benefits provided in paragraph (g) of this 25Section 8.26    If any employee who receives an award under this paragraph   HB1258- 29 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1afterwards returns to work or is able to do so, and earns or is 2able to earn as much as before the accident, payments under 3such award shall cease. If such employee returns to work, or is 4able to do so, and earns or is able to earn part but not as 5much as before the accident, such award shall be modified so as 6to conform to an award under paragraph (d) of this Section. If 7such award is terminated or reduced under the provisions of 8this paragraph, such employees have the right at any time 9within 30 months after the date of such termination or 10reduction to file petition with the Commission for the purpose 11of determining whether any disability exists as a result of 12the original accidental injury and the extent thereof.13    Disability as enumerated in subdivision 18, paragraph (e) 14of this Section is considered complete disability.15    If an employee who had previously incurred loss or the 16permanent and complete loss of use of one member, through the 17loss or the permanent and complete loss of the use of one hand, 18one arm, one foot, one leg, or one eye, incurs permanent and 19complete disability through the loss or the permanent and 20complete loss of the use of another member, he shall receive, 21in addition to the compensation payable by the employer and 22after such payments have ceased, an amount from the Second 23Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of Section 7, which, 24together with the compensation payable from the employer in 25whose employ he was when the last accidental injury was 26incurred, will equal the amount payable for permanent and   HB1258- 30 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1complete disability as provided in this paragraph of this 2Section.3    The custodian of the Second Injury Fund provided for in 4paragraph (f) of Section 7 shall be joined with the employer as 5a party respondent in the application for adjustment of claim. 6The application for adjustment of claim shall state briefly 7and in general terms the approximate time and place and manner 8of the loss of the first member.9    In its award the Commission or the Arbitrator shall 10specifically find the amount the injured employee shall be 11weekly paid, the number of weeks compensation which shall be 12paid by the employer, the date upon which payments begin out of 13the Second Injury Fund provided for in paragraph (f) of 14Section 7 of this Act, the length of time the weekly payments 15continue, the date upon which the pension payments commence 16and the monthly amount of the payments. The Commission shall 1730 days after the date upon which payments out of the Second 18Injury Fund have begun as provided in the award, and every 19month thereafter, prepare and submit to the State Comptroller 20a voucher for payment for all compensation accrued to that 21date at the rate fixed by the Commission. The State 22Comptroller shall draw a warrant to the injured employee along 23with a receipt to be executed by the injured employee and 24returned to the Commission. The endorsed warrant and receipt 25is a full and complete acquittance to the Commission for the 26payment out of the Second Injury Fund. No other appropriation   HB1258- 31 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1or warrant is necessary for payment out of the Second Injury 2Fund. The Second Injury Fund is appropriated for the purpose 3of making payments according to the terms of the awards.4    As of July 1, 1980 to July 1, 1982, all claims against and 5obligations of the Second Injury Fund shall become claims 6against and obligations of the Rate Adjustment Fund to the 7extent there is insufficient money in the Second Injury Fund 8to pay such claims and obligations. In that case, all 9references to "Second Injury Fund" in this Section shall also 10include the Rate Adjustment Fund.11    (g) Every award for permanent total disability entered by 12the Commission on and after July 1, 1965 under which 13compensation payments shall become due and payable after the 14effective date of this amendatory Act, and every award for 15death benefits or permanent total disability entered by the 16Commission on and after the effective date of this amendatory 17Act shall be subject to annual adjustments as to the amount of 18the compensation rate therein provided. Such adjustments shall 19first be made on July 15, 1977, and all awards made and entered 20prior to July 1, 1975 and on July 15 of each year thereafter. 21In all other cases such adjustment shall be made on July 15 of 22the second year next following the date of the entry of the 23award and shall further be made on July 15 annually 24thereafter. If during the intervening period from the date of 25the entry of the award, or the last periodic adjustment, there 26shall have been an increase in the State's average weekly wage   HB1258- 32 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1in covered industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, 2the weekly compensation rate shall be proportionately 3increased by the same percentage as the percentage of increase 4in the State's average weekly wage in covered industries under 5the Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the 6compensation rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring 7the total compensation rate to an amount greater than the 8prevailing maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment 9is made. Such increase shall be paid in the same manner as 10herein provided for payments under the Second Injury Fund to 11the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may be, 12out of the Rate Adjustment Fund provided in paragraph (f) of 13Section 7 of this Act. Payments shall be made at the same 14intervals as provided in the award or, at the option of the 15Commission, may be made in quarterly payment on the 15th day of 16January, April, July and October of each year. In the event of 17a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall be no change 18in the then existing compensation rate. The within paragraph 19shall not apply to cases where there is disputed liability and 20in which a compromise lump sum settlement between the employer 21and the injured employee, or his dependents, as the case may 22be, has been duly approved by the Illinois Workers' 23Compensation Commission.24    Provided, that in cases of awards entered by the 25Commission for injuries occurring before July 1, 1975, the 26increases in the compensation rate adjusted under the   HB1258- 33 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1foregoing provision of this paragraph (g) shall be limited to 2increases in the State's average weekly wage in covered 3industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act occurring 4after July 1, 1975.5    For every accident occurring on or after July 20, 2005 but 6before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th 7General Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General 8Assembly), the annual adjustments to the compensation rate in 9awards for death benefits or permanent total disability, as 10provided in this Act, shall be paid by the employer. The 11adjustment shall be made by the employer on July 15 of the 12second year next following the date of the entry of the award 13and shall further be made on July 15 annually thereafter. If 14during the intervening period from the date of the entry of the 15award, or the last periodic adjustment, there shall have been 16an increase in the State's average weekly wage in covered 17industries under the Unemployment Insurance Act, the employer 18shall increase the weekly compensation rate proportionately by 19the same percentage as the percentage of increase in the 20State's average weekly wage in covered industries under the 21Unemployment Insurance Act. The increase in the compensation 22rate under this paragraph shall in no event bring the total 23compensation rate to an amount greater than the prevailing 24maximum rate at the time that the annual adjustment is made. In 25the event of a decrease in such average weekly wage there shall 26be no change in the then existing compensation rate. Such   HB1258- 34 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1increase shall be paid by the employer in the same manner and 2at the same intervals as the payment of compensation in the 3award. This paragraph shall not apply to cases where there is 4disputed liability and in which a compromise lump sum 5settlement between the employer and the injured employee, or 6his or her dependents, as the case may be, has been duly 7approved by the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission.8    The annual adjustments for every award of death benefits 9or permanent total disability involving accidents occurring 10before July 20, 2005 and accidents occurring on or after the 11effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General 12Assembly (Senate Bill 1283 of the 94th General Assembly) shall 13continue to be paid from the Rate Adjustment Fund pursuant to 14this paragraph and Section 7(f) of this Act. 15    (h) In case death occurs from any cause before the total 16compensation to which the employee would have been entitled 17has been paid, then in case the employee leaves any widow, 18widower, child, parent (or any grandchild, grandparent or 19other lineal heir or any collateral heir dependent at the time 20of the accident upon the earnings of the employee to the extent 21of 50% or more of total dependency) such compensation shall be 22paid to the beneficiaries of the deceased employee and 23distributed as provided in paragraph (g) of Section 7.24    (h-1) In case an injured employee is under legal 25disability at the time when any right or privilege accrues to 26him or her under this Act, a guardian may be appointed pursuant   HB1258- 35 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1to law, and may, on behalf of such person under legal 2disability, claim and exercise any such right or privilege 3with the same effect as if the employee himself or herself had 4claimed or exercised the right or privilege. No limitations of 5time provided by this Act run so long as the employee who is 6under legal disability is without a conservator or guardian.7    (i) In case the injured employee is under 16 years of age 8at the time of the accident and is illegally employed, the 9amount of compensation payable under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), 10(e) and (f) of this Section is increased 50%.11    However, where an employer has on file an employment 12certificate issued pursuant to the Child Labor Law of 2024 or 13work permit issued pursuant to the Federal Fair Labor 14Standards Act, as amended, or a birth certificate properly and 15duly issued, such certificate, permit or birth certificate is 16conclusive evidence as to the age of the injured minor 17employee for the purposes of this Section.18    Nothing herein contained repeals or amends the provisions 19of the Child Labor Law of 2024 relating to the employment of 20minors under the age of 16 years.21    (j) 1. In the event the injured employee receives 22benefits, including medical, surgical or hospital benefits 23under any group plan covering non-occupational disabilities 24contributed to wholly or partially by the employer, which 25benefits should not have been payable if any rights of 26recovery existed under this Act, then such amounts so paid to   HB1258- 36 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1the employee from any such group plan as shall be consistent 2with, and limited to, the provisions of paragraph 2 hereof, 3shall be credited to or against any compensation payment for 4temporary total incapacity for work or any medical, surgical 5or hospital benefits made or to be made under this Act. In such 6event, the period of time for giving notice of accidental 7injury and filing application for adjustment of claim does not 8commence to run until the termination of such payments. This 9paragraph does not apply to payments made under any group plan 10which would have been payable irrespective of an accidental 11injury under this Act. Any employer receiving such credit 12shall keep such employee safe and harmless from any and all 13claims or liabilities that may be made against him by reason of 14having received such payments only to the extent of such 15credit.16    Any excess benefits paid to or on behalf of a State 17employee by the State Employees' Retirement System under 18Article 14 of the Illinois Pension Code on a death claim or 19disputed disability claim shall be credited against any 20payments made or to be made by the State of Illinois to or on 21behalf of such employee under this Act, except for payments 22for medical expenses which have already been incurred at the 23time of the award. The State of Illinois shall directly 24reimburse the State Employees' Retirement System to the extent 25of such credit.26    2. Nothing contained in this Act shall be construed to   HB1258- 37 -LRB104 03227 SPS 13249 b1give the employer or the insurance carrier the right to credit 2for any benefits or payments received by the employee other 3than compensation payments provided by this Act, and where the 4employee receives payments other than compensation payments, 5whether as full or partial salary, group insurance benefits, 6bonuses, annuities or any other payments, the employer or 7insurance carrier shall receive credit for each such payment 8only to the extent of the compensation that would have been 9payable during the period covered by such payment.10    3. The extension of time for the filing of an Application 11for Adjustment of Claim as provided in paragraph 1 above shall 12not apply to those cases where the time for such filing had 13expired prior to the date on which payments or benefits 14enumerated herein have been initiated or resumed. Provided 15however that this paragraph 3 shall apply only to cases 16wherein the payments or benefits hereinabove enumerated shall 17be received after July 1, 1969.18(Source: P.A. 103-721, eff. 1-1-25.) 19    Section 99.
