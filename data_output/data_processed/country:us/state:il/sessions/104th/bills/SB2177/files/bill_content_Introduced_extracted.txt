However, this paragraph subdivision (p) shall not 3    be construed so as to permit a licensed clinical social 4    worker to conduct any medical diagnosis to determine 5    mental illness or mental impairment.6        (q) (Blank).7        (r) The child is in the temporary custody or 8    guardianship of the Department of Children and Family 9    Services, the parent is incarcerated as a result of 10    criminal conviction at the time the petition or motion for 11    termination of parental rights is filed, prior to 12    incarceration the parent had little or no contact with the 13    child or provided little or no support for the child, and 14    the parent's incarceration will prevent the parent from 15    discharging his or her parental responsibilities for the 16    child for a period in excess of 2 years after the filing of 17    the petition or motion for termination of parental rights.18        (s) The child is in the temporary custody or 19    guardianship of the Department of Children and Family 20    Services, the parent is incarcerated at the time the 21    petition or motion for termination of parental rights is 22    filed, the parent has been repeatedly incarcerated as a 23    result of criminal convictions, and the parent's repeated 24    incarceration has prevented the parent from discharging 25    his or her parental responsibilities for the child.26        (t) (Blank).  SB2177- 12 -LRB104 10758 JRC 20837 b1    E.
