The defendant shall have the 6    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 7    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 8    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 9    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 10    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 11    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 12    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 13    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 14    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 15    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 16    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 17    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 18        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 19    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 20    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 21    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 22    court determines that the physical health and safety of 23    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 24    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 25    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 26    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such   HB4090- 15 -LRB104 14342 RLC 27475 b1    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 2    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 3    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 4    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 5    Courts every 6 months. 6        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 7    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 8    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 9    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 10    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 11    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 12    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 13    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 14    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 15    the court shall state on the record the reason for 16    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 17    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 18    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 19    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 20    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 21    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 22    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 23    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 24    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 25    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 26    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The   HB4090- 16 -LRB104 14342 RLC 27475 b1    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 2    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 3    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 4    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 5    criminal history, if available, and any written or 6    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 7    statements made by any person, if in the State's 8    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 9        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 10    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 11    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 12    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 13    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 14    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 15    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 16    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 17    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.18        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 19    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 20    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 21    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 22    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 23    the defendant.24        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 25    release, and detention prior to trial must be 26    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be   HB4090- 17 -LRB104 14342 RLC 27475 b1    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 2    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 3    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 4dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 5defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 6person or persons or the community, based on the specific 7articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 8limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:9        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 10    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 11    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.12        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 13    including:14            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 15        history indicative of violent, abusive, or assaultive 16        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 17        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 18        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 19        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.20            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 21        psychiatric or other similar social history which 22        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 23        nature, or lack of any such history.24        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 25    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 26    nature of the threat.  HB4090- 18 -LRB104 14342 RLC 27475 b1        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 2    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 3    them.4        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.5        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 6    complaining witness. 7        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 8    access to any weapon or weapons.9        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 10    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 11    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release, 12    or other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 13    appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under 14    federal or State state law.15        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 16    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 17    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 18    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 19    or lack of such behavior.20    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 21detention:22        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 23    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 24    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 25    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 26    the safety of any person or persons or the community,   HB4090- 19 -LRB104 14342 RLC 27475 b1    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 2    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;3        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 4    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 5    pending trial;6        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 7    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 8    communication with others of his or her choice by 9    visitation, mail and telephone; and10        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 11    required for appearances in connection with court 12    proceedings.13    (i) Detention.

The Court may deny or 23    grant the request for continuance.

The defendant shall have the 6    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 7    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 8    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 9    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 10    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 11    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 12    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 13    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 14    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 15    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 16    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 17    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 18        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 19    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 20    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 21    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 22    court determines that the physical health and safety of 23    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 24    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 25    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 26    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such   HB4090- 15 -LRB104 14342 RLC 27475 b1    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 2    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 3    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 4    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 5    Courts every 6 months. 6        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 7    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 8    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 9    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 10    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 11    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 12    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 13    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 14    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 15    the court shall state on the record the reason for 16    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 17    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 18    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 19    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 20    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 21    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 22    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 23    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 24    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 25    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 26    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The   HB4090- 16 -LRB104 14342 RLC 27475 b1    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 2    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 3    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 4    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 5    criminal history, if available, and any written or 6    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 7    statements made by any person, if in the State's 8    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 9        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 10    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 11    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 12    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 13    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 14    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 15    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 16    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 17    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.18        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 19    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 20    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 21    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 22    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 23    the defendant.24        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 25    release, and detention prior to trial must be 26    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be   HB4090- 17 -LRB104 14342 RLC 27475 b1    used exclusively to order detention.
