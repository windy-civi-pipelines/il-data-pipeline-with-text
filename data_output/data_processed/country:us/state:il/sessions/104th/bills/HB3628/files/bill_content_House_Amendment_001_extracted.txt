Treatment and prevention strategies, such as 15Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and 16Undetectable=Untransmittable (U=U), are time-tested, 17science-based interventions that prevent new HIV diagnoses. 18Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a prevention strategy that   10400HB3628ham001- 2 -LRB104 09750 BDA 23428 a1involves sexually active HIV-negative adults and adolescents 2taking prescription medications to prevent HIV acquisition. 3PrEP is 99% effective in preventing HIV when taken as 4prescribed.
