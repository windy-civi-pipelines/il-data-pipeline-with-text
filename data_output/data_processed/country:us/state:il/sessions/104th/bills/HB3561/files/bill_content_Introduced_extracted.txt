Dagmara Avelar SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: See Index    Amends the Illinois Insurance Code. Requires a group or individual policy of accident and health insurance or a managed care plan to provide coverage for at least one early egg allergen introduction dietary supplement and one early peanut allergen introduction dietary supplement. Provides that the required coverage shall be provided at no cost to a covered individual, including deductible payments and cost-sharing amounts charged once a deductible is met. Except as otherwise provided, nothing in the provisions prevents the operation of such a policy provision as a deductible, coinsurance, allowable charge limitation, coordination of benefits, or a provision restricting coverage to services by a licensed, certified, or carrier-approved provider or facility. Provides that the required coverage does not apply to accident-only, specified disease, hospital indemnity, Medicare supplement, long-term care, disability income, or other limited benefit health insurance policies, and that the cost-sharing limitation does not apply to a catastrophic health plan to the extent the cost-sharing limitation would cause the plan to fail to be treated as a catastrophic plan under federal law. Provides that the cost-sharing limitation does not apply to a high deductible health plan to the extent this cost-sharing limitation would cause the plan to fail to be treated as a high deductible health plan under specified provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Provides that, if the cost-sharing limitation would result in an enrollee becoming ineligible for a health savings account under federal law, the cost-sharing limitation only applies to a qualified high deductible health plan after the enrollee's deductible has been met. Amends the State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971, the Counties Code, the Illinois Municipal Code, the School Code, the Health Maintenance Organization Act, the Limited Health Service Organization Act, the Voluntary Health Services Plans Act, and the Illinois Public Aid Code to require coverage under those provisions.LRB104 10745 BAB 20824 b  A BILL FOR HB3561LRB104 10745 BAB 20824 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5.

Full Text of HB3561 ILGA.GOV HB3561 - 104th General Assembly 104TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY State of Illinois 2025 and 2026HB3561 Introduced 2/18/2025, by Rep. Dagmara Avelar SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: See Index    Amends the Illinois Insurance Code. Requires a group or individual policy of accident and health insurance or a managed care plan to provide coverage for at least one early egg allergen introduction dietary supplement and one early peanut allergen introduction dietary supplement. Provides that the required coverage shall be provided at no cost to a covered individual, including deductible payments and cost-sharing amounts charged once a deductible is met. Except as otherwise provided, nothing in the provisions prevents the operation of such a policy provision as a deductible, coinsurance, allowable charge limitation, coordination of benefits, or a provision restricting coverage to services by a licensed, certified, or carrier-approved provider or facility. Provides that the required coverage does not apply to accident-only, specified disease, hospital indemnity, Medicare supplement, long-term care, disability income, or other limited benefit health insurance policies, and that the cost-sharing limitation does not apply to a catastrophic health plan to the extent the cost-sharing limitation would cause the plan to fail to be treated as a catastrophic plan under federal law. Provides that the cost-sharing limitation does not apply to a high deductible health plan to the extent this cost-sharing limitation would cause the plan to fail to be treated as a high deductible health plan under specified provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Provides that, if the cost-sharing limitation would result in an enrollee becoming ineligible for a health savings account under federal law, the cost-sharing limitation only applies to a qualified high deductible health plan after the enrollee's deductible has been met. Amends the State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971, the Counties Code, the Illinois Municipal Code, the School Code, the Health Maintenance Organization Act, the Limited Health Service Organization Act, the Voluntary Health Services Plans Act, and the Illinois Public Aid Code to require coverage under those provisions.LRB104 10745 BAB 20824 b  A BILL FOR HB3561LRB104 10745 BAB 20824 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5.
