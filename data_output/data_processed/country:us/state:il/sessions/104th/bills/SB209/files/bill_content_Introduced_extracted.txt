State Licensing Boards that participate in this 8Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose Adverse Action 9against a Compact Privilege in that State issued to a PA 10through the procedures of this Compact.

The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law 9in each Participating State, provided however that where the 10Rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the 11Participating State that establish the medical services a PA 12may perform in the Participating State, as held by a court of 13competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be 14ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.15    D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Participating 16States rejects a Commission Rule, by enactment of a statute or 17resolution in the same manner used to adopt this Compact 18within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then 19such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any 20Participating State or to any State applying to participate in 21the Compact.22    E.

All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the 11    recording and the written comments, data, facts, opinions, 12    and arguments received in response to the proposed 13    rulemaking shall be made available to a person upon 14    request.15        4. Nothing in this section shall be construed as 16    requiring a separate hearing on each proposed Rule. 17    Proposed Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the 18    Commission at hearings required by this section.19    J. Following the public hearing, the Commission shall 20consider all written and oral comments timely received.21    K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all 22delegates, take final action on the proposed Rule and shall 23determine the effective date of the Rule, if adopted, based on 24the Rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.25        1. If adopted, the Rule shall be posted on the 26    Commission's website.  SB0209- 31 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1        2. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed 2    Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original 3    purpose of the proposed Rule.4        3. The Commission shall provide on its website an 5    explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to 6    the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive 7    changes not made that were recommended by commenters.8        4. The Commission shall determine a reasonable 9    effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as 10    provided in subsection L, the effective date of the Rule 11    shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days after the 12    Commission issued the notice that it adopted the Rule.13    L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 14Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 15twenty-four (24) hours' prior notice, without the opportunity 16for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking 17procedures provided in this Compact and in this section shall 18be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably 19possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the 20effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this 21provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted 22immediately by the Commission in order to:23        1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, 24    or welfare;25        2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State 26    funds;  SB0209- 32 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1        3.

Public notice of any revisions shall be 10posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be 11subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) 12days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on 13grounds that the revision results in a material change to a 14Rule. A challenge shall be made as set forth in the notice of 15revisions and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of 16the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will 17take effect without further action. If the revision is 18challenged, the revision may not take effect without the 19approval of the Commission.20    N. No Participating State's rulemaking requirements shall 21apply under this Compact. 22    Section 10. Oversight, Dispute Resolution, and Enforcement23    A. Oversight24        1. The executive and judicial branches of State 25    government in each Participating State shall enforce this   SB0209- 33 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1    Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to 2    implement the Compact.3        2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or 4    against the Commission shall be brought solely and 5    exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the 6    principal office of the Commission is located. The 7    Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to 8    the extent it adopts or consents to participate in 9    alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein 10    shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue 11    in any action against a licensee for professional 12    malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.13        3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 14    of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 15    interpretation of the Compact or the Commission's Rules 16    and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding 17    for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission with 18    service of process shall render a judgment or order in 19    such proceeding void as to the Commission, this Compact, 20    or Commission Rules. 21    B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination22        1. If the Commission determines that a Participating 23    State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations 24    or responsibilities under this Compact or the Commission 25    Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the 26    defaulting State and other Participating States. The   SB0209- 34 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1    notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of 2    curing the default and any other action that the 3    Commission may take and shall offer remedial training and 4    specific technical assistance regarding the default.5        2. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the 6    defaulting State may be terminated from this Compact upon 7    an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the 8    Participating States, and all rights, privileges and 9    benefits conferred by this Compact upon such State may be 10    terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of 11    the default does not relieve the offending State of 12    obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of 13    default.14        3. Termination of participation in this Compact shall 15    be imposed only after all other means of securing 16    compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to 17    suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to 18    the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the 19    defaulting State's legislature, and to the Licensing 20    Board(s) of each of the Participating States.21        4.

The defaulting State may appeal its termination 5    from the Compact by the Commission by petitioning the U.S. 6    District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal 7    district where the Commission has its principal offices. 8    The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such 9    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.10        7. Upon the termination of a State's participation in 11    the Compact, the State shall immediately provide notice to 12    all Licensees within that State of such termination: 13            a. Licensees who have been granted a Compact 14        Privilege in that State shall retain the Compact 15        Privilege for one hundred eighty (180) days following 16        the effective date of such termination.17            b. Licensees who are licensed in that State who 18        have been granted a Compact Privilege in a 19        Participating State shall retain the Compact Privilege 20        for one hundred eighty (180) days unless the Licensee 21        also has a Qualifying License in a Participating State 22        or obtains a Qualifying License in a Participating 23        State before the one hundred eighty (180)-day period 24        ends, in which case the Compact Privilege shall 25        continue.26    C. Dispute Resolution  SB0209- 36 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1        1. Upon request by a Participating State, the 2    Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to 3    this Compact that arise among Participating States and 4    between participating and non-Participating States.5        2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing 6    for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for 7    disputes as appropriate.8    D. Enforcement9        1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its 10    discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact 11    and Rules of the Commission.12        2. If compliance is not secured after all means to 13    secure compliance have been exhausted, by majority vote, 14    the Commission may initiate legal action in the United 15    States District Court for the District of Columbia or the 16    federal district where the Commission has its principal 17    offices against a Participating State in default to 18    enforce compliance with the provisions of this Compact and 19    the Commission's promulgated Rules and bylaws. The relief 20    sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In 21    the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the 22    prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 23    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.24        3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive 25    remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any 26    other remedies available under federal or State law.  SB0209- 37 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1    E. Legal Action Against the Commission2        1. A Participating State may initiate legal action 3    against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the 4    District of Columbia or the federal district where the 5    Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance 6    with the provisions of the Compact and its Rules. The 7    relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 8    damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 9    the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 10    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.11        2. No person other than a Participating State shall 12    enforce this Compact against the Commission. 13    Section 11. Date of Implementation of the PA Licensure 14Compact Commission15    A. This Compact shall come into effect on the date on which 16this Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh 17Participating State. 18        1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the 19    Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each 20    of the States that enacted the Compact prior to the 21    Commission convening ("Charter Participating States") to 22    determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter 23    Participating State is materially different than the Model 24    Compact.25            a. A Charter Participating State whose enactment   SB0209- 38 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1        is found to be materially different from the Model 2        Compact shall be entitled to the default process set 3        forth in Section 10.B.4            b. If any Participating State later withdraws from 5        the Compact or its participation is terminated, the 6        Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact 7        shall remain in effect even if the number of 8        Participating States should be less than seven. 9        Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent 10        to the Commission convening shall be subject to the 11        process set forth in Section 7.C.21 to determine if 12        their enactments are materially different from the 13        Model Compact and whether they qualify for 14        participation in the Compact.15        2. Participating States enacting the Compact 16    subsequent to the seven initial Charter Participating 17    States shall be subject to the process set forth in 18    Section 7.C.21 to determine if their enactments are 19    materially different from the Model Compact and whether 20    they qualify for participation in the Compact.21        3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission 22    or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of 23    the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or 24    the Commission coming into existence shall be considered 25    to be actions of the Commission unless specifically 26    repudiated by the Commission.  SB0209- 39 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1    B. Any State that joins this Compact shall be subject to 2the Commission's Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on 3which this Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has 4been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full 5force and effect of law on the day this Compact becomes law in 6that State.7    C. Any Participating State may withdraw from this Compact 8by enacting a statute repealing the same.9        1. A Participating State's withdrawal shall not take 10    effect until one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment 11    of the repealing statute. During this one hundred eighty 12    (180) day-period, all Compact Privileges that were in 13    effect in the withdrawing State and were granted to 14    Licensees licensed in the withdrawing State shall remain 15    in effect. If any Licensee licensed in the withdrawing 16    State is also licensed in another Participating State or 17    obtains a license in another Participating State within 18    the one hundred eighty (180) days, the Licensee's Compact 19    Privileges in other Participating States shall not be 20    affected by the passage of the one hundred eighty (180) 21    days.22        2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing 23    requirement of the State Licensing Board(s) of the 24    withdrawing State to comply with the investigative, and 25    Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact 26    prior to the effective date of withdrawal.  SB0209- 40 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1        3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a State 2    from this Compact, the State shall immediately provide 3    notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees within that 4    State. Such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize 5    all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a 6    minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of 7    such notice of withdrawal.8    D. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to 9invalidate or prevent any PA licensure agreement or other 10cooperative arrangement between Participating States and 11between a Participating State and non-Participating State that 12does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.13    E. This Compact may be amended by the Participating 14States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective 15and binding upon any Participating State until it is enacted 16materially in the same manner into the laws of all 17Participating States as determined by the Commission. 18    Section 12. Construction and Severability19    A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority 20shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes 21and the implementation and administration of the Compact. 22Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring 23the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the 24Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. 25    B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and   SB0209- 41 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact 2is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to 3the constitution of any Participating State, a State seeking 4participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the 5applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or 6circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 7competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this 8Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 9agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. 10    C. Notwithstanding subsection B or this section, the 11Commission may deny a State's participation in the Compact or, 12in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.B, terminate 13a Participating State's participation in the Compact if it 14determines that a constitutional requirement of a 15Participating State is, or would be with respect to a State 16seeking to participate in the Compact, a material departure 17from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to 18be contrary to the constitution of any Participating State, 19the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the 20remaining Participating States and in full force and effect as 21to the Participating State affected as to all severable 22matters. 23    Section 13. Binding Effect of Compact24    A. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other 25law of a Participating State that is not inconsistent with   SB0209- 42 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1this Compact.2    B. Any laws in a Participating State in conflict with this 3Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.4    C. All agreements between the Commission and the 5Participating States are binding in accordance with their 6terms. 7    Section 100.

This Compact allows 20Medical Services to be provided by PAs, via the mutual 21recognition of the Licensee's Qualifying License by other   SB0209- 2 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1Compact Participating States. This Compact also adopts the 2prevailing standard for PA licensure and affirms that the 3practice and delivery of Medical Services by the PA occurs 4where the patient is located at the time of the patient 5encounter, and therefore requires the PA to be under the 6jurisdiction of the State Licensing Board where the patient is 7located. State Licensing Boards that participate in this 8Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose Adverse Action 9against a Compact Privilege in that State issued to a PA 10through the procedures of this Compact. The PA Licensure 11Compact will alleviate burdens for military families by 12allowing active duty military personnel and their spouses to 13obtain a Compact Privilege based on having an unrestricted 14License in good standing from a Participating State.  15    Section 2.

The Commission shall indemnify and hold harmless 8    any member, officer, executive director, employee, and 9    representative of the Commission for the amount of any 10    settlement or judgment obtained against that person 11    arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or 12    omission that occurred within the scope of Commission 13    employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such 14    person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred 15    within the scope of Commission employment, duties, or 16    responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, 17    error, or omission did not result from the intentional or 18    willful or wanton misconduct of that person.19        4. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or 20    against the Commission shall be brought solely and 21    exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the 22    principal office of the Commission is located. The 23    Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses in 24    any proceedings as authorized by Commission Rules.25        5. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation 26    on the liability of any Licensee for professional   SB0209- 25 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1    malpractice or misconduct, which shall be governed solely 2    by any other applicable State laws.3        6. Nothing herein shall be construed to designate the 4    venue or jurisdiction to bring actions for alleged acts of 5    malpractice, professional misconduct, negligence, or other 6    such civil action pertaining to the practice of a PA. All 7    such matters shall be determined exclusively by State law 8    other than this Compact.9        7. Nothing in this Compact shall be interpreted to 10    waive or otherwise abrogate a Participating State's state 11    action immunity or state action affirmative defense with 12    respect to antitrust claims under the Sherman Act, Clayton 13    Act, or any other State or federal antitrust or 14    anticompetitive law or regulation.15        8. Nothing in this Compact shall be construed to be a 16    waiver of sovereign immunity by the Participating States 17    or by the Commission. 18    Section 8. Data System19    A. The Commission shall provide for the development, 20maintenance, operation, and utilization of a coordinated data 21and reporting system containing licensure, Adverse Action, and 22the reporting of the existence of Significant Investigative 23Information on all licensed PAs and applicants denied a 24License in Participating States.25    B. Notwithstanding any other State law to the contrary, a   SB0209- 26 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1Participating State shall submit a uniform data set to the 2Data System on all PAs to whom this Compact is applicable 3(utilizing a unique identifier) as required by the Rules of 4the Commission, including:5        1. Identifying information;6        2. Licensure data;7        3. Adverse Actions against a License or Compact 8    Privilege;9        4.

The Commission shall promulgate reasonable Rules in 25order to effectively and efficiently implement and administer   SB0209- 28 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1this Compact and achieve its purposes. A Commission Rule shall 2be invalid and have not force or effect only if a court of 3competent jurisdiction holds that the Rule is invalid because 4the Commission exercised its rulemaking authority in a manner 5that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this Compact, or 6the powers granted hereunder, or based upon another applicable 7standard of review.8    C. The Rules of the Commission shall have the force of law 9in each Participating State, provided however that where the 10Rules of the Commission conflict with the laws of the 11Participating State that establish the medical services a PA 12may perform in the Participating State, as held by a court of 13competent jurisdiction, the Rules of the Commission shall be 14ineffective in that State to the extent of the conflict.15    D. If a majority of the legislatures of the Participating 16States rejects a Commission Rule, by enactment of a statute or 17resolution in the same manner used to adopt this Compact 18within four (4) years of the date of adoption of the Rule, then 19such Rule shall have no further force and effect in any 20Participating State or to any State applying to participate in 21the Compact.22    E. Commission Rules shall be adopted at a regular or 23special meeting of the Commission.24    F. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final Rule or 25Rules by the Commission, and at least thirty (30) days in 26advance of the meeting at which the Rule will be considered and   SB0209- 29 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1voted upon, the Commission shall file a Notice of Proposed 2Rulemaking:3        1. On the website of the Commission or other publicly 4    accessible platform; and5        2. To persons who have requested notice of the 6    Commission's notices of proposed rulemaking; and7        3. In such other way(s) as the Commission may by Rule 8    specify.9    G. The Notice of Proposed Rulemaking shall include:10        1. The time, date, and location of the public hearing 11    on the proposed Rule and the proposed time, date and 12    location of the meeting in which the proposed Rule will be 13    considered and voted upon;14        2. The text of the proposed Rule and the reason for the 15    proposed Rule;16        3. A request for comments on the proposed Rule from 17    any interested person and the date by which written 18    comments must be received; and19        4. The manner in which interested persons may submit 20    notice to the Commission of their intention to attend the 21    public hearing or provide any written comments.22    H. Prior to adoption of a proposed Rule, the Commission 23shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, 24and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.25    I. If the hearing is to be held via electronic means, the 26Commission shall publish the mechanism for access to the   SB0209- 30 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1electronic hearing. 2        1. All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing 3    shall, as directed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 4    not less than five (5) business days before the scheduled 5    date of the hearing, notify the Commission of their desire 6    to appear and testify at the hearing.7        2. Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing 8    each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable 9    opportunity to comment orally or in writing.10        3. All hearings shall be recorded. A copy of the 11    recording and the written comments, data, facts, opinions, 12    and arguments received in response to the proposed 13    rulemaking shall be made available to a person upon 14    request.15        4. Nothing in this section shall be construed as 16    requiring a separate hearing on each proposed Rule. 17    Proposed Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the 18    Commission at hearings required by this section.19    J. Following the public hearing, the Commission shall 20consider all written and oral comments timely received.21    K. The Commission shall, by majority vote of all 22delegates, take final action on the proposed Rule and shall 23determine the effective date of the Rule, if adopted, based on 24the Rulemaking record and the full text of the Rule.25        1. If adopted, the Rule shall be posted on the 26    Commission's website.  SB0209- 31 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1        2. The Commission may adopt changes to the proposed 2    Rule provided the changes do not enlarge the original 3    purpose of the proposed Rule.4        3. The Commission shall provide on its website an 5    explanation of the reasons for substantive changes made to 6    the proposed Rule as well as reasons for substantive 7    changes not made that were recommended by commenters.8        4. The Commission shall determine a reasonable 9    effective date for the Rule. Except for an emergency as 10    provided in subsection L, the effective date of the Rule 11    shall be no sooner than thirty (30) days after the 12    Commission issued the notice that it adopted the Rule.13    L. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the 14Commission may consider and adopt an emergency Rule with 15twenty-four (24) hours' prior notice, without the opportunity 16for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking 17procedures provided in this Compact and in this section shall 18be retroactively applied to the Rule as soon as reasonably 19possible, in no event later than ninety (90) days after the 20effective date of the Rule. For the purposes of this 21provision, an emergency Rule is one that must be adopted 22immediately by the Commission in order to:23        1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, 24    or welfare;25        2. Prevent a loss of Commission or Participating State 26    funds;  SB0209- 32 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1        3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of a 2    Commission Rule that is established by federal law or 3    Rule; or4        4. Protect public health and safety.5    M. The Commission or an authorized committee of the 6Commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted 7Commission Rule for purposes of correcting typographical 8errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or 9grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be 10posted on the website of the Commission. The revision shall be 11subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty (30) 12days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on 13grounds that the revision results in a material change to a 14Rule. A challenge shall be made as set forth in the notice of 15revisions and delivered to the Commission prior to the end of 16the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will 17take effect without further action. If the revision is 18challenged, the revision may not take effect without the 19approval of the Commission.20    N. No Participating State's rulemaking requirements shall 21apply under this Compact. 22    Section 10. Oversight, Dispute Resolution, and Enforcement23    A. Oversight24        1. The executive and judicial branches of State 25    government in each Participating State shall enforce this   SB0209- 33 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1    Compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to 2    implement the Compact.3        2. Venue is proper and judicial proceedings by or 4    against the Commission shall be brought solely and 5    exclusively in a court of competent jurisdiction where the 6    principal office of the Commission is located. The 7    Commission may waive venue and jurisdictional defenses to 8    the extent it adopts or consents to participate in 9    alternative dispute resolution proceedings. Nothing herein 10    shall affect or limit the selection or propriety of venue 11    in any action against a licensee for professional 12    malpractice, misconduct or any such similar matter.13        3. The Commission shall be entitled to receive service 14    of process in any proceeding regarding the enforcement or 15    interpretation of the Compact or the Commission's Rules 16    and shall have standing to intervene in such a proceeding 17    for all purposes. Failure to provide the Commission with 18    service of process shall render a judgment or order in 19    such proceeding void as to the Commission, this Compact, 20    or Commission Rules. 21    B. Default, Technical Assistance, and Termination22        1. If the Commission determines that a Participating 23    State has defaulted in the performance of its obligations 24    or responsibilities under this Compact or the Commission 25    Rules, the Commission shall provide written notice to the 26    defaulting State and other Participating States. The   SB0209- 34 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1    notice shall describe the default, the proposed means of 2    curing the default and any other action that the 3    Commission may take and shall offer remedial training and 4    specific technical assistance regarding the default.5        2. If a State in default fails to cure the default, the 6    defaulting State may be terminated from this Compact upon 7    an affirmative vote of a majority of the delegates of the 8    Participating States, and all rights, privileges and 9    benefits conferred by this Compact upon such State may be 10    terminated on the effective date of termination. A cure of 11    the default does not relieve the offending State of 12    obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of 13    default.14        3. Termination of participation in this Compact shall 15    be imposed only after all other means of securing 16    compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to 17    suspend or terminate shall be given by the Commission to 18    the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the 19    defaulting State's legislature, and to the Licensing 20    Board(s) of each of the Participating States.21        4. A State that has been terminated is responsible for 22    all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred 23    through the effective date of termination, including 24    obligations that extend beyond the effective date of 25    termination.26        5. The Commission shall not bear any costs related to   SB0209- 35 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1    a State that is found to be in default or that has been 2    terminated from this Compact, unless agreed upon in 3    writing between the Commission and the defaulting State.4        6. The defaulting State may appeal its termination 5    from the Compact by the Commission by petitioning the U.S. 6    District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal 7    district where the Commission has its principal offices. 8    The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such 9    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.10        7. Upon the termination of a State's participation in 11    the Compact, the State shall immediately provide notice to 12    all Licensees within that State of such termination: 13            a. Licensees who have been granted a Compact 14        Privilege in that State shall retain the Compact 15        Privilege for one hundred eighty (180) days following 16        the effective date of such termination.17            b. Licensees who are licensed in that State who 18        have been granted a Compact Privilege in a 19        Participating State shall retain the Compact Privilege 20        for one hundred eighty (180) days unless the Licensee 21        also has a Qualifying License in a Participating State 22        or obtains a Qualifying License in a Participating 23        State before the one hundred eighty (180)-day period 24        ends, in which case the Compact Privilege shall 25        continue.26    C. Dispute Resolution  SB0209- 36 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1        1. Upon request by a Participating State, the 2    Commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to 3    this Compact that arise among Participating States and 4    between participating and non-Participating States.5        2. The Commission shall promulgate a Rule providing 6    for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for 7    disputes as appropriate.8    D. Enforcement9        1. The Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its 10    discretion, shall enforce the provisions of this Compact 11    and Rules of the Commission.12        2. If compliance is not secured after all means to 13    secure compliance have been exhausted, by majority vote, 14    the Commission may initiate legal action in the United 15    States District Court for the District of Columbia or the 16    federal district where the Commission has its principal 17    offices against a Participating State in default to 18    enforce compliance with the provisions of this Compact and 19    the Commission's promulgated Rules and bylaws. The relief 20    sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In 21    the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the 22    prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 23    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.24        3. The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive 25    remedies of the Commission. The Commission may pursue any 26    other remedies available under federal or State law.  SB0209- 37 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1    E. Legal Action Against the Commission2        1. A Participating State may initiate legal action 3    against the Commission in the U.S. District Court for the 4    District of Columbia or the federal district where the 5    Commission has its principal offices to enforce compliance 6    with the provisions of the Compact and its Rules. The 7    relief sought may include both injunctive relief and 8    damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, 9    the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such 10    litigation, including reasonable attorney's fees.11        2. No person other than a Participating State shall 12    enforce this Compact against the Commission. 13    Section 11. Date of Implementation of the PA Licensure 14Compact Commission15    A. This Compact shall come into effect on the date on which 16this Compact statute is enacted into law in the seventh 17Participating State. 18        1. On or after the effective date of the Compact, the 19    Commission shall convene and review the enactment of each 20    of the States that enacted the Compact prior to the 21    Commission convening ("Charter Participating States") to 22    determine if the statute enacted by each such Charter 23    Participating State is materially different than the Model 24    Compact.25            a. A Charter Participating State whose enactment   SB0209- 38 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1        is found to be materially different from the Model 2        Compact shall be entitled to the default process set 3        forth in Section 10.B.4            b. If any Participating State later withdraws from 5        the Compact or its participation is terminated, the 6        Commission shall remain in existence and the Compact 7        shall remain in effect even if the number of 8        Participating States should be less than seven. 9        Participating States enacting the Compact subsequent 10        to the Commission convening shall be subject to the 11        process set forth in Section 7.C.21 to determine if 12        their enactments are materially different from the 13        Model Compact and whether they qualify for 14        participation in the Compact.15        2. Participating States enacting the Compact 16    subsequent to the seven initial Charter Participating 17    States shall be subject to the process set forth in 18    Section 7.C.21 to determine if their enactments are 19    materially different from the Model Compact and whether 20    they qualify for participation in the Compact.21        3. All actions taken for the benefit of the Commission 22    or in furtherance of the purposes of the administration of 23    the Compact prior to the effective date of the Compact or 24    the Commission coming into existence shall be considered 25    to be actions of the Commission unless specifically 26    repudiated by the Commission.  SB0209- 39 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1    B. Any State that joins this Compact shall be subject to 2the Commission's Rules and bylaws as they exist on the date on 3which this Compact becomes law in that State. Any Rule that has 4been previously adopted by the Commission shall have the full 5force and effect of law on the day this Compact becomes law in 6that State.7    C. Any Participating State may withdraw from this Compact 8by enacting a statute repealing the same.9        1. A Participating State's withdrawal shall not take 10    effect until one hundred eighty (180) days after enactment 11    of the repealing statute. During this one hundred eighty 12    (180) day-period, all Compact Privileges that were in 13    effect in the withdrawing State and were granted to 14    Licensees licensed in the withdrawing State shall remain 15    in effect. If any Licensee licensed in the withdrawing 16    State is also licensed in another Participating State or 17    obtains a license in another Participating State within 18    the one hundred eighty (180) days, the Licensee's Compact 19    Privileges in other Participating States shall not be 20    affected by the passage of the one hundred eighty (180) 21    days.22        2. Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing 23    requirement of the State Licensing Board(s) of the 24    withdrawing State to comply with the investigative, and 25    Adverse Action reporting requirements of this Compact 26    prior to the effective date of withdrawal.  SB0209- 40 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1        3. Upon the enactment of a statute withdrawing a State 2    from this Compact, the State shall immediately provide 3    notice of such withdrawal to all Licensees within that 4    State. Such withdrawing State shall continue to recognize 5    all licenses granted pursuant to this Compact for a 6    minimum of one hundred eighty (180) days after the date of 7    such notice of withdrawal.8    D. Nothing contained in this Compact shall be construed to 9invalidate or prevent any PA licensure agreement or other 10cooperative arrangement between Participating States and 11between a Participating State and non-Participating State that 12does not conflict with the provisions of this Compact.13    E. This Compact may be amended by the Participating 14States. No amendment to this Compact shall become effective 15and binding upon any Participating State until it is enacted 16materially in the same manner into the laws of all 17Participating States as determined by the Commission. 18    Section 12. Construction and Severability19    A. This Compact and the Commission's rulemaking authority 20shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes 21and the implementation and administration of the Compact. 22Provisions of the Compact expressly authorizing or requiring 23the promulgation of Rules shall not be construed to limit the 24Commission's rulemaking authority solely for those purposes. 25    B. The provisions of this Compact shall be severable and   SB0209- 41 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact 2is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to 3the constitution of any Participating State, a State seeking 4participation in the Compact, or of the United States, or the 5applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or 6circumstance is held to be unconstitutional by a court of 7competent jurisdiction, the validity of the remainder of this 8Compact and the applicability thereof to any other government, 9agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. 10    C. Notwithstanding subsection B or this section, the 11Commission may deny a State's participation in the Compact or, 12in accordance with the requirements of Section 10.B, terminate 13a Participating State's participation in the Compact if it 14determines that a constitutional requirement of a 15Participating State is, or would be with respect to a State 16seeking to participate in the Compact, a material departure 17from the Compact. Otherwise, if this Compact shall be held to 18be contrary to the constitution of any Participating State, 19the Compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the 20remaining Participating States and in full force and effect as 21to the Participating State affected as to all severable 22matters. 23    Section 13. Binding Effect of Compact24    A. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other 25law of a Participating State that is not inconsistent with   SB0209- 42 -LRB104 02925 AWJ 12941 b1this Compact.2    B. Any laws in a Participating State in conflict with this 3Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.4    C. All agreements between the Commission and the 5Participating States are binding in accordance with their 6terms. 7    Section 100.
