The counsel shall meet the 19qualifications as the Supreme Court shall by rule provide. At 20the request of court appointed counsel in a case in which the 21death penalty is sought, attorneys employed by the State 22Appellate Defender may enter an appearance for the limited 23purpose of assisting counsel appointed under this Section.    SB1200- 2 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1    Section 10. Court appointed trial counsel; compensation 2and expenses. 3    (a) This Section applies only to compensation and expenses 4of trial counsel appointed by the court as set forth in Section 55, other than public defenders, for the period after 6arraignment and so long as the State's Attorney has not, at any 7time, filed a certificate indicating he or she will not seek 8the death penalty or stated on the record in open court that 9the death penalty will not be sought.10    (a-5) Litigation budget.11        (1) In a case in which the State has filed a statement 12    of intent to seek the death penalty, the court shall 13    require appointed counsel, including those appointed in 14    Cook County, after counsel has had adequate time to review 15    the case and prior to engaging trial assistance, to submit 16    a proposed estimated litigation budget for court approval, 17    that will be subject to modification in light of facts and 18    developments that emerge as the case proceeds. Case 19    budgets should be submitted ex parte and filed and 20    maintained under seal in order to protect the defendant's 21    right to effective assistance of counsel, right not to 22    incriminate him or herself and all applicable privileges. 23    Case budgets shall be reviewed and approved by the judge 24    assigned to try the case. As provided under subsection (c) 25    of this Section, petitions for compensation shall be   SB1200- 3 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1    reviewed by both the trial judge and the presiding judge 2    or the presiding judge's designee. 3        (2) The litigation budget shall serve purposes 4    comparable to those of private retainer agreements by 5    confirming both the court's and the attorney's 6    expectations regarding fees and expenses. Consideration 7    should be given to employing an ex parte pretrial 8    conference in order to facilitate reaching agreement on a 9    litigation budget at the earliest opportunity.10        (3) The budget shall be incorporated into a sealed 11    initial pretrial order that reflects the understandings of 12    the court and counsel regarding all matters affecting 13    counsel compensation and reimbursement and payments for 14    investigative, expert and other services, including, but 15    not limited to, the following matters:16            (A) the hourly rate at which counsel will be 17        compensated;18            (B) the hourly rate at which private 19        investigators, other than investigators employed by 20        the Office of the State Appellate Defender, will be 21        compensated; and22            (C) the best preliminary estimate that can be made 23        of the cost of all services, including, but not 24        limited to, counsel, expert, and investigative 25        services, that are likely to be needed through the 26        guilt and penalty phases of the trial. The court shall   SB1200- 4 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1        have discretion to require that budgets be prepared 2        for shorter intervals of time.3        (4) Appointed counsel may obtain, subject to later 4    review, investigative, expert or other services without 5    prior authorization if necessary for an adequate defense. 6    If the services are obtained, the presiding judge or the 7    presiding judge's designee shall consider in an ex parte 8    proceeding that timely procurement of necessary services 9    could not await prior authorization. If an ex parte 10    hearing is requested by defense counsel or deemed 11    necessary by the trial judge prior to modifying a budget, 12    the ex parte hearing shall be before the presiding judge 13    or the presiding judge's designee. The judge may then 14    authorize the services nunc pro tunc. If the presiding 15    judge or the presiding judge's designee finds that the 16    services were not reasonable, payment may be denied.17        (5) An approved budget shall guide counsel's use of 18    time and resources by indicating the services for which 19    compensation is authorized. The case budget shall be 20    re-evaluated when justified by changed or unexpected 21    circumstances and shall be modified by the court when 22    reasonable and necessary for an adequate defense. If an ex 23    parte hearing is requested by defense counsel or deemed 24    necessary by the trial judge prior to modifying a budget, 25    the ex parte hearing shall be before the presiding judge 26    or the presiding judge's designee.  SB1200- 5 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1    (b) Appointed trial counsel shall be compensated upon 2presentment and certification by the circuit court of a claim 3for services detailing the date, activity, and time duration 4for which compensation is sought.

The Unified Code of Corrections is amended by 22changing Section 5-8-1 as follows: 23    (730 ILCS 5/5-8-1)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-8-1)24    Sec. 5-8-1. Natural life imprisonment; enhancements for   SB1200- 40 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1use of a firearm; mandatory supervised release terms. 2    (a) Except as otherwise provided in the statute defining 3the offense or in Article 4.5 of Chapter V, a sentence of 4imprisonment for a felony shall be a determinate sentence set 5by the court under this Section, subject to Section 5-4.5-115 6of this Code, according to the following limitations:7        (1) for first degree murder,8            (a) (blank),9            (a-1) if the defendant had at the time of the 10        commission of the offense attained 18 years of age or 11        more, the court may sentence the defendant to death 12        under the procedures described in subsections (a-2) 13        through (a-11) if:14                (1) the murdered individual was a peace 15            officer, employee of an institution or facility of 16            the Department of Corrections or any similar local 17            correctional agency, or fireman killed in the 18            course of performing his or her official duties, 19            to prevent the performance of his or her official 20            duties, or in retaliation for performing his or 21            her official duties, and the defendant knew or 22            should have known that the murdered individual was 23            so employed;24                (2) the defendant has been convicted of 25            murdering 2 or more individuals under subsection 26            (a) of Section 9-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012 or   SB1200- 41 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1            under any law of the United States or of any state 2            which is substantially similar to subsection (a) 3            of Section 9-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012 4            regardless of whether the deaths occurred as the 5            result of the same act or of several related or 6            unrelated acts so long as the deaths were the 7            result of either an intent to kill more than one 8            person or of separate acts which the defendant 9            knew would cause death or create a strong 10            probability of death or great bodily harm to the 11            murdered individual or another; or12                (3) the murdered individual was under 12 years 13            of age and the death resulted from exceptionally 14            brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton 15            cruelty; 16                (4) the murder was committed by the defendant 17            upon the grounds of a school or grounds adjacent 18            to a school, or is in any part of a building used 19            for school purposes; 20                (5) the murder was committed by the defendant 21            in connection with or as a result of the offense of 22            terrorism as defined in Section 29D-14.9 of the 23            Criminal Code of 2012; or 24                (6) the murdered individual was a member of a 25            congregation engaged in prayer or other religious 26            activities at a church, synagogue, mosque, or   SB1200- 42 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1            other building, structure, or place used for 2            religious worship. 3            (a-2) The court shall consider, or shall instruct 4            the jury to consider, any aggravating and any 5            mitigating factors which are relevant to the 6            imposition of the death penalty. Aggravating 7            factors may include, but need not be limited to, 8            those factors set forth in subsections (b) and 9            (b-5). Mitigating factors may include but need not 10            be limited to the following: 11                (1) the defendant has no significant history 12            of prior criminal activity; 13                (2) the murder was committed while the 14            defendant was under the influence of extreme 15            mental or emotional disturbance, although not such 16            as to constitute a defense to prosecution;17                (3) the murdered individual was a participant 18            in the defendant's homicidal conduct or consented 19            to the homicidal act; 20                (4) the defendant acted under the compulsion 21            of threat or menace of the imminent infliction of 22            death or great bodily harm; 23                (5) the defendant was not personally present 24            during commission of the act or acts causing 25            death; 26                (6) the defendant's background includes a   SB1200- 43 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1            history of extreme emotional or physical abuse; 2                (7) the defendant suffers from a reduced 3            mental capacity. Provided, however, that an action 4            that does not otherwise mitigate first degree 5            murder cannot qualify as a mitigating factor for 6            first degree murder because of the discovery, 7            knowledge, or disclosure of the victim's sexual 8            orientation as defined in Section 1-103 of the 9            Illinois Human Rights Act. 10            (a-3) If requested by the State, the court shall 11        conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine 12        the existence of factors set forth in subsections (b) 13        and (b-5) and to consider any aggravating or 14        mitigating factors as indicated in this subsection 15        (a-2). The proceeding shall be conducted: 16                (1) before the jury that determined the 17            defendant's guilt; or 18                (2) before a jury impanelled for the purpose 19            of the proceeding if:20                    (A) the defendant was convicted upon a 21                plea of guilty; or 22                    (B) the defendant was convicted after a 23                trial before the court sitting without a jury; 24                or 25                    (C) the court for good cause shown 26                discharges the jury that determined the   SB1200- 44 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1                defendant's guilt; or 2                (3) before the court alone if the defendant 3            waives a jury for the separate proceeding. 4            (a-4) During the proceeding any information 5        relevant to any of the factors set forth in 6        subsections (b) and (b-5) may be presented by either 7        the State or the defendant under the rules governing 8        the admission of evidence at criminal trials. Any 9        information relevant to any additional aggravating 10        factors or any mitigating factors indicated in 11        subsection (a-2) may be presented by the State or 12        defendant regardless of its admissibility under the 13        rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal 14        trials. The State and the defendant shall be given 15        fair opportunity to rebut any information received at 16        the hearing. 17            (a-5) The burden of proof of establishing the 18        existence of any of the factors set forth in 19        subsections (b) and (b-5) is on the State and shall not 20        be satisfied unless established beyond a reasonable 21        doubt. 22            (a-6) If at the separate sentencing proceeding the 23        jury finds that none of the factors set forth in 24        subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court shall 25        sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under 26        Chapter V. If there is a unanimous finding by the jury   SB1200- 45 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1        that one or more of the factors set forth in 2        subsections (b) and (b-5) exist, the jury shall 3        consider aggravating and mitigating factors as 4        instructed by the court and shall determine whether 5        the sentence of death shall be imposed. If the jury 6        determines unanimously, after weighing the factors in 7        aggravation and mitigation, that death is the 8        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the 9        defendant to death. If the court does not concur with 10        the jury determination that death is the appropriate 11        sentence, the court shall set forth reasons in writing 12        including what facts or circumstances the court relied 13        upon, along with any relevant documents, that 14        compelled the court to non-concur with the sentence. 15        This document and any attachments shall be part of the 16        record for appellate review. The court shall be bound 17        by the jury's sentencing determination. If after 18        weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, 19        one or more jurors determines that death is not the 20        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the 21        defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of 22        the Unified Code of Corrections. 23            (a-7) In a proceeding before the court alone, if 24        the court finds that none of the factors found in 25        subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court shall 26        sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under   SB1200- 46 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1        Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections. If the 2        Court determines that one or more of the factors set 3        forth in subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court 4        shall consider any aggravating and mitigating factors 5        as indicated in subsection (a-2). If the court 6        determines, after weighing the factors in aggravation 7        and mitigation, that death is the appropriate 8        sentence, the Court shall sentence the defendant to 9        death. If the court finds that death is not the 10        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the 11        defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of 12        the Unified Code of Corrections. 13            (a-8) In a case in which the defendant has been 14        found guilty of first degree murder by a judge or jury, 15        or a case on remand for resentencing, and the State 16        seeks the death penalty as an appropriate sentence, on 17        the court's own motion or the written motion of the 18        defendant, the court may decertify the case as a death 19        penalty case if the court finds that the only evidence 20        supporting the defendant's conviction is the 21        uncorroborated testimony of an informant witness, as 22        defined in Section 115-21 of the Code of Criminal 23        Procedure of 1963, concerning the confession or 24        admission of the defendant or that the sole evidence 25        against the defendant is a single eyewitness or single 26        accomplice without any other corroborating evidence.   SB1200- 47 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1        If the court decertifies the case as a capital case 2        under either of the grounds set forth above, the court 3        shall issue a written finding. The State may pursue 4        its right to appeal the decertification pursuant to 5        Supreme Court Rule 604(a)(1). If the court does not 6        decertify the case as a capital case, the matter shall 7        proceed to the eligibility phase of the sentencing 8        hearing. 9            (a-9) The conviction and sentence of death shall 10        be subject to automatic review by the Supreme Court. 11        Such review shall be in accordance with rules 12        promulgated by the Supreme Court. The Illinois Supreme 13        Court may overturn the death sentence, and order the 14        imposition of imprisonment under Chapter V if the 15        court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally 16        unjust as applied to the particular case. If the 17        Illinois Supreme Court finds that the death sentence 18        is fundamentally unjust as applied to the particular 19        case, independent of any procedural grounds for 20        relief, the Illinois Supreme Court shall issue a 21        written opinion explaining this finding. 22            (a-10) If the death penalty in this amendatory Act 23        of the 104th General Assembly is held to be 24        unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United 25        States or of the State of Illinois, any person 26        convicted of first degree murder shall be sentenced by   SB1200- 48 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1        the court to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V. If 2        any death sentence pursuant to the sentencing 3        provisions of this Section is declared 4        unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United 5        States or of the State of Illinois, the court having 6        jurisdiction over a person previously sentenced to 7        death shall cause the defendant to be brought before 8        the court, and the court shall sentence the defendant 9        to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V. 10            (a-11) The Attorney General and State's Attorneys 11        Association shall consult on voluntary guidelines for 12        procedures governing whether or not to seek the death 13        penalty. The guidelines do not have the force of law 14        and are only advisory in nature, or 15            (b) if a trier of fact finds beyond a reasonable 16        doubt that the murder was accompanied by exceptionally 17        brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton 18        cruelty or, except as set forth in subsection 19        (a)(1)(c) of this Section, that any of the aggravating 20        factors listed in subparagraph (b-5) are present, the 21        court may sentence the defendant, subject to Section 22        5-4.5-105, to a term of natural life imprisonment, or23            (b-5) a A defendant who at the time of the 24        commission of the offense has attained the age of 18 or 25        more and who has been found guilty of first degree 26        murder for which the death penalty has not been   SB1200- 49 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1        imposed by the court may be sentenced to a term of 2        natural life imprisonment if: 3                (1) the murdered individual was an inmate at 4            an institution or facility of the Department of 5            Corrections, or any similar local correctional 6            agency and was killed on the grounds thereof, or 7            the murdered individual was otherwise present in 8            such institution or facility with the knowledge 9            and approval of the chief administrative officer 10            thereof; 11                (2) the murdered individual was killed as a 12            result of the hijacking of an airplane, train, 13            ship, bus, or other public conveyance; 14                (3) the defendant committed the murder 15            pursuant to a contract, agreement, or 16            understanding by which he or she was to receive 17            money or anything of value in return for 18            committing the murder or procured another to 19            commit the murder for money or anything of value; 20                (4) the murdered individual was killed in the 21            course of another felony if: 22                    (A) the murdered individual: 23                        (i) was actually killed by the 24                    defendant, or 25                        (ii) received physical injuries 26                    personally inflicted by the defendant   SB1200- 50 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1                    substantially contemporaneously with 2                    physical injuries caused by one or more 3                    persons for whose conduct the defendant is 4                    legally accountable under Section 5-2 of 5                    this Code, and the physical injuries 6                    inflicted by either the defendant or the 7                    other person or persons for whose conduct 8                    he is legally accountable caused the death 9                    of the murdered individual; and (B) in 10                    performing the acts which caused the death 11                    of the murdered individual or which 12                    resulted in physical injuries personally 13                    inflicted by the defendant on the murdered 14                    individual under the circumstances of 15                    subdivision (ii) of clause (A) of this 16                    clause (4), the defendant acted with the 17                    intent to kill the murdered individual or 18                    with the knowledge that his or her acts 19                    created a strong probability of death or 20                    great bodily harm to the murdered 21                    individual or another; and 22                    (B) in performing the acts which caused 23                the death of the murdered individual or which 24                resulted in physical injuries personally 25                inflicted by the defendant on the murdered 26                individual under the circumstances of   SB1200- 51 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1                subdivision (ii) of clause (A) of this clause 2                (4), the defendant acted with the intent to 3                kill the murdered individual or with the 4                knowledge that his or her acts created a 5                strong probability of death or great bodily 6                harm to the murdered individual or another; 7                and 8                    (C) the other felony was an inherently 9                violent crime or the attempt to commit an 10                inherently violent crime.

Court appointed trial counsel; compensation 2and expenses. 3    (a) This Section applies only to compensation and expenses 4of trial counsel appointed by the court as set forth in Section 55, other than public defenders, for the period after 6arraignment and so long as the State's Attorney has not, at any 7time, filed a certificate indicating he or she will not seek 8the death penalty or stated on the record in open court that 9the death penalty will not be sought.10    (a-5) Litigation budget.11        (1) In a case in which the State has filed a statement 12    of intent to seek the death penalty, the court shall 13    require appointed counsel, including those appointed in 14    Cook County, after counsel has had adequate time to review 15    the case and prior to engaging trial assistance, to submit 16    a proposed estimated litigation budget for court approval, 17    that will be subject to modification in light of facts and 18    developments that emerge as the case proceeds. Case 19    budgets should be submitted ex parte and filed and 20    maintained under seal in order to protect the defendant's 21    right to effective assistance of counsel, right not to 22    incriminate him or herself and all applicable privileges. 23    Case budgets shall be reviewed and approved by the judge 24    assigned to try the case. As provided under subsection (c) 25    of this Section, petitions for compensation shall be   SB1200- 3 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1    reviewed by both the trial judge and the presiding judge 2    or the presiding judge's designee. 3        (2) The litigation budget shall serve purposes 4    comparable to those of private retainer agreements by 5    confirming both the court's and the attorney's 6    expectations regarding fees and expenses. Consideration 7    should be given to employing an ex parte pretrial 8    conference in order to facilitate reaching agreement on a 9    litigation budget at the earliest opportunity.10        (3) The budget shall be incorporated into a sealed 11    initial pretrial order that reflects the understandings of 12    the court and counsel regarding all matters affecting 13    counsel compensation and reimbursement and payments for 14    investigative, expert and other services, including, but 15    not limited to, the following matters:16            (A) the hourly rate at which counsel will be 17        compensated;18            (B) the hourly rate at which private 19        investigators, other than investigators employed by 20        the Office of the State Appellate Defender, will be 21        compensated; and22            (C) the best preliminary estimate that can be made 23        of the cost of all services, including, but not 24        limited to, counsel, expert, and investigative 25        services, that are likely to be needed through the 26        guilt and penalty phases of the trial.

If an ex parte 10    hearing is requested by defense counsel or deemed 11    necessary by the trial judge prior to modifying a budget, 12    the ex parte hearing shall be before the presiding judge 13    or the presiding judge's designee. The judge may then 14    authorize the services nunc pro tunc. If the presiding 15    judge or the presiding judge's designee finds that the 16    services were not reasonable, payment may be denied.17        (5) An approved budget shall guide counsel's use of 18    time and resources by indicating the services for which 19    compensation is authorized. The case budget shall be 20    re-evaluated when justified by changed or unexpected 21    circumstances and shall be modified by the court when 22    reasonable and necessary for an adequate defense. If an ex 23    parte hearing is requested by defense counsel or deemed 24    necessary by the trial judge prior to modifying a budget, 25    the ex parte hearing shall be before the presiding judge 26    or the presiding judge's designee.  SB1200- 5 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1    (b) Appointed trial counsel shall be compensated upon 2presentment and certification by the circuit court of a claim 3for services detailing the date, activity, and time duration 4for which compensation is sought.

The Unified Code of Corrections is amended by 22changing Section 5-8-1 as follows: 23    (730 ILCS 5/5-8-1)  (from Ch. 38, par. 1005-8-1)24    Sec. 5-8-1. Natural life imprisonment; enhancements for   SB1200- 40 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1use of a firearm; mandatory supervised release terms. 2    (a) Except as otherwise provided in the statute defining 3the offense or in Article 4.5 of Chapter V, a sentence of 4imprisonment for a felony shall be a determinate sentence set 5by the court under this Section, subject to Section 5-4.5-115 6of this Code, according to the following limitations:7        (1) for first degree murder,8            (a) (blank),9            (a-1) if the defendant had at the time of the 10        commission of the offense attained 18 years of age or 11        more, the court may sentence the defendant to death 12        under the procedures described in subsections (a-2) 13        through (a-11) if:14                (1) the murdered individual was a peace 15            officer, employee of an institution or facility of 16            the Department of Corrections or any similar local 17            correctional agency, or fireman killed in the 18            course of performing his or her official duties, 19            to prevent the performance of his or her official 20            duties, or in retaliation for performing his or 21            her official duties, and the defendant knew or 22            should have known that the murdered individual was 23            so employed;24                (2) the defendant has been convicted of 25            murdering 2 or more individuals under subsection 26            (a) of Section 9-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012 or   SB1200- 41 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1            under any law of the United States or of any state 2            which is substantially similar to subsection (a) 3            of Section 9-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012 4            regardless of whether the deaths occurred as the 5            result of the same act or of several related or 6            unrelated acts so long as the deaths were the 7            result of either an intent to kill more than one 8            person or of separate acts which the defendant 9            knew would cause death or create a strong 10            probability of death or great bodily harm to the 11            murdered individual or another; or12                (3) the murdered individual was under 12 years 13            of age and the death resulted from exceptionally 14            brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton 15            cruelty; 16                (4) the murder was committed by the defendant 17            upon the grounds of a school or grounds adjacent 18            to a school, or is in any part of a building used 19            for school purposes; 20                (5) the murder was committed by the defendant 21            in connection with or as a result of the offense of 22            terrorism as defined in Section 29D-14.9 of the 23            Criminal Code of 2012; or 24                (6) the murdered individual was a member of a 25            congregation engaged in prayer or other religious 26            activities at a church, synagogue, mosque, or   SB1200- 42 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1            other building, structure, or place used for 2            religious worship. 3            (a-2) The court shall consider, or shall instruct 4            the jury to consider, any aggravating and any 5            mitigating factors which are relevant to the 6            imposition of the death penalty. Aggravating 7            factors may include, but need not be limited to, 8            those factors set forth in subsections (b) and 9            (b-5). Mitigating factors may include but need not 10            be limited to the following: 11                (1) the defendant has no significant history 12            of prior criminal activity; 13                (2) the murder was committed while the 14            defendant was under the influence of extreme 15            mental or emotional disturbance, although not such 16            as to constitute a defense to prosecution;17                (3) the murdered individual was a participant 18            in the defendant's homicidal conduct or consented 19            to the homicidal act; 20                (4) the defendant acted under the compulsion 21            of threat or menace of the imminent infliction of 22            death or great bodily harm; 23                (5) the defendant was not personally present 24            during commission of the act or acts causing 25            death; 26                (6) the defendant's background includes a   SB1200- 43 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1            history of extreme emotional or physical abuse; 2                (7) the defendant suffers from a reduced 3            mental capacity. Provided, however, that an action 4            that does not otherwise mitigate first degree 5            murder cannot qualify as a mitigating factor for 6            first degree murder because of the discovery, 7            knowledge, or disclosure of the victim's sexual 8            orientation as defined in Section 1-103 of the 9            Illinois Human Rights Act. 10            (a-3) If requested by the State, the court shall 11        conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine 12        the existence of factors set forth in subsections (b) 13        and (b-5) and to consider any aggravating or 14        mitigating factors as indicated in this subsection 15        (a-2). The proceeding shall be conducted: 16                (1) before the jury that determined the 17            defendant's guilt; or 18                (2) before a jury impanelled for the purpose 19            of the proceeding if:20                    (A) the defendant was convicted upon a 21                plea of guilty; or 22                    (B) the defendant was convicted after a 23                trial before the court sitting without a jury; 24                or 25                    (C) the court for good cause shown 26                discharges the jury that determined the   SB1200- 44 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1                defendant's guilt; or 2                (3) before the court alone if the defendant 3            waives a jury for the separate proceeding. 4            (a-4) During the proceeding any information 5        relevant to any of the factors set forth in 6        subsections (b) and (b-5) may be presented by either 7        the State or the defendant under the rules governing 8        the admission of evidence at criminal trials. Any 9        information relevant to any additional aggravating 10        factors or any mitigating factors indicated in 11        subsection (a-2) may be presented by the State or 12        defendant regardless of its admissibility under the 13        rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal 14        trials. The State and the defendant shall be given 15        fair opportunity to rebut any information received at 16        the hearing. 17            (a-5) The burden of proof of establishing the 18        existence of any of the factors set forth in 19        subsections (b) and (b-5) is on the State and shall not 20        be satisfied unless established beyond a reasonable 21        doubt. 22            (a-6) If at the separate sentencing proceeding the 23        jury finds that none of the factors set forth in 24        subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court shall 25        sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under 26        Chapter V. If there is a unanimous finding by the jury   SB1200- 45 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1        that one or more of the factors set forth in 2        subsections (b) and (b-5) exist, the jury shall 3        consider aggravating and mitigating factors as 4        instructed by the court and shall determine whether 5        the sentence of death shall be imposed. If the jury 6        determines unanimously, after weighing the factors in 7        aggravation and mitigation, that death is the 8        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the 9        defendant to death. If the court does not concur with 10        the jury determination that death is the appropriate 11        sentence, the court shall set forth reasons in writing 12        including what facts or circumstances the court relied 13        upon, along with any relevant documents, that 14        compelled the court to non-concur with the sentence. 15        This document and any attachments shall be part of the 16        record for appellate review. The court shall be bound 17        by the jury's sentencing determination. If after 18        weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, 19        one or more jurors determines that death is not the 20        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the 21        defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of 22        the Unified Code of Corrections. 23            (a-7) In a proceeding before the court alone, if 24        the court finds that none of the factors found in 25        subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court shall 26        sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under   SB1200- 46 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1        Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections. If the 2        Court determines that one or more of the factors set 3        forth in subsections (b) and (b-5) exists, the court 4        shall consider any aggravating and mitigating factors 5        as indicated in subsection (a-2). If the court 6        determines, after weighing the factors in aggravation 7        and mitigation, that death is the appropriate 8        sentence, the Court shall sentence the defendant to 9        death. If the court finds that death is not the 10        appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the 11        defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of 12        the Unified Code of Corrections. 13            (a-8) In a case in which the defendant has been 14        found guilty of first degree murder by a judge or jury, 15        or a case on remand for resentencing, and the State 16        seeks the death penalty as an appropriate sentence, on 17        the court's own motion or the written motion of the 18        defendant, the court may decertify the case as a death 19        penalty case if the court finds that the only evidence 20        supporting the defendant's conviction is the 21        uncorroborated testimony of an informant witness, as 22        defined in Section 115-21 of the Code of Criminal 23        Procedure of 1963, concerning the confession or 24        admission of the defendant or that the sole evidence 25        against the defendant is a single eyewitness or single 26        accomplice without any other corroborating evidence.   SB1200- 47 -LRB104 03905 RLC 13929 b1        If the court decertifies the case as a capital case 2        under either of the grounds set forth above, the court 3        shall issue a written finding. The State may pursue 4        its right to appeal the decertification pursuant to 5        Supreme Court Rule 604(a)(1). If the court does not 6        decertify the case as a capital case, the matter shall 7        proceed to the eligibility phase of the sentencing 8        hearing. 9            (a-9) The conviction and sentence of death shall 10        be subject to automatic review by the Supreme Court. 11        Such review shall be in accordance with rules 12        promulgated by the Supreme Court. The Illinois Supreme 13        Court may overturn the death sentence, and order the 14        imposition of imprisonment under Chapter V if the 15        court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally 16        unjust as applied to the particular case.
