Any such required professional 18development must be at the expense of the license holder, who 19may use, if available and applicable to the requirements 20established by administrative or court order, training, 21coursework, or other professional development funds in 22accordance with the terms of an applicable collective 23bargaining agreement entered into after June 13, 2011 (the 24effective date of Public Act 97-8), unless that agreement 25specifically precludes use of funds for such purpose. 26    (c) The State Superintendent of Education shall, upon   SB1329 Enrolled- 5 -LRB104 06310 LNS 16345 b1receipt of evidence of abuse or neglect of a child, 2immorality, a condition of health detrimental to the welfare 3of pupils, incompetency (subject to subsection (b) of this 4Section), unprofessional conduct, the neglect of any 5professional duty, or other just cause, further investigate 6and, if and as appropriate, serve written notice to the 7individual and afford the individual opportunity for a hearing 8prior to suspension, revocation, or other sanction; provided 9that the State Superintendent is under no obligation to 10initiate such an investigation if the Department of Children 11and Family Services is investigating the same or substantially 12similar allegations and its child protective service unit has 13not made its determination, as required under Section 7.12 of 14the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act.
