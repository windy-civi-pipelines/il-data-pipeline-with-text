Any such required professional 25development must be at the expense of the license holder, who 26may use, if available and applicable to the requirements   10400SB1329sam002- 5 -LRB104 06310 LNS 23454 a1established by administrative or court order, training, 2coursework, or other professional development funds in 3accordance with the terms of an applicable collective 4bargaining agreement entered into after June 13, 2011 (the 5effective date of Public Act 97-8), unless that agreement 6specifically precludes use of funds for such purpose. 7    (c) The State Superintendent of Education shall, upon 8receipt of evidence of abuse or neglect of a child, 9immorality, a condition of health detrimental to the welfare 10of pupils, incompetency (subject to subsection (b) of this 11Section), unprofessional conduct, the neglect of any 12professional duty, or other just cause, further investigate 13and, if and as appropriate, serve written notice to the 14individual and afford the individual opportunity for a hearing 15prior to suspension, revocation, or other sanction; provided 16that the State Superintendent is under no obligation to 17initiate such an investigation if the Department of Children 18and Family Services is investigating the same or substantially 19similar allegations and its child protective service unit has 20not made its determination, as required under Section 7.12 of 21the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act.

The standard 10of proof for any administrative hearing held pursuant to this 11Section shall be by the preponderance of the evidence. The 12decision of the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board 13is a final administrative decision and is subject to judicial 14review by appeal of either party.15    The State Board of Education may refuse to issue or may 16suspend the license of any person who fails to file a return or 17to pay the tax, penalty, or interest shown in a filed return or 18to pay any final assessment of tax, penalty, or interest, as 19required by any tax Act administered by the Department of 20Revenue, until such time as the requirements of any such tax 21Act are satisfied.22    The exclusive authority of the State Superintendent of 23Education to initiate suspension or revocation of a license 24pursuant to this Section does not preclude a regional 25superintendent of schools from cooperating with the State 26Superintendent or a State's Attorney with respect to an   10400SB1329sam002- 7 -LRB104 06310 LNS 23454 a1investigation of alleged misconduct.2    (d) The State Superintendent of Education or his or her 3designee may initiate and conduct such investigations as may 4be reasonably necessary to establish the existence of any 5alleged misconduct.

The license holder is not entitled to be present, 14but the State Superintendent shall provide the license holder 15with a copy of any recorded testimony prior to a hearing under 16this Section. Such recorded testimony must not be used as 17evidence at a hearing, unless the license holder has adequate 18notice of the testimony and the opportunity to cross-examine 19the witness. Failure of a license holder to comply with a duly 20issued, investigatory subpoena may be grounds for revocation, 21suspension, or denial of a license.22    (e) All correspondence, documentation, and other 23information so received by the regional superintendent of 24schools, the State Superintendent of Education, the State 25Board of Education, or the State Educator Preparation and 26Licensure Board under this Section is confidential and must   10400SB1329sam002- 8 -LRB104 06310 LNS 23454 a1not be disclosed to third parties, except (i) as necessary for 2the State Superintendent of Education or his or her designee 3to investigate and prosecute pursuant to this Article, (ii) 4pursuant to a court order, (iii) for disclosure to the license 5holder or his or her representative, or (iv) as otherwise 6required in this Article and provided that any such 7information admitted into evidence in a hearing is exempt from 8this confidentiality and non-disclosure requirement. 9    (e-5) The State Superintendent of Education or his or her 10designee may notify a license holder's current or most recent 11employer, if the employer is a public school or school 12district, charter school, special education cooperative, 13nonpublic school, nonpublic special education facility, or 14public school residential facility, that the license holder is 15being investigated for an alleged act of misconduct that 16constitutes a threat to the safety of students, including 17serious physical injury, sexual misconduct as defined in 18subsection (c) of Section 22-85.5 of this Code, or a sex or 19other offense as defined in Section 21B-80 of this Code. 20    (f) The State Superintendent of Education or a person 21designated by him or her shall have the power to administer 22oaths to witnesses at any hearing conducted before the State 23Educator Preparation and Licensure Board pursuant to this 24Section. The State Superintendent of Education or a person 25designated by him or her is authorized to subpoena and bring 26before the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board any   10400SB1329sam002- 9 -LRB104 06310 LNS 23454 a1person in this State and to take testimony either orally or by 2deposition or by exhibit, with the same fees and mileage and in 3the same manner as prescribed by law in judicial proceedings 4in civil cases in circuit courts of this State.5    (g) Any circuit court, upon the application of the State 6Superintendent of Education or the license holder, may, by 7order duly entered, require the attendance of witnesses and 8the production of relevant books and papers as part of any 9investigation or at any hearing the State Educator Preparation 10and Licensure Board is authorized to conduct pursuant to this 11Section, and the court may compel obedience to its orders by 12proceedings for contempt.13    (h) The State Board of Education shall receive an annual 14line item appropriation to cover fees associated with the 15investigation and prosecution of alleged educator misconduct 16and hearings related thereto.17(Source: P.A. 101-531, eff. 8-23-19; 102-552, eff. 1-1-22; 18102-702, eff. 7-1-23.)".
