The credits shall be 19applied on the statement issued to the customer for the next 20monthly billing cycle following the violation or following the 21discovery of the violation. Cable or video providers are 22responsible for providing the credits described herein and the 23customer is under no obligation to request the credit. If the 24customer is no longer taking service from the cable or video 25provider, the credit amount will be refunded to the customer 26by check within 30 days of the termination of service.
