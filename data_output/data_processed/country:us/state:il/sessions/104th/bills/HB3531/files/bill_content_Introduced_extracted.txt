The employer shall notify the employee that 3the employee is still responsible for paying the employee's 4share of the cost of the health care coverage, if any. 5    (n) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to interfere with, 6impede, or in any way diminish the right of employees to 7bargain collectively with their employers through 8representatives of their own choosing in order to establish 9wages or other conditions of work in excess of the applicable 10minimum standards established in this Act.

If an employee's scheduled workday is less than 2 hours 9per day, the employee's scheduled workday shall be used to 10determine the amount of paid leave. Employers who voluntarily 11provide all employees with one hour of paid leave for every 40 12hours worked in a 12-month period are exempt from this Act.13    (c) An employer may make available the minimum number of 14hours of paid leave, subject to pro rata requirements provided 15in subsection (b), to an employee on the first day of 16employment or the first day of the 12-month period. Employers 17that provide the minimum number of hours of paid leave to an 18employee on the first day of employment or the first day of the 1912-month period are not required to carry over carryover paid 20leave from 12-month period to 12-month period and may require 21employees to use all paid leave prior to the end of the benefit 22period or forfeit the unused paid leave.

Changes to the 12-month period may be made by the 3employer if notice is given to employees in writing prior to 4the change and the change does not reduce the eligible accrual 5rate and paid leave available to the employee. If the employer 6changes the designated 12-month period, the employer shall 7provide the employee with documentation of the balance of 8hours worked, paid leave accrued and taken, and the remaining 9paid leave balance.10    (e) Paid leave under this Act may be taken by an employee 11for any reason of the employee's choosing.

An employer that requires notice of paid 18    leave under this Act when the leave is not foreseeable 19    shall provide a written policy that contains procedures 20    for the employee to provide notice.21        (3) Employers shall provide employees with written 22    notice of the paid leave policy notification requirements 23    in this Section in the manner provided in Section 20 for 24    notice and posting and within 5 calendar days of any 25    change to the employer's reasonable paid leave policy 26    notification requirements.   HB3531- 9 -LRB104 10568 SPS 20644 b1        (4) An employer may not require, as a condition of 2    providing paid leave under this Act, that the employee 3    search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours 4    during which the employee takes paid leave.5    (i) Except as provided in subsection (c), paid leave under 6this Act shall carry over annually to the extent not used by 7the employee, provided that nothing in this Act shall be 8construed to require an employer to provide more than 40 hours 9of paid leave for an employee in the 12-month period unless the 10employer agrees to do so. 11    (j) Nothing in this Section or any other Illinois law or 12rule shall be construed as requiring financial or other 13payment to an employee from an employer upon the employee's 14termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from 15employment for paid leave accrued under this Act that has not 16been used. Nothing in this Section or any other Illinois law or 17rule shall be construed as requiring financial or other 18reimbursements to an employee from an employer for unused paid 19leave under this Act at the end of the benefit year or any 20other time. 21    (k) If an employee is transferred to a separate division, 22entity, or location, but remains employed by the same 23employer, the employee is entitled to all paid leave accrued 24at the prior division, entity, or location and is entitled to 25use all paid leave as provided in this Section. If there is a 26separation from employment and the employee is rehired within   HB3531- 10 -LRB104 10568 SPS 20644 b112 months of separation by the same employer, previously 2accrued paid leave that had not been used by the employee shall 3be reinstated.

If the paid leave under this Act is credited to an 10employee's paid time off bank or employee vacation account 11then any unused paid leave shall be paid to the employee upon 12the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other 13separation to the same extent as vacation time under existing 14Illinois law or rule. Nothing in this Act shall be construed to 15waive or otherwise limit an employee's right to final 16compensation for promised and earned, but unpaid vacation time 17or paid time off, as provided under the Illinois Wage Payment 18and Collection Act and rules. Employers shall provide 19employees with written notice of changes to the employer's 20vacation time, paid time off, or other paid leave policies 21that affect an employee's right to final compensation for such 22leave. 23    (m) During any period an employee takes leave under this 24Act, the employer shall maintain coverage for the employee and 25any family member under any group health plan for the duration 26of such leave at no less than the level and conditions of   HB3531- 11 -LRB104 10568 SPS 20644 b1coverage that would have been provided if the employee had not 2taken the leave. The employer shall notify the employee that 3the employee is still responsible for paying the employee's 4share of the cost of the health care coverage, if any. 5    (n) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to interfere with, 6impede, or in any way diminish the right of employees to 7bargain collectively with their employers through 8representatives of their own choosing in order to establish 9wages or other conditions of work in excess of the applicable 10minimum standards established in this Act. The paid leave 11requirements of this Act may be waived in a bona fide 12collective bargaining agreement, but only if the waiver is set 13forth explicitly in such agreement in clear and unambiguous 14terms.15    Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect the validity 16or change the terms of bona fide collective bargaining 17agreements in effect on January 1, 2024.
