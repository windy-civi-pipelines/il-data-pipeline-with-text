The term also includes other 25non-security employees in bargaining units having the majority 26of employees being responsible for the supervision and control   SB1701 Engrossed- 19 -LRB104 10362 BDA 20437 b1of inmates at correctional facilities. 2    (q) "Short-term employee" means an employee who is 3employed for less than 2 consecutive calendar quarters during 4a calendar year and who does not have a reasonable assurance 5that he or she will be rehired by the same employer for the 6same service in a subsequent calendar year. 7    (q-5) "State agency" means an agency directly responsible 8to the Governor, as defined in Section 3.1 of the Executive 9Reorganization Implementation Act, and the Illinois Commerce 10Commission, the Illinois Workers' Compensation Commission, the 11Civil Service Commission, the Pollution Control Board, the 12Illinois Racing Board, and the Illinois State Police Merit 13Board. 14    (r) "Supervisor" is:15        (1) An employee whose principal work is substantially 16    different from that of his or her subordinates and who has 17    authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, 18    transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, 19    direct, reward, or discipline employees, to adjust their 20    grievances, or to effectively recommend any of those 21    actions, if the exercise of that authority is not of a 22    merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the 23    consistent use of independent judgment.

In addition, in 7    determining supervisory status in police employment, rank 8    shall not be determinative. The Board shall consider, as 9    evidence of bargaining unit inclusion or exclusion, the 10    common law enforcement policies and relationships between 11    police officer ranks and certification under applicable 12    civil service law, ordinances, personnel codes, or 13    Division 2.1 of Article 10 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 14    but these factors shall not be the sole or predominant 15    factors considered by the Board in determining police 16    supervisory status. 17        Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding 18    paragraph, in determining supervisory status in fire 19    fighter employment, no fire fighter shall be excluded as a 20    supervisor who has established representation rights under 21    Section 9 of this Act.

If there is no rank 4    between that of chief and the highest company officer, the 5    employer may designate a position on each shift as a Shift 6    Commander, and the persons occupying those positions shall 7    be supervisors. All other ranks above that of the highest 8    company officer shall be supervisors. 9        (2) With respect only to State employees in positions 10    under the jurisdiction of the Attorney General, Secretary 11    of State, Comptroller, or Treasurer (i) that were 12    certified in a bargaining unit on or after December 2, 13    2008, (ii) for which a petition is filed with the Illinois 14    Public Labor Relations Board on or after April 5, 2013 15    (the effective date of Public Act 97-1172), or (iii) for 16    which a petition is pending before the Illinois Public 17    Labor Relations Board on that date, an employee who 18    qualifies as a supervisor under (A) Section 152 of the 19    National Labor Relations Act and (B) orders of the 20    National Labor Relations Board interpreting that provision 21    or decisions of courts reviewing decisions of the National 22    Labor Relations Board. 23        (3) With respect to a police officer, other than a 24    police officer employed by the Illinois State Police, any 25    officer in a permanent rank for which the police officer 26    is appointed.

The position or rank 4    immediately below that of Chief, whether occupied by a 5    person or persons in appointed positions or a tested rank 6    shall also be considered supervisors unless that rank is 7    that of patrol officer. An appointment of duties in which 8    the tested permanent rank does not change shall not be 9    considered the appointment of a supervisor under this 10    definition.11        (4) With respect to a police officer for the State 12    Police, any rank of Major or above.13    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of 14subsection (r), "supervisor" does not include (1) a police 15officer excluded from the definition of "supervisor" by a 16collective bargaining agreement, (2) a police officer who is 17in a rank for which the police officer must complete a written 18test pursuant to Division 1 or Division 2.1 of the Illinois 19Municipal Code in order to be employed in that rank, (3) a 20police officer who is in a position or rank that has been 21voluntarily recognized as covered by a collective bargaining 22agreement by the employer, or (4) a police officer who is in a 23position or rank that has been historically covered by a 24collective bargaining agreement.
