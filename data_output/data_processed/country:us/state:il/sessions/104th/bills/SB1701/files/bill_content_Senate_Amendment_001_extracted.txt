Except with 5    respect to police employment, the term "supervisor" 6    includes only those individuals who devote a preponderance 7    of their employment time to exercising that authority, 8    State supervisors notwithstanding. Determinations of 9    supervisor status shall be based on actual employee job 10    duties and not solely on written job descriptions.

In addition, in 14    determining supervisory status in police employment, rank 15    shall not be determinative. The Board shall consider, as 16    evidence of bargaining unit inclusion or exclusion, the 17    common law enforcement policies and relationships between 18    police officer ranks and certification under applicable 19    civil service law, ordinances, personnel codes, or 20    Division 2.1 of Article 10 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 21    but these factors shall not be the sole or predominant 22    factors considered by the Board in determining police 23    supervisory status. 24        Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding 25    paragraph, in determining supervisory status in fire 26    fighter employment, no fire fighter shall be excluded as a   10400SB1701sam001- 21 -LRB104 10362 BDA 24786 a1    supervisor who has established representation rights under 2    Section 9 of this Act.

If a company 8    officer otherwise qualifies as a supervisor under the 9    preceding paragraph, however, he or she shall not be 10    included in the fire fighter unit. If there is no rank 11    between that of chief and the highest company officer, the 12    employer may designate a position on each shift as a Shift 13    Commander, and the persons occupying those positions shall 14    be supervisors. All other ranks above that of the highest 15    company officer shall be supervisors. 16        (2) With respect only to State employees in positions 17    under the jurisdiction of the Attorney General, Secretary 18    of State, Comptroller, or Treasurer (i) that were 19    certified in a bargaining unit on or after December 2, 20    2008, (ii) for which a petition is filed with the Illinois 21    Public Labor Relations Board on or after April 5, 2013 22    (the effective date of Public Act 97-1172), or (iii) for 23    which a petition is pending before the Illinois Public 24    Labor Relations Board on that date, an employee who 25    qualifies as a supervisor under (A) Section 152 of the 26    National Labor Relations Act and (B) orders of the   10400SB1701sam001- 22 -LRB104 10362 BDA 24786 a1    National Labor Relations Board interpreting that provision 2    or decisions of courts reviewing decisions of the National 3    Labor Relations Board. 4        (3) With respect to a police officer, other than a 5    police officer employed by the Illinois State Police, any 6    officer in a permanent rank for which the police officer 7    is appointed, which for municipal police officers shall 8    mean those not subject to promotional testing pursuant to 9    Division 1 or Division 2.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code. 10    The position or rank immediately below that of Chief, 11    whether occupied by a person or persons in appointed 12    positions or a tested rank shall also be considered 13    supervisors unless that rank is that of patrol officer. An 14    appointment of duties in which the tested permanent rank 15    does not change shall not be considered the appointment of 16    a supervisor under this definition.17        (4) With respect to a police officer for the State 18    Police, any rank of Major or above.19    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of 20subsection (r), "supervisor" does not include (1) a police 21officer excluded from the definition of "supervisor" by a 22collective bargaining agreement, (2) a police officer who is 23in a rank for which the police officer must test pursuant to 24Division 1 or Division 2.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code in 25order to be employed in that rank, (3) a police officer who is 26in a position or rank that has been voluntarily recognized as   10400SB1701sam001- 23 -LRB104 10362 BDA 24786 a1covered by a collective bargaining agreement by the employer, 2or (4) a police officer who is in a position or rank that has 3been historically covered by a collective bargaining 4agreement.
