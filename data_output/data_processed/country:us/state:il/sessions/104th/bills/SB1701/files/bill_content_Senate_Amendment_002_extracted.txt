If there is no rank 12    between that of chief and the highest company officer, the 13    employer may designate a position on each shift as a Shift 14    Commander, and the persons occupying those positions shall 15    be supervisors.

An appointment of duties in which 16    the tested permanent rank does not change shall not be 17    considered the appointment of a supervisor under this 18    definition.19        (4) With respect to a police officer for the State 20    Police, any rank of Major or above.21    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of 22subsection (r), "supervisor" does not include (1) a police 23officer excluded from the definition of "supervisor" by a 24collective bargaining agreement, (2) a police officer who is 25in a rank for which the police officer must complete a written 26test pursuant to Division 1 or Division 2.1 of the Illinois   10400SB1701sam002- 23 -LRB104 10362 BDA 24982 a1Municipal Code in order to be employed in that rank, (3) a 2police officer who is in a position or rank that has been 3voluntarily recognized as covered by a collective bargaining 4agreement by the employer, or (4) a police officer who is in a 5position or rank that has been historically covered by a 6collective bargaining agreement.

Except with 6    respect to police employment, the term "supervisor" 7    includes only those individuals who devote a preponderance 8    of their employment time to exercising that authority, 9    State supervisors notwithstanding. Determinations of 10    supervisor status shall be based on actual employee job 11    duties and not solely on written job descriptions.

In addition, in 15    determining supervisory status in police employment, rank 16    shall not be determinative.

If a company 9    officer otherwise qualifies as a supervisor under the 10    preceding paragraph, however, he or she shall not be 11    included in the fire fighter unit. If there is no rank 12    between that of chief and the highest company officer, the 13    employer may designate a position on each shift as a Shift 14    Commander, and the persons occupying those positions shall 15    be supervisors. All other ranks above that of the highest 16    company officer shall be supervisors. 17        (2) With respect only to State employees in positions 18    under the jurisdiction of the Attorney General, Secretary 19    of State, Comptroller, or Treasurer (i) that were 20    certified in a bargaining unit on or after December 2, 21    2008, (ii) for which a petition is filed with the Illinois 22    Public Labor Relations Board on or after April 5, 2013 23    (the effective date of Public Act 97-1172), or (iii) for 24    which a petition is pending before the Illinois Public 25    Labor Relations Board on that date, an employee who 26    qualifies as a supervisor under (A) Section 152 of the   10400SB1701sam002- 22 -LRB104 10362 BDA 24982 a1    National Labor Relations Act and (B) orders of the 2    National Labor Relations Board interpreting that provision 3    or decisions of courts reviewing decisions of the National 4    Labor Relations Board. 5        (3) With respect to a police officer, other than a 6    police officer employed by the Illinois State Police, any 7    officer in a permanent rank for which the police officer 8    is appointed. For municipal police officers, "in a 9    permanent rank" shall mean those not subject to 10    promotional testing pursuant to Division 1 or Division 2.1 11    of the Illinois Municipal Code. The position or rank 12    immediately below that of Chief, whether occupied by a 13    person or persons in appointed positions or a tested rank 14    shall also be considered supervisors unless that rank is 15    that of patrol officer. An appointment of duties in which 16    the tested permanent rank does not change shall not be 17    considered the appointment of a supervisor under this 18    definition.19        (4) With respect to a police officer for the State 20    Police, any rank of Major or above.21    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of 22subsection (r), "supervisor" does not include (1) a police 23officer excluded from the definition of "supervisor" by a 24collective bargaining agreement, (2) a police officer who is 25in a rank for which the police officer must complete a written 26test pursuant to Division 1 or Division 2.1 of the Illinois   10400SB1701sam002- 23 -LRB104 10362 BDA 24982 a1Municipal Code in order to be employed in that rank, (3) a 2police officer who is in a position or rank that has been 3voluntarily recognized as covered by a collective bargaining 4agreement by the employer, or (4) a police officer who is in a 5position or rank that has been historically covered by a 6collective bargaining agreement.
