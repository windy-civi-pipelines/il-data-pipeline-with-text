The description 11shall include all of the following:12        (1) A geographic map of the area proposed to be served 13    by the plan by county service area and zip code, including 14    marked locations for preferred providers.15        (2) As deemed necessary by the Department, the names, 16    addresses, phone numbers, and specialties of the providers 17    who have entered into preferred provider agreements under 18    the network plan.19        (3) The number of beneficiaries anticipated to be 20    covered by the network plan.21        (4) An Internet website and toll-free telephone number 22    for beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries to access 23    current and accurate lists of preferred providers in each 24    plan, additional information about the plan, as well as 25    any other information required by Department rule.26        (5) A description of how health care services to be   HB1331- 3 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1    rendered under the network plan are reasonably accessible 2    and available to beneficiaries. The description shall 3    address all of the following:4            (A) the type of health care services to be 5        provided by the network plan;6            (B) the ratio of physicians and other providers to 7        beneficiaries, by specialty and including primary care 8        physicians and facility-based physicians when 9        applicable under the contract, necessary to meet the 10        health care needs and service demands of the currently 11        enrolled population; 12            (C) the travel and distance standards for plan 13        beneficiaries in county service areas; and14            (D) a description of how the use of telemedicine, 15        telehealth, or mobile care services may be used to 16        partially meet the network adequacy standards, if 17        applicable.18        (6) A provision ensuring that whenever a beneficiary 19    has made a good faith effort, as evidenced by accessing 20    the provider directory, calling the network plan, and 21    calling the provider, to utilize preferred providers for a 22    covered service and it is determined the insurer does not 23    have the appropriate preferred providers due to 24    insufficient number, type, unreasonable travel distance or 25    delay, or preferred providers refusing to provide a 26    covered service because it is contrary to the conscience   HB1331- 4 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1    of the preferred providers, as protected by the Health 2    Care Right of Conscience Act, the issuer shall ensure, 3    directly or indirectly, by terms contained in the payer 4    contract, that the beneficiary will be provided the 5    covered service at no greater cost to the beneficiary than 6    if the service had been provided by a preferred provider. 7    This paragraph (6) does not apply to: (A) a beneficiary 8    who willfully chooses to access a non-preferred provider 9    for health care services available through the panel of 10    preferred providers, or (B) a beneficiary enrolled in a 11    health maintenance organization.

In no event 15    shall a beneficiary who receives care at a participating 16    health care facility be required to search for 17    participating providers under the circumstances described 18    in subsection (b) or (b-5) of Section 356z.3a of the 19    Illinois Insurance Code except under the circumstances 20    described in paragraph (2) of subsection (b-5).21        (7) A provision that the beneficiary shall receive 22    emergency care coverage such that payment for this 23    coverage is not dependent upon whether the emergency 24    services are performed by a preferred or non-preferred 25    provider and the coverage shall be at the same benefit 26    level as if the service or treatment had been rendered by a   HB1331- 5 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1    preferred provider. For purposes of this paragraph (7), 2    "the same benefit level" means that the beneficiary is 3    provided the covered service at no greater cost to the 4    beneficiary than if the service had been provided by a 5    preferred provider. This provision shall be consistent 6    with Section 356z.3a of the Illinois Insurance Code.7        (8) A limitation that, if the plan provides that the 8    beneficiary will incur a penalty for failing to 9    pre-certify inpatient hospital treatment, the penalty may 10    not exceed $1,000 per occurrence in addition to the plan 11    cost sharing provisions.12        (9) For a network plan to be offered through the 13    Exchange in the individual or small group market, as well 14    as any off-Exchange mirror of such a network plan, 15    evidence that the network plan includes essential 16    community providers in accordance with rules established 17    by the Exchange that will operate in this State for the 18    applicable plan year. 19    (c) The issuer shall demonstrate to the Director a minimum 20ratio of providers to plan beneficiaries as required by the 21Department for each network plan.22        (1) The minimum ratio of physicians or other providers 23    to plan beneficiaries shall be established by the 24    Department in consultation with the Department of Public 25    Health based upon the guidance from the federal Centers 26    for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The Department shall   HB1331- 6 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1    not establish ratios for vision or dental providers who 2    provide services under dental-specific or vision-specific 3    benefits, except to the extent provided under federal law 4    for stand-alone dental plans.

Federal 22    standards for stand-alone dental plans shall only apply to 23    such network plans. In the absence of an applicable 24    Department rule, the federal standards shall apply for the 25    time period specified in the federal law, regulation, or 26    guidance. If the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid   HB1331- 8 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1    Services establish standards that are more stringent than 2    the standards in effect under any Department rule, the 3    Department may amend its rules to conform to the more 4    stringent federal standards. 5    (d) The network plan shall demonstrate to the Director 6maximum travel and distance standards and appointment wait 7time standards for plan beneficiaries, which shall be 8established by the Department in consultation with the 9Department of Public Health based upon the guidance from the 10federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These 11standards shall consist of the maximum minutes or miles to be 12traveled by a plan beneficiary for each county type, such as 13large counties, metro counties, or rural counties as defined 14by Department rule.15    The maximum travel time and distance standards must 16include standards for each physician and other provider 17category listed for which ratios have been established.18    The Director shall establish a process for the review of 19the adequacy of these standards along with an assessment of 20additional specialties to be included in the list under this 21subsection (d).22    Notwithstanding any other law or Department rule, the 23maximum travel time and distance standards and appointment 24wait time standards shall be no greater than any such 25standards established for qualified health plans in 26Federally-Facilitated Exchanges by federal law or by the   HB1331- 9 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, even if 2the network plan is issued in the large group market or is 3otherwise not issued through an exchange. Federal standards 4for stand-alone dental plans shall only apply to such network 5plans. In the absence of an applicable Department rule, the 6federal standards shall apply for the time period specified in 7the federal law, regulation, or guidance. If the Centers for 8Medicare and Medicaid Services establish standards that are 9more stringent than the standards in effect under any 10Department rule, the Department may amend its rules to conform 11to the more stringent federal standards. 12    If the federal area designations for the maximum time or 13distance or appointment wait time standards required are 14changed by the most recent Letter to Issuers in the 15Federally-facilitated Marketplaces, the Department shall post 16on its website notice of such changes and may amend its rules 17to conform to those designations if the Director deems 18appropriate. 19    (d-5)(1) Every issuer shall ensure that beneficiaries have 20timely and proximate access to treatment for mental, 21emotional, nervous, or substance use disorders or conditions 22in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4) of 23subsection (a) of Section 370c of the Illinois Insurance Code. 24Issuers shall use a comparable process, strategy, evidentiary 25standard, and other factors in the development and application 26of the network adequacy standards for timely and proximate   HB1331- 10 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1access to treatment for mental, emotional, nervous, or 2substance use disorders or conditions and those for the access 3to treatment for medical and surgical conditions. As such, the 4network adequacy standards for timely and proximate access 5shall equally be applied to treatment facilities and providers 6for mental, emotional, nervous, or substance use disorders or 7conditions and specialists providing medical or surgical 8benefits pursuant to the parity requirements of Section 370c.1 9of the Illinois Insurance Code and the federal Paul Wellstone 10and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity 11Act of 2008. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the network 12adequacy standards for timely and proximate access to 13treatment for mental, emotional, nervous, or substance use 14disorders or conditions shall, at a minimum, satisfy the 15following requirements:16        (A) For beneficiaries residing in the metropolitan 17    counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will, 18    network adequacy standards for timely and proximate access 19    to treatment for mental, emotional, nervous, or substance 20    use disorders or conditions means a beneficiary shall not 21    have to travel longer than 30 minutes or 30 miles from the 22    beneficiary's residence to receive outpatient treatment 23    for mental, emotional, nervous, or substance use disorders 24    or conditions.

The Department may grant an exception in the 20following circumstances:21        (1) if no providers or facilities meet the specific 22    time and distance standard in a specific service area and 23    the issuer (i) discloses information on the distance and 24    travel time points that beneficiaries would have to travel 25    beyond the required criterion to reach the next closest 26    contracted provider outside of the service area and (ii)   HB1331- 14 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1    provides contact information, including names, addresses, 2    and phone numbers for the next closest contracted provider 3    or facility;4        (2) if patterns of care in the service area do not 5    support the need for the requested number of provider or 6    facility type and the issuer provides data on local 7    patterns of care, such as claims data, referral patterns, 8    or local provider interviews, indicating where the 9    beneficiaries currently seek this type of care or where 10    the physicians currently refer beneficiaries, or both; or11        (3) other circumstances deemed appropriate by the 12    Department consistent with the requirements of this Act.13    (h) Issuers are required to report to the Director any 14material change to an approved network plan within 15 business 15days after the change occurs and any change that would result 16in failure to meet the requirements of this Act. The issuer 17shall submit a revised version of the portions of the network 18adequacy filing affected by the material change, as determined 19by the Director by rule, and the issuer shall attach versions 20with the changes indicated for each document that was revised 21from the previous version of the filing. Upon notice from the 22issuer, the Director shall reevaluate the network plan's 23compliance with the network adequacy and transparency 24standards of this Act. For every day past 15 business days that 25the issuer fails to submit a revised network adequacy filing 26to the Director, the Director may order a fine of $5,000 per   HB1331- 15 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1day. 2    (i) If a network plan is inadequate under this Act with 3respect to a provider type in a county, and if the network plan 4does not have an approved exception for that provider type in 5that county pursuant to subsection (g), an issuer shall cover 6out-of-network claims for covered health care services 7received from that provider type within that county at the 8in-network benefit level and shall retroactively adjudicate 9and reimburse beneficiaries to achieve that objective if their 10claims were processed at the out-of-network level contrary to 11this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed 12to supersede Section 356z.3a of the Illinois Insurance Code. 13    (j) If the Director determines that a network is 14inadequate in any county and no exception has been granted 15under subsection (g) and the issuer does not have a process in 16place to comply with subsection (d-5), the Director may 17prohibit the network plan from being issued or renewed within 18that county until the Director determines that the network is 19adequate apart from processes and exceptions described in 20subsections (d-5) and (g). Nothing in this subsection shall be 21construed to terminate any beneficiary's health insurance 22coverage under a network plan before the expiration of the 23beneficiary's policy period if the Director makes a 24determination under this subsection after the issuance or 25renewal of the beneficiary's policy or certificate because of 26a material change. Policies or certificates issued or renewed   HB1331- 16 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1in violation of this subsection may subject the issuer to a 2civil penalty of $5,000 per policy. 3    (k) For the Department to enforce any new or modified 4federal standard before the Department adopts the standard by 5rule, the Department must, no later than May 15 before the 6start of the plan year, give public notice to the affected 7health insurance issuers through a bulletin. 8(Source: P.A. 102-144, eff. 1-1-22; 102-901, eff. 7-1-22; 9102-1117, eff. 1-13-23; 103-650, eff. 1-1-25.) 10    (Text of Section from P.A. 103-656)11    Sec. 10.

For purposes of this paragraph (7), 10    "the same benefit level" means that the beneficiary is 11    provided the covered service at no greater cost to the 12    beneficiary than if the service had been provided by a 13    preferred provider. This provision shall be consistent 14    with Section 356z.3a of the Illinois Insurance Code.15        (8) A limitation that, if the plan provides that the 16    beneficiary will incur a penalty for failing to 17    pre-certify inpatient hospital treatment, the penalty may 18    not exceed $1,000 per occurrence in addition to the plan 19    cost sharing provisions.20    (c) The network plan shall demonstrate to the Director a 21minimum ratio of providers to plan beneficiaries as required 22by the Department.23        (1) The ratio of physicians or other providers to plan 24    beneficiaries shall be established annually by the 25    Department in consultation with the Department of Public 26    Health based upon the guidance from the federal Centers   HB1331- 43 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1    for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

The description 11shall include all of the following:12        (1) A geographic map of the area proposed to be served 13    by the plan by county service area and zip code, including 14    marked locations for preferred providers.15        (2) As deemed necessary by the Department, the names, 16    addresses, phone numbers, and specialties of the providers 17    who have entered into preferred provider agreements under 18    the network plan.19        (3) The number of beneficiaries anticipated to be 20    covered by the network plan.21        (4) An Internet website and toll-free telephone number 22    for beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries to access 23    current and accurate lists of preferred providers in each 24    plan, additional information about the plan, as well as 25    any other information required by Department rule.26        (5) A description of how health care services to be   HB1331- 3 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1    rendered under the network plan are reasonably accessible 2    and available to beneficiaries. The description shall 3    address all of the following:4            (A) the type of health care services to be 5        provided by the network plan;6            (B) the ratio of physicians and other providers to 7        beneficiaries, by specialty and including primary care 8        physicians and facility-based physicians when 9        applicable under the contract, necessary to meet the 10        health care needs and service demands of the currently 11        enrolled population; 12            (C) the travel and distance standards for plan 13        beneficiaries in county service areas; and14            (D) a description of how the use of telemedicine, 15        telehealth, or mobile care services may be used to 16        partially meet the network adequacy standards, if 17        applicable.18        (6) A provision ensuring that whenever a beneficiary 19    has made a good faith effort, as evidenced by accessing 20    the provider directory, calling the network plan, and 21    calling the provider, to utilize preferred providers for a 22    covered service and it is determined the insurer does not 23    have the appropriate preferred providers due to 24    insufficient number, type, unreasonable travel distance or 25    delay, or preferred providers refusing to provide a 26    covered service because it is contrary to the conscience   HB1331- 4 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1    of the preferred providers, as protected by the Health 2    Care Right of Conscience Act, the issuer shall ensure, 3    directly or indirectly, by terms contained in the payer 4    contract, that the beneficiary will be provided the 5    covered service at no greater cost to the beneficiary than 6    if the service had been provided by a preferred provider. 7    This paragraph (6) does not apply to: (A) a beneficiary 8    who willfully chooses to access a non-preferred provider 9    for health care services available through the panel of 10    preferred providers, or (B) a beneficiary enrolled in a 11    health maintenance organization. In these circumstances, 12    the contractual requirements for non-preferred provider 13    reimbursements shall apply unless Section 356z.3a of the 14    Illinois Insurance Code requires otherwise. In no event 15    shall a beneficiary who receives care at a participating 16    health care facility be required to search for 17    participating providers under the circumstances described 18    in subsection (b) or (b-5) of Section 356z.3a of the 19    Illinois Insurance Code except under the circumstances 20    described in paragraph (2) of subsection (b-5).21        (7) A provision that the beneficiary shall receive 22    emergency care coverage such that payment for this 23    coverage is not dependent upon whether the emergency 24    services are performed by a preferred or non-preferred 25    provider and the coverage shall be at the same benefit 26    level as if the service or treatment had been rendered by a   HB1331- 5 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1    preferred provider. For purposes of this paragraph (7), 2    "the same benefit level" means that the beneficiary is 3    provided the covered service at no greater cost to the 4    beneficiary than if the service had been provided by a 5    preferred provider. This provision shall be consistent 6    with Section 356z.3a of the Illinois Insurance Code.7        (8) A limitation that, if the plan provides that the 8    beneficiary will incur a penalty for failing to 9    pre-certify inpatient hospital treatment, the penalty may 10    not exceed $1,000 per occurrence in addition to the plan 11    cost sharing provisions.12        (9) For a network plan to be offered through the 13    Exchange in the individual or small group market, as well 14    as any off-Exchange mirror of such a network plan, 15    evidence that the network plan includes essential 16    community providers in accordance with rules established 17    by the Exchange that will operate in this State for the 18    applicable plan year. 19    (c) The issuer shall demonstrate to the Director a minimum 20ratio of providers to plan beneficiaries as required by the 21Department for each network plan.22        (1) The minimum ratio of physicians or other providers 23    to plan beneficiaries shall be established by the 24    Department in consultation with the Department of Public 25    Health based upon the guidance from the federal Centers 26    for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Federal 22    standards for stand-alone dental plans shall only apply to 23    such network plans. In the absence of an applicable 24    Department rule, the federal standards shall apply for the 25    time period specified in the federal law, regulation, or 26    guidance. If the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid   HB1331- 8 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1    Services establish standards that are more stringent than 2    the standards in effect under any Department rule, the 3    Department may amend its rules to conform to the more 4    stringent federal standards. 5    (d) The network plan shall demonstrate to the Director 6maximum travel and distance standards and appointment wait 7time standards for plan beneficiaries, which shall be 8established by the Department in consultation with the 9Department of Public Health based upon the guidance from the 10federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

Federal standards 4for stand-alone dental plans shall only apply to such network 5plans. In the absence of an applicable Department rule, the 6federal standards shall apply for the time period specified in 7the federal law, regulation, or guidance. If the Centers for 8Medicare and Medicaid Services establish standards that are 9more stringent than the standards in effect under any 10Department rule, the Department may amend its rules to conform 11to the more stringent federal standards. 12    If the federal area designations for the maximum time or 13distance or appointment wait time standards required are 14changed by the most recent Letter to Issuers in the 15Federally-facilitated Marketplaces, the Department shall post 16on its website notice of such changes and may amend its rules 17to conform to those designations if the Director deems 18appropriate. 19    (d-5)(1) Every issuer shall ensure that beneficiaries have 20timely and proximate access to treatment for mental, 21emotional, nervous, or substance use disorders or conditions 22in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (4) of 23subsection (a) of Section 370c of the Illinois Insurance Code. 24Issuers shall use a comparable process, strategy, evidentiary 25standard, and other factors in the development and application 26of the network adequacy standards for timely and proximate   HB1331- 10 -LRB104 07370 BAB 17410 b1access to treatment for mental, emotional, nervous, or 2substance use disorders or conditions and those for the access 3to treatment for medical and surgical conditions. As such, the 4network adequacy standards for timely and proximate access 5shall equally be applied to treatment facilities and providers 6for mental, emotional, nervous, or substance use disorders or 7conditions and specialists providing medical or surgical 8benefits pursuant to the parity requirements of Section 370c.1 9of the Illinois Insurance Code and the federal Paul Wellstone 10and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity 11Act of 2008.
