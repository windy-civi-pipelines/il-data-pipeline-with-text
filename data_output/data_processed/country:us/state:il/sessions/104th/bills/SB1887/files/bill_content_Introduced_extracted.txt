The Water Commission Act of 1985 is amended by 5changing Section 2 and by adding Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 612, 13, 14, and 15 as follows: 7    (70 ILCS 3720/2)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 252)8    Sec. 2. The General Assembly hereby finds and declares 9that it is necessary and in the public interest to help assure 10a sufficient and economic supply of a source of water within 11those county wide areas of this State where, because of a 12growth in population and proximity to large urban centers, the 13health, safety and welfare of the residents is threatened by 14an ever increasing shortage of a continuing, available and 15adequate source and supply of water on an economically 16reasonable basis; however, it is not the intent of the General 17Assembly to interfere with the power of municipalities to 18provide for the retail distribution of water to their 19residents or the customers of their water systems. Therefore, 20in order to provide for a sufficient and economic supply of 21water to such areas, it is hereby declared to be the law of 22this State that:23    (a) With respect to any water commission constituted   SB1887- 2 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1pursuant to Division 135 of the Illinois Municipal Code or 2established by operation of law under Public Act 83-1123, as 3amended, which water commission includes municipalities which 4in the aggregate have within their corporate limits more than 550% of the population of a county (hereinafter referred to as a 6"home county"), and such county is contiguous to a county 7which has a population in excess of 1,000,000 inhabitants, the 8provisions of this Act shall apply. With respect to any such 9water commission (hereinafter referred to as a "county water 10commission"): 11        (i) the terms of all commissioners of such commission 12    holding office at the time a water commission becomes a 13    county water commission shall terminate 30 days after such 14    time and new commissioners shall be appointed as the 15    governing board of the county water commission as 16    hereinafter provided in subsection (c); and 17        (ii) the county water commission shall continue to be 18    a body corporate and politic, and shall bear the name of 19    the home county but shall be independent from and not a 20    part of the county government and shall itself be a 21    political subdivision and a unit of local government, and 22    upon appointment of the new commissioners as the governing 23    board of such water commission as provided in subsection 24    (c), such water commission shall remain responsible for 25    the full payment of, and shall by operation of law be 26    deemed to have assumed and shall pay when due all debts and   SB1887- 3 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1    obligations of the commission as the same is constituted 2    and as such debts and obligations existed on the date such 3    water commission becomes a county water commission and 4    such additional debts and obligations as are incurred by 5    such commission after such date and prior to the 6    appointment of the new commissioners as the governing 7    board of such commission, and further shall continue to 8    have and exercise all powers and functions and duties of a 9    water commission created pursuant to Division 135 of the 10    Illinois Municipal Code, as now or hereafter amended, and 11    the county water commission may rely on that Division, as 12    modified and supplemented by the provisions of this Act, 13    as lawful authority under which it may act.14    (b) Any county water commission shall have as its 15territory within its corporate limits, subject to taxation for 16its purposes, and subject to the powers and limitations as 17conferred by this Act, (i) all of the territory of the home 18county except that territory located within the corporate 19limits of excluded units as hereinafter defined and (ii) also 20all of the territory located outside the home county and 21included within the corporate limits of an included unit as 22hereinafter defined. As used in this Act, "excluded unit" 23means a unit of local government having a waterworks system 24and having within its corporate limits territory within the 25home county and which either, at the time any commission 26becomes a county water commission, receives, or has contracted   SB1887- 4 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1at such time for the receipt of, more than 25% of the water 2distributed by such unit's water system from a source outside 3of the home county, or a unit of local government that seeks a 4change in status as provided in this Section. As used in this 5Section, "included unit" means any unit of local government 6having a waterworks system and having within its corporate 7limits territory within the home county, which unit of local 8government is not an excluded unit. No other water commission 9shall be constituted under Division 135 of the Illinois 10Municipal Code in any home county after the effective date of 11this Act to provide water from any source located outside the 12home county. A unit of local government may switch its status 13from being an included unit to an excluded unit provided that 14(i) it has constructed a water treatment plant prior to 15December 31, 2006 to comply with United States Environmental 16Protection Agency regulations regarding radium; (ii) it 17notifies the commission in writing of its desire to become an 18excluded unit; and (iii) it no longer demands future service 19from the commission and shall not be reinstated as an included 20unit. In the event a unit of local government switches status, 21the water commission shall, from any legally available 22sources, transfer the sums collected from that unit of local 23government for the period of time beginning January 1, 2006 to 24the date that this tax is no longer assessed within the 25affected excluded unit. The transfer of funds authorized 26herein shall be made within 90 days of the effective date of   SB1887- 5 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly. Except as 2authorized by a county water commission, no home county or 3included unit shall enter into any new or renew or extend any 4existing contract, agreement or other arrangement for the 5acquisition or sale of water from any source located outside a 6home county; provided, however, that any included unit may 7contract for a supply of water in case of a temporary emergency 8from any other unit of local government or any entity. In the 9event that any included unit elects to serve retail customers 10outside its corporate boundaries and to establish rates and 11charges for such water in excess of those charged within its 12corporate boundaries, such rates and charges shall have a 13reasonable relationship to the actual cost of providing and 14delivering the water; this provision is declarative of 15existing law. It is declared to be the law of this State 16pursuant to paragraphs (g) and (h) of Section 6 of Article VII 17of the Illinois Constitution that in any home county, the 18provisions of this Act and Division 135 of the Illinois 19Municipal Code, as modified and supplemented by this Act and 20this amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly, constitute a 21limitation upon the power of any such county and upon all units 22of local government (except excluded units) within such 23county, including home rule units, limiting to such county, 24units of local government and home rule units the power to 25acquire, supply or distribute water or to establish any water 26commission for such purposes involving water from any source   SB1887- 6 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1located outside the home county in a manner other than as 2provided or permitted by this Act and Division 135, as 3modified and supplemented by this Act, and further constitute 4an exercise of exclusive State power with respect to the 5acquisition, supply and distribution of water from any source 6located outside the home county by any such county and by units 7of local government (except excluded units), including home 8rule units, within such county and with respect to the 9establishment for such purposes of any water commission 10therein, which power may not be exercised concurrently by any 11unit of local government or home rule unit. Upon the request of 12any included unit, a county water commission shall provide 13such included unit Lake Michigan water in an amount up to the 14then current Department of Transportation allocation of Lake 15Michigan water for such included unit.16    With respect to a water commission to which the provisions 17of subsection (a) apply, all uninhabited territory that is 18owned and solely occupied by such a commission and is located 19not within its home county but within a non-home rule 20municipality adjacent to its home county shall, 21notwithstanding any other provision of law, be disconnected 22from that municipality by operation of this Act on the 23effective date of this amendatory Act of 1991, and shall 24thereafter no longer be within the territory of the 25municipality for any purpose; except that for the purposes of 26any statute that requires contiguity of territory, the   SB1887- 7 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1territory of the water commission shall be disregarded and the 2municipality shall not be deemed to be noncontiguous by virtue 3of the disconnection of the water commission territory.4    (c) The governing body of any water commission to which 5the provisions of subsection (a) apply shall be a board of 6commissioners, each to be appointed within 30 days after the 7water commission becomes a county water commission to a term 8commencing on such date, as follows: 9        (i) one commissioner, who shall serve as chairman, who 10    shall be a resident of the home county, to be appointed by 11    the chairman of the county board of such county with the 12    advice and consent of the county board, provided that 13    following the expiration of the term or vacancy of the 14    current chairman serving on the effective date of this 15    amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly, any 16    subsequent appointment as chairman shall also be subject 17    to the advice and consent of the county water commission; 18        (ii) one commissioner from each county board district 19    within the home county, to be appointed by the chairman of 20    the county board of the home county with the advice and 21    consent of the county board; and 22        (iii) one commissioner from each county board district 23    within the home county, to be appointed by the majority 24    vote of the mayors of those included units which are 25    municipalities and which have the greatest percentage of 26    their respective populations residing within such county   SB1887- 8 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1    board district of the home county.2    The mayors of the respective county board districts shall 3meet for the purpose of making said respective appointments at 4a time and place designated by that mayor in each county board 5district of the included unit with the largest population 6voting for a commissioner upon not less than 10 days' written 7notice to each other mayor entitled to vote.8    The commissioners so appointed shall serve for a term of 6 9years, or until their successors have been appointed and have 10qualified in the same manner as the original appointments, 11except that at the first meeting of such commissioners, (A) 12the commissioners first appointed pursuant to paragraph (ii) 13of this subsection shall determine publicly by lot 1/3 of 14their number to serve for terms of 2 years, 1/3 of their number 15to serve for terms of 4 years and 1/3 of their number to serve 16for terms of 6 years, any odd number of commissioners so 17determined by dividing into thirds to serve 6 year terms, and 18(B) the commissioners first appointed pursuant to paragraph 19(iii) of this subsection shall determine publicly by lot 1/3 20of their number to serve for terms of 2 years, 1/3 of their 21number to serve for terms of 4 years and 1/3 of their number to 22serve for terms of 6 years, any odd number of commissioners so 23determined by dividing into thirds to serve 6 year terms. The 24commissioner first appointed pursuant to paragraph (i) of this 25subsection, who shall serve as chairman, shall serve for a 26term of 6 years. Any commissioner may be a member of the   SB1887- 9 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1governing board or an officer or employee of such county or any 2unit of local government within such county. A commissioner is 3eligible for reappointment upon the expiration of his term. A 4vacancy in the office of a commissioner shall be filled for the 5balance of the unexpired term by appointment and qualification 6as to residency in the same manner as the original appointment 7was made. Each commissioner shall receive the same 8compensation which shall not be more than $10,000 $600 per 9year, except that no such commissioner who is a member of the 10governing board or an officer or employee of such county or any 11unit of local government within such county may receive any 12compensation for serving as a commissioner.

Before or at 16the time of incurring any indebtedness, except as provided in 17subsection (g), the commission shall provide for the 18collection of a direct annual tax, which shall be unlimited as 19to rate or amount, sufficient to pay the interest on such debt 20as it falls due and also to pay and discharge the principal 21thereof at maturity, which shall be within 40 years after the 22date of issue thereof. Such tax shall be levied upon and 23collected from all of the taxable property within the 24territory of the county water commission. Dissolution of the 25county water commission for any reason shall not relieve the 26taxable property within such territory of the county water   SB1887- 11 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1commission from liability for such tax. The clerk of the 2commission shall file a certified copy of the resolution or 3ordinance by which such bonds are authorized to be issued and 4such tax is levied with the County Clerk of each county in 5which any of the territory of the county water commission is 6located and such filing shall constitute, without the doing of 7any other act, full and complete authority for each such 8County Clerk to extend such tax for collection upon all the 9taxable property within the territory of the county water 10commission subject to such tax in each and every year required 11sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds, 12as aforesaid, without limit as to rate or amount, and shall be 13in addition to and in excess of all other taxes authorized to 14be levied by the commission or any included unit.

In addition, any county water commission may by 9ordinance levy upon all taxable property within its territory, 10for one year only, an additional tax for such purposes at a 11rate not to exceed .20% of the value of such property, as 12equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue for that 13year; provided, however, that such tax may not be levied more 14than once in any county water commission.15    (g) Any county water commission shall have the power to 16borrow money, subject to the indebtedness limitation provided 17in subsection (d), from the home county or included units, in 18such amounts and in such terms as agreed by the governing 19bodies of the commission and the home county or included 20units.21    (h) No county water commission constituted pursuant to the 22Act shall engage in the retail sale or distribution of water to 23residents or customers of any municipality.24    (i) Nothing in the Section requires any municipality to 25contract with a county water commission for a supply of water.26    (j) The State of Illinois recognizes that any such   SB1887- 14 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1contract for the supply of water executed by a unit of local 2government and a county water commission may contain terms and 3conditions intended by the parties thereto to be absolute 4conditions thereof. The State of Illinois also recognizes that 5persons may loan funds to a county water commission 6(including, without limitation, the purchase of revenue or 7general obligation bonds of such commission) in reliance upon 8the terms and conditions of any such contract for the supply of 9water. Therefore, the State of Illinois pledges and agrees to 10those parties and persons which make loans of funds to a county 11water commission that it will not impair or limit the power or 12ability of a county water commission or a unit of local 13government fully to carry out the financial obligations and 14obligation to furnish water pursuant to the terms of any 15contract for the supply of water entered into by such county 16water commission or unit of local government for the term of 17such contracts or loans. All other terms and conditions of 18such contracts and intergovernmental agreements shall be 19binding to the extent that they are not inconsistent with this 20amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly.21(Source: P.A. 95-114, eff. 1-1-08.) 22    (70 ILCS 3720/6 new)23    Sec. 6.

Any such 17contract may provide that if one or more of the other 18purchasers defaults in the payment of its obligations under 19such contract or similar contract made with the supplier of 20the water, one or more of the remaining purchasers party to 21such contract or such similar contract shall be required to 22pay for all or a portion of the obligations of the defaulting 23purchasers. Any such contract entered into to supply water to 24a municipal corporation or political subdivision shall provide 25that the payments to be made thereunder shall be solely from 26the revenues to be derived by such municipality or political   SB1887- 31 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1subdivision from the operation of the waterworks system of 2such municipality or political subdivision, and said contract 3shall be a continuing, valid and binding obligation of the 4municipality or political subdivision, payable from such 5revenues for such period of years, not to exceed 40, as may be 6provided in such contract. Any such contract shall not be a 7debt within the meaning of any statutory or constitutional 8limitations.9    No prior appropriation shall be required before entering 10into such contract, and no appropriation shall be required to 11authorize payments to be made under the terms of any such 12contract, notwithstanding any provision of this Code to the 13contrary.14    The changes in this Section made by this amendatory Act of 151984 are intended to be declarative of existing law.16(Source: P.A. 83-1123.)

Provides that a commission may not receive more than $10,000 per year in compensation (currently a commission may not receive more than $10,000 per year in compensation except that no commissioner who is a member of the governing board or an officer or employee of the county or any unit of local government within the county may receive any compensation for serving as a commissioner). Allows a commission to use alternate project delivery methods, establish goals or requirements for the procurement of goods and services and for construction contracts, and accept assignment of municipal waterworks system contracts or other public improvement contracts. Gives commissions the authority to enter into design-build contracts and use a design-build delivery system. Includes definitions and requirements for the design-build delivery system. Amends the Illinois Municipal Code. Provides that a water commission may construct water transmission and distribution lines within a radius of 50 miles (rather than 25 miles) outside the corporate limits of member municipalities for the purpose of furnishing water to any additional entities which contract with the commission for a supply of water.LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b  A BILL FOR SB1887LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1    AN ACT concerning local government. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Water Commission Act of 1985 is amended by 5changing Section 2 and by adding Sections 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 612, 13, 14, and 15 as follows: 7    (70 ILCS 3720/2)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 252)8    Sec. 2. The General Assembly hereby finds and declares 9that it is necessary and in the public interest to help assure 10a sufficient and economic supply of a source of water within 11those county wide areas of this State where, because of a 12growth in population and proximity to large urban centers, the 13health, safety and welfare of the residents is threatened by 14an ever increasing shortage of a continuing, available and 15adequate source and supply of water on an economically 16reasonable basis; however, it is not the intent of the General 17Assembly to interfere with the power of municipalities to 18provide for the retail distribution of water to their 19residents or the customers of their water systems. Therefore, 20in order to provide for a sufficient and economic supply of 21water to such areas, it is hereby declared to be the law of 22this State that:23    (a) With respect to any water commission constituted   SB1887- 2 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1pursuant to Division 135 of the Illinois Municipal Code or 2established by operation of law under Public Act 83-1123, as 3amended, which water commission includes municipalities which 4in the aggregate have within their corporate limits more than 550% of the population of a county (hereinafter referred to as a 6"home county"), and such county is contiguous to a county 7which has a population in excess of 1,000,000 inhabitants, the 8provisions of this Act shall apply. With respect to any such 9water commission (hereinafter referred to as a "county water 10commission"): 11        (i) the terms of all commissioners of such commission 12    holding office at the time a water commission becomes a 13    county water commission shall terminate 30 days after such 14    time and new commissioners shall be appointed as the 15    governing board of the county water commission as 16    hereinafter provided in subsection (c); and 17        (ii) the county water commission shall continue to be 18    a body corporate and politic, and shall bear the name of 19    the home county but shall be independent from and not a 20    part of the county government and shall itself be a 21    political subdivision and a unit of local government, and 22    upon appointment of the new commissioners as the governing 23    board of such water commission as provided in subsection 24    (c), such water commission shall remain responsible for 25    the full payment of, and shall by operation of law be 26    deemed to have assumed and shall pay when due all debts and   SB1887- 3 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1    obligations of the commission as the same is constituted 2    and as such debts and obligations existed on the date such 3    water commission becomes a county water commission and 4    such additional debts and obligations as are incurred by 5    such commission after such date and prior to the 6    appointment of the new commissioners as the governing 7    board of such commission, and further shall continue to 8    have and exercise all powers and functions and duties of a 9    water commission created pursuant to Division 135 of the 10    Illinois Municipal Code, as now or hereafter amended, and 11    the county water commission may rely on that Division, as 12    modified and supplemented by the provisions of this Act, 13    as lawful authority under which it may act.14    (b) Any county water commission shall have as its 15territory within its corporate limits, subject to taxation for 16its purposes, and subject to the powers and limitations as 17conferred by this Act, (i) all of the territory of the home 18county except that territory located within the corporate 19limits of excluded units as hereinafter defined and (ii) also 20all of the territory located outside the home county and 21included within the corporate limits of an included unit as 22hereinafter defined. As used in this Act, "excluded unit" 23means a unit of local government having a waterworks system 24and having within its corporate limits territory within the 25home county and which either, at the time any commission 26becomes a county water commission, receives, or has contracted   SB1887- 4 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1at such time for the receipt of, more than 25% of the water 2distributed by such unit's water system from a source outside 3of the home county, or a unit of local government that seeks a 4change in status as provided in this Section. As used in this 5Section, "included unit" means any unit of local government 6having a waterworks system and having within its corporate 7limits territory within the home county, which unit of local 8government is not an excluded unit. No other water commission 9shall be constituted under Division 135 of the Illinois 10Municipal Code in any home county after the effective date of 11this Act to provide water from any source located outside the 12home county. A unit of local government may switch its status 13from being an included unit to an excluded unit provided that 14(i) it has constructed a water treatment plant prior to 15December 31, 2006 to comply with United States Environmental 16Protection Agency regulations regarding radium; (ii) it 17notifies the commission in writing of its desire to become an 18excluded unit; and (iii) it no longer demands future service 19from the commission and shall not be reinstated as an included 20unit. In the event a unit of local government switches status, 21the water commission shall, from any legally available 22sources, transfer the sums collected from that unit of local 23government for the period of time beginning January 1, 2006 to 24the date that this tax is no longer assessed within the 25affected excluded unit. The transfer of funds authorized 26herein shall be made within 90 days of the effective date of   SB1887- 5 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly. Except as 2authorized by a county water commission, no home county or 3included unit shall enter into any new or renew or extend any 4existing contract, agreement or other arrangement for the 5acquisition or sale of water from any source located outside a 6home county; provided, however, that any included unit may 7contract for a supply of water in case of a temporary emergency 8from any other unit of local government or any entity. In the 9event that any included unit elects to serve retail customers 10outside its corporate boundaries and to establish rates and 11charges for such water in excess of those charged within its 12corporate boundaries, such rates and charges shall have a 13reasonable relationship to the actual cost of providing and 14delivering the water; this provision is declarative of 15existing law. It is declared to be the law of this State 16pursuant to paragraphs (g) and (h) of Section 6 of Article VII 17of the Illinois Constitution that in any home county, the 18provisions of this Act and Division 135 of the Illinois 19Municipal Code, as modified and supplemented by this Act and 20this amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly, constitute a 21limitation upon the power of any such county and upon all units 22of local government (except excluded units) within such 23county, including home rule units, limiting to such county, 24units of local government and home rule units the power to 25acquire, supply or distribute water or to establish any water 26commission for such purposes involving water from any source   SB1887- 6 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1located outside the home county in a manner other than as 2provided or permitted by this Act and Division 135, as 3modified and supplemented by this Act, and further constitute 4an exercise of exclusive State power with respect to the 5acquisition, supply and distribution of water from any source 6located outside the home county by any such county and by units 7of local government (except excluded units), including home 8rule units, within such county and with respect to the 9establishment for such purposes of any water commission 10therein, which power may not be exercised concurrently by any 11unit of local government or home rule unit. Upon the request of 12any included unit, a county water commission shall provide 13such included unit Lake Michigan water in an amount up to the 14then current Department of Transportation allocation of Lake 15Michigan water for such included unit.16    With respect to a water commission to which the provisions 17of subsection (a) apply, all uninhabited territory that is 18owned and solely occupied by such a commission and is located 19not within its home county but within a non-home rule 20municipality adjacent to its home county shall, 21notwithstanding any other provision of law, be disconnected 22from that municipality by operation of this Act on the 23effective date of this amendatory Act of 1991, and shall 24thereafter no longer be within the territory of the 25municipality for any purpose; except that for the purposes of 26any statute that requires contiguity of territory, the   SB1887- 7 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1territory of the water commission shall be disregarded and the 2municipality shall not be deemed to be noncontiguous by virtue 3of the disconnection of the water commission territory.4    (c) The governing body of any water commission to which 5the provisions of subsection (a) apply shall be a board of 6commissioners, each to be appointed within 30 days after the 7water commission becomes a county water commission to a term 8commencing on such date, as follows: 9        (i) one commissioner, who shall serve as chairman, who 10    shall be a resident of the home county, to be appointed by 11    the chairman of the county board of such county with the 12    advice and consent of the county board, provided that 13    following the expiration of the term or vacancy of the 14    current chairman serving on the effective date of this 15    amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly, any 16    subsequent appointment as chairman shall also be subject 17    to the advice and consent of the county water commission; 18        (ii) one commissioner from each county board district 19    within the home county, to be appointed by the chairman of 20    the county board of the home county with the advice and 21    consent of the county board; and 22        (iii) one commissioner from each county board district 23    within the home county, to be appointed by the majority 24    vote of the mayors of those included units which are 25    municipalities and which have the greatest percentage of 26    their respective populations residing within such county   SB1887- 8 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1    board district of the home county.2    The mayors of the respective county board districts shall 3meet for the purpose of making said respective appointments at 4a time and place designated by that mayor in each county board 5district of the included unit with the largest population 6voting for a commissioner upon not less than 10 days' written 7notice to each other mayor entitled to vote.8    The commissioners so appointed shall serve for a term of 6 9years, or until their successors have been appointed and have 10qualified in the same manner as the original appointments, 11except that at the first meeting of such commissioners, (A) 12the commissioners first appointed pursuant to paragraph (ii) 13of this subsection shall determine publicly by lot 1/3 of 14their number to serve for terms of 2 years, 1/3 of their number 15to serve for terms of 4 years and 1/3 of their number to serve 16for terms of 6 years, any odd number of commissioners so 17determined by dividing into thirds to serve 6 year terms, and 18(B) the commissioners first appointed pursuant to paragraph 19(iii) of this subsection shall determine publicly by lot 1/3 20of their number to serve for terms of 2 years, 1/3 of their 21number to serve for terms of 4 years and 1/3 of their number to 22serve for terms of 6 years, any odd number of commissioners so 23determined by dividing into thirds to serve 6 year terms.

Any commissioner may be a member of the   SB1887- 9 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1governing board or an officer or employee of such county or any 2unit of local government within such county. A commissioner is 3eligible for reappointment upon the expiration of his term. A 4vacancy in the office of a commissioner shall be filled for the 5balance of the unexpired term by appointment and qualification 6as to residency in the same manner as the original appointment 7was made. Each commissioner shall receive the same 8compensation which shall not be more than $10,000 $600 per 9year, except that no such commissioner who is a member of the 10governing board or an officer or employee of such county or any 11unit of local government within such county may receive any 12compensation for serving as a commissioner.

A conviction is cause for the removal of a person 3from his office or employment.4    (d) Except as provided in subsection (g), subject to the 5referendum provided for in subsection (e), a county water 6commission may borrow money for corporate purposes on the 7credit of the commission, and issue general obligation bonds 8therefor, in such amounts and form and on such conditions as it 9shall prescribe, but shall not become indebted in any manner 10or for any purpose in an amount including existing 11indebtedness in the aggregate to exceed 5.75% of the aggregate 12value of the taxable property within the territorial 13boundaries of the county water commission, as equalized and 14assessed by the Department of Revenue and as most recently 15available at the time of the issue of said bonds. Before or at 16the time of incurring any indebtedness, except as provided in 17subsection (g), the commission shall provide for the 18collection of a direct annual tax, which shall be unlimited as 19to rate or amount, sufficient to pay the interest on such debt 20as it falls due and also to pay and discharge the principal 21thereof at maturity, which shall be within 40 years after the 22date of issue thereof. Such tax shall be levied upon and 23collected from all of the taxable property within the 24territory of the county water commission. Dissolution of the 25county water commission for any reason shall not relieve the 26taxable property within such territory of the county water   SB1887- 11 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1commission from liability for such tax. The clerk of the 2commission shall file a certified copy of the resolution or 3ordinance by which such bonds are authorized to be issued and 4such tax is levied with the County Clerk of each county in 5which any of the territory of the county water commission is 6located and such filing shall constitute, without the doing of 7any other act, full and complete authority for each such 8County Clerk to extend such tax for collection upon all the 9taxable property within the territory of the county water 10commission subject to such tax in each and every year required 11sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on such bonds, 12as aforesaid, without limit as to rate or amount, and shall be 13in addition to and in excess of all other taxes authorized to 14be levied by the commission or any included unit. The general 15obligation bonds shall be issued pursuant to an ordinance or 16resolution and may be issued in one or more series, and shall 17bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times and in 18any event not more than 40 years from the date thereof, be sold 19at such price at private or public sale as determined by a 20county water commission, bear interest at such rate or rates 21such that the net effective interest rate received upon the 22sale of such bonds does not exceed the maximum rate determined 23under Section 2 of the Bond Authorization Act, which rates may 24be fixed or variable, be in such denominations, be in such 25form, either coupon or registered, carry such conversion, 26registration, and exchange privileges, be executed in such   SB1887- 12 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1manner, be payable in such medium of payment at such place or 2places within or without the State of Illinois, be subject to 3such terms of redemption, and contain or be subject to such 4other terms as the ordinance or resolution may provide, and 5shall not be restricted by the provisions of any other terms of 6obligations of public agencies or private persons.7    (e) No issue of general obligation bonds by a county water 8commission (except bonds to refund an existing bonded 9indebtedness) shall be authorized unless the commission 10certifies the proposition of issuing such bonds to the proper 11election officials, who shall submit the proposition to the 12voters at an election in accordance with the general election 13law, and the proposition has been approved by a majority of 14those voting on the proposition.15    The proposition shall be in the form provided in Section 5 16or shall be substantially in the following form:17-------------18  Shall general obligation 19  bonds for the purpose of 20  (state purpose), in the           YES 21  sum of $....(insert amount),  ----------------------------- 22  be issued by the .........        NO 23  (insert corporate name of 24  the county water commission)? 25-------------------------------------------------------------26    (f) In order to carry out and perform its powers and   SB1887- 13 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1functions and duties under the provisions of this Act and 2Division 135 of the Illinois Municipal Code, as modified and 3supplemented by this Act, the governing body of any county 4water commission may by ordinance levy annually upon all 5taxable property within its territory a tax at a rate not to 6exceed .005% of the value of such property, as equalized or 7assessed by the Department of Revenue for the year in which the 8levy is made. In addition, any county water commission may by 9ordinance levy upon all taxable property within its territory, 10for one year only, an additional tax for such purposes at a 11rate not to exceed .20% of the value of such property, as 12equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue for that 13year; provided, however, that such tax may not be levied more 14than once in any county water commission.15    (g) Any county water commission shall have the power to 16borrow money, subject to the indebtedness limitation provided 17in subsection (d), from the home county or included units, in 18such amounts and in such terms as agreed by the governing 19bodies of the commission and the home county or included 20units.21    (h) No county water commission constituted pursuant to the 22Act shall engage in the retail sale or distribution of water to 23residents or customers of any municipality.24    (i) Nothing in the Section requires any municipality to 25contract with a county water commission for a supply of water.26    (j) The State of Illinois recognizes that any such   SB1887- 14 -LRB104 07722 RTM 17767 b1contract for the supply of water executed by a unit of local 2government and a county water commission may contain terms and 3conditions intended by the parties thereto to be absolute 4conditions thereof. The State of Illinois also recognizes that 5persons may loan funds to a county water commission 6(including, without limitation, the purchase of revenue or 7general obligation bonds of such commission) in reliance upon 8the terms and conditions of any such contract for the supply of 9water. Therefore, the State of Illinois pledges and agrees to 10those parties and persons which make loans of funds to a county 11water commission that it will not impair or limit the power or 12ability of a county water commission or a unit of local 13government fully to carry out the financial obligations and 14obligation to furnish water pursuant to the terms of any 15contract for the supply of water entered into by such county 16water commission or unit of local government for the term of 17such contracts or loans. All other terms and conditions of 18such contracts and intergovernmental agreements shall be 19binding to the extent that they are not inconsistent with this 20amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly.21(Source: P.A. 95-114, eff. 1-1-08.) 22    (70 ILCS 3720/6 new)23    Sec. 6.
