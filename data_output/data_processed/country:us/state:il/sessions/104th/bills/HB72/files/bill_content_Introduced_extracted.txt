If the court decides to 6    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 7    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 8    filing of the petition and the hearing.9    (d) Contents of petition.10        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 11    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 12    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 13    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 14    persons or the community, based on the specific 15    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.16        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 17    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 18    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 19    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 20    filing of the previous petition.21    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 22for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 23proving by clear and convincing evidence that:24        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 25    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 26    subsection (a), and  HB0072- 9 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 2    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 3    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 4    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 5    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 6    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 7    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 8    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 9    1986, and10        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 11    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 12    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 13    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 14    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 15    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 16    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 17    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and18        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 19    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 20    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 21    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 22    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 23    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 24    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 25    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 26    appear in court as required.  HB0072- 10 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    (f) Conduct of the hearings.2        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 3    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 4    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 5    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 6    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 7    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 8    hearing.9        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 10    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.11        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 12    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 13    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 14    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 15    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 16    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 17    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 18    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 19    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 20    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 21    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 22    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 23    conducted via a two-way audio-visual communication system, 24    such consultation shall not be recorded and shall be 25    undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 26        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be   HB0072- 11 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 3    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 4    court determines that the physical health and safety of 5    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 6    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 7    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 8    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 9    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 10    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 11    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 12    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 13    Courts every 6 months. 14        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 15    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 16    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 17    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 18    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 19    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 20    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 21    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 22    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 23    the court shall state on the record the reason for 24    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 25    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 26    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the   HB0072- 12 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 2    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 3    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 4    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 5    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 6    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 7    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 8    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 9    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 10    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 11    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 12    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 13    criminal history, if available, and any written or 14    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 15    statements made by any person, if in the State's 16    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 17        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 18    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 19    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 20    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 21    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 22    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 23    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 24    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 25    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.26        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or   HB0072- 13 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 2    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 3    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 4    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 5    the defendant.6        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 7    release, and detention prior to trial must be 8    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 9    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 10    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 11    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 12dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 13defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 14person or persons or the community, based on the specific 15articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 16limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:17        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 18    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 19    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.20        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 21    including:22            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 23        history indicative of violent, abusive or assaultive 24        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 25        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 26        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil   HB0072- 14 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.2            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 3        psychiatric or other similar social history which 4        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 5        nature, or lack of any such history.6        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 7    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 8    nature of the threat.9        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 10    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 11    them.12        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.13        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 14    complaining witness. 15        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 16    access to any weapon or weapons.17        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 18    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 19    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release or 20    other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 21    appeal or completion of sentence for an offense under 22    federal or state law.23        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 24    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 25    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 26    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior,   HB0072- 15 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    or lack of such behavior.2    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 3detention:4        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 5    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 6    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 7    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 8    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 9    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 10    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;11        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 12    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 13    pending trial;14        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 15    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 16    communication with others of his or her choice by 17    visitation, mail and telephone; and18        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 19    required for appearances in connection with court 20    proceedings.21    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 22detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 23Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 24offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 25on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 26is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by   HB0072- 16 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 2release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 3any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 4the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 5from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 6good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.7    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 8before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 9is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 10of any person or persons or the community, based on the 11specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 12defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 13    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 14entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 15denying his or her pretrial release.16    (k) Appeal. The State may appeal any order entered under 17this Section denying any motion for denial of pretrial 18release.19    (l) Presumption of innocence.

If there is a finding of no 14probable cause, the defendant shall be released.

The Court may deny or 7    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 8    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 9    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 10    filing of the petition and the hearing.11    (d) Contents of petition.12        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 13    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 14    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 15    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 16    persons or the community, based on the specific 17    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.18        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 19    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 20    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 21    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 22    filing of the previous petition.23    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 24for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 25proving by clear and convincing evidence that:26        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that   HB0072- 25 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 2    subsection (a), and3        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 4    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 5    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 6    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 7    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 8    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 9    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 10    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 11    1986, and12        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 13    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 14    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 15    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 16    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 17    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 18    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 19    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and20        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 21    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 22    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 23    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 24    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 25    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 26    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of   HB0072- 26 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 2    appear in court as required.3    (f) Conduct of the hearings.4        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 5    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 6    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 7    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 8    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 9    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 10    hearing.11        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 12    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.13        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 14    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 15    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 16    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 17    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 18    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 19    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 20    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 21    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 22    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 23    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 24    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 25    conducted via a two-way audio-visual communication system, 26    such consultation shall not be recorded and shall be   HB0072- 27 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 2        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 3    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 4    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 5    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 6    court determines that the physical health and safety of 7    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 8    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 9    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 10    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 11    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 12    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 13    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 14    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 15    Courts every 6 months. 16        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 17    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 18    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 19    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 20    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 21    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 22    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 23    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 24    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 25    the court shall state on the record the reason for 26    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a   HB0072- 28 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 2    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 3    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 4    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 5    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 6    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 7    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 8    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 9    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 10    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 11    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 12    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 13    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 14    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 15    criminal history, if available, and any written or 16    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 17    statements made by any person, if in the State's 18    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 19        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 20    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 21    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 22    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 23    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 24    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 25    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 26    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this   HB0072- 29 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.2        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 3    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 4    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 5    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 6    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 7    the defendant.8        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 9    release, and detention prior to trial must be 10    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 11    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 12    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 13    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 14dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 15defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 16person or persons or the community, based on the specific 17articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 18limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:19        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 20    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 21    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.22        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 23    including:24            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 25        history indicative of violent, abusive or assaultive 26        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may   HB0072- 30 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 2        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 3        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.4            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 5        psychiatric or other similar social history which 6        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 7        nature, or lack of any such history.8        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 9    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 10    nature of the threat.11        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 12    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 13    them.14        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.15        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 16    complaining witness. 17        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 18    access to any weapon or weapons.19        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 20    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 21    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release or 22    other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 23    appeal or completion of sentence for an offense under 24    federal or state law.25        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 26    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a   HB0072- 31 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 2    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 3    or lack of such behavior.4    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 5detention:6        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 7    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 8    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 9    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 10    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 11    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 12    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;13        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 14    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 15    pending trial;16        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 17    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 18    communication with others of his or her choice by 19    visitation, mail and telephone; and20        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 21    required for appearances in connection with court 22    proceedings.23    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 24detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 25Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 26offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date   HB0072- 32 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 2is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 3the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 4release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 5any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 6the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 7from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 8good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.9    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 10before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 11is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 12of any person or persons or the community, based on the 13specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 14defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 15    (j) Rights of the defendant. The defendant shall be 16entitled to appeal any order entered under this Section 17denying his or her pretrial release.18    (k) Appeal. The State may appeal any order entered under 19this Section denying any motion for denial of pretrial 20release.21    (l) Presumption of innocence. Nothing in this Section 22shall be construed as modifying or limiting in any way the 23defendant's presumption of innocence in further criminal 24proceedings.25    (m) Interest of victims. 26    (1) Crime victims shall be given notice by the State's   HB0072- 33 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1Attorney's office of this hearing as required in paragraph (1) 2of subsection (b) of Section 4.5 of the Rights of Crime Victims 3and Witnesses Act and shall be informed of their opportunity 4at this hearing to obtain a protective order. 5    (2) If the defendant is denied pretrial release, the court 6may impose a no contact provision with the victim or other 7interested party that shall be enforced while the defendant 8remains in custody. 9(Source: P.A. 102-1104, eff. 1-1-23; 103-822, eff. 1-1-25.) 10    (725 ILCS 5/111-2.5 new)11    Sec. 111-2.5.

GENERAL RECIDIVISM PROVISIONS.10    (a) HABITUAL CRIMINALS.11        (1) Every person who has been twice convicted in any 12    state or federal court of an offense that contains the 13    same elements as an offense now (the date of the offense 14    committed after the 2 prior convictions) classified in 15    Illinois as a Class X felony, criminal sexual assault, 16    aggravated kidnapping, or first degree murder, and who is 17    thereafter convicted of a Class X felony, criminal sexual 18    assault, or first degree murder, committed after the 2 19    prior convictions, shall be adjudged an habitual criminal.20        (2) The 2 prior convictions need not have been for the 21    same offense.22        (3) Any convictions that result from or are connected 23    with the same transaction, or result from offenses 24    committed at the same time, shall be counted for the   HB0072- 36 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    purposes of this Section as one conviction.2        (4) This Section does not apply unless each of the 3    following requirements are satisfied:4            (A) The third offense was committed after July 3, 5        1980.6            (B) The third offense was committed within 20 7        years of the date that judgment was entered on the 8        first conviction; provided, however, that time spent 9        in custody shall not be counted.10            (C) The third offense was committed after 11        conviction on the second offense.12            (D) The second offense was committed after 13        conviction on the first offense.14            (E) The first offense was committed when the 15        person was 21 years of age or older. 16        (5) Anyone who is adjudged an habitual criminal shall 17    be sentenced to a term of natural life imprisonment.18        (6) A prior conviction shall not be alleged in the 19    indictment, and no evidence or other disclosure of that 20    conviction shall be presented to the court or the jury 21    during the trial of an offense set forth in this Section 22    unless otherwise permitted by the issues properly raised 23    in that trial. After a plea or verdict or finding of guilty 24    and before sentence is imposed, the prosecutor may file 25    with the court a verified written statement signed by the 26    State's Attorney concerning any former conviction of an   HB0072- 37 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    offense set forth in this Section rendered against the 2    defendant. The court shall then cause the defendant to be 3    brought before it; shall inform the defendant of the 4    allegations of the statement so filed, and of his or her 5    right to a hearing before the court on the issue of that 6    former conviction and of his or her right to counsel at 7    that hearing; and unless the defendant admits such 8    conviction, shall hear and determine the issue, and shall 9    make a written finding thereon. If a sentence has 10    previously been imposed, the court may vacate that 11    sentence and impose a new sentence in accordance with this 12    Section.13        (7) A duly authenticated copy of the record of any 14    alleged former conviction of an offense set forth in this 15    Section shall be prima facie evidence of that former 16    conviction; and a duly authenticated copy of the record of 17    the defendant's final release or discharge from probation 18    granted, or from sentence and parole supervision (if any) 19    imposed pursuant to that former conviction, shall be prima 20    facie evidence of that release or discharge.21        (8) Any claim that a previous conviction offered by 22    the prosecution is not a former conviction of an offense 23    set forth in this Section because of the existence of any 24    exceptions described in this Section, is waived unless 25    duly raised at the hearing on that conviction, or unless 26    the prosecution's proof shows the existence of the   HB0072- 38 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    exceptions described in this Section.2        (9) If the person so convicted shows to the 3    satisfaction of the court before whom that conviction was 4    had that he or she was released from imprisonment, upon 5    either of the sentences upon a pardon granted for the 6    reason that he or she was innocent, that conviction and 7    sentence shall not be considered under this Section. 8    (b) When a defendant, over the age of 21 years, is 9convicted of a Class 1 or Class 2 forcible felony after having 10twice been convicted in any state or federal court of an 11offense that contains the same elements as an offense now (the 12date the Class 1 or Class 2 forcible felony was committed) 13classified in Illinois as a Class 2 or greater Class forcible 14felony and those charges are separately brought and tried and 15arise out of different series of acts, that defendant shall be 16sentenced as a Class X offender.

If the court decides to 6    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 7    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 8    filing of the petition and the hearing.9    (d) Contents of petition.10        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 11    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 12    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 13    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 14    persons or the community, based on the specific 15    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.16        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 17    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 18    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 19    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 20    filing of the previous petition.21    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 22for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 23proving by clear and convincing evidence that:24        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that 25    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 26    subsection (a), and  HB0072- 9 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 2    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 3    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 4    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 5    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 6    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 7    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 8    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 9    1986, and10        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 11    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 12    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 13    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 14    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 15    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 16    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 17    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and18        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 19    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 20    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 21    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 22    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 23    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 24    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of 25    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 26    appear in court as required.  HB0072- 10 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    (f) Conduct of the hearings.2        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 3    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 4    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 5    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 6    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 7    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 8    hearing.9        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 10    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.11        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 12    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 13    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 14    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 15    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 16    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 17    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 18    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 19    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 20    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 21    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 22    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 23    conducted via a two-way audio-visual communication system, 24    such consultation shall not be recorded and shall be 25    undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 26        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be   HB0072- 11 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 3    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 4    court determines that the physical health and safety of 5    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 6    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 7    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 8    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 9    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 10    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 11    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 12    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 13    Courts every 6 months. 14        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 15    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 16    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 17    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 18    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 19    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 20    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 21    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 22    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 23    the court shall state on the record the reason for 24    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 25    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 26    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the   HB0072- 12 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 2    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 3    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 4    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 5    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 6    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 7    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 8    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 9    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 10    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 11    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 12    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 13    criminal history, if available, and any written or 14    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 15    statements made by any person, if in the State's 16    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 17        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 18    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 19    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 20    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 21    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 22    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 23    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 24    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 25    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.26        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or   HB0072- 13 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 2    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 3    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 4    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 5    the defendant.6        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 7    release, and detention prior to trial must be 8    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 9    used exclusively to order detention.

The court shall, in any order for 3detention:4        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 5    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 6    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 7    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 8    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 9    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 10    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;11        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 12    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 13    pending trial;14        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 15    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 16    communication with others of his or her choice by 17    visitation, mail and telephone; and18        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 19    required for appearances in connection with court 20    proceedings.21    (i) Detention.

The Court may deny or 7    grant the request for continuance. If the court decides to 8    grant the continuance, the Court retains the discretion to 9    detain or release the defendant in the time between the 10    filing of the petition and the hearing.11    (d) Contents of petition.12        (1) The petition shall be verified by the State and 13    shall state the grounds upon which it contends the 14    defendant should be denied pretrial release, including the 15    real and present threat to the safety of any person or 16    persons or the community, based on the specific 17    articulable facts or flight risk, as appropriate.18        (2) If the State seeks to file a second or subsequent 19    petition under this Section, the State shall be required 20    to present a verified application setting forth in detail 21    any new facts not known or obtainable at the time of the 22    filing of the previous petition.23    (e) Eligibility: All defendants shall be presumed eligible 24for pretrial release, and the State shall bear the burden of 25proving by clear and convincing evidence that:26        (1) the proof is evident or the presumption great that   HB0072- 25 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    the defendant has committed an offense listed in 2    subsection (a), and3        (2) for offenses listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) 4    of subsection (a), the defendant poses a real and present 5    threat to the safety of any person or persons or the 6    community, based on the specific articulable facts of the 7    case, by conduct which may include, but is not limited to, 8    a forcible felony, the obstruction of justice, 9    intimidation, injury, or abuse as defined by paragraph (1) 10    of Section 103 of the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 11    1986, and12        (3) no condition or combination of conditions set 13    forth in subsection (b) of Section 110-10 of this Article 14    can mitigate (i) the real and present threat to the safety 15    of any person or persons or the community, based on the 16    specific articulable facts of the case, for offenses 17    listed in paragraphs (1) through (7) of subsection (a), or 18    (ii) the defendant's willful flight for offenses listed in 19    paragraph (8) of subsection (a), and20        (4) for offenses under subsection (b) of Section 407 21    of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act that are subject 22    to paragraph (1) of subsection (a), no condition or 23    combination of conditions set forth in subsection (b) of 24    Section 110-10 of this Article can mitigate the real and 25    present threat to the safety of any person or persons or 26    the community, based on the specific articulable facts of   HB0072- 26 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    the case, and the defendant poses a serious risk to not 2    appear in court as required.3    (f) Conduct of the hearings.4        (1) Prior to the hearing, the State shall tender to 5    the defendant copies of the defendant's criminal history 6    available, any written or recorded statements, and the 7    substance of any oral statements made by any person, if 8    relied upon by the State in its petition, and any police 9    reports in the prosecutor's possession at the time of the 10    hearing.11        (2) The State or defendant may present evidence at the 12    hearing by way of proffer based upon reliable information.13        (3) The defendant has the right to be represented by 14    counsel, and if he or she is indigent, to have counsel 15    appointed for him or her. The defendant shall have the 16    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 17    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 18    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 19    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 20    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 21    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 22    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 23    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 24    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 25    conducted via a two-way audio-visual communication system, 26    such consultation shall not be recorded and shall be   HB0072- 27 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 2        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 3    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 4    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 5    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 6    court determines that the physical health and safety of 7    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 8    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 9    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 10    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 11    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 12    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 13    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 14    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 15    Courts every 6 months. 16        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 17    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 18    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 19    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 20    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 21    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 22    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 23    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 24    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 25    the court shall state on the record the reason for 26    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a   HB0072- 28 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 2    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 3    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 4    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 5    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 6    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is 7    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 8    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 9    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 10    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 11    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 12    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 13    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 14    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 15    criminal history, if available, and any written or 16    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 17    statements made by any person, if in the State's 18    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 19        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 20    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 21    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 22    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 23    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 24    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 25    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 26    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this   HB0072- 29 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.2        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 3    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 4    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 5    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 6    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against 7    the defendant.8        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 9    release, and detention prior to trial must be 10    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 11    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 12    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 13    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 14dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 15defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 16person or persons or the community, based on the specific 17articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 18limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:19        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 20    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 21    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.22        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 23    including:24            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 25        history indicative of violent, abusive or assaultive 26        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may   HB0072- 30 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 2        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 3        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.4            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 5        psychiatric or other similar social history which 6        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive 7        nature, or lack of any such history.8        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 9    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 10    nature of the threat.11        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 12    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 13    them.14        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.15        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 16    complaining witness. 17        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 18    access to any weapon or weapons.19        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 20    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 21    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release or 22    other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 23    appeal or completion of sentence for an offense under 24    federal or state law.25        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 26    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a   HB0072- 31 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 2    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 3    or lack of such behavior.4    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 5detention:6        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's 7    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 8    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 9    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 10    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 11    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 12    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;13        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 14    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 15    pending trial;16        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 17    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 18    communication with others of his or her choice by 19    visitation, mail and telephone; and20        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 21    required for appearances in connection with court 22    proceedings.23    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 24detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 25Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 26offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date   HB0072- 32 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1on which the order for detention was entered. If the defendant 2is not brought to trial within the 90-day period required by 3the preceding sentence, he shall not be denied pretrial 4release. In computing the 90-day period, the court shall omit 5any period of delay resulting from a continuance granted at 6the request of the defendant and any period of delay resulting 7from a continuance granted at the request of the State with 8good cause shown pursuant to Section 103-5.9    (i-5) At each subsequent appearance of the defendant 10before the court, the judge must find that continued detention 11is necessary to avoid a real and present threat to the safety 12of any person or persons or the community, based on the 13specific articulable facts of the case, or to prevent the 14defendant's willful flight from prosecution. 15    (j) Rights of the defendant.

GENERAL RECIDIVISM PROVISIONS.10    (a) HABITUAL CRIMINALS.11        (1) Every person who has been twice convicted in any 12    state or federal court of an offense that contains the 13    same elements as an offense now (the date of the offense 14    committed after the 2 prior convictions) classified in 15    Illinois as a Class X felony, criminal sexual assault, 16    aggravated kidnapping, or first degree murder, and who is 17    thereafter convicted of a Class X felony, criminal sexual 18    assault, or first degree murder, committed after the 2 19    prior convictions, shall be adjudged an habitual criminal.20        (2) The 2 prior convictions need not have been for the 21    same offense.22        (3) Any convictions that result from or are connected 23    with the same transaction, or result from offenses 24    committed at the same time, shall be counted for the   HB0072- 36 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    purposes of this Section as one conviction.2        (4) This Section does not apply unless each of the 3    following requirements are satisfied:4            (A) The third offense was committed after July 3, 5        1980.6            (B) The third offense was committed within 20 7        years of the date that judgment was entered on the 8        first conviction; provided, however, that time spent 9        in custody shall not be counted.10            (C) The third offense was committed after 11        conviction on the second offense.12            (D) The second offense was committed after 13        conviction on the first offense.14            (E) The first offense was committed when the 15        person was 21 years of age or older. 16        (5) Anyone who is adjudged an habitual criminal shall 17    be sentenced to a term of natural life imprisonment.18        (6) A prior conviction shall not be alleged in the 19    indictment, and no evidence or other disclosure of that 20    conviction shall be presented to the court or the jury 21    during the trial of an offense set forth in this Section 22    unless otherwise permitted by the issues properly raised 23    in that trial. After a plea or verdict or finding of guilty 24    and before sentence is imposed, the prosecutor may file 25    with the court a verified written statement signed by the 26    State's Attorney concerning any former conviction of an   HB0072- 37 -LRB104 03322 RLC 13344 b1    offense set forth in this Section rendered against the 2    defendant. The court shall then cause the defendant to be 3    brought before it; shall inform the defendant of the 4    allegations of the statement so filed, and of his or her 5    right to a hearing before the court on the issue of that 6    former conviction and of his or her right to counsel at 7    that hearing; and unless the defendant admits such 8    conviction, shall hear and determine the issue, and shall 9    make a written finding thereon.
