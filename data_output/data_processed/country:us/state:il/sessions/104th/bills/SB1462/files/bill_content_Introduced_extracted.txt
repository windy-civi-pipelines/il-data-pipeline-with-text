"New benefit increase", 12however, does not include any benefit increase resulting from 13the changes made to Article 1 or this Article by Public Act 1496-37, Public Act 100-23, Public Act 100-587, Public Act 15100-611, Public Act 101-10, Public Act 101-610, Public Act 16102-210, Public Act 102-856, Public Act 102-956, or this 17amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly this amendatory 18Act of the 102nd General Assembly. 19    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code or 20any subsequent amendment to this Code, every new benefit 21increase is subject to this Section and shall be deemed to be 22granted only in conformance with and contingent upon 23compliance with the provisions of this Section. 24    (c) The Public Act enacting a new benefit increase must 25identify and provide for payment to the System of additional   SB1462- 93 -LRB104 07532 RPS 17576 b1funding at least sufficient to fund the resulting annual 2increase in cost to the System as it accrues.3    Every new benefit increase is contingent upon the General 4Assembly providing the additional funding required under this 5subsection.

A new benefit increase created by 10a Public Act that does not include the additional funding 11required under this subsection is null and void. If the Public 12Pension Division determines that the additional funding 13provided for a new benefit increase under this subsection is 14or has become inadequate, it may so certify to the Governor and 15the State Comptroller and, in the absence of corrective action 16by the General Assembly, the new benefit increase shall expire 17at the end of the fiscal year in which the certification is 18made. 19    (d) Every new benefit increase shall expire 5 years after 20its effective date or on such earlier date as may be specified 21in the language enacting the new benefit increase or provided 22under subsection (c).

"New benefit increase", 12however, does not include any benefit increase resulting from 13the changes made to Article 1 or this Article by Public Act 1496-37, Public Act 100-23, Public Act 100-587, Public Act 15100-611, Public Act 101-10, Public Act 101-610, Public Act 16102-210, Public Act 102-856, Public Act 102-956, or this 17amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly this amendatory 18Act of the 102nd General Assembly. 19    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code or 20any subsequent amendment to this Code, every new benefit 21increase is subject to this Section and shall be deemed to be 22granted only in conformance with and contingent upon 23compliance with the provisions of this Section. 24    (c) The Public Act enacting a new benefit increase must 25identify and provide for payment to the System of additional   SB1462- 93 -LRB104 07532 RPS 17576 b1funding at least sufficient to fund the resulting annual 2increase in cost to the System as it accrues.3    Every new benefit increase is contingent upon the General 4Assembly providing the additional funding required under this 5subsection. The Commission on Government Forecasting and 6Accountability shall analyze whether adequate additional 7funding has been provided for the new benefit increase and 8shall report its analysis to the Public Pension Division of 9the Department of Insurance. A new benefit increase created by 10a Public Act that does not include the additional funding 11required under this subsection is null and void. If the Public 12Pension Division determines that the additional funding 13provided for a new benefit increase under this subsection is 14or has become inadequate, it may so certify to the Governor and 15the State Comptroller and, in the absence of corrective action 16by the General Assembly, the new benefit increase shall expire 17at the end of the fiscal year in which the certification is 18made. 19    (d) Every new benefit increase shall expire 5 years after 20its effective date or on such earlier date as may be specified 21in the language enacting the new benefit increase or provided 22under subsection (c). This does not prevent the General 23Assembly from extending or re-creating a new benefit increase 24by law.25    (e) Except as otherwise provided in the language creating 26the new benefit increase, a new benefit increase that expires   SB1462- 94 -LRB104 07532 RPS 17576 b1under this Section continues to apply to persons who applied 2and qualified for the affected benefit while the new benefit 3increase was in effect and to the affected beneficiaries and 4alternate payees of such persons, but does not apply to any 5other person, including, without limitation, a person who 6continues in service after the expiration date and did not 7apply and qualify for the affected benefit while the new 8benefit increase was in effect.9(Source: P.A. 101-10, eff. 6-5-19; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19; 10101-610, eff. 1-1-20; 102-210, eff. 7-30-21; 102-856, eff. 111-1-23; 102-956, eff. 5-27-22.) 12    Section 90.
