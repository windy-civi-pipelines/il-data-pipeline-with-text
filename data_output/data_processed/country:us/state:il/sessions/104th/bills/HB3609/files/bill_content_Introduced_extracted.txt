Effective immediately.LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b  A BILL FOR HB3609LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be referred to as the 5Thermal Energy Network and Jobs Act. 6    Section 5. Legislative findings and intent.7    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that:8        (1) This State has a strong interest in ensuring that 9    emissions of greenhouse gases from buildings are reduced 10    because buildings are one of this State's largest sources 11    of greenhouse gases due to the combustion of fossil fuels 12    for heating, domestic hot water production, cooking, and 13    other end uses.14        (2) The decarbonization of buildings must be pursued 15    in a manner that is affordable and accessible, preserves 16    and creates living-wage jobs, and retains the knowledge 17    and experience of the existing utility union workforce.18        (3) Thermal energy networks have the potential to 19    decarbonize buildings at the community and utility scale 20    and help achieve the goals of Public Act 102-662 (also 21    known as the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act).22        (4) Thermal energy networks consist of pipe loops 23    between multiple buildings and energy sources, which carry   HB3609- 2 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1    water and can be connected to by building owners to 2    support heating and cooling and hot water services. 3    Building owners can connect to the loops to support water 4    heating and cooling and hot water services.5        (5) Many utilities in this State have been seeking to 6    develop thermal energy networks but have encountered legal 7    and regulatory barriers.8        (6) This State has a strong interest in ensuring an 9    adequate supply of reliable electrical power and, 10    therefore, needs to promote the development of alternative 11    power sources and take steps to assure reliable 12    deliverability. Thermal energy networks are highly 13    efficient because they use and exchange thermal energy 14    from many underground sources and buildings, including 15    recycled thermal energy, which minimizes impacts on the 16    electricity grid.17        (7) Access to thermal energy networks has the 18    potential to reduce the upfront and operating costs of 19    building electrification for customers.20        (8) Thermal loop technology provides benefits to 21    participants and non-participants alike including societal 22    benefits to the environment and the market benefits 23    associated with the reduction of both the volume and peak 24    demand of electricity and natural gas.25        (9) A utility's access to capital, the utility's 26    experience with networked infrastructure in public   HB3609- 3 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1    rights-of-way, and the requirement that the utility serve 2    all customers positions the utility well to develop and 3    scale thermal energy networks that are accessible to all 4    customers and to coordinate the development of thermal 5    energy networks with any orderly rightsizing of the 6    utility gas system.7        (10) This State also has an interest in the efficient 8    and reliable delivery of energy and the energy 9    infrastructure of the State, which interest is 10    acknowledged throughout the Public Utilities Act. Utility 11    corporations and other power suppliers share these 12    interests and, moreover, have a duty to protect 13    proprietary interests in the projects they fund. Such 14    investments of ratepayer resources can be protected by 15    establishing effective contractor qualification and 16    performance standards, including requirements for 17    prevailing wage rates, bona fide apprenticeship criteria, 18    and project labor agreements.19        (11) The construction industry is highly skilled and 20    labor intensive, and the installation of modern thermal 21    energy networks involves particularly complex work. 22    Therefore, effective qualification standards for craft 23    labor personnel employed on these projects are critically 24    needed to promote successful project delivery.25        (12) Finally, these findings are especially vital now 26    because the construction industry is experiencing   HB3609- 4 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1    widespread skill shortages across the country, which are 2    crippling existing capital projects and threatening 3    projects planned for the future. The construction of 4    thermal energy networks will utilize many of the same 5    skills that the current utility and building trades 6    workforces already possess.7    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that passage 8of this Act is for the following purposes:9        (1) to remove the legal barriers to utility 10    development of thermal energy networks and require the 11    Illinois Commerce Commission, within 90 days after the 12    effective date of this amendatory Act of the 104th General 13    Assembly, to begin to authorize and direct utilities to 14    immediately commence piloting thermal energy networks in 15    each and every utility territory;16        (2) to direct and authorize the Illinois Commerce 17    Commission to develop a regulatory structure for utility 18    thermal energy networks that scales affordable and 19    accessible building electrification, protects customers, 20    and balances the role of incumbent monopoly utilities with 21    other market and public actors;22        (3) to promote the successful planning and delivery of 23    thermal energy networks and protect critical investments 24    in such projects by requiring the use of appropriate 25    quality craft labor policies that ensure the development 26    of and access to an adequate supply of well trained,   HB3609- 5 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1    highly skilled craft persons needed to support timely, 2    reliable, high-quality projects;3        (4) to promote strong economic development and good 4    jobs for local residents in the expanding decarbonized 5    sector by requiring application of progressive State labor 6    and employment policies that ensure public utility 7    investments and related State subsidies create 8    unparalleled skill training and employment opportunities 9    for residents in project areas through the use of local 10    prevailing wage standards and successful, bona fide 11    apprenticeship programs or project labor agreements that 12    incorporate prevailing wage and training standards and 13    provide additional benefits for project owners and 14    workers; and15        (5) to promote the use of preapprenticeship programs 16    that will fortify and expand existing apprenticeship 17    programs through systematic outreach efforts to recruit 18    and assist persons from underrepresented and low income 19    communities by providing such persons with remedial 20    education, social services, and unique opportunities for 21    direct access into high-quality apprenticeship programs 22    and gainful employment in the growing building 23    decarbonization workforce. 24    Section 10. The Public Utilities Act is amended by 25changing Section 3-101 and by adding Sections 3-128, 3-129,   HB3609- 6 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1and 8-513 as follows: 2    (220 ILCS 5/3-101)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 3-101)3    Sec. 3-101.

Designs for the projects should coordinate and 17maximize the value of existing State energy efficiency and 18weatherization programs and take advantage of federal funding 19opportunities to the extent practicable. No later than 18 20months after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 21104th General Assembly, the Commission shall enter an order 22approving, approving with modification, or rejecting each 23proposed pilot thermal energy network project and shall direct 24the public utility to implement the pilot thermal energy 25network projects as approved or approved as modified. In 26considering whether to approve or approve as modified each   HB3609- 8 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1pilot thermal energy network project, the Commission shall 2consider whether the pilot thermal energy network project is 3in the public interest, whether the pilot thermal energy 4network project will develop information useful for the 5Commission in adopting rules governing thermal energy 6networks, whether the pilot thermal energy network project 7furthers climate justice and emissions reduction, whether the 8pilot thermal energy network project advances financial and 9technical approaches to equitable and affordable building 10electrification, and whether the pilot thermal energy network 11project creates benefits to customers and society at large, 12including, but not limited to, public health benefits in areas 13with disproportionate environmental or public health burdens, 14job retention and creation, reliability, and increased 15affordability of renewable thermal energy options. After the 16filing of a petition, a utility may request the Commission to 17grant additional time for pilot development approval, which 18shall be approved for at least 6 months upon request or up to 1912 months upon a showing that additional time would benefit 20pilot development. 21    (c) If a utility proposes 3 pilot thermal energy network 22projects, at least one project shall be proposed in 23economically disadvantaged communities as defined in Section 245-35 of the Energy Transition Act and at least one shall be 25focused on existing electric heat customers. Each public 26utility shall coordinate with other public utilities and   HB3609- 9 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1consultants with expertise on successful pilot projects to 2ensure that the pilot projects are diverse and designed to 3inform the Commission's decisions in the proceeding on the 4various ownership, market, and rate structures for thermal 5energy networks. The pilot project proposals shall be made 6publicly available on the Commission's website. Utilities are 7encouraged to develop plans that enable and facilitate access 8to thermal loop technology benefits, including access by low 9and moderate income households. As part of any pilot project 10proposed pursuant to this Section, a public utility subject to 11this Section may propose to include customer rebates and 12incentives, and associated tariffs and proposed regulatory 13treatment, in a manner similar to what is included in 14Commission-approved electric energy efficiency plans pursuant 15to Section 8-103B of this Act. 16    (d) Any gas public utility, electric public utility, or 17combination public utility constructing or operating a 18Commission-approved pilot thermal energy network project shall 19report to the Commission, on a quarterly basis and until 20completion of the pilot thermal energy network project, as 21determined by the Commission, the status of each pilot thermal 22energy network project.

In 26considering whether to approve or approve as modified each   HB3609- 8 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1pilot thermal energy network project, the Commission shall 2consider whether the pilot thermal energy network project is 3in the public interest, whether the pilot thermal energy 4network project will develop information useful for the 5Commission in adopting rules governing thermal energy 6networks, whether the pilot thermal energy network project 7furthers climate justice and emissions reduction, whether the 8pilot thermal energy network project advances financial and 9technical approaches to equitable and affordable building 10electrification, and whether the pilot thermal energy network 11project creates benefits to customers and society at large, 12including, but not limited to, public health benefits in areas 13with disproportionate environmental or public health burdens, 14job retention and creation, reliability, and increased 15affordability of renewable thermal energy options. After the 16filing of a petition, a utility may request the Commission to 17grant additional time for pilot development approval, which 18shall be approved for at least 6 months upon request or up to 1912 months upon a showing that additional time would benefit 20pilot development. 21    (c) If a utility proposes 3 pilot thermal energy network 22projects, at least one project shall be proposed in 23economically disadvantaged communities as defined in Section 245-35 of the Energy Transition Act and at least one shall be 25focused on existing electric heat customers. Each public 26utility shall coordinate with other public utilities and   HB3609- 9 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1consultants with expertise on successful pilot projects to 2ensure that the pilot projects are diverse and designed to 3inform the Commission's decisions in the proceeding on the 4various ownership, market, and rate structures for thermal 5energy networks. The pilot project proposals shall be made 6publicly available on the Commission's website. Utilities are 7encouraged to develop plans that enable and facilitate access 8to thermal loop technology benefits, including access by low 9and moderate income households. As part of any pilot project 10proposed pursuant to this Section, a public utility subject to 11this Section may propose to include customer rebates and 12incentives, and associated tariffs and proposed regulatory 13treatment, in a manner similar to what is included in 14Commission-approved electric energy efficiency plans pursuant 15to Section 8-103B of this Act. 16    (d) Any gas public utility, electric public utility, or 17combination public utility constructing or operating a 18Commission-approved pilot thermal energy network project shall 19report to the Commission, on a quarterly basis and until 20completion of the pilot thermal energy network project, as 21determined by the Commission, the status of each pilot thermal 22energy network project. The Commission shall post and make 23publicly available the reports on its website. The report 24shall include, but not be limited to: 25        (1) the stage of development of each pilot project; 26        (2) the barriers to development;   HB3609- 10 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1        (3) the number of customers served; 2        (4) the costs of the pilot project; 3        (5) the number of jobs retained or created by the 4    pilot project; and 5        (6) other information the Commission deems to be in 6    the public interest or considers likely to prove useful or 7    relevant to the rulemaking described in subsection (h). 8    (e) Any gas public utility, electric public utility, or 9combination public utility constructing or operating a 10Commission-approved pilot thermal energy network project shall 11demonstrate that it has entered into a labor peace agreement 12with a bona fide labor organization that is actively engaged 13in representing its employees. The labor peace agreement shall 14apply to the employees necessary for the ongoing maintenance 15and operation of the thermal energy network. The labor peace 16agreement shall be an ongoing material condition of 17authorization to maintain and operate the thermal energy 18networks. 19    (f) Any contractor or subcontractor that performs work on 20a pilot thermal energy network under this Section shall be a 21responsible bidder as described in Section 30-22 of the 22Illinois Procurement Code and shall certify that not less than 23prevailing wage, as determined under the Prevailing Wage Act, 24was or will be paid to employees who are engaged in 25construction activities associated with the pilot thermal 26energy network project. The contractor or subcontractor shall   HB3609- 11 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1submit evidence to the Commission that it complied with the 2requirements of this subsection. 3    (g) For any pending application for a thermal energy 4network, the contractor or subcontractor shall submit evidence 5that the contractor or subcontractor has entered into a fully 6executed project labor agreement with the applicable local 7building trades council. The Commission shall not approve any 8pending applications until the contractor or subcontractor has 9submitted the information required under this subsection. 10    (h) Within 4 years after the completion of the 11construction of all thermal energy network projects under this 12Section, the Commission shall adopt rules to, at a minimum: 13        (1) create fair market access rules for thermal energy 14    networks to accept thermal energy and that do not increase 15    greenhouse gas emissions or copollutants; 16        (2) to the extent it is in the public interest to do 17    so, exempt small-scale thermal energy networks from active 18    regulation by the Commission; 19        (3) promote the training and transition of utility 20    workers impacted by this amendatory Act of the 104th 21    General Assembly; and 22        (4) encourage third-party participation and 23    competition where it will maximize benefits to customers. 24    (i) A gas public utility, electric public utility, or 25combination public utility required to develop any pilot 26thermal energy network project under this Section shall be   HB3609- 12 -LRB104 12086 AAS 22184 b1permitted to recover all reasonable and prudently incurred 2costs associated with the development, construction, and 3operation of one or more pilot thermal energy network projects 4through general rates set pursuant to Section 9-201 or through 5rates set in a Multi-Year Rate Plan pursuant to Section 616-108.18. The Commission shall have broad discretion in 7approving proposed pilot projects that are consistent with the 8public interest consistent with this Section and in approving 9all tariffs and issue other regulatory approvals as necessary 10to permit a pilot program that facilitates a full review of 11technologies, and associated policies, with respect to thermal 12network technology in this State.  13    Section 99.
