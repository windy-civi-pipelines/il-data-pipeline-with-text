The State 22    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 23    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 24    that the exemption holder has made a material 25    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 26    or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000   HB3694- 14 -LRB104 08047 RPS 18093 b1    gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 2    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 3    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 4    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 5    spirits.6        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 7    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 8    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 9    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 10    production and sales information of a self-distribution 11    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 12    such information to any person.13        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 14    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 15    this Section and this Act.16        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 17    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 18    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 19    licensed Illinois distributor.20        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 21    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 22    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 23    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 24    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 25    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 26    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small   HB3694- 15 -LRB104 08047 RPS 18093 b1    for distributor or importing distributor business 2    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 3    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 4    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 5    integrity of the 3-tier system. 6        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be 7    either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer 8    and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of 9    beer, may make application to the State Commission for a 10    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 11    than 232,500 gallons per year of the exemption holder's 12    beer to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, 13    and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of 14    Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or any 15    combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries.16        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 17    penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall 18    state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of 19    beer manufactured and sold for each year since its 20    establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor 21    relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 22    necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) 23    that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and 24    revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any 25    other state where it is licensed.26        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the   HB3694- 16 -LRB104 08047 RPS 18093 b1    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 2    action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall 3    approve the application for a self-distribution exemption 4    if the class 1 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with 5    the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is 6    not a member of any affiliated group that manufactures, 7    directly or indirectly, more than 930,000 gallons of beer 8    per annum, 25,000 gallons of wine per annum, or 50,000 9    gallons of spirits per annum; (3) shall not annually 10    manufacture for sale more than 930,000 gallons of beer, 11    25,000 gallons of wine, or 50,000 gallons of spirits; (4) 12    shall not annually sell more than 232,500 gallons of its 13    beer to retail licensees and class 3 brewers and to 14    brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, 15    pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, 16    sell beer, cider, mead, or any combination thereof to 17    non-licensees at their breweries; and (5) has relinquished 18    any brew pub license held by the licensee, including any 19    ownership interest it held in the licensed brew pub.20        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall 21    annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture 22    of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated 23    manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months.

The State 22    Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a 23    self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds 24    that the exemption holder has made a material 25    misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue 26    or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000   HB3694- 14 -LRB104 08047 RPS 18093 b1    gallons of wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 2    gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or become part of 3    an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of 4    wine, 930,000 gallons of beer, or 50,000 gallons of 5    spirits.6        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or 7    Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly 8    sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or 9    its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the 10    production and sales information of a self-distribution 11    exemption holder as confidential and shall not release 12    such information to any person.13        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations 14    governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with 15    this Section and this Act.16        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a 17    self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or 18    simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a 19    licensed Illinois distributor.20        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to promote 21    and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds 22    that, in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory 23    distribution system, it is necessary to create an 24    exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are 25    frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and 26    taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small   HB3694- 15 -LRB104 08047 RPS 18093 b1    for distributor or importing distributor business 2    strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford 3    and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace 4    in order to develop a customer base without impairing the 5    integrity of the 3-tier system. 6        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be 7    either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer 8    and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of 9    beer, may make application to the State Commission for a 10    self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more 11    than 232,500 gallons per year of the exemption holder's 12    beer to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, 13    and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of 14    Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, mead, or any 15    combination thereof to non-licensees at their breweries.16        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under 17    penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall 18    state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of 19    beer manufactured and sold for each year since its 20    establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor 21    relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is 22    necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) 23    that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and 24    revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any 25    other state where it is licensed.26        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the   HB3694- 16 -LRB104 08047 RPS 18093 b1    State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to 2    action by the State Commission.
