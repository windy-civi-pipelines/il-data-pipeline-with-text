The difference 13between the rate base and the purchase price or fair market 14value shall be borne by the shareholders of the acquiring 15large public utility. The reasonable transaction and closing 16costs incurred by the large public utility shall be treated 17consistent with the applicable accounting standards under this 18Act. The total amount of all of the appraisers' fees to be 19included in the transaction and closing costs shall not exceed 20the greater of $15,000 or 5% of the appraised value of the 21water or sewer utility being acquired. This rate base 22treatment shall not be deemed to violate this Act, including, 23but not limited to, any Sections in Articles VIII and IX of 24this Act that might be affected by this Section, provided that 25only 20% of the transaction and closing costs are included in 26the rate base. Any acquisition of a water or sewer utility that   SB0075- 7 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1affects the cumulative base rates of the large public 2utility's existing ratepayers in the tariff group into which 3the water or sewer utility is to be combined by less than (1) 42.5% at the time of the acquisition for any single acquisition 5completed under this Section or (2) 5% for all acquisitions 6completed under this Section before the Commission's final 7order in the next rate case shall not be deemed to violate 8Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act.9    In the Commission's order that approves the large public 10utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 11Commission shall issue its decision establishing (1) the 12ratemaking rate base of the water or sewer utility; (2) the 13district or tariff group with which the water or sewer utility 14shall be combined for ratemaking purposes, if such combination 15has been proposed by the large public utility; and (3) the 16rates to be charged to customers in the water or sewer utility.17    (e) If the water or sewer utility being acquired is owned 18by the State or any political subdivision thereof, then the 19water or sewer utility must inform the public of the terms of 20its acquisition by the large public utility by (1) holding a 21public meeting prior to the acquisition and (2) causing to be 22published, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 23that the water or sewer utility operates, a notice setting 24forth the terms of its acquisition by the large public utility 25and options that shall be available to assist customers to pay 26their bills after the acquisition.   SB0075- 8 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1    At the next election following the public meeting and 2notice required by this subsection, a referendum, subject to 3the requirements of Section 16-7 of the Election Code, shall 4be placed on the ballot for all electors within the area the 5water or sewer utility operates in substantially the following 6form:7        May the (name of large public utility) acquire the 8    (name of water or sewer utility) under the terms of 9    acquisition published in (name of newspaper) on (date)?10    The votes shall be recorded as "Yes" or "No".11    If a majority of the electors voting on the referendum 12within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in 13favor of the referendum, then the acquisition may continue as 14provided in this Section. If less than a majority of the 15electors voting on the referendum within the service area of 16the water or sewer utility vote in favor of the referendum, the 17Commission shall not approve the large public utility's 18acquisition of the water or sewer utility. 19    (f) The large public utility may recommend the district or 20tariff group of which the water or sewer utility shall, for 21ratemaking purposes, become a part after the acquisition, or 22may recommend a lesser rate for the water or sewer utility. If 23the large public utility recommends a lesser rate, it shall 24submit to the Commission its proposed rate schedule and the 25proposed final tariff group for the acquired water or sewer 26utility. The Commission's approved district or tariff group or   SB0075- 9 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's 2recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 3contrary to the public interest.4    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new 5rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 6next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer 7utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 8district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 9lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and 10approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided, 11that, if the application of such rates of the large public 12utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 13using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 14total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 15utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 16the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 17the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 18reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 19results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 20or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 21sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 22latest median household income as reported by the United 23States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 24county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 25potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained, 26a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned. These   SB0075- 10 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1rates shall not be deemed to violate this Act including, but 2not limited to, Section 9-101 and any other applicable 3Sections in Articles VIII and IX of this Act. The Commission 4shall issue its decision establishing the rates effective for 5the water or sewer utility immediately following an 6acquisition in its order approving the acquisition.7    (h) In the acquiring large public utility's next rate 8case, the water or sewer utility and the district or tariff 9group ordered by the Commission and their costs of service may 10be combined under the same rate tariff. This rate tariff shall 11be based on allocation of costs of service of the acquired 12water or sewer utility and the large public utility's district 13or tariff group ordered by the Commission and utilizing a rate 14design that does not distinguish among customers on the basis 15of utility service source or type. This rate tariff shall not 16be deemed to violate this Act including, but not limited to, 17Section 9-101 of this Act. In the acquiring large public 18utility's 2 rate cases after an acquisition, but in no 19subsequent rate case, the large public utility may file a rate 20tariff for a water or sewer utility acquired under this 21Section that establishes lesser rates than the district or 22tariff group into which the water or sewer utility is to be 23combined. Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 24Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 25the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's 26existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than   SB0075- 11 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b12.5%. 2    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 3public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 4cost for financing set at the large public utility's 5determined rate for allowance for funds used during 6construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax 7gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 8was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 9has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 10the time the rates are implemented in the large public 11utility's next rate case.12    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 13utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 14for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 15was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 16has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 17the time the rates are implemented in the large public 18utility's next rate case.19    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 20public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 21acquisition of water or sewer utilities. Any petitions filed 22with the Commission related to the acquisitions described in 23this Section, including petitions seeking approvals or 24certificates required by this Act, shall be deemed approved 25unless the Commission issues its final order within 11 months 26after the date the large public utility filed its initial   SB0075- 12 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1petition. This Section shall only apply to utilities providing 2water or sewer service and shall not be construed in any manner 3to apply to electric corporations, natural gas corporations, 4or any other utility subject to this Act.5    (k) Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a party from 6declining to proceed with an acquisition or be deemed as 7establishing the final purchase price of an acquisition.8    (l) In the Commission's order that approves the large 9utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 10Commission shall address each aspect of the acquisition 11transaction for which approval is required under the Act. 12    (m) Any contractor or subcontractor that performs work on 13a water or sewer utility acquired by a large public utility 14under this Section shall be a responsible bidder as described 15in Section 30-22 of the Illinois Procurement Code. The 16contractor or subcontractor shall submit evidence of meeting 17the requirements to be a responsible bidder as described in 18Section 30-22 to the water or sewer utility. Any new water or 19sewer facility built as a result of the acquisition shall 20require the contractor to enter into a project labor 21agreement. The large public utility acquiring the water or 22sewer utility shall offer employee positions to qualified 23employees of the acquired water or sewer utility. 24    (n) This Section is repealed on June 1, 2028. 25(Source: P.A. 102-149, eff. 1-1-22.)   SB0075- 13 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1    (220 ILCS 5/9-220.2)2    Sec. 9-220.2. Water and sewer surcharges authorized. 3    (a) The Commission may authorize a water or sewer utility 4to file a surcharge which adjusts rates and charges to provide 5for recovery of (i) the cost of purchased water, (ii) the cost 6of purchased sewage treatment service, or (iii) other costs 7which fluctuate for reasons beyond the utility's control or 8are difficult to predict, or (iv) costs associated with an 9investment in qualifying infrastructure plant, independent of 10any other matters related to the utility's revenue 11requirement. A surcharge approved under this Section can 12operate on an historical or a prospective basis.13    (b) (Blank). For purposes of this Section, "costs 14associated with an investment in qualifying infrastructure 15plant" include a return on the investment in and depreciation 16expense related to plant items or facilities (including, but 17not limited to, replacement mains, meters, services, and 18hydrants) which (i) are not reflected in the rate base used to 19establish the utility's base rates and (ii) are non-revenue 20producing. For purposes of this Section, a "non-revenue 21producing facility" is one that is not constructed or 22installed for the purpose of serving a new customer.23    (c) On a periodic basis, the Commission shall initiate 24hearings to reconcile amounts collected under each surcharge 25authorized pursuant to this Section with the actual prudently 26incurred costs recoverable for each annual period during which   SB0075- 14 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1the surcharge was in effect.2(Source: P.A. 91-638, eff. 1-1-00.)

If the appraiser is 24unable to negotiate reasonable engagement terms with the 25recommended engineer within 15 days after the recommendation 26by the Commission's Executive Director or designee, then the   SB0075- 6 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1appraiser shall notify the Commission's Executive Director or 2designee and the process shall be repeated until an engineer 3is successfully engaged.4    (d) Twenty percent of the The lesser of (i) the purchase 5price or (ii) the fair market value determined under 6subsection (c) of this Section shall constitute the rate base 7associated with the water or sewer utility as acquired by and 8incorporated into the rate base of the district designated by 9the acquiring large public utility under this Section, subject 10to any adjustments that the Commission deems necessary to 11ensure such rate base reflects prudent and useful investments 12in the provision of public utility service. The difference 13between the rate base and the purchase price or fair market 14value shall be borne by the shareholders of the acquiring 15large public utility. The reasonable transaction and closing 16costs incurred by the large public utility shall be treated 17consistent with the applicable accounting standards under this 18Act. The total amount of all of the appraisers' fees to be 19included in the transaction and closing costs shall not exceed 20the greater of $15,000 or 5% of the appraised value of the 21water or sewer utility being acquired. This rate base 22treatment shall not be deemed to violate this Act, including, 23but not limited to, any Sections in Articles VIII and IX of 24this Act that might be affected by this Section, provided that 25only 20% of the transaction and closing costs are included in 26the rate base. Any acquisition of a water or sewer utility that   SB0075- 7 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1affects the cumulative base rates of the large public 2utility's existing ratepayers in the tariff group into which 3the water or sewer utility is to be combined by less than (1) 42.5% at the time of the acquisition for any single acquisition 5completed under this Section or (2) 5% for all acquisitions 6completed under this Section before the Commission's final 7order in the next rate case shall not be deemed to violate 8Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act.9    In the Commission's order that approves the large public 10utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 11Commission shall issue its decision establishing (1) the 12ratemaking rate base of the water or sewer utility; (2) the 13district or tariff group with which the water or sewer utility 14shall be combined for ratemaking purposes, if such combination 15has been proposed by the large public utility; and (3) the 16rates to be charged to customers in the water or sewer utility.17    (e) If the water or sewer utility being acquired is owned 18by the State or any political subdivision thereof, then the 19water or sewer utility must inform the public of the terms of 20its acquisition by the large public utility by (1) holding a 21public meeting prior to the acquisition and (2) causing to be 22published, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area 23that the water or sewer utility operates, a notice setting 24forth the terms of its acquisition by the large public utility 25and options that shall be available to assist customers to pay 26their bills after the acquisition.   SB0075- 8 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1    At the next election following the public meeting and 2notice required by this subsection, a referendum, subject to 3the requirements of Section 16-7 of the Election Code, shall 4be placed on the ballot for all electors within the area the 5water or sewer utility operates in substantially the following 6form:7        May the (name of large public utility) acquire the 8    (name of water or sewer utility) under the terms of 9    acquisition published in (name of newspaper) on (date)?10    The votes shall be recorded as "Yes" or "No".11    If a majority of the electors voting on the referendum 12within the service area of the water or sewer utility vote in 13favor of the referendum, then the acquisition may continue as 14provided in this Section. If less than a majority of the 15electors voting on the referendum within the service area of 16the water or sewer utility vote in favor of the referendum, the 17Commission shall not approve the large public utility's 18acquisition of the water or sewer utility. 19    (f) The large public utility may recommend the district or 20tariff group of which the water or sewer utility shall, for 21ratemaking purposes, become a part after the acquisition, or 22may recommend a lesser rate for the water or sewer utility. If 23the large public utility recommends a lesser rate, it shall 24submit to the Commission its proposed rate schedule and the 25proposed final tariff group for the acquired water or sewer 26utility. The Commission's approved district or tariff group or   SB0075- 9 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1rates shall be consistent with the large public utility's 2recommendation, unless such recommendation can be shown to be 3contrary to the public interest.4    (g) From the date of acquisition until the date that new 5rates are effective in the acquiring large public utility's 6next rate case, the customers of the acquired water or sewer 7utility shall pay the approved then-existing rates of the 8district or tariff group as ordered by the Commission, or some 9lesser rates as recommended by the large public utility and 10approved by the Commission under subsection (f); provided, 11that, if the application of such rates of the large public 12utility to customers of the acquired water or sewer utility 13using 54,000 gallons annually results in an increase to the 14total annual bill of customers of the acquired water or sewer 15utility, exclusive of fire service or related charges, then 16the large public utility's rates charged to the customers of 17the acquired water or sewer utility shall be uniformly 18reduced, if any reduction is required, by the percent that 19results in the total annual bill, exclusive of fire services 20or related charges, for the customers of the acquired water or 21sewer utility using 54,000 gallons being equal to 1.5% of the 22latest median household income as reported by the United 23States Census Bureau for the most applicable community or 24county. For each customer of the water or sewer utility with 25potable water usage values that cannot be reasonably obtained, 26a value of 4,500 gallons per month shall be assigned. These   SB0075- 10 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1rates shall not be deemed to violate this Act including, but 2not limited to, Section 9-101 and any other applicable 3Sections in Articles VIII and IX of this Act. The Commission 4shall issue its decision establishing the rates effective for 5the water or sewer utility immediately following an 6acquisition in its order approving the acquisition.7    (h) In the acquiring large public utility's next rate 8case, the water or sewer utility and the district or tariff 9group ordered by the Commission and their costs of service may 10be combined under the same rate tariff. This rate tariff shall 11be based on allocation of costs of service of the acquired 12water or sewer utility and the large public utility's district 13or tariff group ordered by the Commission and utilizing a rate 14design that does not distinguish among customers on the basis 15of utility service source or type. This rate tariff shall not 16be deemed to violate this Act including, but not limited to, 17Section 9-101 of this Act. In the acquiring large public 18utility's 2 rate cases after an acquisition, but in no 19subsequent rate case, the large public utility may file a rate 20tariff for a water or sewer utility acquired under this 21Section that establishes lesser rates than the district or 22tariff group into which the water or sewer utility is to be 23combined. Those lesser rates shall not be deemed to violate 24Section 7-204 or any other provision of this Act if they affect 25the cumulative base rates of the large public utility's 26existing rate payers in the district or tariff by less than   SB0075- 11 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b12.5%. 2    (i) Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large 3public utility in the water or sewer utility shall accrue a 4cost for financing set at the large public utility's 5determined rate for allowance for funds used during 6construction, inclusive of the debt, equity, and income tax 7gross up components, after the date on which the expenditure 8was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 9has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 10the time the rates are implemented in the large public 11utility's next rate case.12    Any post-acquisition improvements made by the large public 13utility in the water or sewer utility shall not be depreciated 14for ratemaking purposes from the date on which the expenditure 15was incurred by the large public utility until the investment 16has been in service for a 4-year period or, if sooner, until 17the time the rates are implemented in the large public 18utility's next rate case.19    (j) This Section shall be exclusively applied to large 20public utilities in the voluntary and mutually agreeable 21acquisition of water or sewer utilities. Any petitions filed 22with the Commission related to the acquisitions described in 23this Section, including petitions seeking approvals or 24certificates required by this Act, shall be deemed approved 25unless the Commission issues its final order within 11 months 26after the date the large public utility filed its initial   SB0075- 12 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1petition. This Section shall only apply to utilities providing 2water or sewer service and shall not be construed in any manner 3to apply to electric corporations, natural gas corporations, 4or any other utility subject to this Act.5    (k) Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a party from 6declining to proceed with an acquisition or be deemed as 7establishing the final purchase price of an acquisition.8    (l) In the Commission's order that approves the large 9utility's acquisition of the water or sewer utility, the 10Commission shall address each aspect of the acquisition 11transaction for which approval is required under the Act. 12    (m) Any contractor or subcontractor that performs work on 13a water or sewer utility acquired by a large public utility 14under this Section shall be a responsible bidder as described 15in Section 30-22 of the Illinois Procurement Code. The 16contractor or subcontractor shall submit evidence of meeting 17the requirements to be a responsible bidder as described in 18Section 30-22 to the water or sewer utility. Any new water or 19sewer facility built as a result of the acquisition shall 20require the contractor to enter into a project labor 21agreement. The large public utility acquiring the water or 22sewer utility shall offer employee positions to qualified 23employees of the acquired water or sewer utility. 24    (n) This Section is repealed on June 1, 2028. 25(Source: P.A. 102-149, eff. 1-1-22.)   SB0075- 13 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1    (220 ILCS 5/9-220.2)2    Sec. 9-220.2. Water and sewer surcharges authorized. 3    (a) The Commission may authorize a water or sewer utility 4to file a surcharge which adjusts rates and charges to provide 5for recovery of (i) the cost of purchased water, (ii) the cost 6of purchased sewage treatment service, or (iii) other costs 7which fluctuate for reasons beyond the utility's control or 8are difficult to predict, or (iv) costs associated with an 9investment in qualifying infrastructure plant, independent of 10any other matters related to the utility's revenue 11requirement. A surcharge approved under this Section can 12operate on an historical or a prospective basis.13    (b) (Blank). For purposes of this Section, "costs 14associated with an investment in qualifying infrastructure 15plant" include a return on the investment in and depreciation 16expense related to plant items or facilities (including, but 17not limited to, replacement mains, meters, services, and 18hydrants) which (i) are not reflected in the rate base used to 19establish the utility's base rates and (ii) are non-revenue 20producing. For purposes of this Section, a "non-revenue 21producing facility" is one that is not constructed or 22installed for the purpose of serving a new customer.23    (c) On a periodic basis, the Commission shall initiate 24hearings to reconcile amounts collected under each surcharge 25authorized pursuant to this Section with the actual prudently 26incurred costs recoverable for each annual period during which   SB0075- 14 -LRB104 08184 AAS 18234 b1the surcharge was in effect.2(Source: P.A. 91-638, eff. 1-1-00.)
