The projected sales 25    volume may be calculated using the historical method or   10400HB0744ham001- 20 -LRB104 04639 BAB 25168 a1    the underwriting method. The provider shall provide notice 2    to the Secretary on which method the provider intends to 3    use across all instances of sales-based financing offered 4    in calculating the estimated annual percentage rate under 5    this Section, according to the following:6            (A) A provider using the historical method shall 7        use an average historical volume of sales or revenue 8        by which the financing's payment amounts are based and 9        the estimated annual percentage rate is calculated. 10        The provider shall fix the historical time period used 11        to calculate the average historical volume and use the 12        period for all disclosure purposes for all sales-based 13        financing products offered. The fixed historical time 14        period shall either be the preceding time period from 15        the specific offer or, alternatively, the provider may 16        use average sales for the same number of months with 17        the highest sales volume within the previous 12 18        months.

A provider shall, 26        on an annual basis, report data to the Secretary of   10400HB0744ham001- 21 -LRB104 04639 BAB 25168 a1        estimated annual percentage rates disclosed to the 2        recipient and actual retrospective annual percentage 3        rates of completed transactions. The report shall 4        contain the information as the Department may adopt by 5        rule as necessary or appropriate for the purpose of 6        making a determination of whether the deviation 7        between the estimated annual percentage rate and 8        actual retrospective annual percentage rates of 9        completed transactions was reasonable. The Secretary 10        shall establish the method of reporting and may, upon 11        a finding that the use of projected sales volume by the 12        provider has resulted in an unacceptable deviation 13        between estimated and actual annual percentage rate, 14        require the provider to use the historical method.
