The 2court may accept a finding of probable cause at a preliminary 3hearing following the filing of an information charging the 4offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 of 5this Act or the return of an indictment by a grand jury 6charging the offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in 7Section 4 of this Act or after a charge is filed for violating 8Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act as sufficient 9evidence of probable cause as provided in item (i) above.10    Upon such a finding, the circuit court shall enter such 11restraining order, injunction or prohibition, or shall take 12such other action in connection with any such property or 13property interest subject to forfeiture under this Act, as is 14necessary to insure that such property is not removed from the 15jurisdiction of the court, concealed, destroyed or otherwise 16disposed of by the owner of that property or property interest 17prior to a forfeiture hearing under subsection (b) of this 18Section. The Attorney General or State's Attorney shall file a 19certified copy of such restraining order, injunction or other 20prohibition with the recorder of deeds or registrar of titles 21of each county where any such property of the defendant may be 22located. No such injunction, restraining order or other 23prohibition shall affect the rights of any bona fide 24purchaser, mortgagee, judgment creditor or other lien holder 25arising prior to the date of such filing.26    The court may, at any time, upon verified petition by the   HB2749- 58 -LRB104 11390 RTM 21478 b1defendant, conduct a hearing to release all or portions of any 2such property or interest which the court previously 3determined to be subject to forfeiture or subject to any 4restraining order, injunction, or prohibition or other action. 5The court may release such property to the defendant for good 6cause shown and within the sound discretion of the court.7    (d) Prosecution under this Act may be commenced by the 8Attorney General or a State's Attorney.9    (e) Upon an order of forfeiture being entered pursuant to 10subsection (b) of this Section, the court shall authorize the 11Attorney General to seize any property or property interest 12declared forfeited under this Act and under such terms and 13conditions as the court shall deem proper. Any property or 14property interest that has been the subject of an entered 15restraining order, injunction or prohibition or any other 16action filed under subsection (c) shall be forfeited unless 17the claimant can show by a preponderance of the evidence that 18the property or property interest has not been acquired or 19maintained as a result of narcotics racketeering or has not 20been used to facilitate narcotics racketeering.21    (f) The Attorney General or his designee is authorized to 22sell all property forfeited and seized pursuant to this Act, 23unless such property is required by law to be destroyed or is 24harmful to the public, and, after the deduction of all 25requisite expenses of administration and sale, shall 26distribute the proceeds of such sale, along with any moneys   HB2749- 59 -LRB104 11390 RTM 21478 b1forfeited or seized, in accordance with subsection (g) or (h), 2whichever is applicable.3    (g) All monies and the sale proceeds of all other property 4forfeited and seized pursuant to this Act shall be distributed 5as follows:6        (1) An amount equal to 50% shall be distributed to the 7    unit of local government whose officers or employees 8    conducted the investigation into narcotics racketeering 9    and caused the arrest or arrests and prosecution leading 10    to the forfeiture.

(a) A person who commits the offense of narcotics 8racketeering shall:9        (1) be guilty of a Class 1 felony; and10        (2) be subject to a fine of up to $250,000.11    A person who commits the offense of narcotics racketeering 12or who violates Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control 13Act shall forfeit to the State of Illinois: (A) any profits or 14proceeds and any property or property interest he has acquired 15or maintained in violation of this Act or Section 3 of the Drug 16Paraphernalia Control Act or has used to facilitate a 17violation of this Act that the court determines, after a 18forfeiture hearing, under subsection (b) of this Section to 19have been acquired or maintained as a result of narcotics 20racketeering or violating Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia 21Control Act, or used to facilitate narcotics racketeering; and 22(B) any interest in, security of, claim against, or property 23or contractual right of any kind affording a source of 24influence over, any enterprise which he has established,   HB2749- 55 -LRB104 11390 RTM 21478 b1operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in the 2conduct of, in violation of this Act or Section 3 of the Drug 3Paraphernalia Control Act, that the court determines, after a 4forfeiture hearing, under subsection (b) of this Section to 5have been acquired or maintained as a result of narcotics 6racketeering or violating Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia 7Control Act or used to facilitate narcotics racketeering.8    (b) The court shall, upon petition by the Attorney General 9or State's Attorney, at any time subsequent to the filing of an 10information or return of an indictment, conduct a hearing to 11determine whether any property or property interest is subject 12to forfeiture under this Act. At the forfeiture hearing the 13people shall have the burden of establishing, by a 14preponderance of the evidence, that property or property 15interests are subject to forfeiture under this Act. There is a 16rebuttable presumption at such hearing that any property or 17property interest of a person charged by information or 18indictment with narcotics racketeering or who is convicted of 19a violation of Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act 20is subject to forfeiture under this Section if the State 21establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that:22        (1) such property or property interest was acquired by 23    such person during the period of the violation of this Act 24    or Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act or 25    within a reasonable time after such period; and26        (2) there was no likely source for such property or   HB2749- 56 -LRB104 11390 RTM 21478 b1    property interest other than the violation of this Act or 2    Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act.3    (c) In an action brought by the People of the State of 4Illinois under this Act, wherein any restraining order, 5injunction or prohibition or any other action in connection 6with any property or property interest subject to forfeiture 7under this Act is sought, the circuit court which shall 8preside over the trial of the person or persons charged with 9narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 of this Act or 10violating Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act 11shall first determine whether there is probable cause to 12believe that the person or persons so charged has committed 13the offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 14of this Act or a violation of Section 3 of the Drug 15Paraphernalia Control Act and whether the property or property 16interest is subject to forfeiture pursuant to this Act.17    In order to make such a determination, prior to entering 18any such order, the court shall conduct a hearing without a 19jury, wherein the People shall establish that there is: (i) 20probable cause that the person or persons so charged have 21committed the offense of narcotics racketeering or violating 22Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act and (ii) 23probable cause that any property or property interest may be 24subject to forfeiture pursuant to this Act. Such hearing may 25be conducted simultaneously with a preliminary hearing, if the 26prosecution is commenced by information or complaint, or by   HB2749- 57 -LRB104 11390 RTM 21478 b1motion of the People, at any stage in the proceedings. The 2court may accept a finding of probable cause at a preliminary 3hearing following the filing of an information charging the 4offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in Section 4 of 5this Act or the return of an indictment by a grand jury 6charging the offense of narcotics racketeering as defined in 7Section 4 of this Act or after a charge is filed for violating 8Section 3 of the Drug Paraphernalia Control Act as sufficient 9evidence of probable cause as provided in item (i) above.10    Upon such a finding, the circuit court shall enter such 11restraining order, injunction or prohibition, or shall take 12such other action in connection with any such property or 13property interest subject to forfeiture under this Act, as is 14necessary to insure that such property is not removed from the 15jurisdiction of the court, concealed, destroyed or otherwise 16disposed of by the owner of that property or property interest 17prior to a forfeiture hearing under subsection (b) of this 18Section. The Attorney General or State's Attorney shall file a 19certified copy of such restraining order, injunction or other 20prohibition with the recorder of deeds or registrar of titles 21of each county where any such property of the defendant may be 22located.
