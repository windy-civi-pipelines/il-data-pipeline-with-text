The Environmental Protection Act is amended by 5changing Section 22.59 and by adding Section 22.59a as 6follows: 7    (415 ILCS 5/22.59)8    Sec. 22.59. CCR surface impoundments.9    (a) The General Assembly finds that:10        (1) the State of Illinois has a long-standing policy 11    to restore, protect, and enhance the environment, 12    including the purity of the air, land, and waters, 13    including groundwaters, of this State;14        (2) a clean environment is essential to the growth and 15    well-being of this State;16        (3) CCR generated by the electric generating industry 17    has caused groundwater contamination and other forms of 18    pollution at active and inactive plants throughout this 19    State;20        (4) environmental laws should be supplemented to 21    ensure consistent, responsible regulation of all existing 22    CCR surface impoundments; and23        (5) meaningful participation of State residents,   HB1175- 2 -LRB104 04969 BDA 14996 b1    especially vulnerable populations who may be affected by 2    regulatory actions, is critical to ensure that 3    environmental justice considerations are incorporated in 4    the development of, decision-making related to, and 5    implementation of environmental laws and rulemaking that 6    protects and improves the well-being of communities in 7    this State that bear disproportionate burdens imposed by 8    environmental pollution; and .9        (6) the State recognizes the critical need to 10    zealously guard and vigilantly protect the water quality 11    and public uses of public bodies of water throughout the 12    State, including Lake Michigan. 13    Therefore, the purpose of this Section is to promote a 14healthful environment, including clean water, air, and land, 15meaningful public involvement, and the responsible disposal 16and storage of coal combustion residuals, so as to protect 17public health and to prevent pollution of the environment of 18this State.19    The provisions of this Section shall be liberally 20construed to carry out the purposes of this Section.21    (b) No person shall:22        (1) cause or allow the discharge of any contaminants 23    from a CCR surface impoundment into the environment so as 24    to cause, directly or indirectly, a violation of this 25    Section or any regulations or standards adopted by the 26    Board under this Section, either alone or in combination   HB1175- 3 -LRB104 04969 BDA 14996 b1    with contaminants from other sources;2        (2) construct, install, modify, operate, or close any 3    CCR surface impoundment without a permit granted by the 4    Agency, or so as to violate any conditions imposed by such 5    permit, any provision of this Section or any regulations 6    or standards adopted by the Board under this Section;7        (3) cause or allow, directly or indirectly, the 8    discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking, 9    or placing of any CCR upon the land in a place and manner 10    so as to cause or tend to cause a violation of this Section 11    or any regulations or standards adopted by the Board under 12    this Section; or13        (4) construct, install, modify, or close a CCR surface 14    impoundment in accordance with a permit issued under this 15    Act without certifying to the Agency that all contractors, 16    subcontractors, and installers utilized to construct, 17    install, modify, or close a CCR surface impoundment are 18    participants in:19            (A) a training program that is approved by and 20        registered with the United States Department of 21        Labor's Employment and Training Administration and 22        that includes instruction in erosion control and 23        environmental remediation; and24            (B) a training program that is approved by and 25        registered with the United States Department of 26        Labor's Employment and Training Administration and   HB1175- 4 -LRB104 04969 BDA 14996 b1        that includes instruction in the operation of heavy 2        equipment and excavation.3        Nothing in this paragraph (4) shall be construed to 4    require providers of construction-related professional 5    services to participate in a training program approved by 6    and registered with the United States Department of 7    Labor's Employment and Training Administration.8        In this paragraph (4), "construction-related 9    professional services" includes, but is not limited to, 10    those services within the scope of: (i) the practice of 11    architecture as regulated under the Illinois Architecture 12    Practice Act of 1989;
