The employer shall notify the employee that 7the employee is still responsible for paying the employee's 8share of the cost of the health care coverage, if any. 9    (n) Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to interfere with, 10impede, or in any way diminish the right of employees to 11bargain collectively with their employers through 12representatives of their own choosing in order to establish 13wages or other conditions of work in excess of the applicable 14minimum standards established in this Act. The paid leave 15requirements of this Act may be waived in a bona fide 16collective bargaining agreement, but only if the waiver is set 17forth explicitly in such agreement in clear and unambiguous 18terms.19    Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect the validity 20or change the terms of bona fide collective bargaining 21agreements in effect on January 1, 2024.
