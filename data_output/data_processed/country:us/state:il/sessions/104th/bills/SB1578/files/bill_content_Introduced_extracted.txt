In the case of an automated traffic law 5    violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by 6    a technician employed or contracted by the municipality or 7    county that, based on inspection of recorded images, the 8    motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 9    11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance. If 10    the technician determines that the vehicle entered the 11    intersection as part of a funeral procession or in order 12    to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, a 13    citation shall not be issued. In municipalities with a 14    population of less than 1,000,000 inhabitants and counties 15    with a population of less than 3,000,000 inhabitants, the 16    automated traffic law ordinance shall require that all 17    determinations by a technician that a motor vehicle was 18    being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, 19    or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance must be reviewed and 20    approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law 21    enforcement officer of the municipality or county issuing 22    the violation. In municipalities with a population of 23    1,000,000 or more inhabitants and counties with a 24    population of 3,000,000 or more inhabitants, the automated 25    traffic law ordinance shall require that all 26    determinations by a technician that a motor vehicle was   SB1578- 13 -LRB104 08309 LNS 18360 b1    being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, 2    or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance must be reviewed and 3    approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law 4    enforcement officer of the municipality or county issuing 5    the violation or by an additional fully trained reviewing 6    technician who is not employed by the contractor who 7    employs the technician who made the initial determination. 8    In the case of an automated speed enforcement system 9    violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by 10    a technician employed by the municipality, based upon an 11    inspection of recorded images, video or other 12    documentation, including documentation of the speed limit 13    and automated speed enforcement signage, and documentation 14    of the inspection, calibration, and certification of the 15    speed equipment, that the vehicle was being operated in 16    violation of Article VI of Chapter 11 of this Code or a 17    similar local ordinance. If the technician determines that 18    the vehicle speed was not determined by a calibrated, 19    certified speed equipment device based upon the speed 20    equipment documentation, or if the vehicle was an 21    emergency vehicle, a citation may not be issued. The 22    automated speed enforcement ordinance shall require that 23    all determinations by a technician that a violation 24    occurred be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement 25    officer or retired law enforcement officer of the 26    municipality issuing the violation or by an additional   SB1578- 14 -LRB104 08309 LNS 18360 b1    fully trained reviewing technician who is not employed by 2    the contractor who employs the technician who made the 3    initial determination. Routine and independent calibration 4    of the speeds produced by automated speed enforcement 5    systems and equipment shall be conducted annually by a 6    qualified technician. Speeds produced by an automated 7    speed enforcement system shall be compared with speeds 8    produced by lidar or other independent equipment. Radar or 9    lidar equipment shall undergo an internal validation test 10    no less frequently than once each week. Qualified 11    technicians shall test loop-based equipment no less 12    frequently than once a year. Radar equipment shall be 13    checked for accuracy by a qualified technician when the 14    unit is serviced, when unusual or suspect readings 15    persist, or when deemed necessary by a reviewing 16    technician. Radar equipment shall be checked with the 17    internal frequency generator and the internal circuit test 18    whenever the radar is turned on. Technicians must be alert 19    for any unusual or suspect readings, and if unusual or 20    suspect readings of a radar unit persist, that unit shall 21    immediately be removed from service and not returned to 22    service until it has been checked by a qualified 23    technician and determined to be functioning properly. 24    Documentation of the annual calibration results, including 25    the equipment tested, test date, technician performing the 26    test, and test results, shall be maintained and available   SB1578- 15 -LRB104 08309 LNS 18360 b1    for use in the determination of an automated speed 2    enforcement system violation and issuance of a citation. 3    The technician performing the calibration and testing of 4    the automated speed enforcement equipment shall be trained 5    and certified in the use of equipment for speed 6    enforcement purposes. Training on the speed enforcement 7    equipment may be conducted by law enforcement, civilian, 8    or manufacturer's personnel and if applicable may be 9    equivalent to the equipment use and operations training 10    included in the Speed Measuring Device Operator Program 11    developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety 12    Administration (NHTSA). The vendor or technician who 13    performs the work shall keep accurate records on each 14    piece of equipment the technician calibrates and tests. As 15    used in this paragraph, "fully trained reviewing 16    technician" means a person who has received at least 40 17    hours of supervised training in subjects which shall 18    include image inspection and interpretation, the elements 19    necessary to prove a violation, license plate 20    identification, and traffic safety and management. In all 21    municipalities and counties, the automated speed 22    enforcement system or automated traffic law ordinance 23    shall require that no additional fee shall be charged to 24    the alleged violator for exercising his or her right to an 25    administrative hearing, and persons shall be given at 26    least 25 days following an administrative hearing to pay   SB1578- 16 -LRB104 08309 LNS 18360 b1    any civil penalty imposed by a finding that Section 2    11-208.6, 11-208.8, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a similar 3    local ordinance has been violated. The original or a 4    facsimile of the violation notice or, in the case of a 5    notice produced by a computerized device, a printed record 6    generated by the device showing the facts entered on the 7    notice, shall be retained by the traffic compliance 8    administrator, and shall be a record kept in the ordinary 9    course of business.
