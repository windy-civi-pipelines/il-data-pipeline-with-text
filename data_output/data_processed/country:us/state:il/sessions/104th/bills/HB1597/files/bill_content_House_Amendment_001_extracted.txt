In emergency situations as defined in Section 10 of 15this Act, the 30-day provision of the written notice may be 16waived.17    (c) The establishment shall attempt to resolve with the 18resident or the resident's representative, if any, 19circumstances that if not remedied have the potential of 20resulting in an involuntary termination of residency and shall 21document those efforts in the resident's file. This action may 22occur prior to or during the 30-day 30 day notice period, but 23must occur prior to the termination of the residency. In 24emergency situations as defined in Section 10 of this Act, the 25requirements of this subsection may be waived.26    (d) A request for a hearing shall stay an involuntary   10400HB1597ham001- 32 -LRB104 07842 BAB 23138 a1termination of residency until a decision has been rendered by 2the Department, according to a process adopted by rule. During 3this time period, the establishment may not terminate or 4reduce any service without the consent of the resident or the 5resident's representative, if any, for the purpose of making 6it more difficult or impossible for the resident to remain in 7the establishment.8    (e) The establishment shall offer the resident and the 9resident's representative, if any, residency termination and 10relocation assistance including information on available 11alternative placement. Residents shall be involved in planning 12the move and shall choose among the available alternative 13placements except when an emergency situation makes prior 14resident involvement impossible. Emergency placements are 15deemed temporary until the resident's input can be sought in 16the final placement decision. No resident shall be forced to 17remain in a temporary or permanent placement.18    (f) The Department may offer assistance to the 19establishment and the resident in the preparation of residency 20termination and relocation plans to assure safe and orderly 21transition and to protect the resident's health, safety, 22welfare, and rights. In nonemergencies, and where possible in 23emergencies, the transition plan shall be designed and 24implemented in advance of transfer or residency termination.25    (g) An establishment may not initiate a termination of 26residency due to an emergency situation if the establishment   10400HB1597ham001- 33 -LRB104 07842 BAB 23138 a1is able to safely care for the resident and (1) the resident 2has been hospitalized and the resident's physician, the 3establishment's manager, and the establishment's director of 4nursing state that returning to the establishment would not 5create an imminent danger of death or serious physical harm to 6the resident; or (2) the emergency can be negated by changes in 7activities, health care, personal care, or available rooming 8accommodations, consistent with the license and services of 9the establishment. The Department may not find an 10establishment to be in violation of Section 75 of this Act for 11failing to initiate an emergency discharge in these 12circumstances.13    (h) If the Department determines that an involuntary 14termination of residency does not meet the requirements of 15this Act, the Department shall issue a written decision 16stating that the involuntary termination of residency is 17denied. If the action of the establishment giving rise to the 18request for hearings is the establishment's failure to readmit 19the resident following hospitalization, other medical leave of 20absence, or other absence, the Department shall order the 21immediate readmission of the resident to the establishment 22unless a condition which would have allowed transfer or 23discharge develops within that timeframe.24    (i) If an order to readmit is entered pursuant to 25subsection (h), the establishment shall immediately comply. As 26used in this subsection, "comply" means the establishment and   10400HB1597ham001- 34 -LRB104 07842 BAB 23138 a1the resident have agreed on a schedule for readmission or the 2resident is living in the establishment.3    (j) An establishment that does not readmit a resident 4after the Department has ordered readmission shall be assessed 5a fine. The establishment shall be required to submit an 6acceptable plan of correction to the Department within 30 days 7after the violation is affirmed.8    (k) Once a notice of appeal is filed, the Department shall 9hold a hearing unless the notice of appeal is withdrawn. If the 10notice of appeal is withdrawn based upon a representation made 11by the establishment to the resident and the Department, 12including the hearing officer, that a resident who has been 13previously denied readmission will be readmitted, failure to 14comply with the representation shall be considered a failure 15to comply with a Department order pursuant to subsection (h) 16and shall result in the imposition of a fine as provided in 17subsection (j) of this Section.18(Source: P.A. 91-656, eff. 1-1-01.) 19    (210 ILCS 9/90)20    Sec. 90.

In emergency situations as defined in Section 10 of 15this Act, the 30-day provision of the written notice may be 16waived.17    (c) The establishment shall attempt to resolve with the 18resident or the resident's representative, if any, 19circumstances that if not remedied have the potential of 20resulting in an involuntary termination of residency and shall 21document those efforts in the resident's file. This action may 22occur prior to or during the 30-day 30 day notice period, but 23must occur prior to the termination of the residency. In 24emergency situations as defined in Section 10 of this Act, the 25requirements of this subsection may be waived.26    (d) A request for a hearing shall stay an involuntary   10400HB1597ham001- 32 -LRB104 07842 BAB 23138 a1termination of residency until a decision has been rendered by 2the Department, according to a process adopted by rule. During 3this time period, the establishment may not terminate or 4reduce any service without the consent of the resident or the 5resident's representative, if any, for the purpose of making 6it more difficult or impossible for the resident to remain in 7the establishment.8    (e) The establishment shall offer the resident and the 9resident's representative, if any, residency termination and 10relocation assistance including information on available 11alternative placement. Residents shall be involved in planning 12the move and shall choose among the available alternative 13placements except when an emergency situation makes prior 14resident involvement impossible. Emergency placements are 15deemed temporary until the resident's input can be sought in 16the final placement decision. No resident shall be forced to 17remain in a temporary or permanent placement.18    (f) The Department may offer assistance to the 19establishment and the resident in the preparation of residency 20termination and relocation plans to assure safe and orderly 21transition and to protect the resident's health, safety, 22welfare, and rights. In nonemergencies, and where possible in 23emergencies, the transition plan shall be designed and 24implemented in advance of transfer or residency termination.25    (g) An establishment may not initiate a termination of 26residency due to an emergency situation if the establishment   10400HB1597ham001- 33 -LRB104 07842 BAB 23138 a1is able to safely care for the resident and (1) the resident 2has been hospitalized and the resident's physician, the 3establishment's manager, and the establishment's director of 4nursing state that returning to the establishment would not 5create an imminent danger of death or serious physical harm to 6the resident; or (2) the emergency can be negated by changes in 7activities, health care, personal care, or available rooming 8accommodations, consistent with the license and services of 9the establishment. The Department may not find an 10establishment to be in violation of Section 75 of this Act for 11failing to initiate an emergency discharge in these 12circumstances.13    (h) If the Department determines that an involuntary 14termination of residency does not meet the requirements of 15this Act, the Department shall issue a written decision 16stating that the involuntary termination of residency is 17denied. If the action of the establishment giving rise to the 18request for hearings is the establishment's failure to readmit 19the resident following hospitalization, other medical leave of 20absence, or other absence, the Department shall order the 21immediate readmission of the resident to the establishment 22unless a condition which would have allowed transfer or 23discharge develops within that timeframe.24    (i) If an order to readmit is entered pursuant to 25subsection (h), the establishment shall immediately comply. As 26used in this subsection, "comply" means the establishment and   10400HB1597ham001- 34 -LRB104 07842 BAB 23138 a1the resident have agreed on a schedule for readmission or the 2resident is living in the establishment.3    (j) An establishment that does not readmit a resident 4after the Department has ordered readmission shall be assessed 5a fine. The establishment shall be required to submit an 6acceptable plan of correction to the Department within 30 days 7after the violation is affirmed.8    (k) Once a notice of appeal is filed, the Department shall 9hold a hearing unless the notice of appeal is withdrawn. If the 10notice of appeal is withdrawn based upon a representation made 11by the establishment to the resident and the Department, 12including the hearing officer, that a resident who has been 13previously denied readmission will be readmitted, failure to 14comply with the representation shall be considered a failure 15to comply with a Department order pursuant to subsection (h) 16and shall result in the imposition of a fine as provided in 17subsection (j) of this Section.18(Source: P.A. 91-656, eff. 1-1-01.) 19    (210 ILCS 9/90)20    Sec. 90.
