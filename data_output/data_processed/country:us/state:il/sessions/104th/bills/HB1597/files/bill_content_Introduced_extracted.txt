This action may 15occur prior to or during the 30-day 30 day notice period, but 16must occur prior to the termination of the residency.

The Department may not find an 3establishment to be in violation of Section 75 of this Act for 4failing to initiate an emergency discharge in these 5circumstances.6    (h) If the Department determines that an involuntary 7termination of residency does not meet the requirements of 8this Act, the Department shall issue a written decision 9stating that the involuntary termination of residency is 10denied. If the action of the establishment giving rise to the 11request for hearings is the establishment's failure to readmit 12the resident following hospitalization, other medical leave of 13absence, or other absence, the Department shall order the 14immediate readmission of the resident to the establishment 15unless a condition which would have allowed transfer or 16discharge develops within that timeframe.17    (i) If an order to readmit is entered pursuant to 18subsection (h), the establishment shall immediately comply.

Involuntary termination of residency. 25    (a) Residency shall be involuntarily terminated only for   HB1597- 30 -LRB104 07842 BAB 17888 b1the following reasons: 2        (1) as provided in Section 75 of this Act; 3        (2) nonpayment of contracted charges after the 4    resident and the resident's representative have received a 5    minimum of 30 days' 30-days written notice of the 6    delinquency and the resident or the resident's 7    representative has had at least 15 days to cure the 8    delinquency; or 9        (3) failure to execute a service delivery contract or 10    to substantially comply with its terms and conditions, 11    failure to comply with the assessment requirements 12    contained in Section 15, or failure to substantially 13    comply with the terms and conditions of the lease 14    agreement.15    (b) A 30-day 30 day written notice of residency 16termination shall be provided to the resident, the resident's 17representative, or both, the Department, and the long term 18care ombudsman, which shall include the reason for the pending 19action, the date of the proposed move, and a notice, the 20content and form to be set forth by rule, of the resident's 21right to appeal, the steps that the resident or the resident's 22representative must take to initiate an appeal, and a 23statement of the resident's right to continue to reside in the 24establishment until a decision is rendered. The notice shall 25include a toll free telephone number to initiate an appeal and 26a written hearing request form, together with a postage paid,   HB1597- 31 -LRB104 07842 BAB 17888 b1pre-addressed envelope to the Department. If the resident or 2the resident's representative, if any, cannot read English, 3the notice must be provided in a language the individual 4receiving the notice can read or the establishment must 5provide a translator who has been trained to assist the 6resident or the resident's representative in the appeal 7process. In emergency situations as defined in Section 10 of 8this Act, the 30-day provision of the written notice may be 9waived.10    (c) The establishment shall attempt to resolve with the 11resident or the resident's representative, if any, 12circumstances that if not remedied have the potential of 13resulting in an involuntary termination of residency and shall 14document those efforts in the resident's file. This action may 15occur prior to or during the 30-day 30 day notice period, but 16must occur prior to the termination of the residency. In 17emergency situations as defined in Section 10 of this Act, the 18requirements of this subsection may be waived.19    (d) A request for a hearing shall stay an involuntary 20termination of residency until a decision has been rendered by 21the Department, according to a process adopted by rule. During 22this time period, the establishment may not terminate or 23reduce any service without the consent of the resident or the 24resident's representative, if any, for the purpose of making 25it more difficult or impossible for the resident to remain in 26the establishment.  HB1597- 32 -LRB104 07842 BAB 17888 b1    (e) The establishment shall offer the resident and the 2resident's representative, if any, residency termination and 3relocation assistance including information on available 4alternative placement. Residents shall be involved in planning 5the move and shall choose among the available alternative 6placements except when an emergency situation makes prior 7resident involvement impossible. Emergency placements are 8deemed temporary until the resident's input can be sought in 9the final placement decision. No resident shall be forced to 10remain in a temporary or permanent placement.11    (f) The Department may offer assistance to the 12establishment and the resident in the preparation of residency 13termination and relocation plans to assure safe and orderly 14transition and to protect the resident's health, safety, 15welfare, and rights. In nonemergencies, and where possible in 16emergencies, the transition plan shall be designed and 17implemented in advance of transfer or residency termination.18    (g) An establishment may not initiate a termination of 19residency due to an emergency situation if the establishment 20is able to safely care for the resident and (1) the resident 21has been hospitalized and the resident's physician, the 22establishment's manager, and the establishment's director of 23nursing state that returning to the establishment would not 24create an imminent danger of death or serious physical harm to 25the resident; or (2) the emergency can be negated by changes in 26activities, health care, personal care, or available rooming   HB1597- 33 -LRB104 07842 BAB 17888 b1accommodations, consistent with the license and services of 2the establishment. The Department may not find an 3establishment to be in violation of Section 75 of this Act for 4failing to initiate an emergency discharge in these 5circumstances.6    (h) If the Department determines that an involuntary 7termination of residency does not meet the requirements of 8this Act, the Department shall issue a written decision 9stating that the involuntary termination of residency is 10denied. If the action of the establishment giving rise to the 11request for hearings is the establishment's failure to readmit 12the resident following hospitalization, other medical leave of 13absence, or other absence, the Department shall order the 14immediate readmission of the resident to the establishment 15unless a condition which would have allowed transfer or 16discharge develops within that timeframe.17    (i) If an order to readmit is entered pursuant to 18subsection (h), the establishment shall immediately comply. As 19used in this subsection, "comply" means the establishment and 20the resident have agreed on a schedule for readmission or the 21resident is living in the establishment.22    (j) An establishment that does not readmit a resident 23after the Department has ordered readmission shall be assessed 24a fine. The establishment shall be required to submit an 25acceptable plan of correction to the Department within 30 days 26after the violation is affirmed.  HB1597- 34 -LRB104 07842 BAB 17888 b1    (k) Once a notice of appeal is filed, the Department shall 2hold a hearing unless the notice of appeal is withdrawn. If the 3notice of appeal is withdrawn based upon a representation made 4by the establishment to the resident and the Department, 5including the hearing officer, that a resident who has been 6previously denied readmission will be readmitted, failure to 7comply with the representation shall be considered a failure 8to comply with a Department order pursuant to subsection (h) 9and shall result in the imposition of a fine as provided in 10subsection (j) of this Section.11(Source: P.A. 91-656, eff. 1-1-01.) 12    (210 ILCS 9/90)13    Sec. 90.
