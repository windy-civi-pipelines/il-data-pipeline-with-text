A 5community college district may combine its negotiations with 6multiple school districts to establish one multi-district 7partnership agreement or may negotiate individual partnership 8agreements at its discretion.9(Source: P.A. 102-516, eff. 8-20-21; 102-1077, eff. 1-1-23.) 10    (110 ILCS 27/16.10 new)11    Sec. 16.10. Partnership agreement negotiations with 12liaison. Prior to offering dual credit coursework with any 13postsecondary institution other than a community college, a 14school district shall first negotiate with the designated 15liaison of the school district's local community college 16district to seek a partnership agreement with the community 17college district as provided in Section 16.

The Illinois Community College 12Board Board of Higher Education shall have 30 days to provide 13the school district with a list of in-state postsecondary 14institutions that can provide the school district an 15equivalent dual credit opportunity. The school district may 16not enter into a contract with an out-of-state postsecondary 17institution on or after the effective date of this amendatory 18Act of the 104th General Assembly until the school district 19has demonstrated to the Illinois Community College Board that 20the school district has taken appropriate steps to consider 21the listing of in-state postsecondary institutions and 22provides a rationale as to why the course can be provided only 23by an out-of-state postsecondary institution; however, this 24limitation does not apply to a contract that was entered into 25prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 104th 26General Assembly. In deciding which dual credit courses to   10400HB2967sam002- 11 -LRB104 10336 LNS 26982 a1offer, a school district reserves the right to evaluate any 2dual credit course offered by any postsecondary institution 3for quality, rigor, and alignment with the school district's 4students' needs.5    Agreements to provide dual credit courses between a school 6district and an out-of-state postsecondary institution in 7existence on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 8100th General Assembly shall remain in effect and shall not be 9impacted by this Section.10(Source: P.A. 100-1049, eff. 1-1-19.) 11    (110 ILCS 27/19.5 new)12    Sec. 19.5.
