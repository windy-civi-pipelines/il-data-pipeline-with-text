Purpose. The General Assembly has determined 5that it is in the best interests of the State and the State's 6citizens that all high school students be required to take a 7one semester course in personal finance prior to graduation. 8Research has shown that such a course is significantly more 9effective if taught as a separate course in the 11th or 12th 10grade rather than embedded in another course or taught at an 11earlier time. Similarly, research has shown that before the 12course can be implemented, there must be time to develop 13curriculum and provide incentives for professional development 14for teachers of the course. 15    Section 5.
