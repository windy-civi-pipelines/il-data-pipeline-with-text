A municipality may enter into an intergovernmental 9agreement with any county in which it is partially located, 10when the county has adopted an ordinance to impose a surcharge 11as provided in subsection (c), to include that portion of the 12municipality lying outside the county in that county's 13surcharge referendum. If the county's surcharge referendum is 14approved, the portion of the municipality identified in the 15intergovernmental agreement shall automatically be 16disconnected from the county in which it lies and connected to 17the county which approved the referendum for purposes of a 18surcharge on telecommunications carriers.19    (b) For purposes of computing the surcharge imposed by 20subsection (a), the network connections to which the surcharge 21shall apply shall be those in-service network connections, 22other than those network connections assigned to the 23municipality or county, where the service address for each 24such network connection or connections is located within the 25corporate limits of the municipality or county levying the 26surcharge. Except for mobile telecommunication services, the   HB1866- 27 -LRB104 09427 RTM 19487 b1"service address" shall mean the location of the primary use 2of the network connection or connections. For mobile 3telecommunication services, "service address" means the 4customer's place of primary use as defined in the Mobile 5Telecommunications Sourcing Conformity Act.6    (c) Upon the passage of an ordinance to impose a surcharge 7under this Section the clerk of the municipality or county 8shall certify the question of whether the surcharge may be 9imposed to the proper election authority who shall submit the 10public question to the electors of the municipality or county 11in accordance with the general election law; provided that 12such question shall not be submitted at a consolidated primary 13election.

The telecommunications 15carrier collecting the surcharge shall also be entitled to 16deduct 3% of the gross amount of surcharge collected to 17reimburse the telecommunications carrier for the expense of 18accounting and collecting the surcharge.19    (h) Except as expressly provided in subsection (a) of this 20Section, on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act 21of the 98th General Assembly and until December 31, 2017, a 22municipality with a population of 500,000 or more shall not 23impose a monthly surcharge per network connection in excess of 24the highest monthly surcharge imposed as of January 1, 2014 by 25any county or municipality under subsection (c) of this 26Section.
