Full Text of HB1889 ILGA.GOV HB1889 - 104th General Assembly 104TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY State of Illinois 2025 and 2026HB1889 Introduced 1/29/2025, by Rep. Anne Stava-Murray SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 750 ILCS 5/505  from Ch. 40, par. 505    Amends the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. Excludes from the definition of a parent's "gross income" income or value received by a parent as a gift that is the voluntary transfer of property, including, but not limited to, money that is completely free of repayment or obligation while both the giver and the parent are still alive.LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b  A BILL FOR HB1889LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    AN ACT concerning civil law. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 5Marriage Act is amended by changing Section 505 as follows: 6    (750 ILCS 5/505)  (from Ch. 40, par. 505)7    Sec. 505. Child support; contempt; penalties. 8    (a) In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, legal 9separation, declaration of invalidity of marriage, or 10dissolution of a civil union, a proceeding for child support 11following a legal separation or dissolution of the marriage or 12civil union by a court that lacked personal jurisdiction over 13the absent spouse, a proceeding for modification of a previous 14order for child support under Section 510 of this Act, or any 15proceeding authorized under Section 501 or 601 of this Act, 16the court may order either or both parents owing a duty of 17support to a child of the marriage or civil union to pay an 18amount reasonable and necessary for support. The duty of 19support owed to a child includes the obligation to provide for 20the reasonable and necessary physical, mental and emotional 21health needs of the child. For purposes of this Section, the 22term "child" shall include any child under age 18 and any child 23age 19 or younger who is still attending high school. For   HB1889- 2 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1purposes of this Section, the term "obligor" means the parent 2obligated to pay support to the other parent.3        (1) Child support guidelines. The Illinois Department 4    of Healthcare and Family Services shall adopt rules 5    establishing child support guidelines which include 6    worksheets to aid in the calculation of the child support 7    obligations and a schedule of basic child support 8    obligations that reflects the percentage of combined net 9    income that parents living in the same household in this 10    State ordinarily spend on their child. The child support 11    guidelines have the following purposes:12            (A) to establish as State policy an adequate 13        standard of support for a child, subject to the 14        ability of parents to pay;15            (B) to make child support obligations more 16        equitable by ensuring more consistent treatment of 17        parents in similar circumstances;18            (C) to improve the efficiency of the court process 19        by promoting settlements and giving courts and the 20        parties guidance in establishing levels of child 21        support;22            (D) to calculate child support based upon the 23        parents' combined net income estimated to have been 24        allocated for the support of the child if the parents 25        and child were living in an intact household;26            (E) to adjust child support based upon the needs   HB1889- 3 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        of the child; and2            (F) to allocate the amount of child support to be 3        paid by each parent based upon a parent's net income 4        and the child's physical care arrangements.5        (1.5) Computation of basic child support obligation. 6    The court shall compute the basic child support obligation 7    by taking the following steps:8            (A) determine each parent's monthly net income;9            (B) add the parents' monthly net incomes together 10        to determine the combined monthly net income of the 11        parents;12            (C) select the corresponding appropriate amount 13        from the schedule of basic child support obligations 14        based on the parties' combined monthly net income and 15        number of children of the parties; and16            (D) calculate each parent's percentage share of 17        the basic child support obligation.18        Although a monetary obligation is computed for each 19    parent as child support, the receiving parent's share is 20    not payable to the other parent and is presumed to be spent 21    directly on the child. 22        (2) Duty of support. The court shall determine child 23    support in each case by applying the child support 24    guidelines unless the court makes a finding that 25    application of the guidelines would be inappropriate, 26    after considering the best interests of the child and   HB1889- 4 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    evidence which shows relevant factors including, but not 2    limited to, one or more of the following:3            (A) the financial resources and needs of the 4        child;5            (B) the financial resources and needs of the 6        parents;7            (C) the standard of living the child would have 8        enjoyed had the marriage or civil union not been 9        dissolved; and10            (D) the physical and emotional condition of the 11        child and his or her educational needs.12        (3) Income.13            (A) As used in this Section, "gross income" means 14        the total of all income from all sources, except 15        "gross income" does not include (i) benefits received 16        by the parent from means-tested public assistance 17        programs, including, but not limited to, Temporary 18        Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Security 19        Income, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 20        Program; or (ii) benefits and income received by the 21        parent for other children in the household, including, 22        but not limited to, child support, survivor benefits, 23        and foster care payments; or (iii) income or value 24        received by a parent as a gift that is the voluntary 25        transfer of property, including but not limited to, 26        money that is completely free of repayment or   HB1889- 5 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        obligation while both the giver and the parent are 2        still alive. Social security disability and retirement 3        benefits paid for the benefit of the subject child 4        must be included in the disabled or retired parent's 5        gross income for purposes of calculating the parent's 6        child support obligation, but the parent is entitled 7        to a child support credit for the amount of benefits 8        paid to the other party for the child. "Gross income" 9        includes maintenance treated as taxable income for 10        federal income tax purposes to the payee and received 11        pursuant to a court order in the pending proceedings 12        or any other proceedings and shall be included in the 13        payee's gross income for purposes of calculating the 14        parent's child support obligation. 15            (B) As used in this Section, "net income" means 16        gross income minus either the standardized tax amount 17        calculated pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this 18        paragraph (3) or the individualized tax amount 19        calculated pursuant to subparagraph (D) of this 20        paragraph (3), and minus any adjustments pursuant to 21        subparagraph (F) of this paragraph (3). The 22        standardized tax amount shall be used unless the 23        requirements for an individualized tax amount set 24        forth in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (3) are 25        met. "Net income" includes maintenance not includable 26        in the gross taxable income of the payee for federal   HB1889- 6 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        income tax purposes under a court order in the pending 2        proceedings or any other proceedings and shall be 3        included in the payee's net income for purposes of 4        calculating the parent's child support obligation.5            (C) As used in this Section, "standardized tax 6        amount" means the total of federal and state income 7        taxes for a single person claiming the standard tax 8        deduction, one personal exemption, and the applicable 9        number of dependency exemptions for the minor child or 10        children of the parties, and Social Security and 11        Medicare tax calculated at the Federal Insurance 12        Contributions Act rate.13                (I) Unless a court has determined otherwise or 14            the parties otherwise agree, the party with the 15            majority of parenting time shall be deemed 16            entitled to claim the dependency exemption for the 17            parties' minor child.18                (II) The Illinois Department of Healthcare and 19            Family Services shall promulgate a standardized 20            net income conversion table that computes net 21            income by deducting the standardized tax amount 22            from gross income.23            (D) As used in this Section, "individualized tax 24        amount" means the aggregate of the following taxes:25                (I) federal income tax (properly calculated 26            withholding or estimated payments);  HB1889- 7 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1                (II) State income tax (properly calculated 2            withholding or estimated payments); and3                (III) Social Security or self-employment tax, 4            if applicable (or, if none, mandatory retirement 5            contributions required by law or as a condition of 6            employment) and Medicare tax calculated at the 7            Federal Insurance Contributions Act rate.8            (E) In lieu of a standardized tax amount, a 9        determination of an individualized tax amount may be 10        made under items (I), (II), or (III) below. If an 11        individualized tax amount determination is made under 12        this subparagraph (E), all relevant tax attributes 13        (including filing status, allocation of dependency 14        exemptions, and whether a party is to claim the use of 15        the standard deduction or itemized deductions for 16        federal income tax purposes) shall be as the parties 17        agree or as the court determines. To determine a 18        party's reported income, the court may order the party 19        to complete an Internal Revenue Service Form 4506-T, 20        Request for Tax Transcript. 21                (I) Agreement. Irrespective of whether the 22            parties agree on any other issue before the court, 23            if they jointly stipulate for the record their 24            concurrence on a computation method for the 25            individualized tax amount that is different from 26            the method set forth under subparagraph (D), the   HB1889- 8 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            stipulated method shall be used by the court 2            unless the court rejects the proposed stipulated 3            method for good cause.4                (II) Summary hearing. If the court determines 5            child support in a summary hearing under Section 6            501 and an eligible party opts in to the 7            individualized tax amount method under this item 8            (II), the individualized tax amount shall be 9            determined by the court on the basis of 10            information contained in one or both parties' 11            Supreme Court approved Financial Affidavit (Family &12             Divorce Cases) and relevant supporting documents 13            under applicable court rules. No party, however, 14            is eligible to opt in unless the party, under 15            applicable court rules, has served the other party 16            with the required Supreme Court approved Financial 17            Affidavit (Family & Divorce Cases) and has 18            substantially produced supporting documents 19            required by the applicable court rules.20                (III) Evidentiary hearing. If the court 21            determines child support in an evidentiary 22            hearing, whether for purposes of a temporary order 23            or at the conclusion of a proceeding, item (II) of 24            this subparagraph (E) does not apply. In each such 25            case (unless item (I) governs), the individualized 26            tax amount shall be as determined by the court on   HB1889- 9 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            the basis of the record established. 2            (F) Adjustments to income.3                (I) Multi-family adjustment. If a parent is 4            also legally responsible for support of a child 5            not shared with the other parent and not subject 6            to the present proceeding, there shall be an 7            adjustment to net income as follows:8                    (i) Multi-family adjustment with court 9                order. The court shall deduct from the 10                parent's net income the amount of child 11                support actually paid by the parent pursuant 12                to a support order unless the court makes a 13                finding that it would cause economic hardship 14                to the child.15                    (ii) Multi-family adjustment without court 16                order. Upon the request or application of a 17                parent actually supporting a presumed, 18                acknowledged, or adjudicated child living in 19                or outside of that parent's household, there 20                shall be an adjustment to child support. The 21                court shall deduct from the parent's net 22                income the amount of financial support 23                actually paid by the parent for the child or 24                75% of the support the parent should pay under 25                the child support guidelines (before this 26                adjustment), whichever is less, unless the   HB1889- 10 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1                court makes a finding that it would cause 2                economic hardship to the child. The adjustment 3                shall be calculated using that parent's income 4                alone.5                (II) Spousal Maintenance adjustment. 6            Obligations pursuant to a court order for spousal 7            maintenance in the pending proceeding actually 8            paid or payable to the same party to whom child 9            support is to be payable or actually paid to a 10            former spouse pursuant to a court order shall be 11            deducted from the parent's after-tax income, 12            unless the maintenance obligation is tax 13            deductible to the payor for federal income tax 14            purposes, in which case it shall be deducted from 15            the payor's gross income for purposes of 16            calculating the parent's child support obligation.17        (3.1) Business income. For purposes of calculating 18    child support, net business income from the operation of a 19    business means gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary 20    expenses required to carry on the trade or business. As 21    used in this paragraph, "business" includes, but is not 22    limited to, sole proprietorships, closely held 23    corporations, partnerships, other flow-through business 24    entities, and self-employment. The court shall apply the 25    following:26            (A) The accelerated component of depreciation and   HB1889- 11 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        any business expenses determined either judicially or 2        administratively to be inappropriate or excessive 3        shall be excluded from the total of ordinary and 4        necessary business expenses to be deducted in the 5        determination of net business income from gross 6        business income.7            (B) Any item of reimbursement or in-kind payment 8        received by a parent from a business, including, but 9        not limited to, a company car, reimbursed meals, free 10        housing, or a housing allowance, shall be counted as 11        income if not otherwise included in the recipient's 12        gross income, if the item is significant in amount and 13        reduces personal expenses.14        (3.2a) Unemployment or underemployment. If a parent is 15    voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, child support 16    shall be calculated based on a determination of potential 17    income. In determining potential income, the court shall 18    consider the specific circumstances of a party, to the 19    extent known, including, but not limited to, the parent's:20            (1) assets;21            (2) ownership of a substantial non-income 22        producing asset;23            (3) residence;24            (4) employment and earning history;25            (5) job skills;26            (6) educational attainment;  HB1889- 12 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            (7) literacy;2            (8) age;3            (9) health;4            (10) criminal records and other employment 5        barriers; and6            (11) record of seeking work.7        The court shall also consider the local job market, 8    availability of local employers willing to hire the 9    parent, prevailing earning levels in the local community, 10    and other relevant background factors in the case. If 11    there is insufficient work history to determine employment 12    potential and probable earnings level, there shall be a 13    rebuttable presumption that the parent's potential income 14    is 75% of the most recent United States Department of 15    Health and Human Services Federal Poverty Guidelines for a 16    family of one person. Incarceration shall not be 17    considered voluntary unemployment for child support 18    purposes in establishing or modifying child support. 19        (3.2b) The court may impute income to a party only 20    upon conducting an evidentiary hearing or by agreement of 21    the parties. Imputation of income shall be accompanied by 22    specific written findings identifying the basis or bases 23    for imputation using these factors.24        (3.3) Rebuttable presumption in favor of guidelines. 25    There is a rebuttable presumption in any judicial or 26    administrative proceeding for child support that the   HB1889- 13 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    amount of the child support obligation that would result 2    from the application of the child support guidelines is 3    the correct amount of child support. 4        (3.3a) Minimum child support obligation. There is a 5    rebuttable presumption that a minimum child support 6    obligation of $40 per month, per child, will be entered 7    for an obligor who has actual or imputed gross income at or 8    less than 75% of the most recent United States Department 9    of Health and Human Services Federal Poverty Guidelines 10    for a family of one person, with a maximum total child 11    support obligation for that obligor of $120 per month to 12    be divided equally among all of the obligor's children.13        (3.3b) Zero dollar child support order. For parents 14    with no gross income, who receive only means-tested 15    assistance, or who cannot work due to a medically proven 16    disability, incarceration, or institutionalization, there 17    is a rebuttable presumption that the $40 per month minimum 18    support order is inapplicable and a zero dollar order 19    shall be entered. 20        (3.4) Deviation factors. In any action to establish or 21    modify child support, whether pursuant to a temporary or 22    final administrative or court order, the child support 23    guidelines shall be used as a rebuttable presumption for 24    the establishment or modification of the amount of child 25    support. The court may deviate from the child support 26    guidelines if the application would be inequitable,   HB1889- 14 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    unjust, or inappropriate. Any deviation from the 2    guidelines shall be accompanied by written findings by the 3    court specifying the reasons for the deviation and the 4    presumed amount under the child support guidelines without 5    a deviation. These reasons may include:6            (A) extraordinary medical expenditures necessary 7        to preserve the life or health of a party or a child of 8        either or both of the parties;9            (B) additional expenses incurred for a child 10        subject to the child support order who has special 11        medical, physical, or developmental needs; and12            (C) any other factor the court determines should 13        be applied upon a finding that the application of the 14        child support guidelines would be inappropriate, after 15        considering the best interest of the child. 16        (3.5) Income in excess of the schedule of basic child 17    support obligation. A court may use its discretion to 18    determine child support if the combined adjusted net 19    income of the parties exceeds the highest level of the 20    schedule of basic child support obligation, except that 21    the basic child support obligation shall not be less than 22    the highest level of combined net income set forth in the 23    schedule of basic child support obligation. 24        (3.6) Extracurricular activities and school expenses. 25    The court, in its discretion, in addition to the basic 26    child support obligation, may order either or both parents   HB1889- 15 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    owing a duty of support to the child to contribute to the 2    reasonable school and extracurricular activity expenses 3    incurred which are intended to enhance the educational, 4    athletic, social, or cultural development of the child.5        (3.7) Child care expenses. The court, in its 6    discretion, in addition to the basic child support 7    obligation, may order either or both parents owing a duty 8    of support to the child to contribute to the reasonable 9    child care expenses of the child. The child care expenses 10    shall be made payable directly to a party or directly to 11    the child care provider at the time of child care 12    services. 13            (A) "Child care expenses" means actual expenses 14        reasonably necessary to enable a parent or non-parent 15        custodian to be employed, to attend educational or 16        vocational training programs to improve employment 17        opportunities, or to search for employment. "Child 18        care expenses" also includes deposits for securing 19        placement in a child care program, the cost of before 20        and after school care, and camps when school is not in 21        session. A child's special needs shall be a 22        consideration in determining reasonable child care 23        expenses.24            (B) Child care expenses shall be prorated in 25        proportion to each parent's percentage share of 26        combined net income, and may be added to the basic   HB1889- 16 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        child support obligation if not paid directly by each 2        parent to the provider of child care services. The 3        obligor's and obligee's portion of actual child care 4        expenses shall appear in the support order. If 5        allowed, the value of the federal income tax credit 6        for child care shall be subtracted from the actual 7        cost to determine the net child care costs.8            (C) The amount of child care expenses shall be 9        adequate to obtain reasonable and necessary child 10        care. The actual child care expenses shall be used to 11        calculate the child care expenses, if available. When 12        actual child care expenses vary, the actual child care 13        expenses may be averaged over the most recent 12-month 14        period. When a parent is temporarily unemployed or 15        temporarily not attending educational or vocational 16        training programs, future child care expenses shall be 17        based upon prospective expenses to be incurred upon 18        return to employment or educational or vocational 19        training programs.20            (D) An order for child care expenses may be 21        modified upon a showing of a substantial change in 22        circumstances. The party incurring child care expenses 23        shall notify the other party within 14 days of any 24        change in the amount of child care expenses that would 25        affect the annualized child care amount as determined 26        in the support order.   HB1889- 17 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        (3.8) Shared physical care. If each parent exercises 2    146 or more overnights per year with the child, the basic 3    child support obligation is multiplied by 1.5 to calculate 4    the shared care child support obligation. The court shall 5    determine each parent's share of the shared care child 6    support obligation based on the parent's percentage share 7    of combined net income. The child support obligation is 8    then computed for each parent by multiplying that parent's 9    portion of the shared care support obligation by the 10    percentage of time the child spends with the other parent. 11    The respective child support obligations are then offset, 12    with the parent owing more child support paying the 13    difference between the child support amounts. The Illinois 14    Department of Healthcare and Family Services shall 15    promulgate a worksheet to calculate child support in cases 16    in which the parents have shared physical care and use the 17    standardized tax amount to determine net income.18        (3.9) Split physical care. When there is more than one 19    child and each parent has physical care of at least one but 20    not all of the children, the support is calculated by 21    using 2 child support worksheets to determine the support 22    each parent owes the other. The support shall be 23    calculated as follows:24            (A) compute the support the first parent would owe 25        to other parent as if the child in his or her care was 26        the only child of the parties; then  HB1889- 18 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            (B) compute the support the other parent would owe 2        to the first parent as if the child in his or her care 3        were the only child of the parties; then4            (C) subtract the lesser support obligation from 5        the greater.6        The parent who owes the greater obligation shall be 7    ordered to pay the difference in support to the other 8    parent, unless the court determines, pursuant to other 9    provisions of this Section, that it should deviate from 10    the guidelines. 11        (4) Health care to be addressed by the court.12            (A) A portion of the basic child support 13        obligation is intended to cover basic ordinary 14        out-of-pocket medical expenses. The court, in its 15        discretion, in addition to the basic child support 16        obligation, shall also provide for the child's current 17        and future medical needs by ordering either or both 18        parents to initiate health insurance coverage for the 19        child through currently effective health insurance 20        policies held by the parent or parents, purchase one 21        or more or all health, dental, or vision insurance 22        policies for the child, or provide for the child's 23        current and future medical needs through some other 24        manner.25            (B) The court, in its discretion, may order either 26        or both parents to contribute to the reasonable health   HB1889- 19 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        care needs of the child not covered by insurance, 2        including, but not limited to, unreimbursed medical, 3        dental, orthodontic, or vision expenses and any 4        prescription medication for the child not covered 5        under the child's health insurance.6            (C) If neither parent has access to appropriate 7        private health insurance coverage, the court may 8        order:9                (I) one or both parents to provide health 10            insurance coverage at any time it becomes 11            available at a reasonable cost; or12                (II) the parent or non-parent custodian with 13            primary physical responsibility for the child to 14            apply for public health insurance coverage for the 15            child and require either or both parents to pay a 16            reasonable amount of the cost of health insurance 17            for the child.18            The order may also provide that any time private 19        health insurance coverage is available at a reasonable 20        cost to that party it will be provided instead of cash 21        medical support. As used in this Section, "cash 22        medical support" means an amount ordered to be paid 23        toward the cost of health insurance provided by a 24        public entity or by another person through employment 25        or otherwise or for other medical costs not covered by 26        insurance.   HB1889- 20 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            (D) The amount to be added to the basic child 2        support obligation shall be the actual amount of the 3        total health insurance premium that is attributable to 4        the child who is the subject of the order. If this 5        amount is not available or cannot be verified, the 6        total cost of the health insurance premium shall be 7        divided by the total number of persons covered by the 8        policy. The cost per person derived from this 9        calculation shall be multiplied by the number of 10        children who are the subject of the order and who are 11        covered under the health insurance policy. This amount 12        shall be added to the basic child support obligation 13        and shall be allocated between the parents in 14        proportion to their respective net incomes.15            (E) After the health insurance premium for the 16        child is added to the basic child support obligation 17        and allocated between the parents in proportion to 18        their respective incomes for child support purposes, 19        if the obligor is paying the premium, the amount 20        calculated for the obligee's share of the health 21        insurance premium for the child shall be deducted from 22        the obligor's share of the total child support 23        obligation. If the obligee is paying for private 24        health insurance for the child, the child support 25        obligation shall be increased by the obligor's share 26        of the premium payment. The obligor's and obligee's   HB1889- 21 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        portion of health insurance costs shall appear in the 2        support order.3            (F) Prior to allowing the health insurance 4        adjustment, the parent requesting the adjustment must 5        submit proof that the child has been enrolled in a 6        health insurance plan and must submit proof of the 7        cost of the premium. The court shall require the 8        parent receiving the adjustment to annually submit 9        proof of continued coverage of the child to the other 10        parent, or as designated by the court.11            (G) A reasonable cost for providing health 12        insurance coverage for the child may not exceed 5% of 13        the providing parent's gross income. Parents with a 14        net income below 133% of the most recent United States 15        Department of Health and Human Services Federal 16        Poverty Guidelines or whose child is covered by 17        Medicaid based on that parent's income may not be 18        ordered to contribute toward or provide private 19        coverage, unless private coverage is obtainable 20        without any financial contribution by that parent.21            (H) If dental or vision insurance is included as 22        part of the employer's medical plan, the coverage 23        shall be maintained for the child. If not included in 24        the employer's medical plan, adding the dental or 25        vision insurance for the child is at the discretion of 26        the court.  HB1889- 22 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            (I) If a parent has been directed to provide 2        health insurance pursuant to this paragraph and that 3        parent's spouse or legally recognized partner provides 4        the insurance for the benefit of the child either 5        directly or through employment, a credit on the child 6        support worksheet shall be given to that parent in the 7        same manner as if the premium were paid by that parent.8        (4.5) In a proceeding for child support following 9    dissolution of the marriage or civil union by a court that 10    lacked personal jurisdiction over the absent spouse, and 11    in which the court is requiring payment of support for the 12    period before the date an order for current support is 13    entered, there is a rebuttable presumption that the 14    obligor's net income for the prior period was the same as 15    his or her net income at the time the order for current 16    support is entered.17        (5) If the net income cannot be determined because of 18    default or any other reason, the court shall order support 19    in an amount considered reasonable in the particular case. 20    The final order in all cases shall state the support level 21    in dollar amounts. However, if the court finds that the 22    child support amount cannot be expressed exclusively as a 23    dollar amount because all or a portion of the obligor's 24    net income is uncertain as to source, time of payment, or 25    amount, the court may order a percentage amount of support 26    in addition to a specific dollar amount and enter such   HB1889- 23 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    other orders as may be necessary to determine and enforce, 2    on a timely basis, the applicable support ordered.3        (6) If (i) the obligor was properly served with a 4    request for discovery of financial information relating to 5    the obligor's ability to provide child support, (ii) the 6    obligor failed to comply with the request, despite having 7    been ordered to do so by the court, and (iii) the obligor 8    is not present at the hearing to determine support despite 9    having received proper notice, then any relevant financial 10    information concerning the obligor's ability to provide 11    child support that was obtained pursuant to subpoena and 12    proper notice shall be admitted into evidence without the 13    need to establish any further foundation for its 14    admission.15    (a-3) Life insurance to secure support. At the discretion 16of the court, a child support obligation pursuant to this 17Section and Sections 510, 513, and 513.5 of this Act may be 18secured, in whole or in part, by reasonably affordable life 19insurance on the life of one or both parents on such terms as 20the parties agree or as the court orders. The court may require 21such insurance remain in full force and effect until the 22termination of all obligations of support, subject to the 23following:24        (1) Existing life insurance. The court shall be 25    apprised through evidence, stipulation, or otherwise as to 26    the level, ownership, and type of existing life insurance   HB1889- 24 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    death benefit coverage available to one or both parents, 2    the cost of the premiums, cost ratings, and escalations 3    and assignment of the policy, if applicable, and all other 4    relevant circumstances. The court shall make findings 5    relative thereto.6        (2) New life insurance. The court shall be apprised 7    through evidence, stipulation, or otherwise as to the 8    availability of obtaining reasonably affordable new life 9    insurance. To the extent the court determines that the 10    support obligations should be secured, in whole or in 11    part, by new life insurance on the life of one or both 12    parents, the court may order that one or both parents 13    comply with all requirements to obtain such new life 14    insurance through employment, trade union, fraternal 15    organizations, associations, or individual means.16        In determining the level and type of death benefits 17    coverage to be obtained by a parent, the court shall 18    consider access and availability of life insurance to that 19    parent, the cost of the premium, cost ratings, and 20    escalations, if applicable, and all other relevant 21    circumstances.22        (3) Other security. If life insurance is unavailable 23    to a parent, the court, in its discretion, or as agreed to 24    by the parties, may order other equitable and reasonable 25    means to secure a child support obligation. 26    (a-5) In an action to enforce an order for child support   HB1889- 25 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1based on the obligor's failure to make support payments as 2required by the order, notice of proceedings to hold the 3obligor in contempt for that failure may be served on the 4obligor by personal service or by regular mail addressed to 5the last known address of the obligor. The last known address 6of the obligor may be determined from records of the clerk of 7the court, from the Federal Case Registry of Child Support 8Orders, or by any other reasonable means.9    (b) Failure of either parent to comply with an order to pay 10support shall be punishable as in other cases of contempt. In 11addition to other penalties provided by law the court may, 12after finding the parent guilty of contempt, order that the 13parent be:14        (1) placed on probation with such conditions of 15    probation as the court deems advisable;16        (2) sentenced to periodic imprisonment for a period 17    not to exceed 6 months; provided, however, that the court 18    may permit the parent to be released for periods of time 19    during the day or night to:20            (A) work; or21            (B) conduct a business or other self-employed 22        occupation.23    The court may further order any part or all of the earnings 24of a parent during a sentence of periodic imprisonment paid to 25the Clerk of the Circuit Court or to the parent having physical 26possession of the child or to the non-parent custodian having   HB1889- 26 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1custody of the child of the sentenced parent for the support of 2the child until further order of the court.3    If a parent who is found guilty of contempt for failure to 4comply with an order to pay support is a person who conducts a 5business or who is self-employed, the court in addition to 6other penalties provided by law may order that the parent do 7one or more of the following: (i) provide to the court monthly 8financial statements showing income and expenses from the 9business or the self-employment; (ii) seek employment and 10report periodically to the court with a diary, listing, or 11other memorandum of his or her employment search efforts; or 12(iii) report to the Department of Employment Security for job 13search services to find employment that will be subject to 14withholding for child support. 15    If there is a unity of interest and ownership sufficient 16to render no financial separation between an obligor and 17another person or persons or business entity, the court may 18pierce the ownership veil of the person, persons, or business 19entity to discover assets of the obligor held in the name of 20that person, those persons, or that business entity. The 21following circumstances are sufficient to authorize a court to 22order discovery of the assets of a person, persons, or 23business entity and to compel the application of any 24discovered assets toward payment on the judgment for support:25        (1) the obligor and the person, persons, or business 26    entity maintain records together.  HB1889- 27 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        (2) the obligor and the person, persons, or business 2    entity fail to maintain an arm's length relationship 3    between themselves with regard to any assets.4        (3) the obligor transfers assets to the person, 5    persons, or business entity with the intent to perpetrate 6    a fraud on the obligee.7    With respect to assets which are real property, no order 8entered under this paragraph shall affect the rights of bona 9fide purchasers, mortgagees, judgment creditors, or other lien 10holders who acquire their interests in the property prior to 11the time a notice of lis pendens pursuant to the Code of Civil 12Procedure or a copy of the order is placed of record in the 13office of the recorder of deeds for the county in which the 14real property is located.15    The court may also order in cases where the parent is 90 16days or more delinquent in payment of support or has been 17adjudicated in arrears in an amount equal to 90 days 18obligation or more, that the parent's Illinois driving 19privileges be suspended until the court determines that the 20parent is in compliance with the order of support. The court 21may also order that the parent be issued a family financial 22responsibility driving permit that would allow limited driving 23privileges for employment and medical purposes in accordance 24with Section 7-702.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. The Clerk 25of the Circuit Court shall certify the order suspending the 26driving privileges of the parent or granting the issuance of a   HB1889- 28 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1family financial responsibility driving permit to the 2Secretary of State on forms prescribed by the Secretary of 3State. Upon receipt of the authenticated documents, the 4Secretary of State shall suspend the parent's driving 5privileges until further order of the court and shall, if 6ordered by the court, subject to the provisions of Section 77-702.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, issue a family financial 8responsibility driving permit to the parent.9    In addition to the penalties or punishment that may be 10imposed under this Section, any person whose conduct 11constitutes a violation of Section 15 of the Non-Support 12Punishment Act may be prosecuted under that Act, and a person 13convicted under that Act may be sentenced in accordance with 14that Act. The sentence may include but need not be limited to a 15requirement that the person perform community service under 16Section 50 of that Act or participate in a work alternative 17program under Section 50 of that Act. A person may not be 18required to participate in a work alternative program under 19Section 50 of that Act if the person is currently 20participating in a work program pursuant to Section 505.1 of 21this Act.22    A support obligation, or any portion of a support 23obligation, which becomes due and remains unpaid as of the end 24of each month, excluding the child support that was due for 25that month to the extent that it was not paid in that month, 26shall accrue simple interest as set forth in Section 12-109 of   HB1889- 29 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1the Code of Civil Procedure. An order for support entered or 2modified on or after January 1, 2006 shall contain a statement 3that a support obligation required under the order, or any 4portion of a support obligation required under the order, that 5becomes due and remains unpaid as of the end of each month, 6excluding the child support that was due for that month to the 7extent that it was not paid in that month, shall accrue simple 8interest as set forth in Section 12-109 of the Code of Civil 9Procedure. Failure to include the statement in the order for 10support does not affect the validity of the order or the 11accrual of interest as provided in this Section.12    (c) A one-time charge of 20% is imposable upon the amount 13of past-due child support owed on July 1, 1988 which has 14accrued under a support order entered by the court. The charge 15shall be imposed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1610-21 of the Illinois Public Aid Code and shall be enforced by 17the court upon petition.18    (d) Any new or existing support order entered by the court 19under this Section shall be deemed to be a series of judgments 20against the person obligated to pay support thereunder, each 21such judgment to be in the amount of each payment or 22installment of support and each such judgment to be deemed 23entered as of the date the corresponding payment or 24installment becomes due under the terms of the support order. 25Each such judgment shall have the full force, effect and 26attributes of any other judgment of this State, including the   HB1889- 30 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1ability to be enforced. Notwithstanding any other State or 2local law to the contrary, a lien arises by operation of law 3against the real and personal property of the obligor for each 4installment of overdue support owed by the obligor.5    (e) When child support is to be paid through the Clerk of 6the Court in a county of 500,000 inhabitants or less, the order 7shall direct the obligor to pay to the Clerk, in addition to 8the child support payments, all fees imposed by the county 9board under paragraph (2) of subsection (j-5) of Section 27.1b 10of the Clerks of Courts Act. When child support is to be paid 11through the clerk of the court in a county of more than 500,000 12but less than 3,000,000 inhabitants, the order shall direct 13the obligor to pay to the clerk, in addition to the child 14support payments, all fees imposed by the county board under 15paragraph (4) of subsection (bb) of Section 27.2 of the Clerks 16of Courts Act. Unless paid pursuant to an Income Withholding 17Order/Notice for Support, the payment of the fee shall be by 18payment acceptable to the clerk and shall be made to the order 19of the Clerk.20    (f) All orders for support, when entered or modified, 21shall include a provision requiring the obligor to notify the 22court and, in cases in which a party is receiving child and 23spouse services under Article X of the Illinois Public Aid 24Code, the Department of Healthcare and Family Services, within 257 days, (i) of the name and address of any new employer of the 26obligor, (ii) whether the obligor has access to health   HB1889- 31 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1insurance coverage through the employer or other group 2coverage and, if so, the policy name and number and the names 3of persons covered under the policy, except only the initials 4of any covered minors shall be included, and (iii) of any new 5residential or mailing address or telephone number of the 6obligor. In any subsequent action to enforce a support order, 7upon a sufficient showing that a diligent effort has been made 8to ascertain the location of the obligor, service of process 9or provision of notice necessary in the case may be made at the 10last known address of the obligor in any manner expressly 11provided by the Code of Civil Procedure or this Act, which 12service shall be sufficient for purposes of due process.13    (g) An order for support shall include a date on which the 14current support obligation terminates. The termination date 15shall be no earlier than the date on which the child covered by 16the order will attain the age of 18. However, if the child will 17not graduate from high school until after attaining the age of 1818, then the termination date shall be no earlier than the 19earlier of the date on which the child's high school 20graduation will occur or the date on which the child will 21attain the age of 19. The order for support shall state that 22the termination date does not apply to any arrearage that may 23remain unpaid on that date. Nothing in this subsection shall 24be construed to prevent the court from modifying the order or 25terminating the order in the event the child is otherwise 26emancipated.  HB1889- 32 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    (g-5) If there is an unpaid arrearage or delinquency (as 2those terms are defined in the Income Withholding for Support 3Act) equal to at least one month's support obligation on the 4termination date stated in the order for support or, if there 5is no termination date stated in the order, on the date the 6child attains the age of majority or is otherwise emancipated, 7the periodic amount required to be paid for current support of 8that child immediately prior to that date shall automatically 9continue to be an obligation, not as current support but as 10periodic payment toward satisfaction of the unpaid arrearage 11or delinquency. That periodic payment shall be in addition to 12any periodic payment previously required for satisfaction of 13the arrearage or delinquency. The total periodic amount to be 14paid toward satisfaction of the arrearage or delinquency may 15be enforced and collected by any method provided by law for 16enforcement and collection of child support, including but not 17limited to income withholding under the Income Withholding for 18Support Act. Each order for support entered or modified on or 19after January 1, 2005 (the effective date of Public Act 2093-1061) must contain a statement notifying the parties of the 21requirements of this subsection. Failure to include the 22statement in the order for support does not affect the 23validity of the order or the operation of the provisions of 24this subsection with regard to the order. This subsection 25shall not be construed to prevent or affect the establishment 26or modification of an order for support of a minor child or the   HB1889- 33 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1establishment or modification of an order for support of a 2non-minor child or educational expenses under Section 513 of 3this Act. 4    (h) An order entered under this Section shall include a 5provision requiring either parent to report to the other 6parent and to the Clerk of Court within 10 days each time 7either parent obtains new employment, and each time either 8parent's employment is terminated for any reason. The report 9shall be in writing and shall, in the case of new employment, 10include the name and address of the new employer. Failure to 11report new employment or the termination of current 12employment, if coupled with nonpayment of support for a period 13in excess of 60 days, is indirect criminal contempt. For 14either parent arrested for failure to report new employment 15bond shall be set in the amount of the child support that 16should have been paid during the period of unreported 17employment. An order entered under this Section shall also 18include a provision requiring either obligor and obligee to 19advise the other of a change in residence within 5 days of the 20change except when the court finds that the physical, mental, 21or emotional health of a party or that of a child, or both, 22would be seriously endangered by disclosure of the party's 23address.24    (i) The court does not lose the powers of contempt, 25driver's license suspension, or other child support 26enforcement mechanisms, including, but not limited to,   HB1889- 34 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1criminal prosecution as set forth in this Act, upon the 2emancipation of the minor child.3(Source: P.A. 102-823, eff. 5-13-22; 103-967, eff. 1-1-25.)

Full Text of HB1889 ILGA.GOV HB1889 - 104th General Assembly 104TH GENERAL ASSEMBLY State of Illinois 2025 and 2026HB1889 Introduced 1/29/2025, by Rep. Anne Stava-Murray SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 750 ILCS 5/505  from Ch. 40, par. 505    Amends the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. Excludes from the definition of a parent's "gross income" income or value received by a parent as a gift that is the voluntary transfer of property, including, but not limited to, money that is completely free of repayment or obligation while both the giver and the parent are still alive.LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b  A BILL FOR HB1889LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    AN ACT concerning civil law. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 5Marriage Act is amended by changing Section 505 as follows: 6    (750 ILCS 5/505)  (from Ch. 40, par. 505)7    Sec. 505. Child support; contempt; penalties. 8    (a) In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, legal 9separation, declaration of invalidity of marriage, or 10dissolution of a civil union, a proceeding for child support 11following a legal separation or dissolution of the marriage or 12civil union by a court that lacked personal jurisdiction over 13the absent spouse, a proceeding for modification of a previous 14order for child support under Section 510 of this Act, or any 15proceeding authorized under Section 501 or 601 of this Act, 16the court may order either or both parents owing a duty of 17support to a child of the marriage or civil union to pay an 18amount reasonable and necessary for support. The duty of 19support owed to a child includes the obligation to provide for 20the reasonable and necessary physical, mental and emotional 21health needs of the child. For purposes of this Section, the 22term "child" shall include any child under age 18 and any child 23age 19 or younger who is still attending high school. For   HB1889- 2 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1purposes of this Section, the term "obligor" means the parent 2obligated to pay support to the other parent.3        (1) Child support guidelines. The Illinois Department 4    of Healthcare and Family Services shall adopt rules 5    establishing child support guidelines which include 6    worksheets to aid in the calculation of the child support 7    obligations and a schedule of basic child support 8    obligations that reflects the percentage of combined net 9    income that parents living in the same household in this 10    State ordinarily spend on their child. The child support 11    guidelines have the following purposes:12            (A) to establish as State policy an adequate 13        standard of support for a child, subject to the 14        ability of parents to pay;15            (B) to make child support obligations more 16        equitable by ensuring more consistent treatment of 17        parents in similar circumstances;18            (C) to improve the efficiency of the court process 19        by promoting settlements and giving courts and the 20        parties guidance in establishing levels of child 21        support;22            (D) to calculate child support based upon the 23        parents' combined net income estimated to have been 24        allocated for the support of the child if the parents 25        and child were living in an intact household;26            (E) to adjust child support based upon the needs   HB1889- 3 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        of the child; and2            (F) to allocate the amount of child support to be 3        paid by each parent based upon a parent's net income 4        and the child's physical care arrangements.5        (1.5) Computation of basic child support obligation. 6    The court shall compute the basic child support obligation 7    by taking the following steps:8            (A) determine each parent's monthly net income;9            (B) add the parents' monthly net incomes together 10        to determine the combined monthly net income of the 11        parents;12            (C) select the corresponding appropriate amount 13        from the schedule of basic child support obligations 14        based on the parties' combined monthly net income and 15        number of children of the parties; and16            (D) calculate each parent's percentage share of 17        the basic child support obligation.18        Although a monetary obligation is computed for each 19    parent as child support, the receiving parent's share is 20    not payable to the other parent and is presumed to be spent 21    directly on the child. 22        (2) Duty of support. The court shall determine child 23    support in each case by applying the child support 24    guidelines unless the court makes a finding that 25    application of the guidelines would be inappropriate, 26    after considering the best interests of the child and   HB1889- 4 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    evidence which shows relevant factors including, but not 2    limited to, one or more of the following:3            (A) the financial resources and needs of the 4        child;5            (B) the financial resources and needs of the 6        parents;7            (C) the standard of living the child would have 8        enjoyed had the marriage or civil union not been 9        dissolved; and10            (D) the physical and emotional condition of the 11        child and his or her educational needs.12        (3) Income.13            (A) As used in this Section, "gross income" means 14        the total of all income from all sources, except 15        "gross income" does not include (i) benefits received 16        by the parent from means-tested public assistance 17        programs, including, but not limited to, Temporary 18        Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Security 19        Income, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 20        Program; or (ii) benefits and income received by the 21        parent for other children in the household, including, 22        but not limited to, child support, survivor benefits, 23        and foster care payments; or (iii) income or value 24        received by a parent as a gift that is the voluntary 25        transfer of property, including but not limited to, 26        money that is completely free of repayment or   HB1889- 5 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        obligation while both the giver and the parent are 2        still alive. Social security disability and retirement 3        benefits paid for the benefit of the subject child 4        must be included in the disabled or retired parent's 5        gross income for purposes of calculating the parent's 6        child support obligation, but the parent is entitled 7        to a child support credit for the amount of benefits 8        paid to the other party for the child. "Gross income" 9        includes maintenance treated as taxable income for 10        federal income tax purposes to the payee and received 11        pursuant to a court order in the pending proceedings 12        or any other proceedings and shall be included in the 13        payee's gross income for purposes of calculating the 14        parent's child support obligation. 15            (B) As used in this Section, "net income" means 16        gross income minus either the standardized tax amount 17        calculated pursuant to subparagraph (C) of this 18        paragraph (3) or the individualized tax amount 19        calculated pursuant to subparagraph (D) of this 20        paragraph (3), and minus any adjustments pursuant to 21        subparagraph (F) of this paragraph (3). The 22        standardized tax amount shall be used unless the 23        requirements for an individualized tax amount set 24        forth in subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (3) are 25        met. "Net income" includes maintenance not includable 26        in the gross taxable income of the payee for federal   HB1889- 6 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        income tax purposes under a court order in the pending 2        proceedings or any other proceedings and shall be 3        included in the payee's net income for purposes of 4        calculating the parent's child support obligation.5            (C) As used in this Section, "standardized tax 6        amount" means the total of federal and state income 7        taxes for a single person claiming the standard tax 8        deduction, one personal exemption, and the applicable 9        number of dependency exemptions for the minor child or 10        children of the parties, and Social Security and 11        Medicare tax calculated at the Federal Insurance 12        Contributions Act rate.13                (I) Unless a court has determined otherwise or 14            the parties otherwise agree, the party with the 15            majority of parenting time shall be deemed 16            entitled to claim the dependency exemption for the 17            parties' minor child.18                (II) The Illinois Department of Healthcare and 19            Family Services shall promulgate a standardized 20            net income conversion table that computes net 21            income by deducting the standardized tax amount 22            from gross income.23            (D) As used in this Section, "individualized tax 24        amount" means the aggregate of the following taxes:25                (I) federal income tax (properly calculated 26            withholding or estimated payments);  HB1889- 7 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1                (II) State income tax (properly calculated 2            withholding or estimated payments); and3                (III) Social Security or self-employment tax, 4            if applicable (or, if none, mandatory retirement 5            contributions required by law or as a condition of 6            employment) and Medicare tax calculated at the 7            Federal Insurance Contributions Act rate.8            (E) In lieu of a standardized tax amount, a 9        determination of an individualized tax amount may be 10        made under items (I), (II), or (III) below. If an 11        individualized tax amount determination is made under 12        this subparagraph (E), all relevant tax attributes 13        (including filing status, allocation of dependency 14        exemptions, and whether a party is to claim the use of 15        the standard deduction or itemized deductions for 16        federal income tax purposes) shall be as the parties 17        agree or as the court determines. To determine a 18        party's reported income, the court may order the party 19        to complete an Internal Revenue Service Form 4506-T, 20        Request for Tax Transcript. 21                (I) Agreement. Irrespective of whether the 22            parties agree on any other issue before the court, 23            if they jointly stipulate for the record their 24            concurrence on a computation method for the 25            individualized tax amount that is different from 26            the method set forth under subparagraph (D), the   HB1889- 8 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            stipulated method shall be used by the court 2            unless the court rejects the proposed stipulated 3            method for good cause.4                (II) Summary hearing. If the court determines 5            child support in a summary hearing under Section 6            501 and an eligible party opts in to the 7            individualized tax amount method under this item 8            (II), the individualized tax amount shall be 9            determined by the court on the basis of 10            information contained in one or both parties' 11            Supreme Court approved Financial Affidavit (Family &12             Divorce Cases) and relevant supporting documents 13            under applicable court rules. No party, however, 14            is eligible to opt in unless the party, under 15            applicable court rules, has served the other party 16            with the required Supreme Court approved Financial 17            Affidavit (Family & Divorce Cases) and has 18            substantially produced supporting documents 19            required by the applicable court rules.20                (III) Evidentiary hearing. If the court 21            determines child support in an evidentiary 22            hearing, whether for purposes of a temporary order 23            or at the conclusion of a proceeding, item (II) of 24            this subparagraph (E) does not apply. In each such 25            case (unless item (I) governs), the individualized 26            tax amount shall be as determined by the court on   HB1889- 9 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            the basis of the record established. 2            (F) Adjustments to income.3                (I) Multi-family adjustment. If a parent is 4            also legally responsible for support of a child 5            not shared with the other parent and not subject 6            to the present proceeding, there shall be an 7            adjustment to net income as follows:8                    (i) Multi-family adjustment with court 9                order. The court shall deduct from the 10                parent's net income the amount of child 11                support actually paid by the parent pursuant 12                to a support order unless the court makes a 13                finding that it would cause economic hardship 14                to the child.15                    (ii) Multi-family adjustment without court 16                order. Upon the request or application of a 17                parent actually supporting a presumed, 18                acknowledged, or adjudicated child living in 19                or outside of that parent's household, there 20                shall be an adjustment to child support. The 21                court shall deduct from the parent's net 22                income the amount of financial support 23                actually paid by the parent for the child or 24                75% of the support the parent should pay under 25                the child support guidelines (before this 26                adjustment), whichever is less, unless the   HB1889- 10 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1                court makes a finding that it would cause 2                economic hardship to the child. The adjustment 3                shall be calculated using that parent's income 4                alone.5                (II) Spousal Maintenance adjustment. 6            Obligations pursuant to a court order for spousal 7            maintenance in the pending proceeding actually 8            paid or payable to the same party to whom child 9            support is to be payable or actually paid to a 10            former spouse pursuant to a court order shall be 11            deducted from the parent's after-tax income, 12            unless the maintenance obligation is tax 13            deductible to the payor for federal income tax 14            purposes, in which case it shall be deducted from 15            the payor's gross income for purposes of 16            calculating the parent's child support obligation.17        (3.1) Business income. For purposes of calculating 18    child support, net business income from the operation of a 19    business means gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary 20    expenses required to carry on the trade or business. As 21    used in this paragraph, "business" includes, but is not 22    limited to, sole proprietorships, closely held 23    corporations, partnerships, other flow-through business 24    entities, and self-employment. The court shall apply the 25    following:26            (A) The accelerated component of depreciation and   HB1889- 11 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        any business expenses determined either judicially or 2        administratively to be inappropriate or excessive 3        shall be excluded from the total of ordinary and 4        necessary business expenses to be deducted in the 5        determination of net business income from gross 6        business income.7            (B) Any item of reimbursement or in-kind payment 8        received by a parent from a business, including, but 9        not limited to, a company car, reimbursed meals, free 10        housing, or a housing allowance, shall be counted as 11        income if not otherwise included in the recipient's 12        gross income, if the item is significant in amount and 13        reduces personal expenses.14        (3.2a) Unemployment or underemployment. If a parent is 15    voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, child support 16    shall be calculated based on a determination of potential 17    income. In determining potential income, the court shall 18    consider the specific circumstances of a party, to the 19    extent known, including, but not limited to, the parent's:20            (1) assets;21            (2) ownership of a substantial non-income 22        producing asset;23            (3) residence;24            (4) employment and earning history;25            (5) job skills;26            (6) educational attainment;  HB1889- 12 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            (7) literacy;2            (8) age;3            (9) health;4            (10) criminal records and other employment 5        barriers; and6            (11) record of seeking work.7        The court shall also consider the local job market, 8    availability of local employers willing to hire the 9    parent, prevailing earning levels in the local community, 10    and other relevant background factors in the case. If 11    there is insufficient work history to determine employment 12    potential and probable earnings level, there shall be a 13    rebuttable presumption that the parent's potential income 14    is 75% of the most recent United States Department of 15    Health and Human Services Federal Poverty Guidelines for a 16    family of one person. Incarceration shall not be 17    considered voluntary unemployment for child support 18    purposes in establishing or modifying child support. 19        (3.2b) The court may impute income to a party only 20    upon conducting an evidentiary hearing or by agreement of 21    the parties. Imputation of income shall be accompanied by 22    specific written findings identifying the basis or bases 23    for imputation using these factors.24        (3.3) Rebuttable presumption in favor of guidelines. 25    There is a rebuttable presumption in any judicial or 26    administrative proceeding for child support that the   HB1889- 13 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    amount of the child support obligation that would result 2    from the application of the child support guidelines is 3    the correct amount of child support. 4        (3.3a) Minimum child support obligation. There is a 5    rebuttable presumption that a minimum child support 6    obligation of $40 per month, per child, will be entered 7    for an obligor who has actual or imputed gross income at or 8    less than 75% of the most recent United States Department 9    of Health and Human Services Federal Poverty Guidelines 10    for a family of one person, with a maximum total child 11    support obligation for that obligor of $120 per month to 12    be divided equally among all of the obligor's children.13        (3.3b) Zero dollar child support order. For parents 14    with no gross income, who receive only means-tested 15    assistance, or who cannot work due to a medically proven 16    disability, incarceration, or institutionalization, there 17    is a rebuttable presumption that the $40 per month minimum 18    support order is inapplicable and a zero dollar order 19    shall be entered. 20        (3.4) Deviation factors. In any action to establish or 21    modify child support, whether pursuant to a temporary or 22    final administrative or court order, the child support 23    guidelines shall be used as a rebuttable presumption for 24    the establishment or modification of the amount of child 25    support. The court may deviate from the child support 26    guidelines if the application would be inequitable,   HB1889- 14 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    unjust, or inappropriate. Any deviation from the 2    guidelines shall be accompanied by written findings by the 3    court specifying the reasons for the deviation and the 4    presumed amount under the child support guidelines without 5    a deviation. These reasons may include:6            (A) extraordinary medical expenditures necessary 7        to preserve the life or health of a party or a child of 8        either or both of the parties;9            (B) additional expenses incurred for a child 10        subject to the child support order who has special 11        medical, physical, or developmental needs; and12            (C) any other factor the court determines should 13        be applied upon a finding that the application of the 14        child support guidelines would be inappropriate, after 15        considering the best interest of the child. 16        (3.5) Income in excess of the schedule of basic child 17    support obligation. A court may use its discretion to 18    determine child support if the combined adjusted net 19    income of the parties exceeds the highest level of the 20    schedule of basic child support obligation, except that 21    the basic child support obligation shall not be less than 22    the highest level of combined net income set forth in the 23    schedule of basic child support obligation. 24        (3.6) Extracurricular activities and school expenses. 25    The court, in its discretion, in addition to the basic 26    child support obligation, may order either or both parents   HB1889- 15 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    owing a duty of support to the child to contribute to the 2    reasonable school and extracurricular activity expenses 3    incurred which are intended to enhance the educational, 4    athletic, social, or cultural development of the child.5        (3.7) Child care expenses. The court, in its 6    discretion, in addition to the basic child support 7    obligation, may order either or both parents owing a duty 8    of support to the child to contribute to the reasonable 9    child care expenses of the child. The child care expenses 10    shall be made payable directly to a party or directly to 11    the child care provider at the time of child care 12    services. 13            (A) "Child care expenses" means actual expenses 14        reasonably necessary to enable a parent or non-parent 15        custodian to be employed, to attend educational or 16        vocational training programs to improve employment 17        opportunities, or to search for employment. "Child 18        care expenses" also includes deposits for securing 19        placement in a child care program, the cost of before 20        and after school care, and camps when school is not in 21        session. A child's special needs shall be a 22        consideration in determining reasonable child care 23        expenses.24            (B) Child care expenses shall be prorated in 25        proportion to each parent's percentage share of 26        combined net income, and may be added to the basic   HB1889- 16 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        child support obligation if not paid directly by each 2        parent to the provider of child care services. The 3        obligor's and obligee's portion of actual child care 4        expenses shall appear in the support order. If 5        allowed, the value of the federal income tax credit 6        for child care shall be subtracted from the actual 7        cost to determine the net child care costs.8            (C) The amount of child care expenses shall be 9        adequate to obtain reasonable and necessary child 10        care. The actual child care expenses shall be used to 11        calculate the child care expenses, if available. When 12        actual child care expenses vary, the actual child care 13        expenses may be averaged over the most recent 12-month 14        period. When a parent is temporarily unemployed or 15        temporarily not attending educational or vocational 16        training programs, future child care expenses shall be 17        based upon prospective expenses to be incurred upon 18        return to employment or educational or vocational 19        training programs.20            (D) An order for child care expenses may be 21        modified upon a showing of a substantial change in 22        circumstances. The party incurring child care expenses 23        shall notify the other party within 14 days of any 24        change in the amount of child care expenses that would 25        affect the annualized child care amount as determined 26        in the support order.   HB1889- 17 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        (3.8) Shared physical care. If each parent exercises 2    146 or more overnights per year with the child, the basic 3    child support obligation is multiplied by 1.5 to calculate 4    the shared care child support obligation. The court shall 5    determine each parent's share of the shared care child 6    support obligation based on the parent's percentage share 7    of combined net income. The child support obligation is 8    then computed for each parent by multiplying that parent's 9    portion of the shared care support obligation by the 10    percentage of time the child spends with the other parent. 11    The respective child support obligations are then offset, 12    with the parent owing more child support paying the 13    difference between the child support amounts. The Illinois 14    Department of Healthcare and Family Services shall 15    promulgate a worksheet to calculate child support in cases 16    in which the parents have shared physical care and use the 17    standardized tax amount to determine net income.18        (3.9) Split physical care. When there is more than one 19    child and each parent has physical care of at least one but 20    not all of the children, the support is calculated by 21    using 2 child support worksheets to determine the support 22    each parent owes the other. The support shall be 23    calculated as follows:24            (A) compute the support the first parent would owe 25        to other parent as if the child in his or her care was 26        the only child of the parties; then  HB1889- 18 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            (B) compute the support the other parent would owe 2        to the first parent as if the child in his or her care 3        were the only child of the parties; then4            (C) subtract the lesser support obligation from 5        the greater.6        The parent who owes the greater obligation shall be 7    ordered to pay the difference in support to the other 8    parent, unless the court determines, pursuant to other 9    provisions of this Section, that it should deviate from 10    the guidelines. 11        (4) Health care to be addressed by the court.12            (A) A portion of the basic child support 13        obligation is intended to cover basic ordinary 14        out-of-pocket medical expenses. The court, in its 15        discretion, in addition to the basic child support 16        obligation, shall also provide for the child's current 17        and future medical needs by ordering either or both 18        parents to initiate health insurance coverage for the 19        child through currently effective health insurance 20        policies held by the parent or parents, purchase one 21        or more or all health, dental, or vision insurance 22        policies for the child, or provide for the child's 23        current and future medical needs through some other 24        manner.25            (B) The court, in its discretion, may order either 26        or both parents to contribute to the reasonable health   HB1889- 19 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        care needs of the child not covered by insurance, 2        including, but not limited to, unreimbursed medical, 3        dental, orthodontic, or vision expenses and any 4        prescription medication for the child not covered 5        under the child's health insurance.6            (C) If neither parent has access to appropriate 7        private health insurance coverage, the court may 8        order:9                (I) one or both parents to provide health 10            insurance coverage at any time it becomes 11            available at a reasonable cost; or12                (II) the parent or non-parent custodian with 13            primary physical responsibility for the child to 14            apply for public health insurance coverage for the 15            child and require either or both parents to pay a 16            reasonable amount of the cost of health insurance 17            for the child.18            The order may also provide that any time private 19        health insurance coverage is available at a reasonable 20        cost to that party it will be provided instead of cash 21        medical support. As used in this Section, "cash 22        medical support" means an amount ordered to be paid 23        toward the cost of health insurance provided by a 24        public entity or by another person through employment 25        or otherwise or for other medical costs not covered by 26        insurance.   HB1889- 20 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            (D) The amount to be added to the basic child 2        support obligation shall be the actual amount of the 3        total health insurance premium that is attributable to 4        the child who is the subject of the order. If this 5        amount is not available or cannot be verified, the 6        total cost of the health insurance premium shall be 7        divided by the total number of persons covered by the 8        policy. The cost per person derived from this 9        calculation shall be multiplied by the number of 10        children who are the subject of the order and who are 11        covered under the health insurance policy. This amount 12        shall be added to the basic child support obligation 13        and shall be allocated between the parents in 14        proportion to their respective net incomes.15            (E) After the health insurance premium for the 16        child is added to the basic child support obligation 17        and allocated between the parents in proportion to 18        their respective incomes for child support purposes, 19        if the obligor is paying the premium, the amount 20        calculated for the obligee's share of the health 21        insurance premium for the child shall be deducted from 22        the obligor's share of the total child support 23        obligation. If the obligee is paying for private 24        health insurance for the child, the child support 25        obligation shall be increased by the obligor's share 26        of the premium payment. The obligor's and obligee's   HB1889- 21 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        portion of health insurance costs shall appear in the 2        support order.3            (F) Prior to allowing the health insurance 4        adjustment, the parent requesting the adjustment must 5        submit proof that the child has been enrolled in a 6        health insurance plan and must submit proof of the 7        cost of the premium. The court shall require the 8        parent receiving the adjustment to annually submit 9        proof of continued coverage of the child to the other 10        parent, or as designated by the court.11            (G) A reasonable cost for providing health 12        insurance coverage for the child may not exceed 5% of 13        the providing parent's gross income. Parents with a 14        net income below 133% of the most recent United States 15        Department of Health and Human Services Federal 16        Poverty Guidelines or whose child is covered by 17        Medicaid based on that parent's income may not be 18        ordered to contribute toward or provide private 19        coverage, unless private coverage is obtainable 20        without any financial contribution by that parent.21            (H) If dental or vision insurance is included as 22        part of the employer's medical plan, the coverage 23        shall be maintained for the child. If not included in 24        the employer's medical plan, adding the dental or 25        vision insurance for the child is at the discretion of 26        the court.  HB1889- 22 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1            (I) If a parent has been directed to provide 2        health insurance pursuant to this paragraph and that 3        parent's spouse or legally recognized partner provides 4        the insurance for the benefit of the child either 5        directly or through employment, a credit on the child 6        support worksheet shall be given to that parent in the 7        same manner as if the premium were paid by that parent.8        (4.5) In a proceeding for child support following 9    dissolution of the marriage or civil union by a court that 10    lacked personal jurisdiction over the absent spouse, and 11    in which the court is requiring payment of support for the 12    period before the date an order for current support is 13    entered, there is a rebuttable presumption that the 14    obligor's net income for the prior period was the same as 15    his or her net income at the time the order for current 16    support is entered.17        (5) If the net income cannot be determined because of 18    default or any other reason, the court shall order support 19    in an amount considered reasonable in the particular case. 20    The final order in all cases shall state the support level 21    in dollar amounts. However, if the court finds that the 22    child support amount cannot be expressed exclusively as a 23    dollar amount because all or a portion of the obligor's 24    net income is uncertain as to source, time of payment, or 25    amount, the court may order a percentage amount of support 26    in addition to a specific dollar amount and enter such   HB1889- 23 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    other orders as may be necessary to determine and enforce, 2    on a timely basis, the applicable support ordered.3        (6) If (i) the obligor was properly served with a 4    request for discovery of financial information relating to 5    the obligor's ability to provide child support, (ii) the 6    obligor failed to comply with the request, despite having 7    been ordered to do so by the court, and (iii) the obligor 8    is not present at the hearing to determine support despite 9    having received proper notice, then any relevant financial 10    information concerning the obligor's ability to provide 11    child support that was obtained pursuant to subpoena and 12    proper notice shall be admitted into evidence without the 13    need to establish any further foundation for its 14    admission.15    (a-3) Life insurance to secure support. At the discretion 16of the court, a child support obligation pursuant to this 17Section and Sections 510, 513, and 513.5 of this Act may be 18secured, in whole or in part, by reasonably affordable life 19insurance on the life of one or both parents on such terms as 20the parties agree or as the court orders. The court may require 21such insurance remain in full force and effect until the 22termination of all obligations of support, subject to the 23following:24        (1) Existing life insurance. The court shall be 25    apprised through evidence, stipulation, or otherwise as to 26    the level, ownership, and type of existing life insurance   HB1889- 24 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    death benefit coverage available to one or both parents, 2    the cost of the premiums, cost ratings, and escalations 3    and assignment of the policy, if applicable, and all other 4    relevant circumstances. The court shall make findings 5    relative thereto.6        (2) New life insurance. The court shall be apprised 7    through evidence, stipulation, or otherwise as to the 8    availability of obtaining reasonably affordable new life 9    insurance. To the extent the court determines that the 10    support obligations should be secured, in whole or in 11    part, by new life insurance on the life of one or both 12    parents, the court may order that one or both parents 13    comply with all requirements to obtain such new life 14    insurance through employment, trade union, fraternal 15    organizations, associations, or individual means.16        In determining the level and type of death benefits 17    coverage to be obtained by a parent, the court shall 18    consider access and availability of life insurance to that 19    parent, the cost of the premium, cost ratings, and 20    escalations, if applicable, and all other relevant 21    circumstances.22        (3) Other security. If life insurance is unavailable 23    to a parent, the court, in its discretion, or as agreed to 24    by the parties, may order other equitable and reasonable 25    means to secure a child support obligation. 26    (a-5) In an action to enforce an order for child support   HB1889- 25 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1based on the obligor's failure to make support payments as 2required by the order, notice of proceedings to hold the 3obligor in contempt for that failure may be served on the 4obligor by personal service or by regular mail addressed to 5the last known address of the obligor. The last known address 6of the obligor may be determined from records of the clerk of 7the court, from the Federal Case Registry of Child Support 8Orders, or by any other reasonable means.9    (b) Failure of either parent to comply with an order to pay 10support shall be punishable as in other cases of contempt. In 11addition to other penalties provided by law the court may, 12after finding the parent guilty of contempt, order that the 13parent be:14        (1) placed on probation with such conditions of 15    probation as the court deems advisable;16        (2) sentenced to periodic imprisonment for a period 17    not to exceed 6 months; provided, however, that the court 18    may permit the parent to be released for periods of time 19    during the day or night to:20            (A) work; or21            (B) conduct a business or other self-employed 22        occupation.23    The court may further order any part or all of the earnings 24of a parent during a sentence of periodic imprisonment paid to 25the Clerk of the Circuit Court or to the parent having physical 26possession of the child or to the non-parent custodian having   HB1889- 26 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1custody of the child of the sentenced parent for the support of 2the child until further order of the court.3    If a parent who is found guilty of contempt for failure to 4comply with an order to pay support is a person who conducts a 5business or who is self-employed, the court in addition to 6other penalties provided by law may order that the parent do 7one or more of the following: (i) provide to the court monthly 8financial statements showing income and expenses from the 9business or the self-employment; (ii) seek employment and 10report periodically to the court with a diary, listing, or 11other memorandum of his or her employment search efforts; or 12(iii) report to the Department of Employment Security for job 13search services to find employment that will be subject to 14withholding for child support. 15    If there is a unity of interest and ownership sufficient 16to render no financial separation between an obligor and 17another person or persons or business entity, the court may 18pierce the ownership veil of the person, persons, or business 19entity to discover assets of the obligor held in the name of 20that person, those persons, or that business entity. The 21following circumstances are sufficient to authorize a court to 22order discovery of the assets of a person, persons, or 23business entity and to compel the application of any 24discovered assets toward payment on the judgment for support:25        (1) the obligor and the person, persons, or business 26    entity maintain records together.  HB1889- 27 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1        (2) the obligor and the person, persons, or business 2    entity fail to maintain an arm's length relationship 3    between themselves with regard to any assets.4        (3) the obligor transfers assets to the person, 5    persons, or business entity with the intent to perpetrate 6    a fraud on the obligee.7    With respect to assets which are real property, no order 8entered under this paragraph shall affect the rights of bona 9fide purchasers, mortgagees, judgment creditors, or other lien 10holders who acquire their interests in the property prior to 11the time a notice of lis pendens pursuant to the Code of Civil 12Procedure or a copy of the order is placed of record in the 13office of the recorder of deeds for the county in which the 14real property is located.15    The court may also order in cases where the parent is 90 16days or more delinquent in payment of support or has been 17adjudicated in arrears in an amount equal to 90 days 18obligation or more, that the parent's Illinois driving 19privileges be suspended until the court determines that the 20parent is in compliance with the order of support. The court 21may also order that the parent be issued a family financial 22responsibility driving permit that would allow limited driving 23privileges for employment and medical purposes in accordance 24with Section 7-702.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code. The Clerk 25of the Circuit Court shall certify the order suspending the 26driving privileges of the parent or granting the issuance of a   HB1889- 28 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1family financial responsibility driving permit to the 2Secretary of State on forms prescribed by the Secretary of 3State. Upon receipt of the authenticated documents, the 4Secretary of State shall suspend the parent's driving 5privileges until further order of the court and shall, if 6ordered by the court, subject to the provisions of Section 77-702.1 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, issue a family financial 8responsibility driving permit to the parent.9    In addition to the penalties or punishment that may be 10imposed under this Section, any person whose conduct 11constitutes a violation of Section 15 of the Non-Support 12Punishment Act may be prosecuted under that Act, and a person 13convicted under that Act may be sentenced in accordance with 14that Act. The sentence may include but need not be limited to a 15requirement that the person perform community service under 16Section 50 of that Act or participate in a work alternative 17program under Section 50 of that Act. A person may not be 18required to participate in a work alternative program under 19Section 50 of that Act if the person is currently 20participating in a work program pursuant to Section 505.1 of 21this Act.22    A support obligation, or any portion of a support 23obligation, which becomes due and remains unpaid as of the end 24of each month, excluding the child support that was due for 25that month to the extent that it was not paid in that month, 26shall accrue simple interest as set forth in Section 12-109 of   HB1889- 29 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1the Code of Civil Procedure. An order for support entered or 2modified on or after January 1, 2006 shall contain a statement 3that a support obligation required under the order, or any 4portion of a support obligation required under the order, that 5becomes due and remains unpaid as of the end of each month, 6excluding the child support that was due for that month to the 7extent that it was not paid in that month, shall accrue simple 8interest as set forth in Section 12-109 of the Code of Civil 9Procedure. Failure to include the statement in the order for 10support does not affect the validity of the order or the 11accrual of interest as provided in this Section.12    (c) A one-time charge of 20% is imposable upon the amount 13of past-due child support owed on July 1, 1988 which has 14accrued under a support order entered by the court. The charge 15shall be imposed in accordance with the provisions of Section 1610-21 of the Illinois Public Aid Code and shall be enforced by 17the court upon petition.18    (d) Any new or existing support order entered by the court 19under this Section shall be deemed to be a series of judgments 20against the person obligated to pay support thereunder, each 21such judgment to be in the amount of each payment or 22installment of support and each such judgment to be deemed 23entered as of the date the corresponding payment or 24installment becomes due under the terms of the support order. 25Each such judgment shall have the full force, effect and 26attributes of any other judgment of this State, including the   HB1889- 30 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1ability to be enforced. Notwithstanding any other State or 2local law to the contrary, a lien arises by operation of law 3against the real and personal property of the obligor for each 4installment of overdue support owed by the obligor.5    (e) When child support is to be paid through the Clerk of 6the Court in a county of 500,000 inhabitants or less, the order 7shall direct the obligor to pay to the Clerk, in addition to 8the child support payments, all fees imposed by the county 9board under paragraph (2) of subsection (j-5) of Section 27.1b 10of the Clerks of Courts Act. When child support is to be paid 11through the clerk of the court in a county of more than 500,000 12but less than 3,000,000 inhabitants, the order shall direct 13the obligor to pay to the clerk, in addition to the child 14support payments, all fees imposed by the county board under 15paragraph (4) of subsection (bb) of Section 27.2 of the Clerks 16of Courts Act. Unless paid pursuant to an Income Withholding 17Order/Notice for Support, the payment of the fee shall be by 18payment acceptable to the clerk and shall be made to the order 19of the Clerk.20    (f) All orders for support, when entered or modified, 21shall include a provision requiring the obligor to notify the 22court and, in cases in which a party is receiving child and 23spouse services under Article X of the Illinois Public Aid 24Code, the Department of Healthcare and Family Services, within 257 days, (i) of the name and address of any new employer of the 26obligor, (ii) whether the obligor has access to health   HB1889- 31 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1insurance coverage through the employer or other group 2coverage and, if so, the policy name and number and the names 3of persons covered under the policy, except only the initials 4of any covered minors shall be included, and (iii) of any new 5residential or mailing address or telephone number of the 6obligor. In any subsequent action to enforce a support order, 7upon a sufficient showing that a diligent effort has been made 8to ascertain the location of the obligor, service of process 9or provision of notice necessary in the case may be made at the 10last known address of the obligor in any manner expressly 11provided by the Code of Civil Procedure or this Act, which 12service shall be sufficient for purposes of due process.13    (g) An order for support shall include a date on which the 14current support obligation terminates. The termination date 15shall be no earlier than the date on which the child covered by 16the order will attain the age of 18. However, if the child will 17not graduate from high school until after attaining the age of 1818, then the termination date shall be no earlier than the 19earlier of the date on which the child's high school 20graduation will occur or the date on which the child will 21attain the age of 19. The order for support shall state that 22the termination date does not apply to any arrearage that may 23remain unpaid on that date. Nothing in this subsection shall 24be construed to prevent the court from modifying the order or 25terminating the order in the event the child is otherwise 26emancipated.  HB1889- 32 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1    (g-5) If there is an unpaid arrearage or delinquency (as 2those terms are defined in the Income Withholding for Support 3Act) equal to at least one month's support obligation on the 4termination date stated in the order for support or, if there 5is no termination date stated in the order, on the date the 6child attains the age of majority or is otherwise emancipated, 7the periodic amount required to be paid for current support of 8that child immediately prior to that date shall automatically 9continue to be an obligation, not as current support but as 10periodic payment toward satisfaction of the unpaid arrearage 11or delinquency. That periodic payment shall be in addition to 12any periodic payment previously required for satisfaction of 13the arrearage or delinquency. The total periodic amount to be 14paid toward satisfaction of the arrearage or delinquency may 15be enforced and collected by any method provided by law for 16enforcement and collection of child support, including but not 17limited to income withholding under the Income Withholding for 18Support Act. Each order for support entered or modified on or 19after January 1, 2005 (the effective date of Public Act 2093-1061) must contain a statement notifying the parties of the 21requirements of this subsection. Failure to include the 22statement in the order for support does not affect the 23validity of the order or the operation of the provisions of 24this subsection with regard to the order. This subsection 25shall not be construed to prevent or affect the establishment 26or modification of an order for support of a minor child or the   HB1889- 33 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1establishment or modification of an order for support of a 2non-minor child or educational expenses under Section 513 of 3this Act. 4    (h) An order entered under this Section shall include a 5provision requiring either parent to report to the other 6parent and to the Clerk of Court within 10 days each time 7either parent obtains new employment, and each time either 8parent's employment is terminated for any reason. The report 9shall be in writing and shall, in the case of new employment, 10include the name and address of the new employer. Failure to 11report new employment or the termination of current 12employment, if coupled with nonpayment of support for a period 13in excess of 60 days, is indirect criminal contempt. For 14either parent arrested for failure to report new employment 15bond shall be set in the amount of the child support that 16should have been paid during the period of unreported 17employment. An order entered under this Section shall also 18include a provision requiring either obligor and obligee to 19advise the other of a change in residence within 5 days of the 20change except when the court finds that the physical, mental, 21or emotional health of a party or that of a child, or both, 22would be seriously endangered by disclosure of the party's 23address.24    (i) The court does not lose the powers of contempt, 25driver's license suspension, or other child support 26enforcement mechanisms, including, but not limited to,   HB1889- 34 -LRB104 08172 JRC 18221 b1criminal prosecution as set forth in this Act, upon the 2emancipation of the minor child.3(Source: P.A. 102-823, eff. 5-13-22; 103-967, eff. 1-1-25.)
