However, if the 20supervising dentist, after consultation with the public health 21hygienist, determines that time is needed to complete an 22approved treatment plan on a patient eligible under this 23Section, then the dentist may instruct the hygienist to 24complete the remaining services prior to an oral examination 25by the dentist. Such instruction by the dentist to the 26hygienist shall be noted in the patient's records.
