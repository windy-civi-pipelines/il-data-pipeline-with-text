Surviving spouse annuities - amount. 4    (a) The amount of surviving spouse annuity shall be: 5    1. Upon the death of an employee annuitant or such person 6entitled, upon application, to a retirement annuity at date of 7death, (i) an amount equal to 50% for a Tier 1 regular employee 8or 66 2/3% for a Tier 2 regular employee of the retirement 9annuity which was or would have been payable exclusive of the 10amount so payable which was provided from additional credits, 11and disregarding any election made under paragraph (b) of 12Section 7-142, plus (ii) an annuity which could be provided at 13the then attained age of the surviving spouse and under 14actuarial tables then in effect, from the excess of the 15additional credits, (excluding any such credits used to create 16a reversionary annuity) used to provide the annuity granted 17pursuant to paragraph (a) (2) of Section 7-142 of this article 18over the total annuity payments made pursuant thereto. 19    2.

Each surviving spouse annuity that begins after 12January 1, 1988 shall be increased on the January 1 next 13occurring after the annuity begins, by an amount equal to (i) 143% of the original amount thereof if the deceased employee was 15receiving a retirement annuity at the time of his death; 16otherwise (ii) 0.25% of the original amount thereof for each 17complete month which has elapsed since the date the annuity 18began. 19    On each January 1 after the date of the initial increase 20under this subsection, each surviving spouse annuity shall be 21increased by 3% of the originally granted amount of the 22annuity. 23    (c) If the participating employee was a Tier 2 regular 24employee, each surviving spouse annuity shall be increased (1) 25on each January 1 occurring on or after the commencement of the 26annuity if the deceased member died while receiving a   HB1307- 21 -LRB104 07406 RPS 17447 b1retirement annuity or (2) in other cases, on each January 1 2occurring after the first anniversary of the commencement of 3the annuity. Such annual increase shall be calculated at 3% or 4one-half the annual unadjusted percentage increase (but not 5less than zero) in the consumer price index-u for the 12 months 6ending with the September preceding each November 1, whichever 7is less, of the originally granted surviving spouse annuity. 8If the annual unadjusted percentage change in the consumer 9price index-u for the 12 months ending with the September 10preceding each November 1 is zero or there is a decrease, then 11the annuity shall not be increased. 12    (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, 13the pension of the surviving spouse of a firefighter who 14qualifies as a sheriff's law enforcement employee under 15paragraph (6) of subsection (a) of Section 7-109.3 and dies on 16or after January 1, 1988 as a result of sickness, accident, or 17injury incurred in or resulting from the performance of an act 18of duty or from the cumulative effects of acts of duty shall 19not be less than 100% of the salary attached to the rank held 20by the deceased firefighter on the last day of service. 21(Source: P.A. 102-210, eff. 1-1-22.) 22    Section 90.
