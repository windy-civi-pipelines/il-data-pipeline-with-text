No authorization is necessary from the 20licensee or applicant ordered to undergo an examination for 21the examining physician or any member of the multidisciplinary 22team to provide information, reports, records, or other 23documents or to provide any testimony regarding the 24examination and evaluation.25    The individual to be examined may have, at his or her own 26expense, another physician of his or her choice present during   SB0271- 33 -LRB104 03116 AAS 13137 b1all aspects of this examination. However, that physician shall 2be present only to observe and may not interfere in any way 3with the examination.4     Failure of an individual to submit to a mental or physical 5examination, when ordered, shall result in an automatic 6suspension of his or her license until the individual submits 7to the examination.8    If the Department finds an individual unable to practice 9because of the reasons set forth in this Section, the 10Department may require that individual to submit to care, 11counseling, or treatment by physicians approved or designated 12by the Department, as a condition, term, or restriction for 13continued, reinstated, or renewed licensure to practice; or, 14in lieu of care, counseling, or treatment, the Department may 15file a complaint to immediately suspend, revoke, or otherwise 16discipline the license of the individual. An individual whose 17license was granted, continued, reinstated, renewed, 18disciplined, or supervised subject to such terms, conditions, 19or restrictions, and who fails to comply with such terms, 20conditions, or restrictions, shall be referred to the 21Secretary for a determination as to whether the individual 22shall have his or her license suspended immediately, pending a 23hearing by the Department.24    In instances in which the Secretary immediately suspends a 25person's license under this Section, a hearing on that 26person's license must be convened by the Department within 30   SB0271- 34 -LRB104 03116 AAS 13137 b1days after the suspension and completed without appreciable 2delay.

Failure to so notify the 10Attorney General constitutes an absolute waiver of the right 11to a defense and indemnification.12    The Attorney General shall determine, within 7 days after 13receiving such notice, whether he or she will undertake to 14represent the member. 15    (g) The Department may adopt rules to implement the 16changes made by this amendatory Act of the 102nd General 17Assembly.18(Source: P.A. 101-363, eff. 8-9-19; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 19102-1117, eff. 1-13-23.) 20    Section 10.
