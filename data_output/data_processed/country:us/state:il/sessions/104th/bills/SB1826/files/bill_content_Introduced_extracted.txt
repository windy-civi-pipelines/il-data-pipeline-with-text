In all other cases, the Public Access Counselor 3shall forward a copy of the request for review to the public 4body within 7 business days after receipt and shall specify 5the records or other documents that the public body shall 6furnish to facilitate the review. Within 7 business days after 7receipt of the request for review, the public body shall 8provide copies of records requested and shall otherwise fully 9cooperate with the Public Access Counselor.

The opinion shall be binding upon both the requester 20and the public body, subject to administrative review under 21Section 11.5.22    In responding to any request under this Section 9.5, the 23Attorney General may exercise his or her discretion and choose 24to resolve a request for review by mediation or by a means 25other than the issuance of a binding opinion. The decision not 26to issue a binding opinion shall not be reviewable.  SB1826- 43 -LRB104 02962 LNS 12978 b1    Upon receipt of a binding opinion concluding that a 2violation of this Act has occurred, the public body shall 3either take necessary action immediately to comply with the 4directive of the opinion or shall initiate administrative 5review under Section 11.5. If the opinion concludes that no 6violation of the Act has occurred, the requester may initiate 7administrative review under Section 11.5.8    A public body that discloses records in accordance with an 9opinion of the Attorney General is immune from all liabilities 10by reason thereof and shall not be liable for penalties under 11this Act. 12    (g) If the requester files suit under Section 11 with 13respect to the same denial that is the subject of a pending 14request for review, the requester shall notify the Public 15Access Counselor, and the Public Access Counselor shall take 16no further action with respect to the request for review and 17shall so notify the public body.18    (h) The Attorney General may also issue advisory opinions 19to public bodies regarding compliance with this Act. A review 20may be initiated upon receipt of a written request from the 21head of the public body or its attorney, which shall contain 22sufficient accurate facts from which a determination can be 23made. The Public Access Counselor may request additional 24information from the public body in order to assist in the 25review. A public body that relies in good faith on an advisory 26opinion of the Attorney General in responding to a request is   SB1826- 44 -LRB104 02962 LNS 12978 b1not liable for penalties under this Act, so long as the facts 2upon which the opinion is based have been fully and fairly 3disclosed to the Public Access Counselor. 4(Source: P.A. 103-69, eff. 1-1-24.) 5    Section 95.
