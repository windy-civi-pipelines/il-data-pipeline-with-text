Carol Ammons SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 415 ILCS 5/59415 ILCS 5/59.5    Amends the Environmental Protection Act. Provides that no person shall conduct a carbon sequestration activity within a sequestration facility that overlies, underlies, or passes through a sole-source aquifer. Defines "sole-source aquifer". Effective immediately.LRB104 08160 BDA 18208 b  A BILL FOR HB3614LRB104 08160 BDA 18208 b1    AN ACT concerning safety. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Environmental Protection Act is amended by 5changing Sections 59 and 59.5 as follows: 6    (415 ILCS 5/59)7    Sec. 59. Definitions. As used in this Title:8    "Carbon dioxide capture project" mean a project or 9facility that:10        (1) uses equipment to capture a significant quantity 11    of carbon dioxide directly from the ambient air or uses a 12    process to separate carbon dioxide from industrial or 13    energy-related sources, other than oil or gas production 14    from a well; and15        (2) produces a concentrated fluid of carbon dioxide. 16    "Carbon dioxide stream" means carbon dioxide, any 17incidental associated substances derived from the source 18materials and process of producing or capturing carbon 19dioxide, and any substance added to the stream to enable or 20improve the injection process or the detection of a leak or 21rupture.22    "Carbon sequestration activity" means the injection of one 23or more carbon dioxide streams into underground geologic   HB3614- 2 -LRB104 08160 BDA 18208 b1formations under at least one Class VI well permit for 2long-term sequestration.3    "Criteria pollutants" means the 6 pollutants for which the 4United States Environmental Protection Agency has set National 5Ambient Air Quality Standards under Section 109 of the Clean 6Air Act, together with recognized precursors to those 7pollutants. 8    "Project labor agreement" means a prehire collective 9bargaining agreement that covers all terms and conditions of 10employment on a specific construction project and must include 11the following:12        (1) provisions establishing the minimum hourly wage 13    for each class of labor organization employee;14        (2) provisions establishing the benefits and other 15    compensation for each class of labor organization 16    employee;17        (3) provisions establishing that no strike or disputes 18    will be engaged in by the labor organization employees;19        (4) provisions establishing that no lockout or 20    disputes will be engaged in by the general contractor 21    building the project; and22        (5) provisions for minorities and women, as defined 23    under the Business Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and 24    Persons with Disabilities Act, setting forth goals for 25    apprenticeship hours to be performed by minorities and 26    women and setting forth goals for total hours to be   HB3614- 3 -LRB104 08160 BDA 18208 b1    performed by underrepresented minorities and women.2"Project labor agreement" includes other terms and conditions 3a labor organization or general contractor building the 4project deems necessary. 5    "Sequestration facility" means the carbon dioxide 6sequestration reservoir, underground equipment, including, but 7not limited to, well penetrations, and surface facilities and 8equipment used or proposed to be used in a carbon 9sequestration activity. "Sequestration facility" includes each 10injection well and equipment used to connect surface 11activities to the carbon dioxide sequestration reservoir and 12underground equipment. "Sequestration facility" does not 13include pipelines used to transport carbon dioxide to a 14sequestration facility. 15    "Sole-source aquifer" means an aquifer designated as a 16sole-source or principal aquifer by the United States 17Environmental Protection Agency under the federal Safe 18Drinking Water Act, together with the aquifer's upstream 19areas, which, for purposes of this definition, consist of the 20project review area of the aquifer, as identified by the 21United States Environmental Protection Agency. 22(Source: P.A. 103-651, eff. 7-18-24.) 23    (415 ILCS 5/59.5)24    Sec. 59.5. Prohibitions. 25    (a) No person shall conduct a carbon sequestration   HB3614- 4 -LRB104 08160 BDA 18208 b1activity without a permit issued by the Agency under Section 259.6. This prohibition does not apply to any carbon 3sequestration activity in existence and permitted by the 4United States Environmental Protection Agency on or before the 5effective date of this amendatory Act of the 103rd General 6Assembly or to any Class VI well for which (1) a Class VI well 7permit has been filed with the United States Environmental 8Protection Agency and a completeness determination had been 9received prior to January 1, 2023, and (2) the sequestration 10activity will occur on a contiguous property with common 11ownership where the carbon dioxide is generated, captured, and 12injected.13    (b) No person shall conduct a carbon sequestration 14activity in violation of this Act.15    (c) No person shall conduct a carbon sequestration 16activity in violation of any applicable rules adopted by the 17Pollution Control Board.18    (d) No person shall conduct a carbon sequestration 19activity in violation of a permit issued by the Agency under 20this Act.21    (e) No person shall fail to submit reports required by 22this Act or required by a permit issued by the Agency under 23this Act.24    (f) No person shall conduct a carbon sequestration 25activity without obtaining an order for integration of pore 26space from the Department of Natural Resources, if applicable.  HB3614- 5 -LRB104 08160 BDA 18208 b1    (g) No person shall conduct a carbon sequestration 2activity within a sequestration facility that overlies, 3underlies, or passes through a sole-source aquifer. 4(Source: P.A. 103-651, eff. 7-18-24.) 5    Section 99.
