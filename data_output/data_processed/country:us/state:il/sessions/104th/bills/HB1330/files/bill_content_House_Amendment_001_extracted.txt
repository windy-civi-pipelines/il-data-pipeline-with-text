The Illinois Act on the Aging is amended by 5changing Section 4.02 as follows: 6    (20 ILCS 105/4.02)7    Sec. 4.02. Community Care Program. The Department shall 8establish a program of services to prevent unnecessary 9institutionalization of persons age 60 and older in need of 10long term care or who are established as persons who suffer 11from Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder under the 12Alzheimer's Disease Assistance Act, thereby enabling them to 13remain in their own homes or in other living arrangements. 14Such preventive services, which may be coordinated with other 15programs for the aged, may include, but are not limited to, any 16or all of the following:  10400HB1330ham001- 2 -LRB104 06107 KTG 22728 a1        (a) (blank);2        (b) (blank);3        (c) home care aide services;4        (d) personal assistant services;5        (e) adult day services;6        (f) home-delivered meals;7        (g) education in self-care;8        (h) personal care services;9        (i) adult day health services;10        (j) habilitation services;11        (k) respite care;12        (k-5) community reintegration services; 13        (k-6) flexible senior services;14        (k-7) medication management;15        (k-8) emergency home response; 16        (l) other nonmedical social services that may enable 17    the person to become self-supporting; or18        (m) (blank).19    The Department shall establish eligibility standards for 20such services. In determining the amount and nature of 21services for which a person may qualify, consideration shall 22not be given to the value of cash, property, or other assets 23held in the name of the person's spouse pursuant to a written 24agreement dividing marital property into equal but separate 25shares or pursuant to a transfer of the person's interest in a 26home to his spouse, provided that the spouse's share of the   10400HB1330ham001- 3 -LRB104 06107 KTG 22728 a1marital property is not made available to the person seeking 2such services.3    The Department shall require as a condition of eligibility 4that all new financially eligible applicants apply for and 5enroll in medical assistance under Article V of the Illinois 6Public Aid Code in accordance with rules promulgated by the 7Department. 8    The Department shall, in conjunction with the Department 9of Public Aid (now Department of Healthcare and Family 10Services), seek appropriate amendments under Sections 1915 and 111924 of the Social Security Act. The purpose of the amendments 12shall be to extend eligibility for home and community based 13services under Sections 1915 and 1924 of the Social Security 14Act to persons who transfer to or for the benefit of a spouse 15those amounts of income and resources allowed under Section 161924 of the Social Security Act. Subject to the approval of 17such amendments, the Department shall extend the provisions of 18Section 5-4 of the Illinois Public Aid Code to persons who, but 19for the provision of home or community-based services, would 20require the level of care provided in an institution, as is 21provided for in federal law. Those persons no longer found to 22be eligible for receiving noninstitutional services due to 23changes in the eligibility criteria shall be given 45 days 24notice prior to actual termination. Those persons receiving 25notice of termination may contact the Department and request 26the determination be appealed at any time during the 45 day   10400HB1330ham001- 4 -LRB104 06107 KTG 22728 a1notice period. The target population identified for the 2purposes of this Section are persons age 60 and older with an 3identified service need. Priority shall be given to those who 4are at imminent risk of institutionalization. The services 5shall be provided to eligible persons age 60 and older to the 6extent that the cost of the services together with the other 7personal maintenance expenses of the persons are reasonably 8related to the standards established for care in a group 9facility appropriate to the person's condition. These 10noninstitutional non-institutional services, pilot projects, 11or experimental facilities may be provided as part of or in 12addition to those authorized by federal law or those funded 13and administered by the Department of Human Services. The 14Departments of Human Services, Healthcare and Family Services, 15Public Health, Veterans' Affairs, and Commerce and Economic 16Opportunity and other appropriate agencies of State, federal, 17and local governments shall cooperate with the Department on 18Aging in the establishment and development of the 19noninstitutional non-institutional services.

Amend House Bill 1330 by replacing 3everything after the enacting clause with the following: 4    "Section 5. The Illinois Act on the Aging is amended by 5changing Section 4.02 as follows: 6    (20 ILCS 105/4.02)7    Sec. 4.02. Community Care Program. The Department shall 8establish a program of services to prevent unnecessary 9institutionalization of persons age 60 and older in need of 10long term care or who are established as persons who suffer 11from Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder under the 12Alzheimer's Disease Assistance Act, thereby enabling them to 13remain in their own homes or in other living arrangements. 14Such preventive services, which may be coordinated with other 15programs for the aged, may include, but are not limited to, any 16or all of the following:  10400HB1330ham001- 2 -LRB104 06107 KTG 22728 a1        (a) (blank);2        (b) (blank);3        (c) home care aide services;4        (d) personal assistant services;5        (e) adult day services;6        (f) home-delivered meals;7        (g) education in self-care;8        (h) personal care services;9        (i) adult day health services;10        (j) habilitation services;11        (k) respite care;12        (k-5) community reintegration services; 13        (k-6) flexible senior services;14        (k-7) medication management;15        (k-8) emergency home response; 16        (l) other nonmedical social services that may enable 17    the person to become self-supporting; or18        (m) (blank).19    The Department shall establish eligibility standards for 20such services. In determining the amount and nature of 21services for which a person may qualify, consideration shall 22not be given to the value of cash, property, or other assets 23held in the name of the person's spouse pursuant to a written 24agreement dividing marital property into equal but separate 25shares or pursuant to a transfer of the person's interest in a 26home to his spouse, provided that the spouse's share of the   10400HB1330ham001- 3 -LRB104 06107 KTG 22728 a1marital property is not made available to the person seeking 2such services.3    The Department shall require as a condition of eligibility 4that all new financially eligible applicants apply for and 5enroll in medical assistance under Article V of the Illinois 6Public Aid Code in accordance with rules promulgated by the 7Department. 8    The Department shall, in conjunction with the Department 9of Public Aid (now Department of Healthcare and Family 10Services), seek appropriate amendments under Sections 1915 and 111924 of the Social Security Act. The purpose of the amendments 12shall be to extend eligibility for home and community based 13services under Sections 1915 and 1924 of the Social Security 14Act to persons who transfer to or for the benefit of a spouse 15those amounts of income and resources allowed under Section 161924 of the Social Security Act. Subject to the approval of 17such amendments, the Department shall extend the provisions of 18Section 5-4 of the Illinois Public Aid Code to persons who, but 19for the provision of home or community-based services, would 20require the level of care provided in an institution, as is 21provided for in federal law. Those persons no longer found to 22be eligible for receiving noninstitutional services due to 23changes in the eligibility criteria shall be given 45 days 24notice prior to actual termination. Those persons receiving 25notice of termination may contact the Department and request 26the determination be appealed at any time during the 45 day   10400HB1330ham001- 4 -LRB104 06107 KTG 22728 a1notice period. The target population identified for the 2purposes of this Section are persons age 60 and older with an 3identified service need. Priority shall be given to those who 4are at imminent risk of institutionalization. The services 5shall be provided to eligible persons age 60 and older to the 6extent that the cost of the services together with the other 7personal maintenance expenses of the persons are reasonably 8related to the standards established for care in a group 9facility appropriate to the person's condition. These 10noninstitutional non-institutional services, pilot projects, 11or experimental facilities may be provided as part of or in 12addition to those authorized by federal law or those funded 13and administered by the Department of Human Services. The 14Departments of Human Services, Healthcare and Family Services, 15Public Health, Veterans' Affairs, and Commerce and Economic 16Opportunity and other appropriate agencies of State, federal, 17and local governments shall cooperate with the Department on 18Aging in the establishment and development of the 19noninstitutional non-institutional services.

This paragraph shall not bar recovery from 22the estate of a spouse, under Sections 1915 and 1924 of the 23Social Security Act and Section 5-4 of the Illinois Public Aid 24Code, who precedes a person receiving services under this 25Section in death.
