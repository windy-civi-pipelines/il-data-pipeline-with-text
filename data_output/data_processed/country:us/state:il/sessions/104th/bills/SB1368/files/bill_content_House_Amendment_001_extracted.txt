The 11Jurisdictional Veterans Assistance Commission shall be known 12as the Veterans Assistance Commission of that judicial 13circuit.14    (2) The superintendent of a Jurisdictional Veterans 15Assistance Commission formed in accordance with paragraph (1) 16shall be selected from among all honorably discharged veterans 17of all participating counties within that judicial circuit's 18boundaries and shall maintain a centrally located office 19within that judicial circuit. However, for a Jurisdictional 20Veterans Assistance Commission formed within a large judicial 21circuit, the superintendent is not precluded from having 22multiple offices that shall be owned and maintained by the 23Jurisdictional Veterans Assistance Commission.24    (3) Delegates and alternates shall be selected by the 25veterans service organizations of that judicial circuit in the 26same manner as prescribed in paragraph (1) of subsection (a).  10400SB1368ham001- 17 -LRB104 08902 KTG 26064 a1    (4) Any existing Veterans Assistance Commission that is 2part of a Judicial Circuit that is comprised of multiple 3counties, as of January 1, 2025, may merge into a Veterans 4Assistance Commission of that Judicial Circuit with its 5neighboring counties. Those existing Veterans Assistance 6Commissions that choose not to merge may continue to exist 7independently while the other counties combine to form a new 8Jurisdictional Veterans Assistance Commission of that judicial 9circuit.10    (5) Nothing in this amendatory Act of the 104th General 11Assembly shall be interpreted to restrict any Jurisdictional 12Veterans Assistance Commissions from providing services to 13veterans and their families who reside outside of those 14participating counties.15(Source: P.A. 102-484, eff. 8-20-21; 102-732, eff. 1-1-23; 16102-1132, eff. 2-10-23.)".

To qualify for State funds to supplement local funds for 12public aid purposes, a local governmental unit shall, except 13as hereinafter provided, levy within the time that such levy 14is authorized to be made a tax of an amount which, when added 15to the unobligated balance available for such purposes at the 16close of the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which 17the tax is levied will equal .10% of the last known total 18equalized value of all taxable property in the governmental 19unit.20    In a county of less than 3 million population in which 21there is created a County Veterans Assistance Commission, the 22county shall levy for assistance to military veterans and 23their families, within the time that such levy is authorized 24to be made, a tax of an amount which, when added to the   10400SB1368ham001- 5 -LRB104 08902 KTG 26064 a1unobligated balance available for such purpose at the close of 2the preceding fiscal year will equal .02% of the last known 3assessed value of the taxable property in the county, or which 4will equal .03% of such assessed value if such higher amount is 5authorized by the electors of the county, as provided in 6Section 5-2006 of the Counties Code.7    In a county that has a population of less than 3,000,000 8and that is a participant in a Jurisdictional Veterans 9Assistance Commission, the county shall levy for assistance to 10military veterans and their families, within the time that 11such levy is authorized to be made, a tax of an amount which, 12when added to the unobligated balance available for such 13purpose at the close of the preceding fiscal year, equals .02% 14of the last known assessed value of the taxable property in the 15county.

The Commission shall be composed of delegates and 9alternates from a majority of such veteran service 10organizations selected annually as determined by each veteran 11service organization. When so organized a Commission shall be 12clothed with all the powers and may be charged with all the 13duties theretofore devolving upon the different veteran 14service organizations within the county as provided in Section 152.16        (1) Every January 1, all Veterans Assistance 17    Commissions shall publish a notice to each veteran service 18    organization within their respective county calling on 19    them to select delegates and alternates for that county's 20    Veterans Assistance Commission by the methods provided in 21    this subsection.

However, for a Jurisdictional 20Veterans Assistance Commission formed within a large judicial 21circuit, the superintendent is not precluded from having 22multiple offices that shall be owned and maintained by the 23Jurisdictional Veterans Assistance Commission.24    (3) Delegates and alternates shall be selected by the 25veterans service organizations of that judicial circuit in the 26same manner as prescribed in paragraph (1) of subsection (a).  10400SB1368ham001- 17 -LRB104 08902 KTG 26064 a1    (4) Any existing Veterans Assistance Commission that is 2part of a Judicial Circuit that is comprised of multiple 3counties, as of January 1, 2025, may merge into a Veterans 4Assistance Commission of that Judicial Circuit with its 5neighboring counties.
