The prosecuting 21    attorney, a victim, or the victim's retained attorney may 22    assert the victim's rights. The defendant in the criminal 23    case has no standing to assert a right of the victim in any 24    court proceeding, including on appeal.25        (4) Assertion of and enforcement of rights.26            (A) The prosecuting attorney shall assert a   HB3424- 9 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        victim's right or request enforcement of a right by 2        filing a motion or by orally asserting the right or 3        requesting enforcement in open court in the criminal 4        case outside the presence of the jury. The prosecuting 5        attorney shall consult with the victim and the 6        victim's attorney regarding the assertion or 7        enforcement of a right. If the prosecuting attorney 8        decides not to assert or enforce a victim's right, the 9        prosecuting attorney shall notify the victim or the 10        victim's attorney in sufficient time to allow the 11        victim or the victim's attorney to assert the right or 12        to seek enforcement of a right.13            (B) If the prosecuting attorney elects not to 14        assert a victim's right or to seek enforcement of a 15        right, the victim or the victim's attorney may assert 16        the victim's right or request enforcement of a right 17        by filing a motion or by orally asserting the right or 18        requesting enforcement in open court in the criminal 19        case outside the presence of the jury.20            (C) If the prosecuting attorney asserts a victim's 21        right or seeks enforcement of a right, unless the 22        prosecuting attorney objects or the trial court does 23        not allow it, the victim or the victim's attorney may 24        be heard regarding the prosecuting attorney's motion 25        or may file a simultaneous motion to assert or request 26        enforcement of the victim's right. If the victim or   HB3424- 10 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        the victim's attorney was not allowed to be heard at 2        the hearing regarding the prosecuting attorney's 3        motion, and the court denies the prosecuting 4        attorney's assertion of the right or denies the 5        request for enforcement of a right, the victim or 6        victim's attorney may file a motion to assert the 7        victim's right or to request enforcement of the right 8        within 10 days of the court's ruling. The motion need 9        not demonstrate the grounds for a motion for 10        reconsideration. The court shall rule on the merits of 11        the motion.12            (D) The court shall take up and decide any motion 13        or request asserting or seeking enforcement of a 14        victim's right without delay, unless a specific time 15        period is specified by law or court rule. The reasons 16        for any decision denying the motion or request shall 17        be clearly stated on the record.18            (E) No later than January 1, 2023, the Office of 19        the Attorney General shall: 20                (i) designate an administrative authority 21            within the Office of the Attorney General to 22            receive and investigate complaints relating to the 23            provision or violation of the rights of a crime 24            victim as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 25            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act;26                (ii) create and administer a course of   HB3424- 11 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1            training for employees and offices of the State of 2            Illinois that fail to comply with provisions of 3            Illinois law pertaining to the treatment of crime 4            victims as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 5            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act as 6            required by the court under Section 5 of this Act; 7            and8                (iii) have the authority to make 9            recommendations to employees and offices of the 10            State of Illinois to respond more effectively to 11            the needs of crime victims, including regarding 12            the violation of the rights of a crime victim.13            (F) Crime victims' rights may also be asserted by 14        filing a complaint for mandamus, injunctive, or 15        declaratory relief in the jurisdiction in which the 16        victim's right is being violated or where the crime is 17        being prosecuted. For complaints or motions filed by 18        or on behalf of the victim, the clerk of court shall 19        waive filing fees that would otherwise be owed by the 20        victim for any court filing with the purpose of 21        enforcing crime victims' rights. If the court denies 22        the relief sought by the victim, the reasons for the 23        denial shall be clearly stated on the record in the 24        transcript of the proceedings, in a written opinion, 25        or in the docket entry, and the victim may appeal the 26        circuit court's decision to the appellate court. The   HB3424- 12 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        court shall issue prompt rulings regarding victims' 2        rights. Proceedings seeking to enforce victims' rights 3        shall not be stayed or subject to unreasonable delay 4        via continuances. 5        (5) Violation of rights and remedies. 6            (A) If the court determines that a victim's right 7        has been violated, the court shall determine the 8        appropriate remedy for the violation of the victim's 9        right by hearing from the victim and the parties, 10        considering all factors relevant to the issue, and 11        then awarding appropriate relief to the victim.12            (A-5) Consideration of an issue of a substantive 13        nature or an issue that implicates the constitutional 14        or statutory right of a victim at a court proceeding 15        labeled as a status hearing shall constitute a per se 16        violation of a victim's right. 17            (B) The appropriate remedy shall include only 18        actions necessary to provide the victim the right to 19        which the victim was entitled. Remedies may include, 20        but are not limited to: injunctive relief requiring 21        the victim's right to be afforded; declaratory 22        judgment recognizing or clarifying the victim's 23        rights; a writ of mandamus; and may include reopening 24        previously held proceedings; however, in no event 25        shall the court vacate a conviction. Any remedy shall 26        be tailored to provide the victim an appropriate   HB3424- 13 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        remedy without violating any constitutional right of 2        the defendant. In no event shall the appropriate 3        remedy to the victim be a new trial or damages.4        The court shall impose a mandatory training course 5    provided by the Attorney General for the employee under 6    item (ii) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph (4), which must 7    be successfully completed within 6 months of the entry of 8    the court order.9        This paragraph (5) takes effect January 2, 2023.10        (6) Right to be heard. Whenever a victim has the right 11    to be heard, the court shall allow the victim to exercise 12    the right in any reasonable manner the victim chooses.13        (7) Right to attend trial. A party must file a written 14    motion to exclude a victim from trial at least 60 days 15    prior to the date set for trial. The motion must state with 16    specificity the reason exclusion is necessary to protect a 17    constitutional right of the party, and must contain an 18    offer of proof. The court shall rule on the motion within 19    30 days. If the motion is granted, the court shall set 20    forth on the record the facts that support its finding 21    that the victim's testimony will be materially affected if 22    the victim hears other testimony at trial.23        (8) Right to have advocate and support person present 24    at court proceedings.25            (A) A party who intends to call an advocate as a 26        witness at trial must seek permission of the court   HB3424- 14 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        before the subpoena is issued. The party must file a 2        written motion at least 90 days before trial that sets 3        forth specifically the issues on which the advocate's 4        testimony is sought and an offer of proof regarding 5        (i) the content of the anticipated testimony of the 6        advocate; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 7        materiality of the anticipated testimony. The court 8        shall consider the motion and make findings within 30 9        days of the filing of the motion. If the court finds by 10        a preponderance of the evidence that: (i) the 11        anticipated testimony is not protected by an absolute 12        privilege; and (ii) the anticipated testimony contains 13        relevant, admissible, and material evidence that is 14        not available through other witnesses or evidence, the 15        court shall issue a subpoena requiring the advocate to 16        appear to testify at an in camera hearing. The 17        prosecuting attorney and the victim shall have 15 days 18        to seek appellate review before the advocate is 19        required to testify at an ex parte in camera 20        proceeding. 21            The prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the 22        advocate's attorney shall be allowed to be present at 23        the ex parte in camera proceeding. If, after 24        conducting the ex parte in camera hearing, the court 25        determines that due process requires any testimony 26        regarding confidential or privileged information or   HB3424- 15 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        communications, the court shall provide to the 2        prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the advocate's 3        attorney a written memorandum on the substance of the 4        advocate's testimony. The prosecuting attorney, the 5        victim, and the advocate's attorney shall have 15 days 6        to seek appellate review before a subpoena may be 7        issued for the advocate to testify at trial. The 8        presence of the prosecuting attorney at the ex parte 9        in camera proceeding does not make the substance of 10        the advocate's testimony that the court has ruled 11        inadmissible subject to discovery.12            (B) If a victim has asserted the right to have a 13        support person present at the court proceedings, the 14        victim shall provide the name of the person the victim 15        has chosen to be the victim's support person to the 16        prosecuting attorney, within 60 days of trial. The 17        prosecuting attorney shall provide the name to the 18        defendant. If the defendant intends to call the 19        support person as a witness at trial, the defendant 20        must seek permission of the court before a subpoena is 21        issued. The defendant must file a written motion at 22        least 45 days prior to trial that sets forth 23        specifically the issues on which the support person 24        will testify and an offer of proof regarding: (i) the 25        content of the anticipated testimony of the support 26        person; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and   HB3424- 16 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        materiality of the anticipated testimony.2            If the prosecuting attorney intends to call the 3        support person as a witness during the State's 4        case-in-chief, the prosecuting attorney shall inform 5        the court of this intent in the response to the 6        defendant's written motion. The victim may choose a 7        different person to be the victim's support person. 8        The court may allow the defendant to inquire about 9        matters outside the scope of the direct examination 10        during cross-examination. If the court allows the 11        defendant to do so, the support person shall be 12        allowed to remain in the courtroom after the support 13        person has testified. A defendant who fails to 14        question the support person about matters outside the 15        scope of direct examination during the State's 16        case-in-chief waives the right to challenge the 17        presence of the support person on appeal. The court 18        shall allow the support person to testify if called as 19        a witness in the defendant's case-in-chief or the 20        State's rebuttal.21            If the court does not allow the defendant to 22        inquire about matters outside the scope of the direct 23        examination, the support person shall be allowed to 24        remain in the courtroom after the support person has 25        been called by the defendant or the defendant has 26        rested. The court shall allow the support person to   HB3424- 17 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        testify in the State's rebuttal.2            If the prosecuting attorney does not intend to 3        call the support person in the State's case-in-chief, 4        the court shall verify with the support person whether 5        the support person, if called as a witness, would 6        testify as set forth in the offer of proof. If the 7        court finds that the support person would testify as 8        set forth in the offer of proof, the court shall rule 9        on the relevance, materiality, and admissibility of 10        the anticipated testimony. If the court rules the 11        anticipated testimony is admissible, the court shall 12        issue the subpoena. The support person may remain in 13        the courtroom after the support person testifies and 14        shall be allowed to testify in rebuttal.15            If the court excludes the victim's support person 16        during the State's case-in-chief, the victim shall be 17        allowed to choose another support person to be present 18        in court. 19            If the victim fails to designate a support person 20        within 60 days of trial and the defendant has 21        subpoenaed the support person to testify at trial, the 22        court may exclude the support person from the trial 23        until the support person testifies. If the court 24        excludes the support person the victim may choose 25        another person as a support person. 26        (9) Right to notice and hearing before disclosure of   HB3424- 18 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    confidential or privileged information or records.2            (A) A defendant who seeks to subpoena testimony or 3        records of or concerning the victim that are 4        confidential or privileged by law must seek permission 5        of the court before the subpoena is issued. The 6        defendant must file a written motion and an offer of 7        proof regarding the relevance, admissibility and 8        materiality of the testimony or records. If the court 9        finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:10                (i) the testimony or records are not protected 11            by an absolute privilege and12                (ii) the testimony or records contain 13            relevant, admissible, and material evidence that 14            is not available through other witnesses or 15            evidence, the court shall issue a subpoena 16            requiring the witness to appear in camera or a 17            sealed copy of the records be delivered to the 18            court to be reviewed in camera. If, after 19            conducting an in camera review of the witness 20            statement or records, the court determines that 21            due process requires disclosure of any potential 22            testimony or any portion of the records, the court 23            shall provide copies of the records that it 24            intends to disclose to the prosecuting attorney 25            and the victim. The prosecuting attorney and the 26            victim shall have 30 days to seek appellate review   HB3424- 19 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1            before the records are disclosed to the defendant, 2            used in any court proceeding, or disclosed to 3            anyone or in any way that would subject the 4            testimony or records to public review. The 5            disclosure of copies of any portion of the 6            testimony or records to the prosecuting attorney 7            under this Section does not make the records 8            subject to discovery or required to be provided to 9            the defendant.10            (B) A prosecuting attorney who seeks to subpoena 11        information or records concerning the victim that are 12        confidential or privileged by law must first request 13        the written consent of the crime victim. If the victim 14        does not provide such written consent, including where 15        necessary the appropriate signed document required for 16        waiving privilege, the prosecuting attorney must serve 17        the subpoena at least 21 days prior to the date a 18        response or appearance is required to allow the 19        subject of the subpoena time to file a motion to quash 20        or request a hearing. The prosecuting attorney must 21        also send a written notice to the victim at least 21 22        days prior to the response date to allow the victim to 23        file a motion or request a hearing. The notice to the 24        victim shall inform the victim (i) that a subpoena has 25        been issued for confidential information or records 26        concerning the victim, (ii) that the victim has the   HB3424- 20 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        right to request a hearing prior to the response date 2        of the subpoena, and (iii) how to request the hearing. 3        The notice to the victim shall also include a copy of 4        the subpoena. If requested, a hearing regarding the 5        subpoena shall occur before information or records are 6        provided to the prosecuting attorney. 7        (10) Right to notice of court proceedings. If the 8    victim is not present at a court proceeding in which a 9    right of the victim is at issue, the court shall ask the 10    prosecuting attorney whether the victim was notified of 11    the time, place, and purpose of the court proceeding and 12    that the victim had a right to be heard at the court 13    proceeding. If the court determines that timely notice was 14    not given or that the victim was not adequately informed 15    of the nature of the court proceeding, the court shall not 16    rule on any substantive issues, accept a plea, or impose a 17    sentence and shall continue the hearing for the time 18    necessary to notify the victim of the time, place and 19    nature of the court proceeding. The time between court 20    proceedings shall not be attributable to the State under 21    Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.22        (11) Right to timely disposition of the case. A victim 23    has the right to timely disposition of the case so as to 24    minimize the stress, cost, and inconvenience resulting 25    from the victim's involvement in the case. Before ruling 26    on a motion to continue trial or other court proceeding,   HB3424- 21 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    the court shall inquire into the circumstances for the 2    request for the delay and, if the victim has provided 3    written notice of the assertion of the right to a timely 4    disposition, and whether the victim objects to the delay. 5    If the victim objects, the prosecutor shall inform the 6    court of the victim's objections. If the prosecutor has 7    not conferred with the victim about the continuance, the 8    prosecutor shall inform the court of the attempts to 9    confer. If the court finds the attempts of the prosecutor 10    to confer with the victim were inadequate to protect the 11    victim's right to be heard, the court shall give the 12    prosecutor at least 3 but not more than 5 business days to 13    confer with the victim. In ruling on a motion to continue, 14    the court shall consider the reasons for the requested 15    continuance, the number and length of continuances that 16    have been granted, the victim's objections and procedures 17    to avoid further delays. If a continuance is granted over 18    the victim's objection, the court shall specify on the 19    record the reasons for the continuance and the procedures 20    that have been or will be taken to avoid further delays.21        (12) Right to Restitution.22            (A) If the victim has asserted the right to 23        restitution and the amount of restitution is known at 24        the time of sentencing, the court shall enter the 25        judgment of restitution at the time of sentencing. 26            (B) If the victim has asserted the right to   HB3424- 22 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        restitution and the amount of restitution is not known 2        at the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall, 3        within 5 days after sentencing, notify the victim what 4        information and documentation related to restitution 5        is needed and that the information and documentation 6        must be provided to the prosecutor within 45 days 7        after sentencing. Failure to timely provide 8        information and documentation related to restitution 9        shall be deemed a waiver of the right to restitution. 10        The prosecutor shall file and serve within 60 days 11        after sentencing a proposed judgment for restitution 12        and a notice that includes information concerning the 13        identity of any victims or other persons seeking 14        restitution, whether any victim or other person 15        expressly declines restitution, the nature and amount 16        of any damages together with any supporting 17        documentation, a restitution amount recommendation, 18        and the names of any co-defendants and their case 19        numbers. Within 30 days after receipt of the proposed 20        judgment for restitution, the defendant shall file any 21        objection to the proposed judgment, a statement of 22        grounds for the objection, and a financial statement. 23        If the defendant does not file an objection, the court 24        may enter the judgment for restitution without further 25        proceedings. If the defendant files an objection and 26        either party requests a hearing, the court shall   HB3424- 23 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        schedule a hearing. 2        (13) Access to presentence reports.3            (A) The victim may request a copy of the 4        presentence report prepared under the Unified Code of 5        Corrections from the State's Attorney. The State's 6        Attorney shall redact the following information before 7        providing a copy of the report:8                (i) the defendant's mental history and 9            condition;10                (ii) any evaluation prepared under subsection 11            (b) or (b-5) of Section 5-3-2; and12                (iii) the name, address, phone number, and 13            other personal information about any other victim.14            (B) The State's Attorney or the defendant may 15        request the court redact other information in the 16        report that may endanger the safety of any person.17            (C) The State's Attorney may orally disclose to 18        the victim any of the information that has been 19        redacted if there is a reasonable likelihood that the 20        information will be stated in court at the sentencing.21            (D) The State's Attorney must advise the victim 22        that the victim must maintain the confidentiality of 23        the report and other information. Any dissemination of 24        the report or information that was not stated at a 25        court proceeding constitutes indirect criminal 26        contempt of court.   HB3424- 24 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        (14) Appellate relief. If the trial court denies the 2    relief requested, the victim, the victim's attorney, or 3    the prosecuting attorney may file an appeal within 30 days 4    of the trial court's ruling. The trial or appellate court 5    may stay the court proceedings if the court finds that a 6    stay would not violate a constitutional right of the 7    defendant. If the appellate court denies the relief 8    sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated 9    in a written opinion. In any appeal in a criminal case, the 10    State may assert as error the court's denial of any crime 11    victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal 12    relates.13        (15) Limitation on appellate relief. In no case shall 14    an appellate court provide a new trial to remedy the 15    violation of a victim's right. 16        (16) The right to be reasonably protected from the 17    accused throughout the criminal justice process and the 18    right to have the safety of the victim and the victim's 19    family considered in determining whether to release the 20    defendant, and setting conditions of release after arrest 21    and conviction.

The Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 is 9amended by changing Section 214 as follows: 10    (750 ILCS 60/214)  (from Ch. 40, par. 2312-14)11    Sec. 214. Order of protection; remedies. 12    (a) Issuance of order. If the court finds that petitioner 13has been abused by a family or household member or that 14petitioner is a high-risk adult who has been abused, 15neglected, or exploited, as defined in this Act, an order of 16protection prohibiting the abuse, neglect, or exploitation 17shall issue; provided that petitioner must also satisfy the 18requirements of one of the following Sections, as appropriate: 19Section 217 on emergency orders, Section 218 on interim 20orders, or Section 219 on plenary orders. Petitioner shall not 21be denied an order of protection because petitioner or 22respondent is a minor. The court, when determining whether or 23not to issue an order of protection, shall not require 24physical manifestations of abuse on the person of the victim.   HB3424- 59 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1Modification and extension of prior orders of protection shall 2be in accordance with this Act.3    (b) Remedies and standards. The remedies to be included in 4an order of protection shall be determined in accordance with 5this Section and one of the following Sections, as 6appropriate: Section 217 on emergency orders, Section 218 on 7interim orders, and Section 219 on plenary orders. The 8remedies listed in this subsection shall be in addition to 9other civil or criminal remedies available to petitioner.10        (1) Prohibition of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. 11    Prohibit respondent's harassment, interference with 12    personal liberty, intimidation of a dependent, physical 13    abuse, or willful deprivation, neglect or exploitation, as 14    defined in this Act, or stalking of the petitioner, as 15    defined in Section 12-7.3 of the Criminal Code of 2012, if 16    such abuse, neglect, exploitation, or stalking has 17    occurred or otherwise appears likely to occur if not 18    prohibited.19        (2) Grant of exclusive possession of residence. 20    Prohibit respondent from entering or remaining in any 21    residence, household, or premises of the petitioner, 22    including one owned or leased by respondent, if petitioner 23    has a right to occupancy thereof. The grant of exclusive 24    possession of the residence, household, or premises shall 25    not affect title to real property, nor shall the court be 26    limited by the standard set forth in subsection (c-2) of   HB3424- 60 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    Section 501 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 2    Marriage Act.3            (A) Right to occupancy. A party has a right to 4        occupancy of a residence or household if it is solely 5        or jointly owned or leased by that party, that party's 6        spouse, a person with a legal duty to support that 7        party or a minor child in that party's care, or by any 8        person or entity other than the opposing party that 9        authorizes that party's occupancy (e.g., a domestic 10        violence shelter). Standards set forth in subparagraph 11        (B) shall not preclude equitable relief.12            (B) Presumption of hardships. If petitioner and 13        respondent each has the right to occupancy of a 14        residence or household, the court shall balance (i) 15        the hardships to respondent and any minor child or 16        dependent adult in respondent's care resulting from 17        entry of this remedy with (ii) the hardships to 18        petitioner and any minor child or dependent adult in 19        petitioner's care resulting from continued exposure to 20        the risk of abuse (should petitioner remain at the 21        residence or household) or from loss of possession of 22        the residence or household (should petitioner leave to 23        avoid the risk of abuse). When determining the balance 24        of hardships, the court shall also take into account 25        the accessibility of the residence or household. 26        Hardships need not be balanced if respondent does not   HB3424- 61 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        have a right to occupancy.2            The balance of hardships is presumed to favor 3        possession by petitioner unless the presumption is 4        rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence, showing 5        that the hardships to respondent substantially 6        outweigh the hardships to petitioner and any minor 7        child or dependent adult in petitioner's care. The 8        court, on the request of petitioner or on its own 9        motion, may order respondent to provide suitable, 10        accessible, alternate housing for petitioner instead 11        of excluding respondent from a mutual residence or 12        household.13        (3) Stay away order and additional prohibitions. Order 14    respondent to stay away from petitioner or any other 15    person protected by the order of protection, or prohibit 16    respondent from entering or remaining present at 17    petitioner's school, place of employment, or other 18    specified places at times when petitioner is present, or 19    both, if reasonable, given the balance of hardships. 20    Hardships need not be balanced for the court to enter a 21    stay away order or prohibit entry if respondent has no 22    right to enter the premises.23            (A) If an order of protection grants petitioner 24        exclusive possession of the residence, or prohibits 25        respondent from entering the residence, or orders 26        respondent to stay away from petitioner or other   HB3424- 62 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        protected persons, then the court may allow respondent 2        access to the residence to remove items of clothing 3        and personal adornment used exclusively by respondent, 4        medications, and other items as the court directs. The 5        right to access shall be exercised on only one 6        occasion as the court directs and in the presence of an 7        agreed-upon adult third party or law enforcement 8        officer.9            (B) When the petitioner and the respondent attend 10        the same public, private, or non-public elementary, 11        middle, or high school, the court when issuing an 12        order of protection and providing relief shall 13        consider the severity of the act, any continuing 14        physical danger or emotional distress to the 15        petitioner, the educational rights guaranteed to the 16        petitioner and respondent under federal and State law, 17        the availability of a transfer of the respondent to 18        another school, a change of placement or a change of 19        program of the respondent, the expense, difficulty, 20        and educational disruption that would be caused by a 21        transfer of the respondent to another school, and any 22        other relevant facts of the case. The court may order 23        that the respondent not attend the public, private, or 24        non-public elementary, middle, or high school attended 25        by the petitioner, order that the respondent accept a 26        change of placement or change of program, as   HB3424- 63 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        determined by the school district or private or 2        non-public school, or place restrictions on the 3        respondent's movements within the school attended by 4        the petitioner. The respondent bears the burden of 5        proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a 6        transfer, change of placement, or change of program of 7        the respondent is not available. The respondent also 8        bears the burden of production with respect to the 9        expense, difficulty, and educational disruption that 10        would be caused by a transfer of the respondent to 11        another school. A transfer, change of placement, or 12        change of program is not unavailable to the respondent 13        solely on the ground that the respondent does not 14        agree with the school district's or private or 15        non-public school's transfer, change of placement, or 16        change of program or solely on the ground that the 17        respondent fails or refuses to consent or otherwise 18        does not take an action required to effectuate a 19        transfer, change of placement, or change of program. 20        When a court orders a respondent to stay away from the 21        public, private, or non-public school attended by the 22        petitioner and the respondent requests a transfer to 23        another attendance center within the respondent's 24        school district or private or non-public school, the 25        school district or private or non-public school shall 26        have sole discretion to determine the attendance   HB3424- 64 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        center to which the respondent is transferred. In the 2        event the court order results in a transfer of the 3        minor respondent to another attendance center, a 4        change in the respondent's placement, or a change of 5        the respondent's program, the parents, guardian, or 6        legal custodian of the respondent is responsible for 7        transportation and other costs associated with the 8        transfer or change. 9            (C) The court may order the parents, guardian, or 10        legal custodian of a minor respondent to take certain 11        actions or to refrain from taking certain actions to 12        ensure that the respondent complies with the order. In 13        the event the court orders a transfer of the 14        respondent to another school, the parents, guardian, 15        or legal custodian of the respondent is responsible 16        for transportation and other costs associated with the 17        change of school by the respondent. 18        (4) Counseling. Require or recommend the respondent to 19    undergo counseling for a specified duration with a social 20    worker, psychologist, clinical psychologist, 21    psychiatrist, family service agency, alcohol or substance 22    abuse program, mental health center guidance counselor, 23    agency providing services to elders, program designed for 24    domestic violence abusers or any other guidance service 25    the court deems appropriate. The Court may order the 26    respondent in any intimate partner relationship to report   HB3424- 65 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    to an Illinois Department of Human Services protocol 2    approved partner abuse intervention program for an 3    assessment and to follow all recommended treatment. 4        (5) Physical care and possession of the minor child. 5    In order to protect the minor child from abuse, neglect, 6    or unwarranted separation from the person who has been the 7    minor child's primary caretaker, or to otherwise protect 8    the well-being of the minor child, the court may do either 9    or both of the following: (i) grant petitioner physical 10    care or possession of the minor child, or both, or (ii) 11    order respondent to return a minor child to, or not remove 12    a minor child from, the physical care of a parent or person 13    in loco parentis.14        If a court finds, after a hearing, that respondent has 15    committed abuse (as defined in Section 103) of a minor 16    child, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that 17    awarding physical care to respondent would not be in the 18    minor child's best interest.19        (6) Temporary allocation of parental responsibilities: 20    significant decision-making. Award temporary 21    decision-making responsibility to petitioner in accordance 22    with this Section, the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution 23    of Marriage Act, the Illinois Parentage Act of 2015, and 24    this State's Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and 25    Enforcement Act. 26        If a court finds, after a hearing, that respondent has   HB3424- 66 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    committed abuse (as defined in Section 103) of a minor 2    child, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that 3    awarding temporary significant decision-making 4    responsibility to respondent would not be in the child's 5    best interest.6        (7) Parenting time. Determine the parenting time, if 7    any, of respondent in any case in which the court awards 8    physical care or allocates temporary significant 9    decision-making responsibility of a minor child to 10    petitioner. The court shall restrict or deny respondent's 11    parenting time with a minor child if the court finds that 12    respondent has done or is likely to do any of the 13    following: (i) abuse or endanger the minor child during 14    parenting time; (ii) use the parenting time as an 15    opportunity to abuse or harass petitioner or petitioner's 16    family or household members; (iii) improperly conceal or 17    detain the minor child; or (iv) otherwise act in a manner 18    that is not in the best interests of the minor child. The 19    court shall not be limited by the standards set forth in 20    Section 603.10 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 21    Marriage Act. If the court grants parenting time, the 22    order shall specify dates and times for the parenting time 23    to take place or other specific parameters or conditions 24    that are appropriate. No order for parenting time shall 25    refer merely to the term "reasonable parenting time".26        Petitioner may deny respondent access to the minor   HB3424- 67 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    child if, when respondent arrives for parenting time, 2    respondent is under the influence of drugs or alcohol and 3    constitutes a threat to the safety and well-being of 4    petitioner or petitioner's minor children or is behaving 5    in a violent or abusive manner.6        If necessary to protect any member of petitioner's 7    family or household from future abuse, respondent shall be 8    prohibited from coming to petitioner's residence to meet 9    the minor child for parenting time, and the parties shall 10    submit to the court their recommendations for reasonable 11    alternative arrangements for parenting time. A person may 12    be approved to supervise parenting time only after filing 13    an affidavit accepting that responsibility and 14    acknowledging accountability to the court.15        (8) Removal or concealment of minor child. Prohibit 16    respondent from removing a minor child from the State or 17    concealing the child within the State. 18        (9) Order to appear. Order the respondent to appear in 19    court, alone or with a minor child, to prevent abuse, 20    neglect, removal or concealment of the child, to return 21    the child to the custody or care of the petitioner or to 22    permit any court-ordered interview or examination of the 23    child or the respondent.24        (10) Possession of personal property. Grant petitioner 25    exclusive possession of personal property and, if 26    respondent has possession or control, direct respondent to   HB3424- 68 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    promptly make it available to petitioner, if:2            (i) petitioner, but not respondent, owns the 3        property; or4            (ii) the parties own the property jointly; sharing 5        it would risk abuse of petitioner by respondent or is 6        impracticable; and the balance of hardships favors 7        temporary possession by petitioner.8        If petitioner's sole claim to ownership of the 9    property is that it is marital property, the court may 10    award petitioner temporary possession thereof under the 11    standards of subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph only if a 12    proper proceeding has been filed under the Illinois 13    Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, as now or 14    hereafter amended.15        No order under this provision shall affect title to 16    property.17        (11) Protection of property. Forbid the respondent 18    from taking, transferring, encumbering, concealing, 19    damaging or otherwise disposing of any real or personal 20    property, except as explicitly authorized by the court, 21    if:22            (i) petitioner, but not respondent, owns the 23        property; or24            (ii) the parties own the property jointly, and the 25        balance of hardships favors granting this remedy.26        If petitioner's sole claim to ownership of the   HB3424- 69 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    property is that it is marital property, the court may 2    grant petitioner relief under subparagraph (ii) of this 3    paragraph only if a proper proceeding has been filed under 4    the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, as 5    now or hereafter amended.6        The court may further prohibit respondent from 7    improperly using the financial or other resources of an 8    aged member of the family or household for the profit or 9    advantage of respondent or of any other person.10        (11.5) Protection of animals. Grant the petitioner the 11    exclusive care, custody, or control of any animal owned, 12    possessed, leased, kept, or held by either the petitioner 13    or the respondent or a minor child residing in the 14    residence or household of either the petitioner or the 15    respondent and order the respondent to stay away from the 16    animal and forbid the respondent from taking, 17    transferring, encumbering, concealing, harming, or 18    otherwise disposing of the animal. 19        (12) Order for payment of support. Order respondent to 20    pay temporary support for the petitioner or any child in 21    the petitioner's care or over whom the petitioner has been 22    allocated parental responsibility, when the respondent has 23    a legal obligation to support that person, in accordance 24    with the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage 25    Act, which shall govern, among other matters, the amount 26    of support, payment through the clerk and withholding of   HB3424- 70 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    income to secure payment. An order for child support may 2    be granted to a petitioner with lawful physical care of a 3    child, or an order or agreement for physical care of a 4    child, prior to entry of an order allocating significant 5    decision-making responsibility. Such a support order shall 6    expire upon entry of a valid order allocating parental 7    responsibility differently and vacating the petitioner's 8    significant decision-making authority, unless otherwise 9    provided in the order.10        (13) Order for payment of losses. Order respondent to 11    pay petitioner for losses suffered as a direct result of 12    the abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Such losses shall 13    include, but not be limited to, medical expenses, lost 14    earnings or other support, repair or replacement of 15    property damaged or taken, reasonable attorney's fees, 16    court costs and moving or other travel expenses, including 17    additional reasonable expenses for temporary shelter and 18    restaurant meals.19            (i) Losses affecting family needs. If a party is 20        entitled to seek maintenance, child support or 21        property distribution from the other party under the 22        Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, as 23        now or hereafter amended, the court may order 24        respondent to reimburse petitioner's actual losses, to 25        the extent that such reimbursement would be 26        "appropriate temporary relief", as authorized by   HB3424- 71 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        subsection (a)(3) of Section 501 of that Act.2            (ii) Recovery of expenses. In the case of an 3        improper concealment or removal of a minor child, the 4        court may order respondent to pay the reasonable 5        expenses incurred or to be incurred in the search for 6        and recovery of the minor child, including but not 7        limited to legal fees, court costs, private 8        investigator fees, and travel costs.9        (14) Prohibition of entry. Prohibit the respondent 10    from entering or remaining in the residence or household 11    while the respondent is under the influence of alcohol or 12    drugs and constitutes a threat to the safety and 13    well-being of the petitioner or the petitioner's children.14        (14.5) Prohibition of firearm possession.15            (a) Prohibit a respondent against whom an order of 16        protection was issued from possessing any firearms 17        during the duration of the order if the order:18                (1) was issued after a hearing of which such 19            person received actual notice, and at which such 20            person had an opportunity to participate;21                (2) restrains such person from harassing, 22            stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of 23            such person or child of such intimate partner or 24            person, or engaging in other conduct that would 25            place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of 26            bodily injury to the partner or child; and  HB3424- 72 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1                (3)(i) includes a finding that such person 2            represents a credible threat to the physical 3            safety of such intimate partner or child; or (ii) 4            by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, 5            attempted use, or threatened use of physical force 6            against such intimate partner or child that would 7            reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.8        Any Firearm Owner's Identification Card in the 9        possession of the respondent, except as provided in 10        subsection (b), shall be ordered by the court to be 11        turned over to the local law enforcement agency. The 12        local law enforcement agency shall immediately mail 13        the card to the Illinois State Police Firearm Owner's 14        Identification Card Office for safekeeping. The court 15        shall issue a warrant for seizure of any firearm in the 16        possession of the respondent, to be kept by the local 17        law enforcement agency for safekeeping, except as 18        provided in subsection (b).

The Commission may consult with 19        wireless telephone service providers and the Circuit 20        Court Clerks on the manner in which this information 21        is provided and displayed. 22    (c) Relevant factors; findings.23        (1) In determining whether to grant a specific remedy, 24    other than payment of support, the court shall consider 25    relevant factors, including but not limited to the 26    following:  HB3424- 78 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1            (i) the nature, frequency, severity, pattern and 2        consequences of the respondent's past abuse, neglect 3        or exploitation of the petitioner or any family or 4        household member, including the concealment of his or 5        her location in order to evade service of process or 6        notice, and the likelihood of danger of future abuse, 7        neglect, or exploitation to petitioner or any member 8        of petitioner's or respondent's family or household; 9        and10            (ii) the danger that any minor child will be 11        abused or neglected or improperly relocated from the 12        jurisdiction, improperly concealed within the State or 13        improperly separated from the child's primary 14        caretaker.15        (2) In comparing relative hardships resulting to the 16    parties from loss of possession of the family home, the 17    court shall consider relevant factors, including but not 18    limited to the following:19            (i) availability, accessibility, cost, safety, 20        adequacy, location and other characteristics of 21        alternate housing for each party and any minor child 22        or dependent adult in the party's care;23            (ii) the effect on the party's employment; and24            (iii) the effect on the relationship of the party, 25        and any minor child or dependent adult in the party's 26        care, to family, school, church and community.  HB3424- 79 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        (3) Subject to the exceptions set forth in paragraph 2    (4) of this subsection, the court shall make its findings 3    in an official record or in writing, and shall at a minimum 4    set forth the following:5            (i) That the court has considered the applicable 6        relevant factors described in paragraphs (1) and (2) 7        of this subsection.8            (ii) Whether the conduct or actions of respondent, 9        unless prohibited, will likely cause irreparable harm 10        or continued abuse.11            (iii) Whether it is necessary to grant the 12        requested relief in order to protect petitioner or 13        other alleged abused persons.14        (4) For purposes of issuing an ex parte emergency 15    order of protection, the court, as an alternative to or as 16    a supplement to making the findings described in 17    paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this 18    subsection, may use the following procedure:19        When a verified petition for an emergency order of 20    protection in accordance with the requirements of Sections 21    203 and 217 is presented to the court, the court shall 22    examine petitioner on oath or affirmation. An emergency 23    order of protection shall be issued by the court if it 24    appears from the contents of the petition and the 25    examination of petitioner that the averments are 26    sufficient to indicate abuse by respondent and to support   HB3424- 80 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    the granting of relief under the issuance of the emergency 2    order of protection.3        (5) Never married parties. No rights or 4    responsibilities for a minor child born outside of 5    marriage attach to a putative father until a father and 6    child relationship has been established under the Illinois 7    Parentage Act of 1984, the Illinois Parentage Act of 2015, 8    the Illinois Public Aid Code, Section 12 of the Vital 9    Records Act, the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Probate 10    Act of 1975, the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of 11    Support Act, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, 12    the Expedited Child Support Act of 1990, any judicial, 13    administrative, or other act of another state or 14    territory, any other Illinois statute, or by any foreign 15    nation establishing the father and child relationship, any 16    other proceeding substantially in conformity with the 17    Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity 18    Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-193), or where 19    both parties appeared in open court or at an 20    administrative hearing acknowledging under oath or 21    admitting by affirmation the existence of a father and 22    child relationship. Absent such an adjudication, finding, 23    or acknowledgment, no putative father shall be granted 24    temporary allocation of parental responsibilities, 25    including parenting time with the minor child, or physical 26    care and possession of the minor child, nor shall an order   HB3424- 81 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    of payment for support of the minor child be entered.2    (d) Balance of hardships; findings. If the court finds 3that the balance of hardships does not support the granting of 4a remedy governed by paragraph (2), (3), (10), (11), or (16) of 5subsection (b) of this Section, which may require such 6balancing, the court's findings shall so indicate and shall 7include a finding as to whether granting the remedy will 8result in hardship to respondent that would substantially 9outweigh the hardship to petitioner from denial of the remedy. 10The findings shall be an official record or in writing.11    (e) Denial of remedies. Denial of any remedy shall not be 12based, in whole or in part, on evidence that:13        (1) Respondent has cause for any use of force, unless 14    that cause satisfies the standards for justifiable use of 15    force provided by Article 7 of the Criminal Code of 2012;16        (2) Respondent was voluntarily intoxicated;17        (3) Petitioner acted in self-defense or defense of 18    another, provided that, if petitioner utilized force, such 19    force was justifiable under Article 7 of the Criminal Code 20    of 2012; 21        (4) Petitioner did not act in self-defense or defense 22    of another;23        (5) Petitioner left the residence or household to 24    avoid further abuse, neglect, or exploitation by 25    respondent;26        (6) Petitioner did not leave the residence or   HB3424- 82 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    household to avoid further abuse, neglect, or exploitation 2    by respondent;3        (7) Conduct by any family or household member excused 4    the abuse, neglect, or exploitation by respondent, unless 5    that same conduct would have excused such abuse, neglect, 6    or exploitation if the parties had not been family or 7    household members.8    A petition for an order of protection may not be denied 9upon the basis that the petitioner or the respondent is 10incarcerated in a penal institution at the time of the filing 11of the petition. 12(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21.)  HB3424- 83 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1 INDEX 2 Statutes amended in order of appearance 3    725 ILCS 120/4.54    730 ILCS 5/3-3-1.1 new5    730 ILCS 5/3-3-2from Ch. 38, par. 1003-3-26    730 ILCS 5/3-3-9from Ch. 38, par. 1003-3-97    730 ILCS 5/3-14-1from Ch. 38, par. 1003-14-18    750 ILCS 60/214from Ch. 40, par. 2312-14

If the victim or   HB3424- 10 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        the victim's attorney was not allowed to be heard at 2        the hearing regarding the prosecuting attorney's 3        motion, and the court denies the prosecuting 4        attorney's assertion of the right or denies the 5        request for enforcement of a right, the victim or 6        victim's attorney may file a motion to assert the 7        victim's right or to request enforcement of the right 8        within 10 days of the court's ruling. The motion need 9        not demonstrate the grounds for a motion for 10        reconsideration. The court shall rule on the merits of 11        the motion.12            (D) The court shall take up and decide any motion 13        or request asserting or seeking enforcement of a 14        victim's right without delay, unless a specific time 15        period is specified by law or court rule. The reasons 16        for any decision denying the motion or request shall 17        be clearly stated on the record.18            (E) No later than January 1, 2023, the Office of 19        the Attorney General shall: 20                (i) designate an administrative authority 21            within the Office of the Attorney General to 22            receive and investigate complaints relating to the 23            provision or violation of the rights of a crime 24            victim as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 25            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act;26                (ii) create and administer a course of   HB3424- 11 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1            training for employees and offices of the State of 2            Illinois that fail to comply with provisions of 3            Illinois law pertaining to the treatment of crime 4            victims as described in Article I, Section 8.1 of 5            the Illinois Constitution and in this Act as 6            required by the court under Section 5 of this Act; 7            and8                (iii) have the authority to make 9            recommendations to employees and offices of the 10            State of Illinois to respond more effectively to 11            the needs of crime victims, including regarding 12            the violation of the rights of a crime victim.13            (F) Crime victims' rights may also be asserted by 14        filing a complaint for mandamus, injunctive, or 15        declaratory relief in the jurisdiction in which the 16        victim's right is being violated or where the crime is 17        being prosecuted. For complaints or motions filed by 18        or on behalf of the victim, the clerk of court shall 19        waive filing fees that would otherwise be owed by the 20        victim for any court filing with the purpose of 21        enforcing crime victims' rights. If the court denies 22        the relief sought by the victim, the reasons for the 23        denial shall be clearly stated on the record in the 24        transcript of the proceedings, in a written opinion, 25        or in the docket entry, and the victim may appeal the 26        circuit court's decision to the appellate court. The   HB3424- 12 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        court shall issue prompt rulings regarding victims' 2        rights. Proceedings seeking to enforce victims' rights 3        shall not be stayed or subject to unreasonable delay 4        via continuances. 5        (5) Violation of rights and remedies. 6            (A) If the court determines that a victim's right 7        has been violated, the court shall determine the 8        appropriate remedy for the violation of the victim's 9        right by hearing from the victim and the parties, 10        considering all factors relevant to the issue, and 11        then awarding appropriate relief to the victim.12            (A-5) Consideration of an issue of a substantive 13        nature or an issue that implicates the constitutional 14        or statutory right of a victim at a court proceeding 15        labeled as a status hearing shall constitute a per se 16        violation of a victim's right. 17            (B) The appropriate remedy shall include only 18        actions necessary to provide the victim the right to 19        which the victim was entitled. Remedies may include, 20        but are not limited to: injunctive relief requiring 21        the victim's right to be afforded; declaratory 22        judgment recognizing or clarifying the victim's 23        rights; a writ of mandamus; and may include reopening 24        previously held proceedings; however, in no event 25        shall the court vacate a conviction. Any remedy shall 26        be tailored to provide the victim an appropriate   HB3424- 13 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        remedy without violating any constitutional right of 2        the defendant. In no event shall the appropriate 3        remedy to the victim be a new trial or damages.4        The court shall impose a mandatory training course 5    provided by the Attorney General for the employee under 6    item (ii) of subparagraph (E) of paragraph (4), which must 7    be successfully completed within 6 months of the entry of 8    the court order.9        This paragraph (5) takes effect January 2, 2023.10        (6) Right to be heard. Whenever a victim has the right 11    to be heard, the court shall allow the victim to exercise 12    the right in any reasonable manner the victim chooses.13        (7) Right to attend trial. A party must file a written 14    motion to exclude a victim from trial at least 60 days 15    prior to the date set for trial. The motion must state with 16    specificity the reason exclusion is necessary to protect a 17    constitutional right of the party, and must contain an 18    offer of proof. The court shall rule on the motion within 19    30 days. If the motion is granted, the court shall set 20    forth on the record the facts that support its finding 21    that the victim's testimony will be materially affected if 22    the victim hears other testimony at trial.23        (8) Right to have advocate and support person present 24    at court proceedings.25            (A) A party who intends to call an advocate as a 26        witness at trial must seek permission of the court   HB3424- 14 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        before the subpoena is issued. The party must file a 2        written motion at least 90 days before trial that sets 3        forth specifically the issues on which the advocate's 4        testimony is sought and an offer of proof regarding 5        (i) the content of the anticipated testimony of the 6        advocate; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and 7        materiality of the anticipated testimony. The court 8        shall consider the motion and make findings within 30 9        days of the filing of the motion. If the court finds by 10        a preponderance of the evidence that: (i) the 11        anticipated testimony is not protected by an absolute 12        privilege; and (ii) the anticipated testimony contains 13        relevant, admissible, and material evidence that is 14        not available through other witnesses or evidence, the 15        court shall issue a subpoena requiring the advocate to 16        appear to testify at an in camera hearing. The 17        prosecuting attorney and the victim shall have 15 days 18        to seek appellate review before the advocate is 19        required to testify at an ex parte in camera 20        proceeding. 21            The prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the 22        advocate's attorney shall be allowed to be present at 23        the ex parte in camera proceeding. If, after 24        conducting the ex parte in camera hearing, the court 25        determines that due process requires any testimony 26        regarding confidential or privileged information or   HB3424- 15 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        communications, the court shall provide to the 2        prosecuting attorney, the victim, and the advocate's 3        attorney a written memorandum on the substance of the 4        advocate's testimony. The prosecuting attorney, the 5        victim, and the advocate's attorney shall have 15 days 6        to seek appellate review before a subpoena may be 7        issued for the advocate to testify at trial. The 8        presence of the prosecuting attorney at the ex parte 9        in camera proceeding does not make the substance of 10        the advocate's testimony that the court has ruled 11        inadmissible subject to discovery.12            (B) If a victim has asserted the right to have a 13        support person present at the court proceedings, the 14        victim shall provide the name of the person the victim 15        has chosen to be the victim's support person to the 16        prosecuting attorney, within 60 days of trial. The 17        prosecuting attorney shall provide the name to the 18        defendant. If the defendant intends to call the 19        support person as a witness at trial, the defendant 20        must seek permission of the court before a subpoena is 21        issued. The defendant must file a written motion at 22        least 45 days prior to trial that sets forth 23        specifically the issues on which the support person 24        will testify and an offer of proof regarding: (i) the 25        content of the anticipated testimony of the support 26        person; and (ii) the relevance, admissibility, and   HB3424- 16 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        materiality of the anticipated testimony.2            If the prosecuting attorney intends to call the 3        support person as a witness during the State's 4        case-in-chief, the prosecuting attorney shall inform 5        the court of this intent in the response to the 6        defendant's written motion. The victim may choose a 7        different person to be the victim's support person. 8        The court may allow the defendant to inquire about 9        matters outside the scope of the direct examination 10        during cross-examination. If the court allows the 11        defendant to do so, the support person shall be 12        allowed to remain in the courtroom after the support 13        person has testified. A defendant who fails to 14        question the support person about matters outside the 15        scope of direct examination during the State's 16        case-in-chief waives the right to challenge the 17        presence of the support person on appeal. The court 18        shall allow the support person to testify if called as 19        a witness in the defendant's case-in-chief or the 20        State's rebuttal.21            If the court does not allow the defendant to 22        inquire about matters outside the scope of the direct 23        examination, the support person shall be allowed to 24        remain in the courtroom after the support person has 25        been called by the defendant or the defendant has 26        rested. The court shall allow the support person to   HB3424- 17 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        testify in the State's rebuttal.2            If the prosecuting attorney does not intend to 3        call the support person in the State's case-in-chief, 4        the court shall verify with the support person whether 5        the support person, if called as a witness, would 6        testify as set forth in the offer of proof. If the 7        court finds that the support person would testify as 8        set forth in the offer of proof, the court shall rule 9        on the relevance, materiality, and admissibility of 10        the anticipated testimony. If the court rules the 11        anticipated testimony is admissible, the court shall 12        issue the subpoena. The support person may remain in 13        the courtroom after the support person testifies and 14        shall be allowed to testify in rebuttal.15            If the court excludes the victim's support person 16        during the State's case-in-chief, the victim shall be 17        allowed to choose another support person to be present 18        in court. 19            If the victim fails to designate a support person 20        within 60 days of trial and the defendant has 21        subpoenaed the support person to testify at trial, the 22        court may exclude the support person from the trial 23        until the support person testifies. If the court 24        excludes the support person the victim may choose 25        another person as a support person. 26        (9) Right to notice and hearing before disclosure of   HB3424- 18 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    confidential or privileged information or records.2            (A) A defendant who seeks to subpoena testimony or 3        records of or concerning the victim that are 4        confidential or privileged by law must seek permission 5        of the court before the subpoena is issued. The 6        defendant must file a written motion and an offer of 7        proof regarding the relevance, admissibility and 8        materiality of the testimony or records. If the court 9        finds by a preponderance of the evidence that:10                (i) the testimony or records are not protected 11            by an absolute privilege and12                (ii) the testimony or records contain 13            relevant, admissible, and material evidence that 14            is not available through other witnesses or 15            evidence, the court shall issue a subpoena 16            requiring the witness to appear in camera or a 17            sealed copy of the records be delivered to the 18            court to be reviewed in camera. If, after 19            conducting an in camera review of the witness 20            statement or records, the court determines that 21            due process requires disclosure of any potential 22            testimony or any portion of the records, the court 23            shall provide copies of the records that it 24            intends to disclose to the prosecuting attorney 25            and the victim. The prosecuting attorney and the 26            victim shall have 30 days to seek appellate review   HB3424- 19 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1            before the records are disclosed to the defendant, 2            used in any court proceeding, or disclosed to 3            anyone or in any way that would subject the 4            testimony or records to public review. The 5            disclosure of copies of any portion of the 6            testimony or records to the prosecuting attorney 7            under this Section does not make the records 8            subject to discovery or required to be provided to 9            the defendant.10            (B) A prosecuting attorney who seeks to subpoena 11        information or records concerning the victim that are 12        confidential or privileged by law must first request 13        the written consent of the crime victim. If the victim 14        does not provide such written consent, including where 15        necessary the appropriate signed document required for 16        waiving privilege, the prosecuting attorney must serve 17        the subpoena at least 21 days prior to the date a 18        response or appearance is required to allow the 19        subject of the subpoena time to file a motion to quash 20        or request a hearing. The prosecuting attorney must 21        also send a written notice to the victim at least 21 22        days prior to the response date to allow the victim to 23        file a motion or request a hearing. The notice to the 24        victim shall inform the victim (i) that a subpoena has 25        been issued for confidential information or records 26        concerning the victim, (ii) that the victim has the   HB3424- 20 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        right to request a hearing prior to the response date 2        of the subpoena, and (iii) how to request the hearing. 3        The notice to the victim shall also include a copy of 4        the subpoena. If requested, a hearing regarding the 5        subpoena shall occur before information or records are 6        provided to the prosecuting attorney. 7        (10) Right to notice of court proceedings. If the 8    victim is not present at a court proceeding in which a 9    right of the victim is at issue, the court shall ask the 10    prosecuting attorney whether the victim was notified of 11    the time, place, and purpose of the court proceeding and 12    that the victim had a right to be heard at the court 13    proceeding. If the court determines that timely notice was 14    not given or that the victim was not adequately informed 15    of the nature of the court proceeding, the court shall not 16    rule on any substantive issues, accept a plea, or impose a 17    sentence and shall continue the hearing for the time 18    necessary to notify the victim of the time, place and 19    nature of the court proceeding. The time between court 20    proceedings shall not be attributable to the State under 21    Section 103-5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.22        (11) Right to timely disposition of the case. A victim 23    has the right to timely disposition of the case so as to 24    minimize the stress, cost, and inconvenience resulting 25    from the victim's involvement in the case. Before ruling 26    on a motion to continue trial or other court proceeding,   HB3424- 21 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    the court shall inquire into the circumstances for the 2    request for the delay and, if the victim has provided 3    written notice of the assertion of the right to a timely 4    disposition, and whether the victim objects to the delay. 5    If the victim objects, the prosecutor shall inform the 6    court of the victim's objections. If the prosecutor has 7    not conferred with the victim about the continuance, the 8    prosecutor shall inform the court of the attempts to 9    confer. If the court finds the attempts of the prosecutor 10    to confer with the victim were inadequate to protect the 11    victim's right to be heard, the court shall give the 12    prosecutor at least 3 but not more than 5 business days to 13    confer with the victim. In ruling on a motion to continue, 14    the court shall consider the reasons for the requested 15    continuance, the number and length of continuances that 16    have been granted, the victim's objections and procedures 17    to avoid further delays. If a continuance is granted over 18    the victim's objection, the court shall specify on the 19    record the reasons for the continuance and the procedures 20    that have been or will be taken to avoid further delays.21        (12) Right to Restitution.22            (A) If the victim has asserted the right to 23        restitution and the amount of restitution is known at 24        the time of sentencing, the court shall enter the 25        judgment of restitution at the time of sentencing. 26            (B) If the victim has asserted the right to   HB3424- 22 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        restitution and the amount of restitution is not known 2        at the time of sentencing, the prosecutor shall, 3        within 5 days after sentencing, notify the victim what 4        information and documentation related to restitution 5        is needed and that the information and documentation 6        must be provided to the prosecutor within 45 days 7        after sentencing. Failure to timely provide 8        information and documentation related to restitution 9        shall be deemed a waiver of the right to restitution. 10        The prosecutor shall file and serve within 60 days 11        after sentencing a proposed judgment for restitution 12        and a notice that includes information concerning the 13        identity of any victims or other persons seeking 14        restitution, whether any victim or other person 15        expressly declines restitution, the nature and amount 16        of any damages together with any supporting 17        documentation, a restitution amount recommendation, 18        and the names of any co-defendants and their case 19        numbers. Within 30 days after receipt of the proposed 20        judgment for restitution, the defendant shall file any 21        objection to the proposed judgment, a statement of 22        grounds for the objection, and a financial statement. 23        If the defendant does not file an objection, the court 24        may enter the judgment for restitution without further 25        proceedings. If the defendant files an objection and 26        either party requests a hearing, the court shall   HB3424- 23 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        schedule a hearing. 2        (13) Access to presentence reports.3            (A) The victim may request a copy of the 4        presentence report prepared under the Unified Code of 5        Corrections from the State's Attorney. The State's 6        Attorney shall redact the following information before 7        providing a copy of the report:8                (i) the defendant's mental history and 9            condition;10                (ii) any evaluation prepared under subsection 11            (b) or (b-5) of Section 5-3-2; and12                (iii) the name, address, phone number, and 13            other personal information about any other victim.14            (B) The State's Attorney or the defendant may 15        request the court redact other information in the 16        report that may endanger the safety of any person.17            (C) The State's Attorney may orally disclose to 18        the victim any of the information that has been 19        redacted if there is a reasonable likelihood that the 20        information will be stated in court at the sentencing.21            (D) The State's Attorney must advise the victim 22        that the victim must maintain the confidentiality of 23        the report and other information. Any dissemination of 24        the report or information that was not stated at a 25        court proceeding constitutes indirect criminal 26        contempt of court.   HB3424- 24 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        (14) Appellate relief. If the trial court denies the 2    relief requested, the victim, the victim's attorney, or 3    the prosecuting attorney may file an appeal within 30 days 4    of the trial court's ruling. The trial or appellate court 5    may stay the court proceedings if the court finds that a 6    stay would not violate a constitutional right of the 7    defendant. If the appellate court denies the relief 8    sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated 9    in a written opinion. In any appeal in a criminal case, the 10    State may assert as error the court's denial of any crime 11    victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal 12    relates.13        (15) Limitation on appellate relief. In no case shall 14    an appellate court provide a new trial to remedy the 15    violation of a victim's right. 16        (16) The right to be reasonably protected from the 17    accused throughout the criminal justice process and the 18    right to have the safety of the victim and the victim's 19    family considered in determining whether to release the 20    defendant, and setting conditions of release after arrest 21    and conviction. A victim of domestic violence, a sexual 22    offense, or stalking may request the entry of a protective 23    order under Article 112A of the Code of Criminal Procedure 24    of 1963. 25    (d) Procedures after the imposition of sentence.26        (1) The Prisoner Review Board shall inform a victim or   HB3424- 25 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    any other concerned citizen, upon written request, of the 2    prisoner's release on parole, mandatory supervised 3    release, electronic detention, work release, international 4    transfer or exchange, or by the custodian, other than the 5    Department of Juvenile Justice, of the discharge of any 6    individual who was adjudicated a delinquent for a crime 7    from State custody and by the sheriff of the appropriate 8    county of any such person's final discharge from county 9    custody. The Prisoner Review Board, upon written request, 10    shall provide to a victim or any other concerned citizen a 11    recent photograph of any person convicted of a felony, 12    upon his or her release from custody. The Prisoner Review 13    Board, upon written request, shall inform a victim or any 14    other concerned citizen when feasible at least 7 days 15    prior to the prisoner's release on furlough of the times 16    and dates of such furlough. Upon written request by the 17    victim or any other concerned citizen, the State's 18    Attorney shall notify the person once of the times and 19    dates of release of a prisoner sentenced to periodic 20    imprisonment. Notification shall be based on the most 21    recent information as to the victim's or other concerned 22    citizen's residence or other location available to the 23    notifying authority. 24        (1.5) At least 48 hours prior to early release of the 25    prisoner from State custody or of the prisoner's pardon, 26    commutation, furlough, or granting of sentence credit, the   HB3424- 26 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    Prisoner Review Board shall inform a victim of the release 2    if the victim has previously requested notification of 3    that information. Notification shall be made before 5 p.m. 4    on weekdays. The notice shall include contact information 5    for the Prisoner Review Board. The notification shall be 6    based upon the most recent information as to the victim's 7    residence or other location available to the Board. When 8    no such information is available, the Board shall make all 9    reasonable efforts to obtain the information and make the 10    notification. This notification requirement is in addition 11    to any notification requirements pursuant to any other 12    statewide victim notification systems. The Board must 13    document notification efforts if that victim alleges lack 14    of notification under this paragraph (1.5). 15        (2) When the defendant has been committed to the 16    Department of Human Services pursuant to Section 5-2-4 or 17    any other provision of the Unified Code of Corrections, 18    the victim may request to be notified by the releasing 19    authority of the approval by the court of an on-grounds 20    pass, a supervised off-grounds pass, an unsupervised 21    off-grounds pass, or conditional release; the release on 22    an off-grounds pass; the return from an off-grounds pass; 23    transfer to another facility; conditional release; escape; 24    death; or final discharge from State custody. The 25    Department of Human Services shall establish and maintain 26    a statewide telephone number to be used by victims to make   HB3424- 27 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    notification requests under these provisions and shall 2    publicize this telephone number on its website and to the 3    State's Attorney of each county.4        (3) In the event of an escape from State custody, the 5    Department of Corrections or the Department of Juvenile 6    Justice immediately shall notify the Prisoner Review Board 7    of the escape and the Prisoner Review Board shall notify 8    the victim. The notification shall be based upon the most 9    recent information as to the victim's residence or other 10    location available to the Board. When no such information 11    is available, the Board shall make all reasonable efforts 12    to obtain the information and make the notification. When 13    the escapee is apprehended, the Department of Corrections 14    or the Department of Juvenile Justice immediately shall 15    notify the Prisoner Review Board and the Board shall 16    notify the victim.17        (4) The victim of the crime for which the prisoner has 18    been sentenced has the right to register with the Prisoner 19    Review Board's victim registry. Victims registered with 20    the Board shall receive reasonable written notice not less 21    than 30 days prior to the parole hearing or target 22    aftercare release date. The victim has the right to submit 23    a victim statement for consideration by the Prisoner 24    Review Board or the Department of Juvenile Justice in 25    writing, on film, videotape, or other electronic means, or 26    in the form of a recording prior to the parole hearing or   HB3424- 28 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    target aftercare release date, or in person at the parole 2    hearing or aftercare release protest hearing, or by 3    calling the toll-free number established in subsection (f) 4    of this Section. The victim shall be notified within 7 5    days after the prisoner has been granted parole or 6    aftercare release and shall be informed of the right to 7    inspect the registry of parole decisions, established 8    under subsection (g) of Section 3-3-5 of the Unified Code 9    of Corrections.

The Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 is 9amended by changing Section 214 as follows: 10    (750 ILCS 60/214)  (from Ch. 40, par. 2312-14)11    Sec. 214. Order of protection; remedies. 12    (a) Issuance of order. If the court finds that petitioner 13has been abused by a family or household member or that 14petitioner is a high-risk adult who has been abused, 15neglected, or exploited, as defined in this Act, an order of 16protection prohibiting the abuse, neglect, or exploitation 17shall issue; provided that petitioner must also satisfy the 18requirements of one of the following Sections, as appropriate: 19Section 217 on emergency orders, Section 218 on interim 20orders, or Section 219 on plenary orders. Petitioner shall not 21be denied an order of protection because petitioner or 22respondent is a minor. The court, when determining whether or 23not to issue an order of protection, shall not require 24physical manifestations of abuse on the person of the victim.   HB3424- 59 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1Modification and extension of prior orders of protection shall 2be in accordance with this Act.3    (b) Remedies and standards. The remedies to be included in 4an order of protection shall be determined in accordance with 5this Section and one of the following Sections, as 6appropriate: Section 217 on emergency orders, Section 218 on 7interim orders, and Section 219 on plenary orders. The 8remedies listed in this subsection shall be in addition to 9other civil or criminal remedies available to petitioner.10        (1) Prohibition of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. 11    Prohibit respondent's harassment, interference with 12    personal liberty, intimidation of a dependent, physical 13    abuse, or willful deprivation, neglect or exploitation, as 14    defined in this Act, or stalking of the petitioner, as 15    defined in Section 12-7.3 of the Criminal Code of 2012, if 16    such abuse, neglect, exploitation, or stalking has 17    occurred or otherwise appears likely to occur if not 18    prohibited.19        (2) Grant of exclusive possession of residence. 20    Prohibit respondent from entering or remaining in any 21    residence, household, or premises of the petitioner, 22    including one owned or leased by respondent, if petitioner 23    has a right to occupancy thereof. The grant of exclusive 24    possession of the residence, household, or premises shall 25    not affect title to real property, nor shall the court be 26    limited by the standard set forth in subsection (c-2) of   HB3424- 60 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    Section 501 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 2    Marriage Act.3            (A) Right to occupancy. A party has a right to 4        occupancy of a residence or household if it is solely 5        or jointly owned or leased by that party, that party's 6        spouse, a person with a legal duty to support that 7        party or a minor child in that party's care, or by any 8        person or entity other than the opposing party that 9        authorizes that party's occupancy (e.g., a domestic 10        violence shelter). Standards set forth in subparagraph 11        (B) shall not preclude equitable relief.12            (B) Presumption of hardships. If petitioner and 13        respondent each has the right to occupancy of a 14        residence or household, the court shall balance (i) 15        the hardships to respondent and any minor child or 16        dependent adult in respondent's care resulting from 17        entry of this remedy with (ii) the hardships to 18        petitioner and any minor child or dependent adult in 19        petitioner's care resulting from continued exposure to 20        the risk of abuse (should petitioner remain at the 21        residence or household) or from loss of possession of 22        the residence or household (should petitioner leave to 23        avoid the risk of abuse). When determining the balance 24        of hardships, the court shall also take into account 25        the accessibility of the residence or household. 26        Hardships need not be balanced if respondent does not   HB3424- 61 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        have a right to occupancy.2            The balance of hardships is presumed to favor 3        possession by petitioner unless the presumption is 4        rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence, showing 5        that the hardships to respondent substantially 6        outweigh the hardships to petitioner and any minor 7        child or dependent adult in petitioner's care. The 8        court, on the request of petitioner or on its own 9        motion, may order respondent to provide suitable, 10        accessible, alternate housing for petitioner instead 11        of excluding respondent from a mutual residence or 12        household.13        (3) Stay away order and additional prohibitions. Order 14    respondent to stay away from petitioner or any other 15    person protected by the order of protection, or prohibit 16    respondent from entering or remaining present at 17    petitioner's school, place of employment, or other 18    specified places at times when petitioner is present, or 19    both, if reasonable, given the balance of hardships. 20    Hardships need not be balanced for the court to enter a 21    stay away order or prohibit entry if respondent has no 22    right to enter the premises.23            (A) If an order of protection grants petitioner 24        exclusive possession of the residence, or prohibits 25        respondent from entering the residence, or orders 26        respondent to stay away from petitioner or other   HB3424- 62 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        protected persons, then the court may allow respondent 2        access to the residence to remove items of clothing 3        and personal adornment used exclusively by respondent, 4        medications, and other items as the court directs. The 5        right to access shall be exercised on only one 6        occasion as the court directs and in the presence of an 7        agreed-upon adult third party or law enforcement 8        officer.9            (B) When the petitioner and the respondent attend 10        the same public, private, or non-public elementary, 11        middle, or high school, the court when issuing an 12        order of protection and providing relief shall 13        consider the severity of the act, any continuing 14        physical danger or emotional distress to the 15        petitioner, the educational rights guaranteed to the 16        petitioner and respondent under federal and State law, 17        the availability of a transfer of the respondent to 18        another school, a change of placement or a change of 19        program of the respondent, the expense, difficulty, 20        and educational disruption that would be caused by a 21        transfer of the respondent to another school, and any 22        other relevant facts of the case. The court may order 23        that the respondent not attend the public, private, or 24        non-public elementary, middle, or high school attended 25        by the petitioner, order that the respondent accept a 26        change of placement or change of program, as   HB3424- 63 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        determined by the school district or private or 2        non-public school, or place restrictions on the 3        respondent's movements within the school attended by 4        the petitioner. The respondent bears the burden of 5        proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a 6        transfer, change of placement, or change of program of 7        the respondent is not available. The respondent also 8        bears the burden of production with respect to the 9        expense, difficulty, and educational disruption that 10        would be caused by a transfer of the respondent to 11        another school. A transfer, change of placement, or 12        change of program is not unavailable to the respondent 13        solely on the ground that the respondent does not 14        agree with the school district's or private or 15        non-public school's transfer, change of placement, or 16        change of program or solely on the ground that the 17        respondent fails or refuses to consent or otherwise 18        does not take an action required to effectuate a 19        transfer, change of placement, or change of program. 20        When a court orders a respondent to stay away from the 21        public, private, or non-public school attended by the 22        petitioner and the respondent requests a transfer to 23        another attendance center within the respondent's 24        school district or private or non-public school, the 25        school district or private or non-public school shall 26        have sole discretion to determine the attendance   HB3424- 64 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        center to which the respondent is transferred. In the 2        event the court order results in a transfer of the 3        minor respondent to another attendance center, a 4        change in the respondent's placement, or a change of 5        the respondent's program, the parents, guardian, or 6        legal custodian of the respondent is responsible for 7        transportation and other costs associated with the 8        transfer or change. 9            (C) The court may order the parents, guardian, or 10        legal custodian of a minor respondent to take certain 11        actions or to refrain from taking certain actions to 12        ensure that the respondent complies with the order. In 13        the event the court orders a transfer of the 14        respondent to another school, the parents, guardian, 15        or legal custodian of the respondent is responsible 16        for transportation and other costs associated with the 17        change of school by the respondent. 18        (4) Counseling. Require or recommend the respondent to 19    undergo counseling for a specified duration with a social 20    worker, psychologist, clinical psychologist, 21    psychiatrist, family service agency, alcohol or substance 22    abuse program, mental health center guidance counselor, 23    agency providing services to elders, program designed for 24    domestic violence abusers or any other guidance service 25    the court deems appropriate. The Court may order the 26    respondent in any intimate partner relationship to report   HB3424- 65 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    to an Illinois Department of Human Services protocol 2    approved partner abuse intervention program for an 3    assessment and to follow all recommended treatment. 4        (5) Physical care and possession of the minor child. 5    In order to protect the minor child from abuse, neglect, 6    or unwarranted separation from the person who has been the 7    minor child's primary caretaker, or to otherwise protect 8    the well-being of the minor child, the court may do either 9    or both of the following: (i) grant petitioner physical 10    care or possession of the minor child, or both, or (ii) 11    order respondent to return a minor child to, or not remove 12    a minor child from, the physical care of a parent or person 13    in loco parentis.14        If a court finds, after a hearing, that respondent has 15    committed abuse (as defined in Section 103) of a minor 16    child, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that 17    awarding physical care to respondent would not be in the 18    minor child's best interest.19        (6) Temporary allocation of parental responsibilities: 20    significant decision-making. Award temporary 21    decision-making responsibility to petitioner in accordance 22    with this Section, the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution 23    of Marriage Act, the Illinois Parentage Act of 2015, and 24    this State's Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and 25    Enforcement Act. 26        If a court finds, after a hearing, that respondent has   HB3424- 66 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    committed abuse (as defined in Section 103) of a minor 2    child, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that 3    awarding temporary significant decision-making 4    responsibility to respondent would not be in the child's 5    best interest.6        (7) Parenting time. Determine the parenting time, if 7    any, of respondent in any case in which the court awards 8    physical care or allocates temporary significant 9    decision-making responsibility of a minor child to 10    petitioner. The court shall restrict or deny respondent's 11    parenting time with a minor child if the court finds that 12    respondent has done or is likely to do any of the 13    following: (i) abuse or endanger the minor child during 14    parenting time; (ii) use the parenting time as an 15    opportunity to abuse or harass petitioner or petitioner's 16    family or household members; (iii) improperly conceal or 17    detain the minor child; or (iv) otherwise act in a manner 18    that is not in the best interests of the minor child. The 19    court shall not be limited by the standards set forth in 20    Section 603.10 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of 21    Marriage Act. If the court grants parenting time, the 22    order shall specify dates and times for the parenting time 23    to take place or other specific parameters or conditions 24    that are appropriate. No order for parenting time shall 25    refer merely to the term "reasonable parenting time".26        Petitioner may deny respondent access to the minor   HB3424- 67 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    child if, when respondent arrives for parenting time, 2    respondent is under the influence of drugs or alcohol and 3    constitutes a threat to the safety and well-being of 4    petitioner or petitioner's minor children or is behaving 5    in a violent or abusive manner.6        If necessary to protect any member of petitioner's 7    family or household from future abuse, respondent shall be 8    prohibited from coming to petitioner's residence to meet 9    the minor child for parenting time, and the parties shall 10    submit to the court their recommendations for reasonable 11    alternative arrangements for parenting time. A person may 12    be approved to supervise parenting time only after filing 13    an affidavit accepting that responsibility and 14    acknowledging accountability to the court.15        (8) Removal or concealment of minor child. Prohibit 16    respondent from removing a minor child from the State or 17    concealing the child within the State. 18        (9) Order to appear. Order the respondent to appear in 19    court, alone or with a minor child, to prevent abuse, 20    neglect, removal or concealment of the child, to return 21    the child to the custody or care of the petitioner or to 22    permit any court-ordered interview or examination of the 23    child or the respondent.24        (10) Possession of personal property. Grant petitioner 25    exclusive possession of personal property and, if 26    respondent has possession or control, direct respondent to   HB3424- 68 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    promptly make it available to petitioner, if:2            (i) petitioner, but not respondent, owns the 3        property; or4            (ii) the parties own the property jointly; sharing 5        it would risk abuse of petitioner by respondent or is 6        impracticable; and the balance of hardships favors 7        temporary possession by petitioner.8        If petitioner's sole claim to ownership of the 9    property is that it is marital property, the court may 10    award petitioner temporary possession thereof under the 11    standards of subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph only if a 12    proper proceeding has been filed under the Illinois 13    Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, as now or 14    hereafter amended.15        No order under this provision shall affect title to 16    property.17        (11) Protection of property. Forbid the respondent 18    from taking, transferring, encumbering, concealing, 19    damaging or otherwise disposing of any real or personal 20    property, except as explicitly authorized by the court, 21    if:22            (i) petitioner, but not respondent, owns the 23        property; or24            (ii) the parties own the property jointly, and the 25        balance of hardships favors granting this remedy.26        If petitioner's sole claim to ownership of the   HB3424- 69 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    property is that it is marital property, the court may 2    grant petitioner relief under subparagraph (ii) of this 3    paragraph only if a proper proceeding has been filed under 4    the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, as 5    now or hereafter amended.6        The court may further prohibit respondent from 7    improperly using the financial or other resources of an 8    aged member of the family or household for the profit or 9    advantage of respondent or of any other person.10        (11.5) Protection of animals. Grant the petitioner the 11    exclusive care, custody, or control of any animal owned, 12    possessed, leased, kept, or held by either the petitioner 13    or the respondent or a minor child residing in the 14    residence or household of either the petitioner or the 15    respondent and order the respondent to stay away from the 16    animal and forbid the respondent from taking, 17    transferring, encumbering, concealing, harming, or 18    otherwise disposing of the animal. 19        (12) Order for payment of support. Order respondent to 20    pay temporary support for the petitioner or any child in 21    the petitioner's care or over whom the petitioner has been 22    allocated parental responsibility, when the respondent has 23    a legal obligation to support that person, in accordance 24    with the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage 25    Act, which shall govern, among other matters, the amount 26    of support, payment through the clerk and withholding of   HB3424- 70 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    income to secure payment. An order for child support may 2    be granted to a petitioner with lawful physical care of a 3    child, or an order or agreement for physical care of a 4    child, prior to entry of an order allocating significant 5    decision-making responsibility. Such a support order shall 6    expire upon entry of a valid order allocating parental 7    responsibility differently and vacating the petitioner's 8    significant decision-making authority, unless otherwise 9    provided in the order.10        (13) Order for payment of losses. Order respondent to 11    pay petitioner for losses suffered as a direct result of 12    the abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Such losses shall 13    include, but not be limited to, medical expenses, lost 14    earnings or other support, repair or replacement of 15    property damaged or taken, reasonable attorney's fees, 16    court costs and moving or other travel expenses, including 17    additional reasonable expenses for temporary shelter and 18    restaurant meals.19            (i) Losses affecting family needs. If a party is 20        entitled to seek maintenance, child support or 21        property distribution from the other party under the 22        Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act, as 23        now or hereafter amended, the court may order 24        respondent to reimburse petitioner's actual losses, to 25        the extent that such reimbursement would be 26        "appropriate temporary relief", as authorized by   HB3424- 71 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        subsection (a)(3) of Section 501 of that Act.2            (ii) Recovery of expenses. In the case of an 3        improper concealment or removal of a minor child, the 4        court may order respondent to pay the reasonable 5        expenses incurred or to be incurred in the search for 6        and recovery of the minor child, including but not 7        limited to legal fees, court costs, private 8        investigator fees, and travel costs.9        (14) Prohibition of entry. Prohibit the respondent 10    from entering or remaining in the residence or household 11    while the respondent is under the influence of alcohol or 12    drugs and constitutes a threat to the safety and 13    well-being of the petitioner or the petitioner's children.14        (14.5) Prohibition of firearm possession.15            (a) Prohibit a respondent against whom an order of 16        protection was issued from possessing any firearms 17        during the duration of the order if the order:18                (1) was issued after a hearing of which such 19            person received actual notice, and at which such 20            person had an opportunity to participate;21                (2) restrains such person from harassing, 22            stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of 23            such person or child of such intimate partner or 24            person, or engaging in other conduct that would 25            place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of 26            bodily injury to the partner or child; and  HB3424- 72 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1                (3)(i) includes a finding that such person 2            represents a credible threat to the physical 3            safety of such intimate partner or child; or (ii) 4            by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, 5            attempted use, or threatened use of physical force 6            against such intimate partner or child that would 7            reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.8        Any Firearm Owner's Identification Card in the 9        possession of the respondent, except as provided in 10        subsection (b), shall be ordered by the court to be 11        turned over to the local law enforcement agency. The 12        local law enforcement agency shall immediately mail 13        the card to the Illinois State Police Firearm Owner's 14        Identification Card Office for safekeeping. The court 15        shall issue a warrant for seizure of any firearm in the 16        possession of the respondent, to be kept by the local 17        law enforcement agency for safekeeping, except as 18        provided in subsection (b). The period of safekeeping 19        shall be for the duration of the order of protection. 20        The firearm or firearms and Firearm Owner's 21        Identification Card, if unexpired, shall at the 22        respondent's request, be returned to the respondent at 23        the end of the order of protection. It is the 24        respondent's responsibility to notify the Illinois 25        State Police Firearm Owner's Identification Card 26        Office.   HB3424- 73 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1            (b) If the respondent is a peace officer as 2        defined in Section 2-13 of the Criminal Code of 2012, 3        the court shall order that any firearms used by the 4        respondent in the performance of his or her duties as a 5        peace officer be surrendered to the chief law 6        enforcement executive of the agency in which the 7        respondent is employed, who shall retain the firearms 8        for safekeeping for the duration of the order of 9        protection.10            (c) Upon expiration of the period of safekeeping, 11        if the firearms or Firearm Owner's Identification Card 12        cannot be returned to respondent because respondent 13        cannot be located, fails to respond to requests to 14        retrieve the firearms, or is not lawfully eligible to 15        possess a firearm, upon petition from the local law 16        enforcement agency, the court may order the local law 17        enforcement agency to destroy the firearms, use the 18        firearms for training purposes, or for any other 19        application as deemed appropriate by the local law 20        enforcement agency; or that the firearms be turned 21        over to a third party who is lawfully eligible to 22        possess firearms, and who does not reside with 23        respondent. 24        (15) Prohibition of access to records. If an order of 25    protection prohibits respondent from having contact with 26    the minor child, or if petitioner's address is omitted   HB3424- 74 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    under subsection (b) of Section 203, or if necessary to 2    prevent abuse or wrongful removal or concealment of a 3    minor child, the order shall deny respondent access to, 4    and prohibit respondent from inspecting, obtaining, or 5    attempting to inspect or obtain, school or any other 6    records of the minor child who is in the care of 7    petitioner.8        (16) Order for payment of shelter services. Order 9    respondent to reimburse a shelter providing temporary 10    housing and counseling services to the petitioner for the 11    cost of the services, as certified by the shelter and 12    deemed reasonable by the court.13        (17) Order for injunctive relief. Enter injunctive 14    relief necessary or appropriate to prevent further abuse 15    of a family or household member or further abuse, neglect, 16    or exploitation of a high-risk adult with disabilities or 17    to effectuate one of the granted remedies, if supported by 18    the balance of hardships. If the harm to be prevented by 19    the injunction is abuse or any other harm that one of the 20    remedies listed in paragraphs (1) through (16) of this 21    subsection is designed to prevent, no further evidence is 22    necessary that the harm is an irreparable injury.23        (18) Telephone services.24            (A) Unless a condition described in subparagraph 25        (B) of this paragraph exists, the court may, upon 26        request by the petitioner, order a wireless telephone   HB3424- 75 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        service provider to transfer to the petitioner the 2        right to continue to use a telephone number or numbers 3        indicated by the petitioner and the financial 4        responsibility associated with the number or numbers, 5        as set forth in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph. 6        For purposes of this paragraph (18), the term 7        "wireless telephone service provider" means a provider 8        of commercial mobile service as defined in 47 U.S.C. 9        332. The petitioner may request the transfer of each 10        telephone number that the petitioner, or a minor child 11        in his or her custody, uses. The clerk of the court 12        shall serve the order on the wireless telephone 13        service provider's agent for service of process 14        provided to the Illinois Commerce Commission. The 15        order shall contain all of the following:16                (i) The name and billing telephone number of 17            the account holder including the name of the 18            wireless telephone service provider that serves 19            the account.20                (ii) Each telephone number that will be 21            transferred.22                (iii) A statement that the provider transfers 23            to the petitioner all financial responsibility for 24            and right to the use of any telephone number 25            transferred under this paragraph.26            (B) A wireless telephone service provider shall   HB3424- 76 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        terminate the respondent's use of, and shall transfer 2        to the petitioner use of, the telephone number or 3        numbers indicated in subparagraph (A) of this 4        paragraph unless it notifies the petitioner, within 72 5        hours after it receives the order, that one of the 6        following applies:7                (i) The account holder named in the order has 8            terminated the account.9                (ii) A difference in network technology would 10            prevent or impair the functionality of a device on 11            a network if the transfer occurs.12                (iii) The transfer would cause a geographic or 13            other limitation on network or service provision 14            to the petitioner.15                (iv) Another technological or operational 16            issue would prevent or impair the use of the 17            telephone number if the transfer occurs.18            (C) The petitioner assumes all financial 19        responsibility for and right to the use of any 20        telephone number transferred under this paragraph. In 21        this paragraph, "financial responsibility" includes 22        monthly service costs and costs associated with any 23        mobile device associated with the number.24            (D) A wireless telephone service provider may 25        apply to the petitioner its routine and customary 26        requirements for establishing an account or   HB3424- 77 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        transferring a number, including requiring the 2        petitioner to provide proof of identification, 3        financial information, and customer preferences.4            (E) Except for willful or wanton misconduct, a 5        wireless telephone service provider is immune from 6        civil liability for its actions taken in compliance 7        with a court order issued under this paragraph.8            (F) All wireless service providers that provide 9        services to residential customers shall provide to the 10        Illinois Commerce Commission the name and address of 11        an agent for service of orders entered under this 12        paragraph (18). Any change in status of the registered 13        agent must be reported to the Illinois Commerce 14        Commission within 30 days of such change. 15            (G) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall 16        maintain the list of registered agents for service for 17        each wireless telephone service provider on the 18        Commission's website. The Commission may consult with 19        wireless telephone service providers and the Circuit 20        Court Clerks on the manner in which this information 21        is provided and displayed. 22    (c) Relevant factors; findings.23        (1) In determining whether to grant a specific remedy, 24    other than payment of support, the court shall consider 25    relevant factors, including but not limited to the 26    following:  HB3424- 78 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1            (i) the nature, frequency, severity, pattern and 2        consequences of the respondent's past abuse, neglect 3        or exploitation of the petitioner or any family or 4        household member, including the concealment of his or 5        her location in order to evade service of process or 6        notice, and the likelihood of danger of future abuse, 7        neglect, or exploitation to petitioner or any member 8        of petitioner's or respondent's family or household; 9        and10            (ii) the danger that any minor child will be 11        abused or neglected or improperly relocated from the 12        jurisdiction, improperly concealed within the State or 13        improperly separated from the child's primary 14        caretaker.15        (2) In comparing relative hardships resulting to the 16    parties from loss of possession of the family home, the 17    court shall consider relevant factors, including but not 18    limited to the following:19            (i) availability, accessibility, cost, safety, 20        adequacy, location and other characteristics of 21        alternate housing for each party and any minor child 22        or dependent adult in the party's care;23            (ii) the effect on the party's employment; and24            (iii) the effect on the relationship of the party, 25        and any minor child or dependent adult in the party's 26        care, to family, school, church and community.  HB3424- 79 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1        (3) Subject to the exceptions set forth in paragraph 2    (4) of this subsection, the court shall make its findings 3    in an official record or in writing, and shall at a minimum 4    set forth the following:5            (i) That the court has considered the applicable 6        relevant factors described in paragraphs (1) and (2) 7        of this subsection.8            (ii) Whether the conduct or actions of respondent, 9        unless prohibited, will likely cause irreparable harm 10        or continued abuse.11            (iii) Whether it is necessary to grant the 12        requested relief in order to protect petitioner or 13        other alleged abused persons.14        (4) For purposes of issuing an ex parte emergency 15    order of protection, the court, as an alternative to or as 16    a supplement to making the findings described in 17    paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(iii) of this 18    subsection, may use the following procedure:19        When a verified petition for an emergency order of 20    protection in accordance with the requirements of Sections 21    203 and 217 is presented to the court, the court shall 22    examine petitioner on oath or affirmation. An emergency 23    order of protection shall be issued by the court if it 24    appears from the contents of the petition and the 25    examination of petitioner that the averments are 26    sufficient to indicate abuse by respondent and to support   HB3424- 80 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    the granting of relief under the issuance of the emergency 2    order of protection.3        (5) Never married parties. No rights or 4    responsibilities for a minor child born outside of 5    marriage attach to a putative father until a father and 6    child relationship has been established under the Illinois 7    Parentage Act of 1984, the Illinois Parentage Act of 2015, 8    the Illinois Public Aid Code, Section 12 of the Vital 9    Records Act, the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Probate 10    Act of 1975, the Revised Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of 11    Support Act, the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, 12    the Expedited Child Support Act of 1990, any judicial, 13    administrative, or other act of another state or 14    territory, any other Illinois statute, or by any foreign 15    nation establishing the father and child relationship, any 16    other proceeding substantially in conformity with the 17    Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity 18    Reconciliation Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104-193), or where 19    both parties appeared in open court or at an 20    administrative hearing acknowledging under oath or 21    admitting by affirmation the existence of a father and 22    child relationship. Absent such an adjudication, finding, 23    or acknowledgment, no putative father shall be granted 24    temporary allocation of parental responsibilities, 25    including parenting time with the minor child, or physical 26    care and possession of the minor child, nor shall an order   HB3424- 81 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    of payment for support of the minor child be entered.2    (d) Balance of hardships; findings. If the court finds 3that the balance of hardships does not support the granting of 4a remedy governed by paragraph (2), (3), (10), (11), or (16) of 5subsection (b) of this Section, which may require such 6balancing, the court's findings shall so indicate and shall 7include a finding as to whether granting the remedy will 8result in hardship to respondent that would substantially 9outweigh the hardship to petitioner from denial of the remedy. 10The findings shall be an official record or in writing.11    (e) Denial of remedies. Denial of any remedy shall not be 12based, in whole or in part, on evidence that:13        (1) Respondent has cause for any use of force, unless 14    that cause satisfies the standards for justifiable use of 15    force provided by Article 7 of the Criminal Code of 2012;16        (2) Respondent was voluntarily intoxicated;17        (3) Petitioner acted in self-defense or defense of 18    another, provided that, if petitioner utilized force, such 19    force was justifiable under Article 7 of the Criminal Code 20    of 2012; 21        (4) Petitioner did not act in self-defense or defense 22    of another;23        (5) Petitioner left the residence or household to 24    avoid further abuse, neglect, or exploitation by 25    respondent;26        (6) Petitioner did not leave the residence or   HB3424- 82 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1    household to avoid further abuse, neglect, or exploitation 2    by respondent;3        (7) Conduct by any family or household member excused 4    the abuse, neglect, or exploitation by respondent, unless 5    that same conduct would have excused such abuse, neglect, 6    or exploitation if the parties had not been family or 7    household members.8    A petition for an order of protection may not be denied 9upon the basis that the petitioner or the respondent is 10incarcerated in a penal institution at the time of the filing 11of the petition. 12(Source: P.A. 102-538, eff. 8-20-21.)  HB3424- 83 -LRB104 08148 RLC 18196 b1 INDEX 2 Statutes amended in order of appearance 3    725 ILCS 120/4.54    730 ILCS 5/3-3-1.1 new5    730 ILCS 5/3-3-2from Ch. 38, par. 1003-3-26    730 ILCS 5/3-3-9from Ch. 38, par. 1003-3-97    730 ILCS 5/3-14-1from Ch. 38, par. 1003-14-18    750 ILCS 60/214from Ch. 40, par. 2312-14
