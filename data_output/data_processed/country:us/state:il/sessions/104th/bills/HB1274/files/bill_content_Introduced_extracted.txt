Adm. Code 890) at the expense 5of the manufactured home community owner or operator.6    For purposes of this paragraph, the manufactured home 7community owner or operator shall be considered the water 8supplier and is the party responsible for the water 9distribution system up to the individual service line at each 10manufactured home site. The owner or operator shall be 11responsible for all maintenance and associated costs of any 12meters and submeters installed outside and beneath a 13manufactured home within the community. This paragraph shall 14not apply to any manufactured home community that has its own 15water source, including, but not limited to, a well. 16    (h) Water and sewer utilities; low usage.

Each 22public utility that provides water and sewer service must 23offer separate rates for water and sewer service to any 24commercial or residential customer who uses separate meters to 25measure each of those services. In order for the separate rate 26to apply, a combination of meters must be used to measure the   HB1274- 9 -LRB104 06228 AAS 16263 b1amount of water that reaches the sewer system and the amount of 2water that does not reach the sewer system.3    (j) Each water or sewer public utility must disclose on 4each billing statement any amount billed that is for service 5provided prior to the date covered by the billing statement. 6The disclosure must include the dates for which the prior 7service is being billed.

The rate for interest 18shall be at the appropriate rate determined by the Commission 19under 83 Ill. Adm. Code 280.70.20    (l) Water and sewer public utilities; subcontractors. The 21Commission shall adopt rules for water and sewer public 22utilities to provide notice to the customers of the proper 23kind of identification that a subcontractor must present to 24the customer, to prohibit a subcontractor from soliciting or 25receiving payment of any kind for any service provided by the 26water or sewer public utility or the subcontractor, and to   HB1274- 10 -LRB104 06228 AAS 16263 b1establish sanctions for violations.2    (m) Water and sewer public utilities; unaccounted-for 3water. By December 31, 2006, each water public utility shall 4file tariffs with the Commission to establish the maximum 5percentage of unaccounted-for water that would be considered 6in the determination of any rates or surcharges. The rates or 7surcharges approved for a water public utility shall not 8include charges for unaccounted-for water in excess of this 9maximum percentage without well-documented support and 10justification for the Commission to consider in any request to 11recover charges in excess of the tariffed maximum percentage.12    (n) Rate increases; public forums. When any public utility 13providing water or sewer service proposes a general rate 14increase, in addition to other notice requirements, the water 15or sewer public utility must notify its customers of their 16right to request a public forum. A customer or group of 17customers must make written request to the Commission for a 18public forum and must also provide written notification of the 19request to the customer's municipal or, for unincorporated 20areas, township government. The Commission, at its discretion, 21may schedule the public forum. If it is determined that public 22forums are required for multiple municipalities or townships, 23the Commission shall schedule these public forums, in 24locations within approximately 45 minutes drive time of the 25municipalities or townships for which the public forums have 26been scheduled. The public utility must provide advance notice   HB1274- 11 -LRB104 06228 AAS 16263 b1of 30 days for each public forum to the governing bodies of 2those units of local government affected by the increase. The 3day of each public forum shall be selected so as to encourage 4the greatest public participation. Each public forum will 5begin at 7:00 p.m. Reports and comments made during or as a 6result of each public forum must be made available to the 7hearing officials and reviewed when drafting a recommended or 8tentative decision, finding or order pursuant to Section 910-111 of this Act.10(Source: P.A. 94-950, eff. 6-27-06.)
