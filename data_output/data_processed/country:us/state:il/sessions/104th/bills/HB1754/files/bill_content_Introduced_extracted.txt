Symptoms of 13AGS occur after people eat red meat or are exposed to other 14products made from mammals. Because of this, AGS is also known 15as the red meat allergy or tick bite meat allergy. The Centers 16for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified AGS as 17a growing threat to clinical and public health and has 18identified state-level surveillance of AGS as a critical need. 19The CDC has identified Illinois as a state with one of the 20highest AGS prevalence rates in the nation. Additionally, the 21General Assembly finds that even after enactment of the Lyme 22disease Prevention and Protection Act, cases of Lyme disease 23remain underreported in Illinois.   HB1754- 2 -LRB104 05061 BDA 15089 b1    Section 10.
