The Illinois Public Aid Code is amended by 4changing Section 9A-11 as follows: 5    (305 ILCS 5/9A-11)  (from Ch. 23, par. 9A-11)6    Sec. 9A-11. Child care. 7    (a) The General Assembly recognizes that families with 8children need child care in order to work. Child care is 9expensive and families with limited access to economic 10resources, including those who are transitioning from welfare 11to work, often struggle to pay the costs of day care. The 12General Assembly understands the importance of helping working 13families with limited access to economic resources become and 14remain self-sufficient. The General Assembly also believes 15that it is the responsibility of families to share in the costs 16of child care. It is also the preference of the General 17Assembly that all working families with limited access to 18economic resources should be treated equally, regardless of 19their welfare status.20    (b) To the extent resources permit, the Illinois 21Department shall provide child care services to parents or 22other relatives as defined by rule who are working or 23participating in employment or Department approved education 24or training programs. At a minimum, the Illinois Department   10400SB1120sam001- 9 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1shall cover the following categories of families:2        (1) recipients of TANF under Article IV participating 3    in work and training activities as specified in the 4    personal plan for employment and self-sufficiency;5        (2) families transitioning from TANF to work;6        (3) families at risk of becoming recipients of TANF;7        (4) families with special needs as defined by rule;8        (5) working families with very low incomes as defined 9    by rule;10        (6) families that are not recipients of TANF and that 11    need child care assistance to participate in education and 12    training activities; 13        (7) youth in care, as defined in Section 4d of the 14    Children and Family Services Act, who are parents, 15    regardless of income or whether they are working or 16    participating in Department-approved employment or 17    education or training programs. Any family that receives 18    child care assistance in accordance with this paragraph 19    shall receive one additional 12-month child care 20    eligibility period after the parenting youth in care's 21    case with the Department of Children and Family Services 22    is closed, regardless of income or whether the parenting 23    youth in care is working or participating in 24    Department-approved employment or education or training 25    programs;26        (8) families receiving Extended Family Support Program   10400SB1120sam001- 10 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1    services from the Department of Children and Family 2    Services, regardless of income or whether they are working 3    or participating in Department-approved employment or 4    education or training programs; and5        (9) families with children under the age of 5 who have 6    an open intact family services case with the Department of 7    Children and Family Services. Any family that receives 8    child care assistance in accordance with this paragraph 9    shall remain eligible for child care assistance 6 months 10    after the child's intact family services case is closed, 11    regardless of whether the child's parents or other 12    relatives as defined by rule are working or participating 13    in Department approved employment or education or training 14    programs. The Department of Early Childhood, in 15    consultation with the Department of Children and Family 16    Services, shall adopt rules to protect the privacy of 17    families who are the subject of an open intact family 18    services case when such families enroll in child care 19    services. Additional rules shall be adopted to offer 20    children who have an open intact family services case the 21    opportunity to receive an Early Intervention screening and 22    other services that their families may be eligible for as 23    provided by the Department of Human Services. 24    Beginning October 1, 2027, and every October 1 thereafter, 25the Department of Children and Family Services shall report to 26the General Assembly on the number of children who received   10400SB1120sam001- 11 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1child care via vouchers paid for by the Department of Early 2Childhood during the preceding fiscal year. The report shall 3include the ages of children who received child care, the type 4of child care they received, and the number of months they 5received child care. 6    The Department shall specify by rule the conditions of 7eligibility, the application process, and the types, amounts, 8and duration of services. Eligibility for child care benefits 9and the amount of child care provided may vary based on family 10size, income, and other factors as specified by rule.11    The Department shall update the Child Care Assistance 12Program Eligibility Calculator posted on its website to 13include a question on whether a family is applying for child 14care assistance for the first time or is applying for a 15redetermination of eligibility. 16    A family's eligibility for child care services shall be 17redetermined no sooner than 12 months following the initial 18determination or most recent redetermination. During the 1912-month periods, the family shall remain eligible for child 20care services regardless of (i) a change in family income, 21unless family income exceeds 85% of State median income, or 22(ii) a temporary change in the ongoing status of the parents or 23other relatives, as defined by rule, as working or attending a 24job training or educational program. 25    In determining income eligibility for child care benefits, 26the Department annually, at the beginning of each fiscal year,   10400SB1120sam001- 12 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1shall establish, by rule, one income threshold for each family 2size, in relation to percentage of State median income for a 3family of that size, that makes families with incomes below 4the specified threshold eligible for assistance and families 5with incomes above the specified threshold ineligible for 6assistance. Through and including fiscal year 2007, the 7specified threshold must be no less than 50% of the 8then-current State median income for each family size. 9Beginning in fiscal year 2008, the specified threshold must be 10no less than 185% of the then-current federal poverty level 11for each family size. Notwithstanding any other provision of 12law or administrative rule to the contrary, beginning in 13fiscal year 2019, the specified threshold for working families 14with very low incomes as defined by rule must be no less than 15185% of the then-current federal poverty level for each family 16size. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or 17administrative rule to the contrary, beginning in State fiscal 18year 2022 through State fiscal year 2023, the specified income 19threshold shall be no less than 200% of the then-current 20federal poverty level for each family size. Beginning in State 21fiscal year 2024, the specified income threshold shall be no 22less than 225% of the then-current federal poverty level for 23each family size. Beginning in State fiscal year 2026, the 24specified income threshold shall be no less than 250% of the 25then-current federal poverty level for each family size. 26    In determining eligibility for assistance, the Department   10400SB1120sam001- 13 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1shall not give preference to any category of recipients or 2give preference to individuals based on their receipt of 3benefits under this Code.4    Nothing in this Section shall be construed as conferring 5entitlement status to eligible families.6    The Illinois Department is authorized to lower income 7eligibility ceilings, raise parent co-payments, create waiting 8lists, or take such other actions during a fiscal year as are 9necessary to ensure that child care benefits paid under this 10Article do not exceed the amounts appropriated for those child 11care benefits. These changes may be accomplished by emergency 12rule under Section 5-45 of the Illinois Administrative 13Procedure Act, except that the limitation on the number of 14emergency rules that may be adopted in a 24-month period shall 15not apply.16    The Illinois Department may contract with other State 17agencies or child care organizations for the administration of 18child care services.19    (c) Payment shall be made for child care that otherwise 20meets the requirements of this Section and applicable 21standards of State and local law and regulation, including any 22requirements the Illinois Department promulgates by rule. 23Through June 30, 2026, the rules of this Section include 24licensure requirements adopted by the Department of Children 25and Family Services. On and after July 1, 2026, the rules of 26this Section include licensure requirements adopted by the   10400SB1120sam001- 14 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1Department of Early Childhood.

The State shall engage in collective 23bargaining with an exclusive representative of child and day 24care home providers participating in the child care assistance 25program concerning their terms and conditions of employment 26that are within the State's control. Nothing in this   10400SB1120sam001- 15 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1subsection shall be understood to limit the right of families 2receiving services defined in this Section to select child and 3day care home providers or supervise them within the limits of 4this Section.

The co-payment 21shall be based on family income and family size and may be 22based on other factors as appropriate. Co-payments may be 23waived for families whose incomes are at or below the federal 24poverty level.25    (d-5) The Illinois Department, in consultation with its 26Child Care and Development Advisory Council, shall develop a   10400SB1120sam001- 16 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1plan to revise the child care assistance program's co-payment 2scale. The plan shall be completed no later than February 1, 32008, and shall include:4        (1) findings as to the percentage of income that the 5    average American family spends on child care and the 6    relative amounts that low-income families and the average 7    American family spend on other necessities of life; 8        (2) recommendations for revising the child care 9    co-payment scale to assure that families receiving child 10    care services from the Department are paying no more than 11    they can reasonably afford;12        (3) recommendations for revising the child care 13    co-payment scale to provide at-risk children with complete 14    access to Preschool for All and Head Start; and15        (4) recommendations for changes in child care program 16    policies that affect the affordability of child care. 17    (e) (Blank).18    (f) The Illinois Department shall, by rule, set rates to 19be paid for the various types of child care.

The Illinois Public Aid Code is amended by 4changing Section 9A-11 as follows: 5    (305 ILCS 5/9A-11)  (from Ch. 23, par. 9A-11)6    Sec. 9A-11. Child care. 7    (a) The General Assembly recognizes that families with 8children need child care in order to work. Child care is 9expensive and families with limited access to economic 10resources, including those who are transitioning from welfare 11to work, often struggle to pay the costs of day care. The 12General Assembly understands the importance of helping working 13families with limited access to economic resources become and 14remain self-sufficient. The General Assembly also believes 15that it is the responsibility of families to share in the costs 16of child care. It is also the preference of the General 17Assembly that all working families with limited access to 18economic resources should be treated equally, regardless of 19their welfare status.20    (b) To the extent resources permit, the Illinois 21Department shall provide child care services to parents or 22other relatives as defined by rule who are working or 23participating in employment or Department approved education 24or training programs. At a minimum, the Illinois Department   10400SB1120sam001- 9 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1shall cover the following categories of families:2        (1) recipients of TANF under Article IV participating 3    in work and training activities as specified in the 4    personal plan for employment and self-sufficiency;5        (2) families transitioning from TANF to work;6        (3) families at risk of becoming recipients of TANF;7        (4) families with special needs as defined by rule;8        (5) working families with very low incomes as defined 9    by rule;10        (6) families that are not recipients of TANF and that 11    need child care assistance to participate in education and 12    training activities; 13        (7) youth in care, as defined in Section 4d of the 14    Children and Family Services Act, who are parents, 15    regardless of income or whether they are working or 16    participating in Department-approved employment or 17    education or training programs. Any family that receives 18    child care assistance in accordance with this paragraph 19    shall receive one additional 12-month child care 20    eligibility period after the parenting youth in care's 21    case with the Department of Children and Family Services 22    is closed, regardless of income or whether the parenting 23    youth in care is working or participating in 24    Department-approved employment or education or training 25    programs;26        (8) families receiving Extended Family Support Program   10400SB1120sam001- 10 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1    services from the Department of Children and Family 2    Services, regardless of income or whether they are working 3    or participating in Department-approved employment or 4    education or training programs; and5        (9) families with children under the age of 5 who have 6    an open intact family services case with the Department of 7    Children and Family Services. Any family that receives 8    child care assistance in accordance with this paragraph 9    shall remain eligible for child care assistance 6 months 10    after the child's intact family services case is closed, 11    regardless of whether the child's parents or other 12    relatives as defined by rule are working or participating 13    in Department approved employment or education or training 14    programs. The Department of Early Childhood, in 15    consultation with the Department of Children and Family 16    Services, shall adopt rules to protect the privacy of 17    families who are the subject of an open intact family 18    services case when such families enroll in child care 19    services. Additional rules shall be adopted to offer 20    children who have an open intact family services case the 21    opportunity to receive an Early Intervention screening and 22    other services that their families may be eligible for as 23    provided by the Department of Human Services. 24    Beginning October 1, 2027, and every October 1 thereafter, 25the Department of Children and Family Services shall report to 26the General Assembly on the number of children who received   10400SB1120sam001- 11 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1child care via vouchers paid for by the Department of Early 2Childhood during the preceding fiscal year. The report shall 3include the ages of children who received child care, the type 4of child care they received, and the number of months they 5received child care. 6    The Department shall specify by rule the conditions of 7eligibility, the application process, and the types, amounts, 8and duration of services. Eligibility for child care benefits 9and the amount of child care provided may vary based on family 10size, income, and other factors as specified by rule.11    The Department shall update the Child Care Assistance 12Program Eligibility Calculator posted on its website to 13include a question on whether a family is applying for child 14care assistance for the first time or is applying for a 15redetermination of eligibility. 16    A family's eligibility for child care services shall be 17redetermined no sooner than 12 months following the initial 18determination or most recent redetermination. During the 1912-month periods, the family shall remain eligible for child 20care services regardless of (i) a change in family income, 21unless family income exceeds 85% of State median income, or 22(ii) a temporary change in the ongoing status of the parents or 23other relatives, as defined by rule, as working or attending a 24job training or educational program. 25    In determining income eligibility for child care benefits, 26the Department annually, at the beginning of each fiscal year,   10400SB1120sam001- 12 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1shall establish, by rule, one income threshold for each family 2size, in relation to percentage of State median income for a 3family of that size, that makes families with incomes below 4the specified threshold eligible for assistance and families 5with incomes above the specified threshold ineligible for 6assistance. Through and including fiscal year 2007, the 7specified threshold must be no less than 50% of the 8then-current State median income for each family size. 9Beginning in fiscal year 2008, the specified threshold must be 10no less than 185% of the then-current federal poverty level 11for each family size. Notwithstanding any other provision of 12law or administrative rule to the contrary, beginning in 13fiscal year 2019, the specified threshold for working families 14with very low incomes as defined by rule must be no less than 15185% of the then-current federal poverty level for each family 16size. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or 17administrative rule to the contrary, beginning in State fiscal 18year 2022 through State fiscal year 2023, the specified income 19threshold shall be no less than 200% of the then-current 20federal poverty level for each family size. Beginning in State 21fiscal year 2024, the specified income threshold shall be no 22less than 225% of the then-current federal poverty level for 23each family size. Beginning in State fiscal year 2026, the 24specified income threshold shall be no less than 250% of the 25then-current federal poverty level for each family size. 26    In determining eligibility for assistance, the Department   10400SB1120sam001- 13 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1shall not give preference to any category of recipients or 2give preference to individuals based on their receipt of 3benefits under this Code.4    Nothing in this Section shall be construed as conferring 5entitlement status to eligible families.6    The Illinois Department is authorized to lower income 7eligibility ceilings, raise parent co-payments, create waiting 8lists, or take such other actions during a fiscal year as are 9necessary to ensure that child care benefits paid under this 10Article do not exceed the amounts appropriated for those child 11care benefits. These changes may be accomplished by emergency 12rule under Section 5-45 of the Illinois Administrative 13Procedure Act, except that the limitation on the number of 14emergency rules that may be adopted in a 24-month period shall 15not apply.16    The Illinois Department may contract with other State 17agencies or child care organizations for the administration of 18child care services.19    (c) Payment shall be made for child care that otherwise 20meets the requirements of this Section and applicable 21standards of State and local law and regulation, including any 22requirements the Illinois Department promulgates by rule. 23Through June 30, 2026, the rules of this Section include 24licensure requirements adopted by the Department of Children 25and Family Services. On and after July 1, 2026, the rules of 26this Section include licensure requirements adopted by the   10400SB1120sam001- 14 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1Department of Early Childhood. In addition, the regulations of 2this Section include the Fire Prevention and Safety 3requirements promulgated by the Office of the State Fire 4Marshal, and is provided in any of the following:5        (1) a child care center which is licensed or exempt 6    from licensure pursuant to Section 2.09 of the Child Care 7    Act of 1969;8        (2) a licensed child care home or home exempt from 9    licensing;10        (3) a licensed group child care home;11        (4) other types of child care, including child care 12    provided by relatives or persons living in the same home 13    as the child, as determined by the Illinois Department by 14    rule.15    (c-5) Solely for the purposes of coverage under the 16Illinois Public Labor Relations Act, child and day care home 17providers, including licensed and license exempt, 18participating in the Department's child care assistance 19program shall be considered to be public employees and the 20State of Illinois shall be considered to be their employer as 21of January 1, 2006 (the effective date of Public Act 94-320), 22but not before. The State shall engage in collective 23bargaining with an exclusive representative of child and day 24care home providers participating in the child care assistance 25program concerning their terms and conditions of employment 26that are within the State's control. Nothing in this   10400SB1120sam001- 15 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1subsection shall be understood to limit the right of families 2receiving services defined in this Section to select child and 3day care home providers or supervise them within the limits of 4this Section. The State shall not be considered to be the 5employer of child and day care home providers for any purposes 6not specifically provided in Public Act 94-320, including, but 7not limited to, purposes of vicarious liability in tort and 8purposes of statutory retirement or health insurance benefits. 9Child and day care home providers shall not be covered by the 10State Employees Group Insurance Act of 1971.11    In according child and day care home providers and their 12selected representative rights under the Illinois Public Labor 13Relations Act, the State intends that the State action 14exemption to application of federal and State antitrust laws 15be fully available to the extent that their activities are 16authorized by Public Act 94-320. 17    (d) The Illinois Department shall establish, by rule, a 18co-payment scale that provides for cost sharing by families 19that receive child care services, including parents whose only 20income is from assistance under this Code. The co-payment 21shall be based on family income and family size and may be 22based on other factors as appropriate. Co-payments may be 23waived for families whose incomes are at or below the federal 24poverty level.25    (d-5) The Illinois Department, in consultation with its 26Child Care and Development Advisory Council, shall develop a   10400SB1120sam001- 16 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1plan to revise the child care assistance program's co-payment 2scale. The plan shall be completed no later than February 1, 32008, and shall include:4        (1) findings as to the percentage of income that the 5    average American family spends on child care and the 6    relative amounts that low-income families and the average 7    American family spend on other necessities of life; 8        (2) recommendations for revising the child care 9    co-payment scale to assure that families receiving child 10    care services from the Department are paying no more than 11    they can reasonably afford;12        (3) recommendations for revising the child care 13    co-payment scale to provide at-risk children with complete 14    access to Preschool for All and Head Start; and15        (4) recommendations for changes in child care program 16    policies that affect the affordability of child care. 17    (e) (Blank).18    (f) The Illinois Department shall, by rule, set rates to 19be paid for the various types of child care. Child care may be 20provided through one of the following methods:21        (1) arranging the child care through eligible 22    providers by use of purchase of service contracts or 23    vouchers;24        (2) arranging with other agencies and community 25    volunteer groups for non-reimbursed child care;26        (3) (blank); or  10400SB1120sam001- 17 -LRB104 05456 AAS 24992 a1        (4) adopting such other arrangements as the Department 2    determines appropriate.3    (f-1) Within 30 days after June 4, 2018 (the effective 4date of Public Act 100-587), the Department of Human Services 5shall establish rates for child care providers that are no 6less than the rates in effect on January 1, 2018 increased by 74.26%. 8    (f-5) (Blank).9    (g) Families eligible for assistance under this Section 10shall be given the following options:11        (1) receiving a child care certificate issued by the 12    Department or a subcontractor of the Department that may 13    be used by the parents as payment for child care and 14    development services only; or15        (2) if space is available, enrolling the child with a 16    child care provider that has a purchase of service 17    contract with the Department or a subcontractor of the 18    Department for the provision of child care and development 19    services.
