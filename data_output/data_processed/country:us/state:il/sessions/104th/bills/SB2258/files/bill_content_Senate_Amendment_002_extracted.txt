Amend Senate Bill 2258, AS AMENDED, 3by replacing everything after the enacting clause with the 4following: 5    "Section 1. Short title. This Act may be referred to as the 6Thermal Energy Network and Jobs Act. 7    Section 5. Legislative findings and intent.8    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that:9        (1) This State has a strong interest in ensuring that 10    emissions of greenhouse gases from buildings are reduced 11    because buildings are one of this State's largest sources 12    of greenhouse gases due to the combustion of fossil fuels 13    for heating, domestic hot water production, cooking, and 14    other end uses.15        (2) The decarbonization of buildings must be pursued 16    in a manner that is affordable and accessible, preserves   10400SB2258sam002- 2 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1    and creates living-wage jobs, and retains the knowledge 2    and experience of the existing utility union workforce.3        (3) Thermal energy networks have the potential to 4    decarbonize buildings at the community and utility scale 5    and help achieve the goals of Public Act 102-662 (also 6    known as the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act).7        (4) Thermal energy networks consist of pipe loops 8    between multiple buildings and energy sources, which carry 9    water and can be connected to by building owners to 10    support heating and cooling and hot water services. 11    Building owners can connect to the loops to support water 12    heating and cooling and hot water services.13        (5) Many utilities in this State have been seeking to 14    develop thermal energy networks but have encountered legal 15    and regulatory barriers.16        (6) This State has a strong interest in ensuring an 17    adequate supply of reliable electrical power and, 18    therefore, needs to promote the development of alternative 19    power sources and take steps to assure reliable 20    deliverability. Thermal energy networks are highly 21    efficient because they use and exchange thermal energy 22    from many underground sources and buildings, including 23    recycled thermal energy, which minimizes impacts on the 24    electricity grid.25        (7) Access to thermal energy networks has the 26    potential to reduce the upfront and operating costs of   10400SB2258sam002- 3 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1    building electrification for customers.2        (8) Thermal loop technology provides benefits to 3    participants and non-participants alike, including 4    societal benefits to the environment and the market 5    benefits associated with the reduction of both the volume 6    and peak demand of electricity and natural gas.7        (9) A utility's access to capital, the utility's 8    experience with networked infrastructure in public 9    rights-of-way, and the requirement that the utility serve 10    all customers positions the utility well to develop and 11    scale thermal energy networks that are accessible to all 12    customers and to coordinate the development of thermal 13    energy networks with any orderly rightsizing of the 14    utility gas system.15        (10) This State also has an interest in the efficient 16    and reliable delivery of energy and the energy 17    infrastructure of the State, which interest is 18    acknowledged throughout the Public Utilities Act. Utility 19    corporations and other power suppliers share these 20    interests and, moreover, have a duty to protect 21    proprietary interests in the projects they fund. Such 22    investments of ratepayer resources can be protected by 23    establishing effective contractor qualification and 24    performance standards, including requirements for 25    prevailing wage rates, bona fide apprenticeship criteria, 26    and project labor agreements.  10400SB2258sam002- 4 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1        (11) The construction industry is highly skilled and 2    labor intensive, and the installation of modern thermal 3    energy networks involves particularly complex work. 4    Therefore, effective qualification standards for craft 5    labor personnel employed on these projects are critically 6    needed to promote successful project delivery.7        (12) Finally, these findings are especially vital now 8    because the construction industry is experiencing 9    widespread skill shortages across the country, which are 10    crippling existing capital projects and threatening 11    projects planned for the future. The construction of 12    thermal energy networks will utilize many of the same 13    skills that the current utility and building trades 14    workforces already possess.15    (b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that passage 16of this Act is for the following purposes:17        (1) to remove the legal barriers to utility 18    development of thermal energy networks and require the 19    Illinois Commerce Commission, within 90 days after the 20    effective date of this amendatory Act of the 104th General 21    Assembly, to begin to authorize and direct utilities to 22    immediately commence piloting thermal energy networks in 23    each and every utility territory;24        (2) to direct and authorize the Illinois Commerce 25    Commission to develop a regulatory structure for utility 26    thermal energy networks that scales affordable and   10400SB2258sam002- 5 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1    accessible building electrification, protects customers, 2    and balances the role of incumbent monopoly utilities with 3    other market and public actors;4        (3) to promote the successful planning and delivery of 5    thermal energy networks and protect critical investments 6    in such projects by requiring the use of appropriate 7    quality craft labor policies that ensure the development 8    of and access to an adequate supply of well trained, 9    highly skilled craft persons needed to support timely, 10    reliable, high-quality projects;11        (4) to promote strong economic development and good 12    jobs for local residents in the expanding decarbonized 13    sector by requiring application of progressive State labor 14    and employment policies that ensure public utility 15    investments and related State subsidies create 16    unparalleled skill training and employment opportunities 17    for residents in project areas through the use of local 18    prevailing wage standards and successful, bona fide 19    apprenticeship programs or project labor agreements that 20    incorporate prevailing wage and training standards and 21    provide additional benefits for project owners and 22    workers; and23        (5) to promote the use of preapprenticeship programs 24    that will fortify and expand existing apprenticeship 25    programs through systematic outreach efforts to recruit 26    and assist persons from underrepresented and low income   10400SB2258sam002- 6 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1    communities by providing such persons with remedial 2    education, social services, and unique opportunities for 3    direct access into high-quality apprenticeship programs 4    and gainful employment in the growing building 5    decarbonization workforce. 6    Section 10. The Public Utilities Act is amended by 7changing Section 3-101 and by adding Sections 3-128, 3-129, 83-130, 3-131, and 8-513 as follows: 9    (220 ILCS 5/3-101)  (from Ch. 111 2/3, par. 3-101)10    Sec. 3-101.

Pilot thermal energy network development. 21    (a) Within 10 months after the effective date of this 22amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, every gas public 23utility or combination public utility serving over 100,000   10400SB2258sam002- 8 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1customers shall file with the Commission a petition seeking 2Commission approval of a proposed pilot thermal energy network 3project. A gas public utility or combination public utility 4may seek Commission approval of one additional proposed pilot 5thermal energy network project each year for 2 years after the 6effective date of this amendatory Act of the 104th General 7Assembly. Designs for the projects should coordinate and 8maximize the value of existing State energy efficiency and 9weatherization programs and take advantage of federal funding 10opportunities to the extent practicable. No later than 18 11months after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 12104th General Assembly, the Commission shall enter an order 13approving, approving with modification, or rejecting each 14proposed pilot thermal energy network project and shall direct 15the public utility to implement the pilot thermal energy 16network projects as approved or approved as modified. In 17considering whether to approve or approve as modified each 18pilot thermal energy network project, the Commission shall 19consider whether the pilot thermal energy network project is 20in the public interest, whether the pilot thermal energy 21network project will develop information useful for the 22Commission in adopting rules governing thermal energy 23networks, whether the pilot thermal energy network project 24furthers climate justice and emissions reduction, whether the 25pilot thermal energy network project advances financial and 26technical approaches to equitable and affordable building   10400SB2258sam002- 9 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1electrification, and whether the pilot thermal energy network 2project creates benefits to customers and society at large, 3including, but not limited to, public health benefits in areas 4with disproportionate environmental or public health burdens, 5job retention and creation, reliability, and increased 6affordability of renewable thermal energy options. After the 7filing of a petition, a utility may request the Commission to 8grant additional time for pilot development approval, which 9shall be approved for at least 6 months upon request or up to 1012 months upon a showing that additional time would benefit 11pilot development. An electric public utility may also propose 12a pilot thermal energy network project in accordance with this 13subsection (a). 14    (b) If a utility proposes 3 pilot thermal energy network 15projects, at least one project shall be proposed in 16economically disadvantaged communities as defined in Section 175-35 of the Energy Transition Act and at least one shall 18include an industrial heat application that may additionally 19include residential and commercial applications. Priority 20shall be given to pilot proposals that replace leak-prone 21natural gas distribution infrastructure with distribution 22infrastructure that supplies non-combusting thermal energy or 23that replaces thermal energy for buildings currently heated 24with electric resistance heat. Each public utility shall 25coordinate with other public utilities and consultants with 26expertise on successful pilot projects to ensure that the   10400SB2258sam002- 10 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1pilot projects are diverse and designed to inform the 2Commission's decisions in the proceeding on the various 3ownership, market, and rate structures for thermal energy 4networks. The pilot project proposals shall be made publicly 5available on the Commission's website. Utilities are 6encouraged to develop plans that enable and facilitate access 7to thermal loop technology benefits, including access by low 8and moderate income households. As part of any pilot project 9proposed pursuant to this Section, a public utility subject to 10this Section may propose to include customer rebates and 11incentives, and associated tariffs and proposed regulatory 12treatment, in a manner similar to what is included in 13Commission-approved electric energy efficiency plans pursuant 14to Section 8-103B of this Act. 15    (b-5) Each public utility proposing a pilot thermal energy 16network project shall hold at least one prefiling public 17meeting to receive public comment concerning the proposed 18thermal energy network in the municipality where the thermal 19energy network is to be located. Notice of the public meeting 20shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation for 3 21consecutive weeks, beginning no earlier than one month prior 22to the first public meeting. Notice of the public meeting, 23including a description of the thermal energy network, must be 24provided in writing to the clerk of the county where the 25project is to be located and to the chief clerk of the 26Commission. A representative of the Commission shall be   10400SB2258sam002- 11 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1invited to each prefiling public meeting. 2    (c) Any gas public utility, electric public utility, or 3combination public utility constructing or operating a 4Commission-approved pilot thermal energy network project shall 5report to the Commission, on a quarterly basis and until 6completion of the pilot thermal energy network project, as 7determined by the Commission, the status of each pilot thermal 8energy network project. The Commission shall post and make 9publicly available the reports on its website. The report 10shall include, but not be limited to: 11        (1) the stage of development of each pilot project; 12        (2) the barriers to development; 13        (3) the number of customers served; 14        (4) the costs of the pilot project; 15        (5) the number of jobs retained or created by the 16    pilot project; and 17        (6) other information the Commission deems to be in 18    the public interest or considers likely to prove useful or 19    relevant to the rulemaking described in subsection (h).20    (c-5) The Commission shall require projects submitted to 21the utility-scale renewable thermal energy network program for 22approval to include a proposed rate structure for thermal 23energy services supplied to network end users and consumer 24protection plans for end users. The Commission may approve the 25proposed rate structure if the projected heating and cooling 26costs for end users is not greater than the heating and cooling   10400SB2258sam002- 12 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1costs the end users would have incurred if the end users had 2not participated in the program. 3    (d) Any gas public utility, electric public utility, or 4combination public utility constructing or operating a 5Commission-approved pilot thermal energy network project shall 6demonstrate that it has entered into a labor peace agreement 7with a bona fide labor organization that is actively engaged 8in representing its employees. The labor peace agreement shall 9apply to the employees necessary for the ongoing maintenance 10and operation of the thermal energy network. The labor peace 11agreement shall be an ongoing material condition of 12authorization to maintain and operate the thermal energy 13networks. 14    (e) Any contractor or subcontractor that performs work on 15a pilot thermal energy network under this Section shall be a 16responsible bidder as described in Section 30-22 of the 17Illinois Procurement Code and shall certify that not less than 18prevailing wage, as determined under the Prevailing Wage Act, 19was or will be paid to employees who are engaged in 20construction activities associated with the pilot thermal 21energy network project. The contractor or subcontractor shall 22submit evidence to the Commission that it complied with the 23requirements of this subsection. 24    (f) For any pending application for a thermal energy 25network, the contractor or subcontractor shall submit evidence 26that the contractor or subcontractor has entered into a fully   10400SB2258sam002- 13 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1executed project labor agreement with the applicable local 2building trades council for the front-of-meter and 3behind-the-meter work required for the thermal energy network. 4The Commission shall not approve any pending applications 5until the contractor or subcontractor has submitted the 6information required under this subsection. 7    (g) Within 4 years after the effective date of this 8amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly, the Commission 9shall adopt rules to, at a minimum: 10        (1) create fair market access rules for thermal energy 11    networks to accept thermal energy and that do not increase 12    greenhouse gas emissions or copollutants; 13        (2) to the extent it is in the public interest to do 14    so, exempt small-scale thermal energy networks from active 15    regulation by the Commission; 16        (3) promote the training and transition of utility 17    workers impacted by this amendatory Act of the 104th 18    General Assembly; and 19        (4) encourage third-party participation and 20    competition where it will maximize benefits to customers. 21    (h) A gas public utility or combination public utility 22required to develop any pilot thermal energy network project 23under this Section shall be permitted to recover all 24reasonable and prudently incurred costs associated with the 25development, construction, and operation of one or more pilot 26thermal energy network projects through general rates set   10400SB2258sam002- 14 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1pursuant to Section 9-201 or through rates set in a Multi-Year 2Rate Plan pursuant to Section 16-108.18. A gas public utility, 3electric public utility, or combination public utility 4developing a thermal energy network project that includes an 5industrial heat application may recover rates proportionally 6from each class of customer. The Commission shall have broad 7discretion in approving proposed pilot projects that are 8consistent with the public interest consistent with this 9Section and in approving all tariffs and issuing other 10regulatory approvals as necessary to permit a pilot program 11that facilitates a full review of technologies, and associated 12policies, with respect to thermal network technology in this 13State. An electric utility or a utility that offers both gas 14and electric service that is required to submit an integrated 15grid plan shall include any proposed pilot programs under this 16Section as part of the proposed grid plan pursuant to Section 1716-105.17 and shall inform stakeholders of the proposed pilot 18programs during the stakeholder process that precedes the 19filing of the grid plan. Any obligation imposed by this 20Section on a utility shall be suspended pending a review of the 21proposed grid planning process. If the Commission (i) 22determines that the investments required to comply with this 23Section impair customer affordability or (ii) does not approve 24the proposed pilot programs, the requirements of this 25subsection (i) shall be suspended until the Commission 26approves recovery under a proposed pilot program in a future   10400SB2258sam002- 15 -LRB104 12071 AAS 25132 a1integrated grid plan or Multi-Year Rate Plan.2    (i) The total cost of implementation and administration of 3thermal energy network projects shall not exceed $25,000,000 4in a given year. If projects exceed the cost limitation under 5this subsection (i), the Commission shall immediately suspend 6new applications and prioritize the continuation of existing 7participants' benefits under this Section as funds permit.  8    Section 97. Severability. If any provision of this Act or 9its application to any gas public utility, electric public 10utility, or combination public utility constructing or 11operating a Commission-approved pilot thermal energy network 12project is determined to be invalid or otherwise 13unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the 14validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Act, 15which shall continue in full force and effect. 16    Section 99. Effective date. This Act takes effect upon 17becoming law.".
