The 18        addition modification required by this subparagraph 19        shall be reduced to the extent that dividends were 20        included in base income of the unitary group for the 21        same taxable year and received by the taxpayer or by a 22        member of the taxpayer's unitary business group 23        (including amounts included in gross income under 24        Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal Revenue Code 25        and amounts included in gross income under Section 78 26        of the Internal Revenue Code) with respect to the   SB1715- 11 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1        stock of the same person to whom the premiums and costs 2        were directly or indirectly paid, incurred, or 3        accrued.

However, for taxable years ending on or after 18    December 31, 1986, net operating loss carryforwards from 19    taxable years ending prior to December 31, 1986, may not 20    exceed the sum of federal taxable income for the taxable 21    year before net operating loss deduction, plus the excess 22    of addition modifications over subtraction modifications 23    for the taxable year. For taxable years ending prior to 24    December 31, 1986, taxable income may never be an amount 25    in excess of the net operating loss for the taxable year as   SB1715- 101 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1    defined in subsections (c) and (d) of Section 172 of the 2    Internal Revenue Code, provided that when taxable income 3    of a corporation (other than a Subchapter S corporation), 4    trust, or estate is less than zero and addition 5    modifications, other than those provided by subparagraph 6    (E) of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) for corporations or 7    subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of subsection (c) for 8    trusts and estates, exceed subtraction modifications, an 9    addition modification must be made under those 10    subparagraphs for any other taxable year to which the 11    taxable income less than zero (net operating loss) is 12    applied under Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code or 13    under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection 14    (e) applied in conjunction with Section 172 of the 15    Internal Revenue Code.16        (2) Special rule. For purposes of paragraph (1) of 17    this subsection, the taxable income properly reportable 18    for federal income tax purposes shall mean:19            (A) Certain life insurance companies.

For purposes of this subparagraph, 21        the taxpayer's separate taxable income shall be 22        determined as if the election provided by Section 23        243(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code had been in 24        effect for all such years;25            (F) Cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative 26        corporation or association, the taxable income of such   SB1715- 103 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1        organization determined in accordance with the 2        provisions of Section 1381 through 1388 of the 3        Internal Revenue Code, but without regard to the 4        prohibition against offsetting losses from patronage 5        activities against income from nonpatronage 6        activities; except that a cooperative corporation or 7        association may make an election to follow its federal 8        income tax treatment of patronage losses and 9        nonpatronage losses. In the event such election is 10        made, such losses shall be computed and carried over 11        in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of Section 12        207 of this Act and apportioned by the apportionment 13        factor reported by the cooperative on its Illinois 14        income tax return filed for the taxable year in which 15        the losses are incurred. The election shall be 16        effective for all taxable years with original returns 17        due on or after the date of the election. In addition, 18        the cooperative may file an amended return or returns, 19        as allowed under this Act, to provide that the 20        election shall be effective for losses incurred or 21        carried forward for taxable years occurring prior to 22        the date of the election. Once made, the election may 23        only be revoked upon approval of the Director. The 24        Department shall adopt rules setting forth 25        requirements for documenting the elections and any 26        resulting Illinois net loss and the standards to be   SB1715- 104 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1        used by the Director in evaluating requests to revoke 2        elections. Public Act 96-932 is declaratory of 3        existing law; 4            (G) Subchapter S corporations. In the case of: (i) 5        a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 6        effect an election for the taxable year under Section 7        1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxable income 8        of such corporation determined in accordance with 9        Section 1363(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, except 10        that taxable income shall take into account those 11        items which are required by Section 1363(b)(1) of the 12        Internal Revenue Code to be separately stated; and 13        (ii) a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 14        effect a federal election to opt out of the provisions 15        of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 and have 16        applied instead the prior federal Subchapter S rules 17        as in effect on July 1, 1982, the taxable income of 18        such corporation determined in accordance with the 19        federal Subchapter S rules as in effect on July 1, 20        1982; and21            (H) Partnerships. In the case of a partnership, 22        taxable income determined in accordance with Section 23        703 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that taxable 24        income shall take into account those items which are 25        required by Section 703(a)(1) to be separately stated 26        but which would be taken into account by an individual   SB1715- 105 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1        in calculating his taxable income.2        (3) Recapture of business expenses on disposition of 3    asset or business. Notwithstanding any other law to the 4    contrary, if in prior years income from an asset or 5    business has been classified as business income and in a 6    later year is demonstrated to be non-business income, then 7    all expenses, without limitation, deducted in such later 8    year and in the 2 immediately preceding taxable years 9    related to that asset or business that generated the 10    non-business income shall be added back and recaptured as 11    business income in the year of the disposition of the 12    asset or business. Such amount shall be apportioned to 13    Illinois using the greater of the apportionment fraction 14    computed for the business under Section 304 of this Act 15    for the taxable year or the average of the apportionment 16    fractions computed for the business under Section 304 of 17    this Act for the taxable year and for the 2 immediately 18    preceding taxable years.  19    (f) Valuation limitation amount.20        (1) In general. The valuation limitation amount 21    referred to in subsections (a)(2)(G), (c)(2)(I) and 22    (d)(2)(E) is an amount equal to:23            (A) The sum of the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 24        amounts (to the extent consisting of gain reportable 25        under the provisions of Section 1245 or 1250 of the   SB1715- 106 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1        Internal Revenue Code) for all property in respect of 2        which such gain was reported for the taxable year; 3        plus4            (B) The lesser of (i) the sum of the pre-August 1, 5        1969 appreciation amounts (to the extent consisting of 6        capital gain) for all property in respect of which 7        such gain was reported for federal income tax purposes 8        for the taxable year, or (ii) the net capital gain for 9        the taxable year, reduced in either case by any amount 10        of such gain included in the amount determined under 11        subsection (a)(2)(F) or (c)(2)(H).12        (2) Pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation amount.13            (A) If the fair market value of property referred 14        to in paragraph (1) was readily ascertainable on 15        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 16        amount for such property is the lesser of (i) the 17        excess of such fair market value over the taxpayer's 18        basis (for determining gain) for such property on that 19        date (determined under the Internal Revenue Code as in 20        effect on that date), or (ii) the total gain realized 21        and reportable for federal income tax purposes in 22        respect of the sale, exchange or other disposition of 23        such property.24            (B) If the fair market value of property referred 25        to in paragraph (1) was not readily ascertainable on 26        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation   SB1715- 107 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1        amount for such property is that amount which bears 2        the same ratio to the total gain reported in respect of 3        the property for federal income tax purposes for the 4        taxable year, as the number of full calendar months in 5        that part of the taxpayer's holding period for the 6        property ending July 31, 1969 bears to the number of 7        full calendar months in the taxpayer's entire holding 8        period for the property.9            (C) The Department shall prescribe such 10        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the 11        purposes of this paragraph. 12    (g) Double deductions. Unless specifically provided 13otherwise, nothing in this Section shall permit the same item 14to be deducted more than once. 15    (h) Legislative intention. Except as expressly provided by 16this Section there shall be no modifications or limitations on 17the amounts of income, gain, loss or deduction taken into 18account in determining gross income, adjusted gross income or 19taxable income for federal income tax purposes for the taxable 20year, or in the amount of such items entering into the 21computation of base income and net income under this Act for 22such taxable year, whether in respect of property values as of 23August 1, 1969 or otherwise.24(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21;   SB1715- 108 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1102-658, eff. 8-27-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-1112, eff. 212-21-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23; 103-478, eff. 1-1-24; 103-592, 3Article 10, Section 10-900, eff. 6-7-24; 103-592, Article 170, 4Section 170-90, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24; 103-647, 5eff. 7-1-24; revised 8-20-24.) 6    Section 99.

The addition modification 20        required by this subparagraph shall be reduced to the 21        extent that dividends were included in base income of 22        the unitary group for the same taxable year and 23        received by the taxpayer or by a member of the 24        taxpayer's unitary business group (including amounts 25        included in gross income under Sections 951 through 26        964 of the Internal Revenue Code and amounts included   SB1715- 5 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1        in gross income under Section 78 of the Internal 2        Revenue Code) with respect to the stock of the same 3        person to whom the interest was paid, accrued, or 4        incurred.5            This paragraph shall not apply to the following: 6                (i) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 7            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person who 8            is subject in a foreign country or state, other 9            than a state which requires mandatory unitary 10            reporting, to a tax on or measured by net income 11            with respect to such interest; or12                (ii) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 13            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 14            the taxpayer can establish, based on a 15            preponderance of the evidence, both of the 16            following:17                    (a) the person, during the same taxable 18                year, paid, accrued, or incurred, the interest 19                to a person that is not a related member, and20                    (b) the transaction giving rise to the 21                interest expense between the taxpayer and the 22                person did not have as a principal purpose the 23                avoidance of Illinois income tax, and is paid 24                pursuant to a contract or agreement that 25                reflects an arm's-length interest rate and 26                terms; or   SB1715- 6 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1                (iii) the taxpayer can establish, based on 2            clear and convincing evidence, that the interest 3            paid, accrued, or incurred relates to a contract 4            or agreement entered into at arm's-length rates 5            and terms and the principal purpose for the 6            payment is not federal or Illinois tax avoidance; 7            or 8                (iv) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 9            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 10            the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing 11            evidence that the adjustments are unreasonable; or 12            if the taxpayer and the Director agree in writing 13            to the application or use of an alternative method 14            of apportionment under Section 304(f). 15                Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the 16            Director from making any other adjustment 17            otherwise allowed under Section 404 of this Act 18            for any tax year beginning after the effective 19            date of this amendment provided such adjustment is 20            made pursuant to regulation adopted by the 21            Department and such regulations provide methods 22            and standards by which the Department will utilize 23            its authority under Section 404 of this Act; 24            (D-18) An amount equal to the amount of intangible 25        expenses and costs otherwise allowed as a deduction in 26        computing base income, and that were paid, accrued, or   SB1715- 7 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1        incurred, directly or indirectly, (i) for taxable 2        years ending on or after December 31, 2004, to a 3        foreign person who would be a member of the same 4        unitary business group but for the fact that the 5        foreign person's business activity outside the United 6        States is 80% or more of that person's total business 7        activity and (ii) for taxable years ending on or after 8        December 31, 2008, to a person who would be a member of 9        the same unitary business group but for the fact that 10        the person is prohibited under Section 1501(a)(27) 11        from being included in the unitary business group 12        because he or she is ordinarily required to apportion 13        business income under different subsections of Section 14        304. The addition modification required by this 15        subparagraph shall be reduced to the extent that 16        dividends were included in base income of the unitary 17        group for the same taxable year and received by the 18        taxpayer or by a member of the taxpayer's unitary 19        business group (including amounts included in gross 20        income under Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal 21        Revenue Code and amounts included in gross income 22        under Section 78 of the Internal Revenue Code) with 23        respect to the stock of the same person to whom the 24        intangible expenses and costs were directly or 25        indirectly paid, incurred, or accrued. The preceding 26        sentence does not apply to the extent that the same   SB1715- 8 -LRB104 08345 HLH 18396 b1        dividends caused a reduction to the addition 2        modification required under Section 203(a)(2)(D-17) of 3        this Act.
