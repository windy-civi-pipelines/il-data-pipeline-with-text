Provides that that a unit of local government shall approve or deny an application for a permit to create or serve an accessory dwelling unit by right and without discretionary review. Requires the unit of local government to either approve or deny the application to create or serve an accessory dwelling unit within 60 days from the date the unit of local government receives a completed application if there is an existing single-family or multi-family dwelling on the lot. Provides that, if the unit of local government has not approved or denied the completed application within 60 days, then the application shall be deemed approved unless the Act provides for additional time. Provides that, if a unit of local government denies an application for an accessory dwelling unit, then the unit of local government shall return a full set of comments to the applicant in writing with a list of items that are defective or deficient and a description of how the application can be remedied by the applicant.
