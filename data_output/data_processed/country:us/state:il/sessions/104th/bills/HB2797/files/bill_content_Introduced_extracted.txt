However, if 14only 3 judges of election serve in each election precinct, no 15more than 2 persons of the same political party shall be judges 16of election in the same election precinct; and which political 17party is entitled to 2 judges of election and which political 18party is entitled to one judge of election shall be determined 19in the same manner as set forth in the next two preceding 20sentences with regard to 5 election judges in each precinct. 21Such certified list shall be filed with the county clerk not 22less than 10 days before the annual meeting of the county board 23of commissioners. Such list shall be arranged according to 24precincts. The chair of each county central committee shall, 25insofar as possible, list persons who reside within the 26precinct in which they are to serve as judges. However, he may,   HB2797- 4 -LRB104 10456 SPS 20531 b1in his sole discretion, submit the names of persons who reside 2outside the precinct but within the county embracing the 3precinct in which they are to serve.

In counties under the township organization the 24county board shall at its meeting in July in each 25even-numbered year except in counties containing a population   HB2797- 5 -LRB104 10456 SPS 20531 b1of 3,000,000 inhabitants or over and except when such judges 2are appointed by election commissioners, select in each 3election precinct in the county, 5 capable and discreet 4persons to be judges of election who shall possess the 5qualifications required by this Act for such judges. Where 6neither voting machines nor electronic, mechanical or electric 7voting systems are used, the county board may, for any 8precinct with respect to which the board considers such action 9necessary or desirable in view of the number of voters, and 10shall for general elections for any precinct containing more 11than 600 registered voters, appoint in addition to the 5 12judges of election a team of 5 tally judges. In such precincts 13the judges of election shall preside over the election during 14the hours the polls are open, and the tally judges, with the 15assistance of the holdover judges designated pursuant to 16Section 13-6.2, shall count the vote after the closing of the 17polls. The tally judges shall possess the same qualifications 18and shall be appointed in the same manner and with the same 19division between political parties as is provided for judges 20of election.21    However, the county board may appoint 3 judges of election 22to serve in lieu of the 5 judges of election otherwise required 23by this Section (1) to serve in any emergency referendum, or in 24any odd-year regular election or in any special primary or 25special election called for the purpose of filling a vacancy 26in the office of representative in the United States Congress   HB2797- 6 -LRB104 10456 SPS 20531 b1or to nominate candidates for such purpose or (2) if the county 2board passes an ordinance to reduce the number of judges of 3election to 3 for primary elections. An election authority may 4also reduce the number of judges of election in each precinct 5to 3 judges of election in lieu of the 5 judges of election 6otherwise required by this Section. 7    In addition to such precinct judges, the county board 8shall appoint special panels of 3 judges each, who shall 9possess the same qualifications and shall be appointed in the 10same manner and with the same division between political 11parties as is provided for other judges of election.

The election of the judges of election in the 21various election precincts shall be made in the following 22manner: The county board shall select and approve 3 of the 23election judges in each precinct from a certified list 24furnished by the chair of the County Central Committee of the 25first leading political party in such election precinct and 26shall also select and approve 2 judges of election in each   HB2797- 7 -LRB104 10456 SPS 20531 b1election precinct from a certified list furnished by the chair 2of the County Central Committee of the second leading 3political party in such election precinct. However, if only 3 4judges of election serve in each election precinct, no more 5than 2 persons of the same political party shall be judges of 6election in the same election precinct; and which political 7party is entitled to 2 judges of election and which political 8party is entitled to one judge of election shall be determined 9in the same manner as set forth in the next two preceding 10sentences with regard to 5 election judges in each precinct. 11The respective County Central Committee chair shall notify the 12county board by June 1 of each odd-numbered year immediately 13preceding the annual meeting of the county board whether or 14not such certified list will be filed by such chair. Such list 15shall be arranged according to precincts. The chair of each 16county central committee shall, insofar as possible, list 17persons who reside within the precinct in which they are to 18serve as judges. However, he may, in his sole discretion, 19submit the names of persons who reside outside the precinct 20but within the county embracing the precinct in which they are 21to serve. He must, however, submit the names of at least 2 22residents of the precinct for each precinct in which his party 23is to have 3 judges and must submit the name of at least one 24resident of the precinct for each precinct in which his party 25is to have 2 judges. Such certified list, if filed, shall be 26filed with the county clerk not less than 20 days before the   HB2797- 8 -LRB104 10456 SPS 20531 b1annual meeting of the county board. The county board shall 2acknowledge in writing to each county chair the names of all 3persons submitted on such certified list and the total number 4of persons listed thereon. If no such list is filed or the list 5is incomplete (that is, no names or an insufficient number of 6names are furnished for certain election precincts), the 7county board shall make or complete such list from the names 8contained in the supplemental list provided for in Section 913-1.1. Provided, further, that in any case where a township 10has been or shall be redistricted, in whole or in part, 11subsequent to one general election for Governor, and prior to 12the next, the judges of election to be selected for all new or 13altered precincts shall be selected in that one of the methods 14above detailed, which shall be applicable according to the 15facts and circumstances of the particular case, but the 16majority of such judges for each such precinct shall be 17selected from the first leading political party, and the 18minority judges from the second leading political party. 19Provided, further, that in counties having a population of 203,000,000 inhabitants or over the selection of judges of 21election shall be made in the same manner in all respects as in 22other counties, except that the provisions relating to tally 23judges are inapplicable to such counties and except that the 24county board shall meet during the month of January for the 25purpose of making such selection, each township 26committeeperson shall assume the responsibilities given to the   HB2797- 9 -LRB104 10456 SPS 20531 b1chair of the county central committee in this Section for the 2precincts within his or her township, and the township 3committeeperson shall notify the county board by the preceding 4October 1 whether or not the certified list will be filed. Such 5judges of election shall hold their office for 2 years from 6their appointment and until their successors are duly 7appointed in the manner provided in this Act. The county board 8shall fill all vacancies in the office of judges of elections 9at any time in the manner herein provided.10    Such selections under this Section shall be confirmed by 11the circuit court as provided in Section 13-3 of this Article.12(Source: P.A. 100-337, eff. 8-25-17; 100-1027, eff. 1-1-19.) 13    (10 ILCS 5/14-1)  (from Ch. 46, par. 14-1)14    Sec. 14-1.

The board of election commissioners 16shall acknowledge in writing to each county chair or ward 17committeepersons, as the case may be, the names of all persons 18submitted on such certified list and the total number of 19persons listed thereon. If no such list is furnished or if no 20names or an insufficient number of names are furnished for 21certain precincts, the board of election commissioners shall 22make or complete such list from the names contained in the 23supplemental list provided for in Section 14-3.2. Judges of 24election shall hold their office for 2 years from their 25appointment and until their successors are duly appointed in 26the manner herein provided. The board of election   HB2797- 17 -LRB104 10456 SPS 20531 b1commissioners shall, subject to the provisions of Section 214-3.2, fill all vacancies in the office of judges of election 3at any time in the manner herein provided.4    Such selections under this Section shall be confirmed by 5the court as provided in Section 14-5.6(Source: P.A. 100-1027, eff. 1-1-19.)
