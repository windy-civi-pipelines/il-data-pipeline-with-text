This Act may be cited as the 20Conversion Therapy Prohibition Youth Mental Health Protection 21Act.  HB3315- 2 -LRB104 11234 KTG 21316 b1(Source: P.A. 99-411, eff. 1-1-16.) 2    (405 ILCS 48/5)3    Sec. 5. Legislative findings. The General Assembly finds 4and declares the following:5        (1) Being lesbian, gay, or bisexual is not a disease, 6    disorder, illness, deficiency, or shortcoming. The major 7    professional associations of mental health practitioners 8    and researchers in the United States have recognized this 9    fact for nearly 40 years.10        (2) The American Psychological Association convened a 11    Task Force on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual 12    Orientation. The Task Force conducted a systematic review 13    of peer-reviewed journal literature on sexual orientation 14    change efforts and issued a report in 2009. The Task Force 15    concluded that sexual orientation change efforts can pose 16    critical health risks to lesbian, gay, and bisexual 17    people, including confusion, depression, guilt, 18    helplessness, hopelessness, shame, social withdrawal, 19    suicidality, substance abuse, stress, disappointment, 20    self-blame, decreased self-esteem and authenticity to 21    others, increased self-hatred, hostility and blame towards 22    parents, feelings of anger and betrayal, loss of friends 23    and potential romantic partners, problems in sexual and 24    emotional intimacy, sexual dysfunction, high-risk sexual 25    behaviors, a feeling of being dehumanized and untrue to   HB3315- 3 -LRB104 11234 KTG 21316 b1    self, a loss of faith, and a sense of having wasted time 2    and resources.3        (3) The American Psychological Association issued a 4    resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual 5    Orientation Distress and Change Efforts in 2009 that 6    states: "The American Psychological Association advises 7    parents, guardians, young people, and their families to 8    avoid sexual orientation change efforts that portray 9    homosexuality as a mental illness or developmental 10    disorder and to seek psychotherapy, social support, and 11    educational services that provide accurate information on 12    sexual orientation and sexuality, increase family and 13    school support, and reduce rejection of sexual minority 14    youth.".15        (4) The American Psychiatric Association published a 16    position statement in March of 2000 that states: 17    "Psychotherapeutic modalities to convert or 'repair' 18    homosexuality are based on developmental theories whose 19    scientific validity is questionable. Furthermore, 20    anecdotal reports of 'cures' are counterbalanced by 21    anecdotal claims of psychological harm. In the last four 22    decades, 'reparative' therapists have not produced any 23    rigorous scientific research to substantiate their claims 24    of cure. Until there is such research available, the 25    American Psychiatric Association recommends that ethical 26    practitioners refrain from attempts to change individuals'   HB3315- 4 -LRB104 11234 KTG 21316 b1    sexual orientation, keeping in mind the medical dictum to 2    first, do no harm. The potential risks of reparative 3    therapy are great, including depression, anxiety and 4    self-destructive behavior, since therapist alignment with 5    societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce 6    self-hatred already experienced by the patient. Many 7    patients who have undergone reparative therapy relate that 8    they were inaccurately told that homosexuals are lonely, 9    unhappy individuals who never achieve acceptance or 10    satisfaction. The possibility that the person might 11    achieve happiness and satisfying interpersonal 12    relationships as a gay man or lesbian is not presented, 13    nor are alternative approaches to dealing with the effects 14    of societal stigmatization discussed. Therefore, the 15    American Psychiatric Association opposes any psychiatric 16    treatment such as reparative or conversion therapy which 17    is based upon the assumption that homosexuality per se is 18    a mental disorder or based upon the a priori assumption 19    that a patient should change his or her sexual homosexual 20    orientation.".21        (5) The American Academy of Pediatrics published an 22    article in 1993 in its journal, Pediatrics, that states: 23    "Therapy directed at specifically changing sexual 24    orientation is contraindicated, since it can provoke guilt 25    and anxiety while having little or no potential for 26    achieving changes in orientation.".  HB3315- 5 -LRB104 11234 KTG 21316 b1        (6) The American Medical Association Council on 2    Scientific Affairs prepared a report in 1994 that states: 3    "Aversion therapy (a behavioral or medical intervention 4    which pairs unwanted behavior, in this case, homosexual 5    behavior, with unpleasant sensations or aversive 6    consequences) is no longer recommended for gay men and 7    lesbians. Through psychotherapy, gay men and lesbians can 8    become comfortable with their sexual orientation and 9    understand the societal response to it.".10        (7) The National Association of Social Workers 11    prepared a policy statement in 1997 that states: "Social 12    stigmatization of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people is 13    widespread and is a primary motivating factor in leading 14    some people to seek sexual orientation changes. Sexual 15    orientation conversion therapies assume that homosexual 16    orientation is both pathological and freely chosen. No 17    data demonstrates that reparative or conversion therapies 18    are effective, and, in fact, they may be harmful.".19        (8) The American Counseling Association Governing 20    Council issued a position statement in April, 1999 that 21    states: "We oppose the promotion of 'reparative therapy' 22    as a 'cure' for individuals who are homosexual.".23        (9) The American Psychoanalytic Association issued a 24    position statement in June, 2012 on attempts to change 25    sexual orientation, gender, identity, or gender expression 26    that states: "As with any societal prejudice, bias against   HB3315- 6 -LRB104 11234 KTG 21316 b1    individuals based on actual or perceived sexual 2    orientation, gender identity or gender expression 3    negatively affects mental health, contributing to an 4    enduring sense of stigma and pervasive self-criticism 5    through the internalization of such prejudice. 6    Psychoanalytic technique does not encompass purposeful 7    attempts to 'convert', 'repair', change or shift an 8    individual's sexual orientation, gender identity or gender 9    expression. Such directed efforts are against fundamental 10    principles of psychoanalytic treatment and often result in 11    substantial psychological pain by reinforcing damaging 12    internalized attitudes.".13        (10) The American Academy of Child and Adolescent 14    Psychiatry published an article in 2012 in its journal, 15    Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent 16    Psychiatry, that states: "Clinicians should be aware that 17    there is no evidence that sexual orientation can be 18    altered through therapy, and that attempts to do so may be 19    harmful. There is no empirical evidence adult 20    homosexuality can be prevented if gender nonconforming 21    children are influenced to be more gender conforming. 22    Indeed, there is no medically valid basis for attempting 23    to prevent homosexuality, which is not an illness. On the 24    contrary, such efforts may encourage family rejection and 25    undermine self-esteem, connectedness and caring, important 26    protective factors against suicidal ideation and attempts.   HB3315- 7 -LRB104 11234 KTG 21316 b1    Given that there is no evidence that efforts to alter 2    sexual orientation are effective, beneficial or necessary, 3    and the possibility that they carry the risk of 4    significant harm, such interventions are 5    contraindicated.".6        (11) The Pan American Health Organization, a regional 7    office of the World Health Organization, issued a 8    statement in May, 2012 that states: "These supposed 9    conversion therapies constitute a violation of the ethical 10    principles of health care and violate human rights that 11    are protected by international and regional agreements.". 12    The organization also noted that reparative therapies 13    "lack medical justification and represent a serious threat 14    to the health and well-being of affected people.".15        (12) Minors who experience family rejection based on 16    their sexual orientation face especially serious health 17    risks. In one study, lesbian, gay, and bisexual young 18    adults who reported higher levels of family rejection 19    during adolescence were 8.4 times more likely to report 20    having attempted suicide, 5.9 times more likely to report 21    high levels of depression, 3.4 times more likely to use 22    illegal drugs, and 3.4 times more likely to report having 23    engaged in unprotected sexual intercourse compared with 24    peers from families that reported no or low levels of 25    family rejection. This is documented by Caitlin Ryan et 26    al. in their article entitled Family Rejection as a   HB3315- 8 -LRB104 11234 KTG 21316 b1    Predictor of Negative Health Outcomes in White and Latino 2    Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Young Adults (2009), 123 3    Pediatrics 346.4        (13) Illinois has a compelling interest in protecting 5    the physical and psychological well-being of all minors, 6    including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender 7    individuals in this State youth and in protecting such 8    individuals its minors against exposure to serious harms 9    caused by sexual orientation change efforts.10(Source: P.A. 99-411, eff. 1-1-16.) 11    (405 ILCS 48/10)12    Sec. 10.
