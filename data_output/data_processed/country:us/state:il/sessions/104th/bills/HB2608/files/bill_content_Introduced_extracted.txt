A taxpayer shall be allowed a 11credit against the Personal Property Tax Replacement Income 12Tax for investment in qualified property.13        (1) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit equal to .5% 14    of the basis of qualified property placed in service 15    during the taxable year, provided such property is placed 16    in service on or after July 1, 1984. There shall be allowed 17    an additional credit equal to .5% of the basis of 18    qualified property placed in service during the taxable 19    year, provided such property is placed in service on or 20    after July 1, 1986, and the taxpayer's base employment 21    within Illinois has increased by 1% or more over the 22    preceding year as determined by the taxpayer's employment 23    records filed with the Illinois Department of Employment 24    Security. Taxpayers who are new to Illinois shall be 25    deemed to have met the 1% growth in base employment for the 26    first year in which they file employment records with the   HB2608- 12 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    Illinois Department of Employment Security. The provisions 2    added to this Section by Public Act 85-1200 (and restored 3    by Public Act 87-895) shall be construed as declaratory of 4    existing law and not as a new enactment. If, in any year, 5    the increase in base employment within Illinois over the 6    preceding year is less than 1%, the additional credit 7    shall be limited to that percentage times a fraction, the 8    numerator of which is .5% and the denominator of which is 9    1%, but shall not exceed .5%. The investment credit shall 10    not be allowed to the extent that it would reduce a 11    taxpayer's liability in any tax year below zero, nor may 12    any credit for qualified property be allowed for any year 13    other than the year in which the property was placed in 14    service in Illinois. For tax years ending on or after 15    December 31, 1987, and on or before December 31, 1988, the 16    credit shall be allowed for the tax year in which the 17    property is placed in service, or, if the amount of the 18    credit exceeds the tax liability for that year, whether it 19    exceeds the original liability or the liability as later 20    amended, such excess may be carried forward and applied to 21    the tax liability of the 5 taxable years following the 22    excess credit years if the taxpayer (i) makes investments 23    which cause the creation of a minimum of 2,000 full-time 24    equivalent jobs in Illinois, (ii) is located in an 25    enterprise zone established pursuant to the Illinois 26    Enterprise Zone Act and (iii) is certified by the   HB2608- 13 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (now 2    Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity) as 3    complying with the requirements specified in clause (i) 4    and (ii) by July 1, 1986. The Department of Commerce and 5    Community Affairs (now Department of Commerce and Economic 6    Opportunity) shall notify the Department of Revenue of all 7    such certifications immediately. For tax years ending 8    after December 31, 1988, the credit shall be allowed for 9    the tax year in which the property is placed in service, 10    or, if the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability 11    for that year, whether it exceeds the original liability 12    or the liability as later amended, such excess may be 13    carried forward and applied to the tax liability of the 5 14    taxable years following the excess credit years. The 15    credit shall be applied to the earliest year for which 16    there is a liability. If there is credit from more than one 17    tax year that is available to offset a liability, earlier 18    credit shall be applied first.19        (2) The term "qualified property" means property 20    which:21            (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including 22        buildings and structural components of buildings and 23        signs that are real property, but not including land 24        or improvements to real property that are not a 25        structural component of a building such as 26        landscaping, sewer lines, local access roads, fencing,   HB2608- 14 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1        parking lots, and other appurtenances;2            (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the 3        Internal Revenue Code, except that "3-year property" 4        as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not 5        eligible for the credit provided by this subsection 6        (e);7            (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section 8        179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;9            (D) is used in Illinois by a taxpayer who is 10        primarily engaged in manufacturing, or in mining coal 11        or fluorite, or in retailing, or was placed in service 12        on or after July 1, 2006 in a River Edge Redevelopment 13        Zone established pursuant to the River Edge 14        Redevelopment Zone Act; and15            (E) has not previously been used in Illinois in 16        such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for 17        the credit provided by this subsection (e) or 18        subsection (f).19        (3) For purposes of this subsection (e), 20    "manufacturing" means the material staging and production 21    of tangible personal property by procedures commonly 22    regarded as manufacturing, processing, fabrication, or 23    assembling which changes some existing material into new 24    shapes, new qualities, or new combinations. For purposes 25    of this subsection (e) the term "mining" shall have the 26    same meaning as the term "mining" in Section 613(c) of the   HB2608- 15 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this subsection 2    (e), the term "retailing" means the sale of tangible 3    personal property for use or consumption and not for 4    resale, or services rendered in conjunction with the sale 5    of tangible personal property for use or consumption and 6    not for resale. For purposes of this subsection (e), 7    "tangible personal property" has the same meaning as when 8    that term is used in the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, 9    and, for taxable years ending after December 31, 2008, 10    does not include the generation, transmission, or 11    distribution of electricity.12        (4) The basis of qualified property shall be the basis 13    used to compute the depreciation deduction for federal 14    income tax purposes.15        (5) If the basis of the property for federal income 16    tax depreciation purposes is increased after it has been 17    placed in service in Illinois by the taxpayer, the amount 18    of such increase shall be deemed property placed in 19    service on the date of such increase in basis.20        (6) The term "placed in service" shall have the same 21    meaning as under Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code.22        (7) If during any taxable year, any property ceases to 23    be qualified property in the hands of the taxpayer within 24    48 months after being placed in service, or the situs of 25    any qualified property is moved outside Illinois within 48 26    months after being placed in service, the Personal   HB2608- 16 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    Property Tax Replacement Income Tax for such taxable year 2    shall be increased. Such increase shall be determined by 3    (i) recomputing the investment credit which would have 4    been allowed for the year in which credit for such 5    property was originally allowed by eliminating such 6    property from such computation and, (ii) subtracting such 7    recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously 8    allowed. For the purposes of this paragraph (7), a 9    reduction of the basis of qualified property resulting 10    from a redetermination of the purchase price shall be 11    deemed a disposition of qualified property to the extent 12    of such reduction.13        (8) Unless the investment credit is extended by law, 14    the basis of qualified property shall not include costs 15    incurred after December 31, 2018, except for costs 16    incurred pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or 17    before December 31, 2018.18        (9) Each taxable year ending before December 31, 2000, 19    a partnership may elect to pass through to its partners 20    the credits to which the partnership is entitled under 21    this subsection (e) for the taxable year. A partner may 22    use the credit allocated to him or her under this 23    paragraph only against the tax imposed in subsections (c) 24    and (d) of this Section. If the partnership makes that 25    election, those credits shall be allocated among the 26    partners in the partnership in accordance with the rules   HB2608- 17 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    set forth in Section 704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, 2    and the rules promulgated under that Section, and the 3    allocated amount of the credits shall be allowed to the 4    partners for that taxable year. The partnership shall make 5    this election on its Personal Property Tax Replacement 6    Income Tax return for that taxable year.

The credit shall be available only in the 20    taxable year in which the property is placed in service in 21    the Enterprise Zone or River Edge Redevelopment Zone and 22    shall not be allowed to the extent that it would reduce a 23    taxpayer's liability for the tax imposed by subsections 24    (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero. For tax years 25    ending on or after December 31, 1985, the credit shall be 26    allowed for the tax year in which the property is placed in   HB2608- 19 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    service, or, if the amount of the credit exceeds the tax 2    liability for that year, whether it exceeds the original 3    liability or the liability as later amended, such excess 4    may be carried forward and applied to the tax liability of 5    the 5 taxable years following the excess credit year. The 6    credit shall be applied to the earliest year for which 7    there is a liability. If there is credit from more than one 8    tax year that is available to offset a liability, the 9    credit accruing first in time shall be applied first.10        (2) The term qualified property means property which:11            (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including 12        buildings and structural components of buildings;13            (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the 14        Internal Revenue Code, except that "3-year property" 15        as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not 16        eligible for the credit provided by this subsection 17        (f);18            (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section 19        179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;20            (D) is used in the Enterprise Zone or River Edge 21        Redevelopment Zone by the taxpayer; and22            (E) has not been previously used in Illinois in 23        such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for 24        the credit provided by this subsection (f) or 25        subsection (e).26        (3) The basis of qualified property shall be the basis   HB2608- 20 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    used to compute the depreciation deduction for federal 2    income tax purposes.3        (4) If the basis of the property for federal income 4    tax depreciation purposes is increased after it has been 5    placed in service in the Enterprise Zone or River Edge 6    Redevelopment Zone by the taxpayer, the amount of such 7    increase shall be deemed property placed in service on the 8    date of such increase in basis.9        (5) The term "placed in service" shall have the same 10    meaning as under Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code.11        (6) If during any taxable year, any property ceases to 12    be qualified property in the hands of the taxpayer within 13    48 months after being placed in service, or the situs of 14    any qualified property is moved outside the Enterprise 15    Zone or River Edge Redevelopment Zone within 48 months 16    after being placed in service, the tax imposed under 17    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section for such taxable 18    year shall be increased. Such increase shall be determined 19    by (i) recomputing the investment credit which would have 20    been allowed for the year in which credit for such 21    property was originally allowed by eliminating such 22    property from such computation, and (ii) subtracting such 23    recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously 24    allowed. For the purposes of this paragraph (6), a 25    reduction of the basis of qualified property resulting 26    from a redetermination of the purchase price shall be   HB2608- 21 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    deemed a disposition of qualified property to the extent 2    of such reduction.3        (7) There shall be allowed an additional credit equal 4    to 0.5% of the basis of qualified property placed in 5    service during the taxable year in a River Edge 6    Redevelopment Zone, provided such property is placed in 7    service on or after July 1, 2006, and the taxpayer's base 8    employment within Illinois has increased by 1% or more 9    over the preceding year as determined by the taxpayer's 10    employment records filed with the Illinois Department of 11    Employment Security. Taxpayers who are new to Illinois 12    shall be deemed to have met the 1% growth in base 13    employment for the first year in which they file 14    employment records with the Illinois Department of 15    Employment Security. If, in any year, the increase in base 16    employment within Illinois over the preceding year is less 17    than 1%, the additional credit shall be limited to that 18    percentage times a fraction, the numerator of which is 19    0.5% and the denominator of which is 1%, but shall not 20    exceed 0.5%. 21        (8) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 22    2021, there shall be allowed an Enterprise Zone 23    construction jobs credit against the taxes imposed under 24    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section as provided in 25    Section 13 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act. 26        The credit or credits may not reduce the taxpayer's   HB2608- 22 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    liability to less than zero. If the amount of the credit or 2    credits exceeds the taxpayer's liability, the excess may 3    be carried forward and applied against the taxpayer's 4    liability in succeeding calendar years in the same manner 5    provided under paragraph (4) of Section 211 of this Act. 6    The credit or credits shall be applied to the earliest 7    year for which there is a tax liability. If there are 8    credits from more than one taxable year that are available 9    to offset a liability, the earlier credit shall be applied 10    first. 11        For partners, shareholders of Subchapter S 12    corporations, and owners of limited liability companies, 13    if the liability company is treated as a partnership for 14    the purposes of federal and State income taxation, for 15    taxable years ending before December 31, 2023, there shall 16    be allowed a credit under this Section to be determined in 17    accordance with the determination of income and 18    distributive share of income under Sections 702 and 704 19    and Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code.

The 23    credit applicable to such investments shall be taken in 24    the taxable year in which such investments have been 25    completed. The credit for additional investments beyond 26    the minimum investment by a designated high impact   HB2608- 24 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    business authorized under subdivision (a)(3)(A) of Section 2    5.5 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act shall be available 3    only in the taxable year in which the property is placed in 4    service and shall not be allowed to the extent that it 5    would reduce a taxpayer's liability for the tax imposed by 6    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero.

The credit shall be applied to the earliest 15    year for which there is a liability. If there is credit 16    from more than one tax year that is available to offset a 17    liability, the credit accruing first in time shall be 18    applied first.19        Changes made in this subdivision (h)(1) by Public Act 20    88-670 restore changes made by Public Act 85-1182 and 21    reflect existing law.22        (2) The term qualified property means property which:23            (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including 24        buildings and structural components of buildings;25            (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the 26        Internal Revenue Code, except that "3-year property"   HB2608- 25 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1        as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not 2        eligible for the credit provided by this subsection 3        (h);4            (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section 5        179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code; and6            (D) is not eligible for the Enterprise Zone 7        Investment Credit provided by subsection (f) of this 8        Section.9        (3) The basis of qualified property shall be the basis 10    used to compute the depreciation deduction for federal 11    income tax purposes.12        (4) If the basis of the property for federal income 13    tax depreciation purposes is increased after it has been 14    placed in service in a federally designated Foreign Trade 15    Zone or Sub-Zone located in Illinois by the taxpayer, the 16    amount of such increase shall be deemed property placed in 17    service on the date of such increase in basis.18        (5) The term "placed in service" shall have the same 19    meaning as under Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code.20        (6) If during any taxable year ending on or before 21    December 31, 1996, any property ceases to be qualified 22    property in the hands of the taxpayer within 48 months 23    after being placed in service, or the situs of any 24    qualified property is moved outside Illinois within 48 25    months after being placed in service, the tax imposed 26    under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section for such   HB2608- 26 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    taxable year shall be increased.

If the amount of the credit or 4credits exceeds the taxpayer's liability, the excess may be 5carried forward and applied against the taxpayer's liability 6in succeeding calendar years in the manner provided under 7paragraph (4) of Section 211 of this Act. The credit or credits 8shall be applied to the earliest year for which there is a tax 9liability. If there are credits from more than one taxable 10year that are available to offset a liability, the earlier 11credit shall be applied first. 12    For partners, shareholders of Subchapter S corporations, 13and owners of limited liability companies, for taxable years 14ending before December 31, 2023, if the liability company is 15treated as a partnership for the purposes of federal and State 16income taxation, there shall be allowed a credit under this 17Section to be determined in accordance with the determination 18of income and distributive share of income under Sections 702 19and 704 and Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code.

The credit must 21    be claimed for the taxable year in which Agency approval 22    of the eligible remediation costs is granted. The credit 23    is not available to any taxpayer if the taxpayer or any 24    related party caused or contributed to, in any material 25    respect, a release of regulated substances on, in, or 26    under the site that was identified and addressed by the   HB2608- 34 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    remedial action pursuant to the Site Remediation Program 2    of the Environmental Protection Act.

The 7    term "unused credit" does not include any amounts of 8    unreimbursed eligible remediation costs in excess of the 9    maximum credit per site authorized under paragraph (i). 10    This credit shall be applied first to the earliest year 11    for which there is a liability. If there is a credit under 12    this subsection from more than one tax year that is 13    available to offset a liability, the earliest credit 14    arising under this subsection shall be applied first. A 15    credit allowed under this subsection may be sold to a 16    buyer as part of a sale of all or part of the remediation 17    site for which the credit was granted. The purchaser of a 18    remediation site and the tax credit shall succeed to the 19    unused credit and remaining carry-forward period of the 20    seller.

In the 11case of a foreign insurer, as defined by Section 35A-5 of the 12Illinois Insurance Code, whose state or country of domicile 13imposes on insurers domiciled in Illinois a retaliatory tax 14(excluding any insurer whose premiums from reinsurance assumed 15are 50% or more of its total insurance premiums as determined 16under paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of Section 304, except 17that for purposes of this determination premiums from 18reinsurance do not include premiums from inter-affiliate 19reinsurance arrangements), beginning with taxable years ending 20on or after December 31, 1999, the sum of the rates of tax 21imposed by subsections (b) and (d) shall be reduced (but not 22increased) to the rate at which the total amount of tax imposed 23under this Act, net of all credits allowed under this Act, 24shall equal (i) the total amount of tax that would be imposed 25on the foreign insurer's net income allocable to Illinois for 26the taxable year by such foreign insurer's state or country of   HB2608- 10 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1domicile if that net income were subject to all income taxes 2and taxes measured by net income imposed by such foreign 3insurer's state or country of domicile, net of all credits 4allowed or (ii) a rate of zero if no such tax is imposed on 5such income by the foreign insurer's state of domicile. For 6the purposes of this subsection (d-1), an inter-affiliate 7includes a mutual insurer under common management.8        (1) For the purposes of subsection (d-1), in no event 9    shall the sum of the rates of tax imposed by subsections 10    (b) and (d) be reduced below the rate at which the sum of:11            (A) the total amount of tax imposed on such 12        foreign insurer under this Act for a taxable year, net 13        of all credits allowed under this Act, plus14            (B) the privilege tax imposed by Section 409 of 15        the Illinois Insurance Code, the fire insurance 16        company tax imposed by Section 12 of the Fire 17        Investigation Act, and the fire department taxes 18        imposed under Section 11-10-1 of the Illinois 19        Municipal Code,20    equals 1.25% for taxable years ending prior to December 21    31, 2003, or 1.75% for taxable years ending on or after 22    December 31, 2003, of the net taxable premiums written for 23    the taxable year, as described by subsection (1) of 24    Section 409 of the Illinois Insurance Code. This paragraph 25    will in no event increase the rates imposed under 26    subsections (b) and (d).  HB2608- 11 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1        (2) Any reduction in the rates of tax imposed by this 2    subsection shall be applied first against the rates 3    imposed by subsection (b) and only after the tax imposed 4    by subsection (a) net of all credits allowed under this 5    Section other than the credit allowed under subsection (i) 6    has been reduced to zero, against the rates imposed by 7    subsection (d).8    This subsection (d-1) is exempt from the provisions of 9Section 250.10    (e) Investment credit. A taxpayer shall be allowed a 11credit against the Personal Property Tax Replacement Income 12Tax for investment in qualified property.13        (1) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit equal to .5% 14    of the basis of qualified property placed in service 15    during the taxable year, provided such property is placed 16    in service on or after July 1, 1984. There shall be allowed 17    an additional credit equal to .5% of the basis of 18    qualified property placed in service during the taxable 19    year, provided such property is placed in service on or 20    after July 1, 1986, and the taxpayer's base employment 21    within Illinois has increased by 1% or more over the 22    preceding year as determined by the taxpayer's employment 23    records filed with the Illinois Department of Employment 24    Security. Taxpayers who are new to Illinois shall be 25    deemed to have met the 1% growth in base employment for the 26    first year in which they file employment records with the   HB2608- 12 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    Illinois Department of Employment Security. The provisions 2    added to this Section by Public Act 85-1200 (and restored 3    by Public Act 87-895) shall be construed as declaratory of 4    existing law and not as a new enactment. If, in any year, 5    the increase in base employment within Illinois over the 6    preceding year is less than 1%, the additional credit 7    shall be limited to that percentage times a fraction, the 8    numerator of which is .5% and the denominator of which is 9    1%, but shall not exceed .5%. The investment credit shall 10    not be allowed to the extent that it would reduce a 11    taxpayer's liability in any tax year below zero, nor may 12    any credit for qualified property be allowed for any year 13    other than the year in which the property was placed in 14    service in Illinois. For tax years ending on or after 15    December 31, 1987, and on or before December 31, 1988, the 16    credit shall be allowed for the tax year in which the 17    property is placed in service, or, if the amount of the 18    credit exceeds the tax liability for that year, whether it 19    exceeds the original liability or the liability as later 20    amended, such excess may be carried forward and applied to 21    the tax liability of the 5 taxable years following the 22    excess credit years if the taxpayer (i) makes investments 23    which cause the creation of a minimum of 2,000 full-time 24    equivalent jobs in Illinois, (ii) is located in an 25    enterprise zone established pursuant to the Illinois 26    Enterprise Zone Act and (iii) is certified by the   HB2608- 13 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (now 2    Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity) as 3    complying with the requirements specified in clause (i) 4    and (ii) by July 1, 1986. The Department of Commerce and 5    Community Affairs (now Department of Commerce and Economic 6    Opportunity) shall notify the Department of Revenue of all 7    such certifications immediately. For tax years ending 8    after December 31, 1988, the credit shall be allowed for 9    the tax year in which the property is placed in service, 10    or, if the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability 11    for that year, whether it exceeds the original liability 12    or the liability as later amended, such excess may be 13    carried forward and applied to the tax liability of the 5 14    taxable years following the excess credit years. The 15    credit shall be applied to the earliest year for which 16    there is a liability. If there is credit from more than one 17    tax year that is available to offset a liability, earlier 18    credit shall be applied first.19        (2) The term "qualified property" means property 20    which:21            (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including 22        buildings and structural components of buildings and 23        signs that are real property, but not including land 24        or improvements to real property that are not a 25        structural component of a building such as 26        landscaping, sewer lines, local access roads, fencing,   HB2608- 14 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1        parking lots, and other appurtenances;2            (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the 3        Internal Revenue Code, except that "3-year property" 4        as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not 5        eligible for the credit provided by this subsection 6        (e);7            (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section 8        179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;9            (D) is used in Illinois by a taxpayer who is 10        primarily engaged in manufacturing, or in mining coal 11        or fluorite, or in retailing, or was placed in service 12        on or after July 1, 2006 in a River Edge Redevelopment 13        Zone established pursuant to the River Edge 14        Redevelopment Zone Act; and15            (E) has not previously been used in Illinois in 16        such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for 17        the credit provided by this subsection (e) or 18        subsection (f).19        (3) For purposes of this subsection (e), 20    "manufacturing" means the material staging and production 21    of tangible personal property by procedures commonly 22    regarded as manufacturing, processing, fabrication, or 23    assembling which changes some existing material into new 24    shapes, new qualities, or new combinations. For purposes 25    of this subsection (e) the term "mining" shall have the 26    same meaning as the term "mining" in Section 613(c) of the   HB2608- 15 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this subsection 2    (e), the term "retailing" means the sale of tangible 3    personal property for use or consumption and not for 4    resale, or services rendered in conjunction with the sale 5    of tangible personal property for use or consumption and 6    not for resale. For purposes of this subsection (e), 7    "tangible personal property" has the same meaning as when 8    that term is used in the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act, 9    and, for taxable years ending after December 31, 2008, 10    does not include the generation, transmission, or 11    distribution of electricity.12        (4) The basis of qualified property shall be the basis 13    used to compute the depreciation deduction for federal 14    income tax purposes.15        (5) If the basis of the property for federal income 16    tax depreciation purposes is increased after it has been 17    placed in service in Illinois by the taxpayer, the amount 18    of such increase shall be deemed property placed in 19    service on the date of such increase in basis.20        (6) The term "placed in service" shall have the same 21    meaning as under Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code.22        (7) If during any taxable year, any property ceases to 23    be qualified property in the hands of the taxpayer within 24    48 months after being placed in service, or the situs of 25    any qualified property is moved outside Illinois within 48 26    months after being placed in service, the Personal   HB2608- 16 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    Property Tax Replacement Income Tax for such taxable year 2    shall be increased. Such increase shall be determined by 3    (i) recomputing the investment credit which would have 4    been allowed for the year in which credit for such 5    property was originally allowed by eliminating such 6    property from such computation and, (ii) subtracting such 7    recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously 8    allowed. For the purposes of this paragraph (7), a 9    reduction of the basis of qualified property resulting 10    from a redetermination of the purchase price shall be 11    deemed a disposition of qualified property to the extent 12    of such reduction.13        (8) Unless the investment credit is extended by law, 14    the basis of qualified property shall not include costs 15    incurred after December 31, 2018, except for costs 16    incurred pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or 17    before December 31, 2018.18        (9) Each taxable year ending before December 31, 2000, 19    a partnership may elect to pass through to its partners 20    the credits to which the partnership is entitled under 21    this subsection (e) for the taxable year. A partner may 22    use the credit allocated to him or her under this 23    paragraph only against the tax imposed in subsections (c) 24    and (d) of this Section. If the partnership makes that 25    election, those credits shall be allocated among the 26    partners in the partnership in accordance with the rules   HB2608- 17 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    set forth in Section 704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, 2    and the rules promulgated under that Section, and the 3    allocated amount of the credits shall be allowed to the 4    partners for that taxable year. The partnership shall make 5    this election on its Personal Property Tax Replacement 6    Income Tax return for that taxable year. The election to 7    pass through the credits shall be irrevocable.8        For taxable years ending on or after December 31, 9    2000, a partner that qualifies its partnership for a 10    subtraction under subparagraph (I) of paragraph (2) of 11    subsection (d) of Section 203 or a shareholder that 12    qualifies a Subchapter S corporation for a subtraction 13    under subparagraph (S) of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) 14    of Section 203 shall be allowed a credit under this 15    subsection (e) equal to its share of the credit earned 16    under this subsection (e) during the taxable year by the 17    partnership or Subchapter S corporation, determined in 18    accordance with the determination of income and 19    distributive share of income under Sections 702 and 704 20    and Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. This 21    paragraph is exempt from the provisions of Section 250.22    (f) Investment credit; Enterprise Zone; River Edge 23Redevelopment Zone.24        (1) A taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the 25    tax imposed by subsections (a) and (b) of this Section for 26    investment in qualified property which is placed in   HB2608- 18 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    service in an Enterprise Zone created pursuant to the 2    Illinois Enterprise Zone Act or, for property placed in 3    service on or after July 1, 2006, a River Edge 4    Redevelopment Zone established pursuant to the River Edge 5    Redevelopment Zone Act. For partners, shareholders of 6    Subchapter S corporations, and owners of limited liability 7    companies, if the liability company is treated as a 8    partnership for purposes of federal and State income 9    taxation, for taxable years ending before December 31, 10    2023, there shall be allowed a credit under this 11    subsection (f) to be determined in accordance with the 12    determination of income and distributive share of income 13    under Sections 702 and 704 and Subchapter S of the 14    Internal Revenue Code. For taxable years ending on or 15    after December 31, 2023, for partners and shareholders of 16    Subchapter S corporations, the provisions of Section 251 17    shall apply with respect to the credit under this 18    subsection. The credit shall be .5% of the basis for such 19    property. The credit shall be available only in the 20    taxable year in which the property is placed in service in 21    the Enterprise Zone or River Edge Redevelopment Zone and 22    shall not be allowed to the extent that it would reduce a 23    taxpayer's liability for the tax imposed by subsections 24    (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero. For tax years 25    ending on or after December 31, 1985, the credit shall be 26    allowed for the tax year in which the property is placed in   HB2608- 19 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    service, or, if the amount of the credit exceeds the tax 2    liability for that year, whether it exceeds the original 3    liability or the liability as later amended, such excess 4    may be carried forward and applied to the tax liability of 5    the 5 taxable years following the excess credit year. The 6    credit shall be applied to the earliest year for which 7    there is a liability. If there is credit from more than one 8    tax year that is available to offset a liability, the 9    credit accruing first in time shall be applied first.10        (2) The term qualified property means property which:11            (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including 12        buildings and structural components of buildings;13            (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the 14        Internal Revenue Code, except that "3-year property" 15        as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not 16        eligible for the credit provided by this subsection 17        (f);18            (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section 19        179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;20            (D) is used in the Enterprise Zone or River Edge 21        Redevelopment Zone by the taxpayer; and22            (E) has not been previously used in Illinois in 23        such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for 24        the credit provided by this subsection (f) or 25        subsection (e).26        (3) The basis of qualified property shall be the basis   HB2608- 20 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    used to compute the depreciation deduction for federal 2    income tax purposes.3        (4) If the basis of the property for federal income 4    tax depreciation purposes is increased after it has been 5    placed in service in the Enterprise Zone or River Edge 6    Redevelopment Zone by the taxpayer, the amount of such 7    increase shall be deemed property placed in service on the 8    date of such increase in basis.9        (5) The term "placed in service" shall have the same 10    meaning as under Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code.11        (6) If during any taxable year, any property ceases to 12    be qualified property in the hands of the taxpayer within 13    48 months after being placed in service, or the situs of 14    any qualified property is moved outside the Enterprise 15    Zone or River Edge Redevelopment Zone within 48 months 16    after being placed in service, the tax imposed under 17    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section for such taxable 18    year shall be increased. Such increase shall be determined 19    by (i) recomputing the investment credit which would have 20    been allowed for the year in which credit for such 21    property was originally allowed by eliminating such 22    property from such computation, and (ii) subtracting such 23    recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously 24    allowed. For the purposes of this paragraph (6), a 25    reduction of the basis of qualified property resulting 26    from a redetermination of the purchase price shall be   HB2608- 21 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    deemed a disposition of qualified property to the extent 2    of such reduction.3        (7) There shall be allowed an additional credit equal 4    to 0.5% of the basis of qualified property placed in 5    service during the taxable year in a River Edge 6    Redevelopment Zone, provided such property is placed in 7    service on or after July 1, 2006, and the taxpayer's base 8    employment within Illinois has increased by 1% or more 9    over the preceding year as determined by the taxpayer's 10    employment records filed with the Illinois Department of 11    Employment Security. Taxpayers who are new to Illinois 12    shall be deemed to have met the 1% growth in base 13    employment for the first year in which they file 14    employment records with the Illinois Department of 15    Employment Security. If, in any year, the increase in base 16    employment within Illinois over the preceding year is less 17    than 1%, the additional credit shall be limited to that 18    percentage times a fraction, the numerator of which is 19    0.5% and the denominator of which is 1%, but shall not 20    exceed 0.5%. 21        (8) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 22    2021, there shall be allowed an Enterprise Zone 23    construction jobs credit against the taxes imposed under 24    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section as provided in 25    Section 13 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act. 26        The credit or credits may not reduce the taxpayer's   HB2608- 22 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    liability to less than zero. If the amount of the credit or 2    credits exceeds the taxpayer's liability, the excess may 3    be carried forward and applied against the taxpayer's 4    liability in succeeding calendar years in the same manner 5    provided under paragraph (4) of Section 211 of this Act. 6    The credit or credits shall be applied to the earliest 7    year for which there is a tax liability. If there are 8    credits from more than one taxable year that are available 9    to offset a liability, the earlier credit shall be applied 10    first. 11        For partners, shareholders of Subchapter S 12    corporations, and owners of limited liability companies, 13    if the liability company is treated as a partnership for 14    the purposes of federal and State income taxation, for 15    taxable years ending before December 31, 2023, there shall 16    be allowed a credit under this Section to be determined in 17    accordance with the determination of income and 18    distributive share of income under Sections 702 and 704 19    and Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. For taxable 20    years ending on or after December 31, 2023, for partners 21    and shareholders of Subchapter S corporations, the 22    provisions of Section 251 shall apply with respect to the 23    credit under this subsection.24        The total aggregate amount of credits awarded under 25    the Blue Collar Jobs Act (Article 20 of Public Act 101-9) 26    shall not exceed $20,000,000 in any State fiscal year.   HB2608- 23 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1        This paragraph (8) is exempt from the provisions of 2    Section 250. 3    (g) (Blank).4    (h) Investment credit; High Impact Business.5        (1) Subject to subsections (b) and (b-5) of Section 6    5.5 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act, a taxpayer shall 7    be allowed a credit against the tax imposed by subsections 8    (a) and (b) of this Section for investment in qualified 9    property which is placed in service by a Department of 10    Commerce and Economic Opportunity designated High Impact 11    Business. The credit shall be .5% of the basis for such 12    property. The credit shall not be available (i) until the 13    minimum investments in qualified property set forth in 14    subdivision (a)(3)(A) of Section 5.5 of the Illinois 15    Enterprise Zone Act have been satisfied or (ii) until the 16    time authorized in subsection (b-5) of the Illinois 17    Enterprise Zone Act for entities designated as High Impact 18    Businesses under subdivisions (a)(3)(B), (a)(3)(C), and 19    (a)(3)(D) of Section 5.5 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone 20    Act, and shall not be allowed to the extent that it would 21    reduce a taxpayer's liability for the tax imposed by 22    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero. The 23    credit applicable to such investments shall be taken in 24    the taxable year in which such investments have been 25    completed. The credit for additional investments beyond 26    the minimum investment by a designated high impact   HB2608- 24 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    business authorized under subdivision (a)(3)(A) of Section 2    5.5 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act shall be available 3    only in the taxable year in which the property is placed in 4    service and shall not be allowed to the extent that it 5    would reduce a taxpayer's liability for the tax imposed by 6    subsections (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero.

If a 13        taxpayer making the election under paragraph (1) is a 14        partner of another taxpayer making the election under 15        paragraph (1), net income shall be computed as 16        provided in subparagraph (A), except that the taxpayer 17        shall subtract its distributive share of the net 18        income of the electing partnership (including its 19        distributive share of the net income of the electing 20        partnership derived as a distributive share from 21        electing partnerships in which it is a partner). 22        (4) Credit for entity level tax. Each partner or 23    shareholder of a taxpayer making the election under this 24    Section shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed 25    under subsections (a) and (b) of Section 201 of this Act 26    for the taxable year of the partnership or Subchapter S   HB2608- 44 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    corporation for which an election is in effect ending 2    within or with the taxable year of the partner or 3    shareholder in an amount equal to 4.95% times the partner 4    or shareholder's distributive share of the net income of 5    the electing partnership or Subchapter S corporation, but 6    not to exceed the partner's or shareholder's share of the 7    tax imposed under paragraph (1) which is actually paid by 8    the partnership or Subchapter S corporation. If the 9    taxpayer is a partnership or Subchapter S corporation that 10    is itself a partner of a partnership making the election 11    under paragraph (1), the credit under this paragraph shall 12    be allowed to the taxpayer's partners or shareholders (or 13    if the partner is a partnership or Subchapter S 14    corporation then its partners or shareholders) in 15    accordance with the determination of income and 16    distributive share of income under Sections 702 and 704 17    and Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. If the 18    amount of the credit allowed under this paragraph exceeds 19    the partner's or shareholder's liability for tax imposed 20    under subsections (a) and (b) of Section 201 of this Act 21    for the taxable year, such excess shall be treated as an 22    overpayment for purposes of Section 909 of this Act. 23        (5) Nonresidents. A nonresident individual who is a 24    partner or shareholder of a partnership or Subchapter S 25    corporation for a taxable year for which an election is in 26    effect under paragraph (1) shall not be required to file   HB2608- 45 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1    an income tax return under this Act for such taxable year 2    if the only source of net income of the individual (or the 3    individual and the individual's spouse in the case of a 4    joint return) is from an entity making the election under 5    paragraph (1) and the credit allowed to the partner or 6    shareholder under paragraph (4) equals or exceeds the 7    individual's liability for the tax imposed under 8    subsections (a) and (b) of Section 201 of this Act for the 9    taxable year.10        (6) Liability for tax. Except as provided in this 11    paragraph, a partnership or Subchapter S making the 12    election under paragraph (1) is liable for the 13    entity-level tax imposed under paragraph (2). If the 14    electing partnership or corporation fails to pay the full 15    amount of tax deemed assessed under paragraph (2), the 16    partners or shareholders shall be liable to pay the tax 17    assessed (including penalties and interest). Each partner 18    or shareholder shall be liable for the unpaid assessment 19    based on the ratio of the partner's or shareholder's share 20    of the net income of the partnership over the total net 21    income of the partnership. If the partnership or 22    Subchapter S corporation fails to pay the tax assessed 23    (including penalties and interest) and thereafter an 24    amount of such tax is paid by the partners or 25    shareholders, such amount shall not be collected from the 26    partnership or corporation.   HB2608- 46 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1        (7) Foreign tax. For purposes of the credit allowed 2    under Section 601(b)(3) of this Act, tax paid by a 3    partnership or Subchapter S corporation to another state 4    which, as determined by the Department, is substantially 5    similar to the tax imposed under this subsection, shall be 6    considered tax paid by the partner or shareholder to the 7    extent that the partner's or shareholder's share of the 8    income of the partnership or Subchapter S corporation 9    allocated and apportioned to such other state bears to the 10    total income of the partnership or Subchapter S 11    corporation allocated or apportioned to such other state. 12        (8) Suspension of withholding. The provisions of 13    Section 709.5 of this Act shall not apply to a partnership 14    or Subchapter S corporation for the taxable year for which 15    an election under paragraph (1) is in effect. 16        (9) Requirement to pay estimated tax. For each taxable 17    year for which an election under paragraph (1) is in 18    effect, a partnership or Subchapter S corporation is 19    required to pay estimated tax for such taxable year under 20    Sections 803 and 804 of this Act if the amount payable as 21    estimated tax can reasonably be expected to exceed $500. 22        (10) The provisions of this subsection shall apply 23    only with respect to taxable years for which the 24    limitation on individual deductions applies under Section 25    164(b)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. 26(Source: P.A. 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 102-658, eff. 8-27-21;   HB2608- 47 -LRB104 10353 HLH 20427 b1103-9, eff. 6-7-23; 103-396, eff. 1-1-24; 103-595, eff. 26-26-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24.) 3    Section 99.
