No other 23designation such as a political slogan, title, or degree or 24nickname suggesting or implying possession of a title, degree 25or professional status, or similar information may be used in 26connection with the candidate's surname.

Whenever a proposition is submitted to 18the electors at the same election, the ballots for or against 19such proposition shall always be canvassed, counted or 20tallied. The votes shall be canvassed in the room or place 21where the election is held, and the judges shall not allow the 22ballot box, or any of the ballots, or the applications for 23ballot, or any of the tally sheets to be removed or carried 24away from such room or place, until the canvass of the vote is 25completed, and the returns carefully enveloped and sealed up 26as provided by law.  HB2431- 20 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1    Where voting machines or electronic voting systems are 2used, the provisions of this section may be modified as 3required or authorized by Article 24 or Article 24A, whichever 4is applicable.5    Where ranked-choice ballot tallying is used for an office 6elected by ranked-choice voting, the provisions of this 7Section may be modified as required or authorized by Section 816-4.2 or Section 17-18.2 of this Code, whichever is 9applicable. 10(Source: P.A. 83-333.) 11    (10 ILCS 5/17-18.2 new)12    Sec. 17-18.2. Ranked-choice ballot tallying.13    (a) As used in this Section,14    "Batch elimination" means the simultaneous defeat of 15multiple candidates for whom it is mathematically impossible 16to be elected.17    "Continuing ballot" means a ballot that is not an 18exhausted ballot.19    "Continuing candidate" means a candidate who has not been 20defeated.21    "Exhausted ballot" means a ballot that does not rank any 22continuing candidate, contains an overvote at the highest 23continuing ranking or contains 2 or more sequential skipped 24rankings before its highest continuing ranking.25    "Highest continuing ranking" means the highest ranking on   HB2431- 21 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1a voter's ballot for a continuing candidate.2    "Last-place candidate" means the candidate with the fewest 3votes in a round of the ranked-choice voting tallying.4    "Mathematically impossible to be elected," with respect to 5a candidate, means either:6        (1) the candidate cannot be elected because the 7    candidate's vote total in a round of the ranked-choice 8    voting tabulation plus all votes that could possibly be 9    transferred to the candidate in future rounds from 10    candidates with fewer votes or an equal number of votes 11    would not be enough to surpass the candidate with the 12    next-higher vote total in the round; or13        (2) the candidate has a lower vote total than a 14    candidate described in subparagraph (1) of this 15    definition.16    "Overvote" means a circumstance in which a voter has 17ranked more than one candidate at the same ranking.18    "Round" means an instance of the sequence of voting 19tabulation steps established in subsection (b) of this 20Section.21    "Skipped ranking" means a circumstance in which a voter 22has left a ranking blank and ranks a candidate at a subsequent 23ranking.24    (b) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this 25Section, the following procedures are used to determine the 26winner in an election for an office elected by ranked-choice   HB2431- 22 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1voting. Tallying must proceed in rounds. In each round, the 2number of votes for each continuing candidate must be counted. 3Each continuing ballot counts as one vote for its 4highest-ranked continuing candidate for that round. Exhausted 5ballots are not counted for any continuing candidate. The 6round then ends with one of the following 2 potential 7outcomes:8        (1) If there are 2 or fewer continuing candidates, the 9    candidate with the most votes is declared the winner of 10    the election.11        (2) If there are more than 2 continuing candidates, 12    the last-place candidate is defeated and a new round 13    begins.14    (c) A tie under this Section between candidates for the 15most votes in the final round or a tie between last-place 16candidates in any round must be decided by lot, and the 17candidate chosen by lot is defeated. The result of the tie 18resolution must be recorded and reused in the event of a 19recount. Election authorities may resolve prospective ties 20between candidates before the election.21    (d) Modification of a ranked-choice voting ballot and 22tabulation is permitted in accordance with the following:23        (1) The number of allowable rankings may be limited to 24    no fewer than 6.25        (2) Two or more candidates may be defeated 26    simultaneously by batch elimination in any round of   HB2431- 23 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1    tabulation.2    (e) For all statutory and constitutional provisions in the 3State pertaining to the rights of political parties, the 4number of votes cast for a party's candidate for an office 5elected by ranked-choice voting is the number of votes 6credited to that candidate after the initial counting in the 7first round described in subsection (b).8    (f) The State Board of Elections may adopt rules to 9implement the provisions of this Section. 10    (10 ILCS 5/18-5)  (from Ch. 46, par. 18-5)11    Sec. 18-5. Any person desiring to vote and whose name is 12found upon the register of voters by the person having charge 13thereof, shall then be questioned by one of the judges as to 14his nativity, his term of residence at present address, 15precinct, State and United States, his age, whether 16naturalized and if so the date of naturalization papers and 17court from which secured, and he shall be asked to state his 18residence when last previously registered and the date of the 19election for which he then registered. The judges of elections 20shall check each application for ballot against the list of 21voters registered in that precinct to whom grace period, vote 22by mail, and early ballots have been issued for that election, 23which shall be provided by the election authority and which 24list shall be available for inspection by pollwatchers. A 25voter applying to vote in the precinct on election day whose   HB2431- 24 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1name appears on the list as having been issued a grace period, 2vote by mail, or early ballot shall not be permitted to vote in 3the precinct, except that a voter to whom a vote by mail ballot 4was issued may vote in the precinct if the voter submits to the 5election judges that vote by mail ballot for cancellation. If 6the voter is unable to submit the vote by mail ballot, it shall 7be sufficient for the voter to submit to the election judges 8(i) a portion of the vote by mail ballot if the vote by mail 9ballot was torn or mutilated or (ii) an affidavit executed 10before the election judges specifying that (A) the voter never 11received a vote by mail ballot or (B) the voter completed and 12returned a vote by mail ballot and was informed that the 13election authority did not receive that vote by mail ballot. 14If such person so registered shall be challenged as 15disqualified, the party challenging shall assign his reasons 16therefor, and thereupon one of the judges shall administer to 17him an oath to answer questions, and if he shall take the oath 18he shall then be questioned by the judge or judges touching 19such cause of challenge, and touching any other cause of 20disqualification. And he may also be questioned by the person 21challenging him in regard to his qualifications and identity. 22But if a majority of the judges are of the opinion that he is 23the person so registered and a qualified voter, his vote shall 24then be received accordingly. But if his vote be rejected by 25such judges, such person may afterward produce and deliver an 26affidavit to such judges, subscribed and sworn to by him   HB2431- 25 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1before one of the judges, in which it shall be stated how long 2he has resided in such precinct, and state; that he is a 3citizen of the United States, and is a duly qualified voter in 4such precinct, and that he is the identical person so 5registered. In addition to such an affidavit, the person so 6challenged shall provide to the judges of election proof of 7residence by producing 2 forms of identification showing the 8person's current residence address, provided that such 9identification may include a lease or contract for a residence 10and not more than one piece of mail addressed to the person at 11his current residence address and postmarked not earlier than 1230 days prior to the date of the election, or the person shall 13procure a witness personally known to the judges of election, 14and resident in the precinct (or district), or who shall be 15proved by some legal voter of such precinct or district, known 16to the judges to be such, who shall take the oath following, 17viz: 18    I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am a resident of 19this election precinct (or district), and entitled to vote at 20this election, and that I have been a resident of this State 21for 30 days last past, and am well acquainted with the person 22whose vote is now offered; that he is an actual and bona fide 23resident of this election precinct (or district), and has 24resided herein 30 days, and as I verily believe, in this State, 2530 days next preceding this election. 26    The oath in each case may be administered by one of the   HB2431- 26 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1judges of election, or by any officer, resident in the 2precinct or district, authorized by law to administer oaths. 3Also supported by an affidavit by a registered voter residing 4in such precinct, stating his own residence, and that he knows 5such person; and that he does reside at the place mentioned and 6has resided in such precinct and state for the length of time 7as stated by such person, which shall be subscribed and sworn 8to in the same way. For purposes of this Section, the 9submission of a photo identification issued by a college or 10university, accompanied by either (i) a copy of the 11applicant's contract or lease for a residence or (ii) one 12piece of mail addressed to the person at his or her current 13residence address and postmarked not earlier than 30 days 14prior to the date of the election, shall be sufficient to 15establish proof of residence. Whereupon the vote of such 16person shall be received, and entered as other votes. But such 17judges, having charge of such registers, shall state in their 18respective books the facts in such case, and the affidavits, 19so delivered to the judges, shall be preserved and returned to 20the office of the commissioners of election. Blank affidavits 21of the character aforesaid shall be sent out to the judges of 22all the precincts, and the judges of election shall furnish 23the same on demand and administer the oaths without criticism. 24Such oaths, if administered by any other officer than such 25judge of election, shall not be received. Whenever a proposal 26for a constitutional amendment or for the calling of a   HB2431- 27 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1constitutional convention is to be voted upon at the election, 2the separate blue ballot or ballots pertaining thereto shall 3be placed on top of the other ballots to be voted at the 4election in such manner that the legend appearing on the back 5thereof, as prescribed in Section 16-6 of this Act, shall be 6plainly visible to the voter, and in this fashion the ballots 7shall be handed to the voter by the judge. 8    Immediately after voting, the voter shall be instructed 9whether the voting equipment, if used, accepted or rejected 10the ballot or identified the ballot as under-voted. A voter 11whose ballot is identified as under-voted for an office 12elected by ranked-choice voting a statewide constitutional 13office may return to the voting booth and complete the voting 14of that ballot. A voter whose ballot is not accepted by the 15voting equipment may, upon surrendering the ballot, request 16and vote another ballot. If a ballot for an office elected by 17ranked-choice voting is considered under-voted because the 18ballot has crosses (X) for 2 or more candidates, the voter may, 19upon surrendering the ballot, request and vote upon another 20ballot. The voter's surrendered ballot shall be initialed by 21the election judge and handled as provided in the appropriate 22Article governing that voting equipment.23    The voter shall, upon quitting the voting booth, deliver 24to one of the judges of election all of the ballots, properly 25folded, which he received. The judge of election to whom the 26voter delivers his ballots shall not accept the same unless   HB2431- 28 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1all of the ballots given to the voter are returned by him. If a 2voter delivers less than all of the ballots given to him, the 3judge to whom the same are offered shall advise him in a voice 4clearly audible to the other judges of election that the voter 5must return the remainder of the ballots. The statement of the 6judge to the voter shall clearly express the fact that the 7voter is not required to vote such remaining ballots but that 8whether or not he votes them he must fold and deliver them to 9the judge. In making such statement the judge of election 10shall not indicate by word, gesture or intonation of voice 11that the unreturned ballots shall be voted in any particular 12manner. No new voter shall be permitted to enter the voting 13booth of a voter who has failed to deliver the total number of 14ballots received by him until such voter has returned to the 15voting booth pursuant to the judge's request and again quit 16the booth with all of the ballots required to be returned by 17him. Upon receipt of all such ballots the judges of election 18shall enter the name of the voter, and his number, as above 19provided in this Section, and the judge to whom the ballots are 20delivered shall immediately put the ballots into the ballot 21box. If any voter who has failed to deliver all the ballots 22received by him refuses to return to the voting booth after 23being advised by the judge of election as herein provided, the 24judge shall inform the other judges of such refusal, and 25thereupon the ballot or ballots returned to the judge shall be 26deposited in the ballot box, the voter shall be permitted to   HB2431- 29 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1depart from the polling place, and a new voter shall be 2permitted to enter the voting booth. 3    The judge of election who receives the ballot or ballots 4from the voter shall announce the residence and name of such 5voter in a loud voice. The judge shall put the ballot or 6ballots received from the voter into the ballot box in the 7presence of the voter and the judges of election, and in plain 8view of the public. The judges having charge of such registers 9shall then, in a column prepared thereon, in the same line of, 10the name of the voter, mark "Voted" or the letter "V". 11    No judge of election shall accept from any voter less than 12the full number of ballots received by such voter without 13first advising the voter in the manner above provided of the 14necessity of returning all of the ballots, nor shall any such 15judge advise such voter in a manner contrary to that which is 16herein permitted, or in any other manner violate the 17provisions of this Section; provided, that the acceptance by a 18judge of election of less than the full number of ballots 19delivered to a voter who refuses to return to the voting booth 20after being properly advised by such judge shall not be a 21violation of this Section. 22    Where ranked-choice ballot tallying is used for an office 23elected by ranked-choice voting, the voter may rank his or her 24preferences for the candidates for that office. A voter shall 25not be required to rank all candidates for that office. A cross 26(X) for only one candidate shall be interpreted as a vote of   HB2431- 30 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1rank 1 for that particular candidate, with no other candidate 2being ranked. Crosses (X) for 2 or more candidates shall not 3count as votes for any candidate, and shall cause the ballot to 4be identified as under-voted, shall be subject to the 5provisions for under-voted ballots in this Section. 6(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 7    (10 ILCS 5/18-9)  (from Ch. 46, par. 18-9)8    Sec. 18-9. The judges of election shall first count the 9whole number of ballots in the box. If the ballots shall be 10found to exceed the number of applications for ballot, they 11shall reject the ballots, if any, found folded inside of a 12ballot. And if the ballots and the applications for ballot 13still do not agree after such rejection, the ballots shall be 14replaced in the box and the box closed and well shaken, and 15again opened; and one of the judges shall publicly draw out so 16many ballots unopened as shall be equal to such excess. Such 17excess ballots shall be marked "Excess-Not Counted" and signed 18by a majority of judges and shall be placed in the "After 6:00 19p.m. Defective Ballots Envelope". The number of excess ballots 20shall be noted in the remarks section of the Certificate of 21Results. "Excess" ballots shall not be counted in the total of 22"defective" ballots. And the ballots and applications for 23ballot being made to agree in this way, the judges shall 24proceed to count the votes in the following manner: The judges 25shall open the ballots and place those which contain the same   HB2431- 31 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1names together, so that the several kinds shall be in separate 2piles or on separate files. Each of the judges shall examine 3the separate files which are, or are supposed to be, alike, and 4exclude from such files any which may have a name or an 5erasure, or in any manner shall be different from the others of 6such file. One of the judges shall then take one file of the 7kind of ballots which contain the same names, and count them by 8tens, carefully examining each name on each of the ballots. 9Such judge shall then pass the ten ballots aforesaid to the 10judge sitting next to him, who shall count them in the same 11manner, who shall then pass them to a third judge, who shall 12also count them in the same manner. Then the third judge shall 13call the names of the persons named in the ten ballots, and the 14offices for which they are designated, and 2 of the judges, who 15did not assist in the counting shall tally ten votes for each 16of such persons, except as herein otherwise provided. When the 17judges shall have gone through such file of ballots, 18containing the same names, and shall count them by tens in the 19same way, and shall call the names of the persons named in the 20ballots and the office for which they are designated, the 21tally judges shall tally the votes by tens for each of such 22persons in the same manner as in the first instance. When the 23counting of each file of ballots which contain the same names 24shall be completed, the tally judges shall compare their 25tallies together and ascertain the total number of ballots of 26that kind so canvassed; and when they agree upon the number,   HB2431- 32 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1one of them shall announce it in a loud voice to the other 2judges. The judges shall then canvass the other kinds of 3ballots which do not correspond, those containing names partly 4from one kind of ballots and partly from another, being those 5from which the name of the person proper to be voted for on 6such ballots has been omitted or erased, usually called 7"scratched tickets". They shall be canvassed separately by one 8of the judges sitting between 2 other judges, which judge 9shall call each name to the tally judges and the office for 10which it is designated, and the other judges looking at the 11ballot at the same time, and the tally judges making tally of 12the same. When all the ballots have been canvassed in this 13manner, the tally judges shall compare their tallies together, 14and ascertain the total number of votes received by each 15candidate and when they agree upon the numbers one of them 16shall announce in a loud voice to the judges the number of 17votes received by each candidate on each of the kinds of 18ballots containing his name, the number received by him on 19scratch tickets, and the total number of votes received by 20him. 21    The votes for the offices of Governor and Lieutenant 22Governor shall be counted and tallied jointly.23    Where voting machines or electronic voting systems are 24used, the provisions of this section may be modified as 25required or authorized by Article 24 or Article 24A, whichever 26is applicable.  HB2431- 33 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1    Where ranked-choice ballot tallying is used for an office 2elected by ranked-choice voting, the provisions of this 3Section may be modified as required or authorized by Section 416-4.2 of this Code and the judges shall abide by Section 517-18.2 of this Code, as applicable. 6(Source: P.A. 89-700, eff. 1-17-97.)

Any county clerk refusing, 2neglecting or failing to print on the official ballot the 3names of candidates of the several political parties in the 4order certified by the State Board of Elections, and any 5county clerk who prints or causes to be printed upon the 6official ballot the name of a candidate, for an office to be 7filled by the Electors of the entire State, whose name has not 8been duly certified to him upon a certificate signed by the 9State Board of Elections shall be guilty of a Class C 10misdemeanor.11    (b) When an electronic voting system is used which 12utilizes a ballot card, on the inside flap of each ballot card 13envelope there shall be printed a form for write-in voting 14which shall be substantially as follows:15WRITE-IN VOTES16    (See card of instructions for specific information. 17Duplicate form below by hand for additional write-in votes.) 18     ............................. 19     Title of Office 20(   ) ............................. 21     Name of Candidate22    Write-in lines equal to the number of candidates for which 23a voter may vote shall be printed for an office only if one or 24more persons filed declarations of intent to be write-in 25candidates or qualify to file declarations to be write-in 26candidates under Sections 17-16.1 and 18-9.1 when the   HB2431- 11 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1certification of ballot contains the words "OBJECTION 2PENDING". 3    (c) When an electronic voting system is used which uses a 4ballot sheet, the instructions to voters on the ballot sheet 5shall refer the voter to the card of instructions for specific 6information on write-in voting. Below each office appearing on 7such ballot sheet there shall be a provision for the casting of 8a write-in vote. Write-in lines equal to the number of 9candidates for which a voter may vote shall be printed for an 10office only if one or more persons filed declarations of 11intent to be write-in candidates or qualify to file 12declarations to be write-in candidates under Sections 17-16.1 13and 18-9.1 when the certification of ballot contains the words 14"OBJECTION PENDING". 15    (d) When such electronic system is used, there shall be 16printed on the back of each ballot card, each ballot card 17envelope, and the first page of the ballot label when a ballot 18label is used, the words "Official Ballot," followed by the 19number of the precinct or other precinct identification, which 20may be stamped, in lieu thereof and, as applicable, the number 21and name of the township, ward or other election district for 22which the ballot card, ballot card envelope, and ballot label 23are prepared, the date of the election and a facsimile of the 24signature of the election authority who has caused the ballots 25to be printed. The back of the ballot card shall also include a 26method of identifying the ballot configuration such as a   HB2431- 12 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1listing of the political subdivisions and districts for which 2votes may be cast on that ballot, or a number code identifying 3the ballot configuration or color coded ballots, except that 4where there is only one ballot configuration in a precinct, 5the precinct identification, and any applicable ward 6identification, shall be sufficient. Ballot card envelopes 7used in punch card systems shall be of paper through which no 8writing or punches may be discerned and shall be of sufficient 9length to enclose all voting positions. However, the election 10authority may provide ballot card envelopes on which no 11precinct number or township, ward or other election district 12designation, or election date are preprinted, if space and a 13preprinted form are provided below the space provided for the 14names of write-in candidates where such information may be 15entered by the judges of election. Whenever an election 16authority utilizes ballot card envelopes on which the election 17date and precinct is not preprinted, a judge of election shall 18mark such information for the particular precinct and election 19on the envelope in ink before tallying and counting any 20write-in vote written thereon. If some method of insuring 21ballot secrecy other than an envelope is used, such 22information must be provided on the ballot itself.23    (e) In the designation of the name of a candidate on the 24ballot, the candidate's given name or names, initial or 25initials, a nickname by which the candidate is commonly known, 26or a combination thereof, may be used in addition to the   HB2431- 13 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1candidate's surname. If a candidate has changed his or her 2name, whether by a statutory or common law procedure in 3Illinois or any other jurisdiction, within 3 years before the 4last day for filing the petition for nomination, nomination 5papers, or certificate of nomination for that office, 6whichever is applicable, then (i) the candidate's name on the 7ballot must be followed by "formerly known as (list all prior 8names during the 3-year period) until name changed on (list 9date of each such name change)" and (ii) the petition, papers, 10or certificate must be accompanied by the candidate's 11affidavit stating the candidate's previous names during the 12period specified in (i) and the date or dates each of those 13names was changed; failure to meet these requirements shall be 14grounds for denying certification of the candidate's name for 15the ballot or removing the candidate's name from the ballot, 16as appropriate, but these requirements do not apply to name 17changes resulting from adoption to assume an adoptive parent's 18or parents' surname, marriage or civil union to assume a 19spouse's surname, or dissolution of marriage or civil union or 20declaration of invalidity of marriage or civil union to assume 21a former surname or a name change that conforms the 22candidate's name to his or her gender identity. No other 23designation such as a political slogan, title, or degree or 24nickname suggesting or implying possession of a title, degree 25or professional status, or similar information may be used in 26connection with the candidate's surname. For purposes of this   HB2431- 14 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1Section, a "political slogan" is defined as any word or words 2expressing or connoting a position, opinion, or belief that 3the candidate may espouse, including, but not limited to, any 4word or words conveying any meaning other than that of the 5personal identity of the candidate. A candidate may not use a 6political slogan as part of his or her name on the ballot, 7notwithstanding that the political slogan may be part of the 8candidate's name.9    (f) The State Board of Elections, a local election 10official, or an election authority shall remove any 11candidate's name designation from a ballot that is 12inconsistent with subsection (e) of this Section. In addition, 13the State Board of Elections, a local election official, or an 14election authority shall not certify to any election authority 15any candidate name designation that is inconsistent with 16subsection (e) of this Section.17    (g) If the State Board of Elections, a local election 18official, or an election authority removes a candidate's name 19designation from a ballot under subsection (f) of this 20Section, then the aggrieved candidate may seek appropriate 21relief in circuit court.22    Where voting machines or electronic voting systems are 23used, the provisions of this Section may be modified as 24required or authorized by Article 24 or Article 24A, whichever 25is applicable.26    Nothing in this Section shall prohibit election   HB2431- 15 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1authorities from using or reusing ballot card envelopes which 2were printed before January 1, 1986 (the effective date of 3Public Act 84-820).4(Source: P.A. 102-15, eff. 6-17-21; 103-154, eff. 6-30-23; 5103-467, eff. 8-4-23; revised 7-23-24.) 6    (10 ILCS 5/16-4.2 new)7    Sec. 16-4.2. Ranked-choice ballots.8    (a) For an election for an office elected by ranked-choice 9voting that has more than 2 choices, the ballot shall be laid 10out to allow the voter to rank the candidates for an office in 11order of preference. Space shall be provided for a voter to 12include one write-in candidate if he or she desires. The 13ballot shall be as simple and easy to understand as possible. 14Any ballot laid out in such a manner shall be tallied in 15accordance with Section 17-18.2 of this Code.16    (b) All other requirements of this Article apply with 17regards to ballots for offices elected by ranked-choice voting 18to the extent that they do not contradict the provisions of 19this amendatory Act of the 104th General Assembly. 20    (10 ILCS 5/17-11)  (from Ch. 46, par. 17-11)21    Sec. 17-11. On receipt of his ballot the voter shall 22forthwith, and without leaving the inclosed space, retire 23alone, or accompanied by children as provided in Section 17-8, 24to one of the voting booths so provided and shall prepare his   HB2431- 16 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1ballot by making in the appropriate margin or place a cross (X) 2opposite the name of the candidate of his choice for each 3office to be filled, or by writing in the name of the candidate 4of his choice in a blank space on said ticket, making a cross 5(X) opposite thereto; and in case of a question submitted to 6the vote of the people, by making in the appropriate margin or 7place a cross (X) against the answer he desires to give. A 8cross (X) in the square in front of the bracket enclosing the 9names of a team of candidates for Governor and Lieutenant 10Governor counts as one vote for each of such candidates. 11Before leaving the voting booth the voter shall fold his 12ballot in such manner as to conceal the marks thereon. He shall 13then vote forthwith in the manner herein provided, except that 14the number corresponding to the number of the voter on the poll 15books shall not be indorsed on the back of his ballot. He shall 16mark and deliver his ballot without undue delay, and shall 17quit said inclosed space as soon as he has voted; except that 18immediately after voting, the voter shall be instructed 19whether the voting equipment, if used, accepted or rejected 20the ballot or identified the ballot as under-voted for a 21statewide constitutional office. A voter whose ballot is 22identified as under-voted may return to the voting booth and 23complete the voting of that ballot. A voter whose ballot is not 24accepted by the voting equipment may, upon surrendering the 25ballot, request and vote another ballot. The voter's 26surrendered ballot shall be initialed by the election judge   HB2431- 17 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1and handled as provided in the appropriate Article governing 2that voting equipment. 3    No voter shall be allowed to occupy a voting booth already 4occupied by another, nor remain within said inclosed space 5more than ten minutes, nor to occupy a voting booth more than 6five minutes in case all of said voting booths are in use and 7other voters waiting to occupy the same. No voter not an 8election officer, shall, after having voted, be allowed to 9re-enter said inclosed space during said election. No person 10shall take or remove any ballot from the polling place before 11the close of the poll. No voter shall vote or offer to vote any 12ballot except such as he has received from the judges of 13election in charge of the ballots. Any voter who shall, by 14accident or mistake, spoil his ballot, may, on returning said 15spoiled ballot, receive another in place thereof only after 16the word "spoiled" has been written in ink diagonally across 17the entire face of the ballot returned by the voter.18    Where voting machines or electronic voting systems are 19used, the provisions of this section may be modified as 20required or authorized by Article 24, 24A, 24B, or 24C, 21whichever is applicable, except that the requirements of this 22Section that (i) the voter must be notified of the voting 23equipment's acceptance or rejection of the voter's ballot or 24identification of an under-vote for a statewide constitutional 25office and (ii) the voter shall have the opportunity to 26correct an under-vote or surrender the ballot that was not   HB2431- 18 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1accepted and vote another ballot shall not be modified.2    Where a ranked-choice balloting is used for an office 3elected by ranked-choice balloting, the voter may rank his or 4her preferences for the candidates for that office. A voter 5shall not be required to rank all candidates for that office. A 6cross (X) for only one candidate shall be interpreted as a vote 7of rank 1 for that particular candidate, with no other 8candidate being ranked. Crosses (X) for 2 or more candidates 9shall not count as votes for any candidate, and shall cause the 10ballot to be identified as under-voted, subject to the 11provisions for under-voted ballots under Section 18-5. 12(Source: P.A. 94-288, eff. 1-1-06; 95-699, eff. 11-9-07.) 13    (10 ILCS 5/17-18)  (from Ch. 46, par. 17-18)14    Sec. 17-18. Immediately upon closing the polls the judges 15shall proceed to canvass the votes polled. They shall first 16count the whole number of ballots in the box. If 2 or more 17ballots are folded together so as to appear to have been cast 18by the same person, all of the ballots so folded together shall 19be marked and returned with the other ballots in the same 20conditions, as near as may be, in which they were found when 21first opened, but shall not be counted. If the remaining 22ballots shall be found to exceed the number of applications 23for ballot, the ballots shall be replaced in the box, and the 24box closed and well shaken and again opened and one of the 25judges shall publicly draw out so many ballots unopened as   HB2431- 19 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1shall be equal to such excess; and the number of the ballots 2agreeing with the poll lists, or being made to agree. Such 3excess ballots shall be marked "Excess-Not Counted" and signed 4by a majority of the judges and shall be placed in the "After 56:00 p.m. Defective Ballots Envelope". The number of excess 6ballots shall be noted in the remarks section of the 7Certificate of Results. "Excess" ballots shall not be counted 8in the total of "defective" ballots.9    The judges shall then proceed to count and record the 10votes; and when the judges of election shall open and read the 11ballots, 3 judges, with at least one from each political party 12from which the precinct judges were chosen, shall carefully 13and correctly mark down upon the three tally sheets the vote 14each candidate has received, in a separate box prepared for 15that purpose, with the name of such candidate at the head of 16such box, and the office designated by the votes such 17candidate shall fill. Whenever a proposition is submitted to 18the electors at the same election, the ballots for or against 19such proposition shall always be canvassed, counted or 20tallied. The votes shall be canvassed in the room or place 21where the election is held, and the judges shall not allow the 22ballot box, or any of the ballots, or the applications for 23ballot, or any of the tally sheets to be removed or carried 24away from such room or place, until the canvass of the vote is 25completed, and the returns carefully enveloped and sealed up 26as provided by law.  HB2431- 20 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1    Where voting machines or electronic voting systems are 2used, the provisions of this section may be modified as 3required or authorized by Article 24 or Article 24A, whichever 4is applicable.5    Where ranked-choice ballot tallying is used for an office 6elected by ranked-choice voting, the provisions of this 7Section may be modified as required or authorized by Section 816-4.2 or Section 17-18.2 of this Code, whichever is 9applicable. 10(Source: P.A. 83-333.) 11    (10 ILCS 5/17-18.2 new)12    Sec. 17-18.2. Ranked-choice ballot tallying.13    (a) As used in this Section,14    "Batch elimination" means the simultaneous defeat of 15multiple candidates for whom it is mathematically impossible 16to be elected.17    "Continuing ballot" means a ballot that is not an 18exhausted ballot.19    "Continuing candidate" means a candidate who has not been 20defeated.21    "Exhausted ballot" means a ballot that does not rank any 22continuing candidate, contains an overvote at the highest 23continuing ranking or contains 2 or more sequential skipped 24rankings before its highest continuing ranking.25    "Highest continuing ranking" means the highest ranking on   HB2431- 21 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1a voter's ballot for a continuing candidate.2    "Last-place candidate" means the candidate with the fewest 3votes in a round of the ranked-choice voting tallying.4    "Mathematically impossible to be elected," with respect to 5a candidate, means either:6        (1) the candidate cannot be elected because the 7    candidate's vote total in a round of the ranked-choice 8    voting tabulation plus all votes that could possibly be 9    transferred to the candidate in future rounds from 10    candidates with fewer votes or an equal number of votes 11    would not be enough to surpass the candidate with the 12    next-higher vote total in the round; or13        (2) the candidate has a lower vote total than a 14    candidate described in subparagraph (1) of this 15    definition.16    "Overvote" means a circumstance in which a voter has 17ranked more than one candidate at the same ranking.18    "Round" means an instance of the sequence of voting 19tabulation steps established in subsection (b) of this 20Section.21    "Skipped ranking" means a circumstance in which a voter 22has left a ranking blank and ranks a candidate at a subsequent 23ranking.24    (b) Except as provided in subsections (c) and (d) of this 25Section, the following procedures are used to determine the 26winner in an election for an office elected by ranked-choice   HB2431- 22 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1voting. Tallying must proceed in rounds. In each round, the 2number of votes for each continuing candidate must be counted. 3Each continuing ballot counts as one vote for its 4highest-ranked continuing candidate for that round. Exhausted 5ballots are not counted for any continuing candidate. The 6round then ends with one of the following 2 potential 7outcomes:8        (1) If there are 2 or fewer continuing candidates, the 9    candidate with the most votes is declared the winner of 10    the election.11        (2) If there are more than 2 continuing candidates, 12    the last-place candidate is defeated and a new round 13    begins.14    (c) A tie under this Section between candidates for the 15most votes in the final round or a tie between last-place 16candidates in any round must be decided by lot, and the 17candidate chosen by lot is defeated. The result of the tie 18resolution must be recorded and reused in the event of a 19recount. Election authorities may resolve prospective ties 20between candidates before the election.21    (d) Modification of a ranked-choice voting ballot and 22tabulation is permitted in accordance with the following:23        (1) The number of allowable rankings may be limited to 24    no fewer than 6.25        (2) Two or more candidates may be defeated 26    simultaneously by batch elimination in any round of   HB2431- 23 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1    tabulation.2    (e) For all statutory and constitutional provisions in the 3State pertaining to the rights of political parties, the 4number of votes cast for a party's candidate for an office 5elected by ranked-choice voting is the number of votes 6credited to that candidate after the initial counting in the 7first round described in subsection (b).8    (f) The State Board of Elections may adopt rules to 9implement the provisions of this Section. 10    (10 ILCS 5/18-5)  (from Ch. 46, par. 18-5)11    Sec. 18-5. Any person desiring to vote and whose name is 12found upon the register of voters by the person having charge 13thereof, shall then be questioned by one of the judges as to 14his nativity, his term of residence at present address, 15precinct, State and United States, his age, whether 16naturalized and if so the date of naturalization papers and 17court from which secured, and he shall be asked to state his 18residence when last previously registered and the date of the 19election for which he then registered. The judges of elections 20shall check each application for ballot against the list of 21voters registered in that precinct to whom grace period, vote 22by mail, and early ballots have been issued for that election, 23which shall be provided by the election authority and which 24list shall be available for inspection by pollwatchers.

If 6the voter is unable to submit the vote by mail ballot, it shall 7be sufficient for the voter to submit to the election judges 8(i) a portion of the vote by mail ballot if the vote by mail 9ballot was torn or mutilated or (ii) an affidavit executed 10before the election judges specifying that (A) the voter never 11received a vote by mail ballot or (B) the voter completed and 12returned a vote by mail ballot and was informed that the 13election authority did not receive that vote by mail ballot. 14If such person so registered shall be challenged as 15disqualified, the party challenging shall assign his reasons 16therefor, and thereupon one of the judges shall administer to 17him an oath to answer questions, and if he shall take the oath 18he shall then be questioned by the judge or judges touching 19such cause of challenge, and touching any other cause of 20disqualification. And he may also be questioned by the person 21challenging him in regard to his qualifications and identity. 22But if a majority of the judges are of the opinion that he is 23the person so registered and a qualified voter, his vote shall 24then be received accordingly. But if his vote be rejected by 25such judges, such person may afterward produce and deliver an 26affidavit to such judges, subscribed and sworn to by him   HB2431- 25 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1before one of the judges, in which it shall be stated how long 2he has resided in such precinct, and state; that he is a 3citizen of the United States, and is a duly qualified voter in 4such precinct, and that he is the identical person so 5registered. In addition to such an affidavit, the person so 6challenged shall provide to the judges of election proof of 7residence by producing 2 forms of identification showing the 8person's current residence address, provided that such 9identification may include a lease or contract for a residence 10and not more than one piece of mail addressed to the person at 11his current residence address and postmarked not earlier than 1230 days prior to the date of the election, or the person shall 13procure a witness personally known to the judges of election, 14and resident in the precinct (or district), or who shall be 15proved by some legal voter of such precinct or district, known 16to the judges to be such, who shall take the oath following, 17viz: 18    I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am a resident of 19this election precinct (or district), and entitled to vote at 20this election, and that I have been a resident of this State 21for 30 days last past, and am well acquainted with the person 22whose vote is now offered; that he is an actual and bona fide 23resident of this election precinct (or district), and has 24resided herein 30 days, and as I verily believe, in this State, 2530 days next preceding this election. 26    The oath in each case may be administered by one of the   HB2431- 26 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1judges of election, or by any officer, resident in the 2precinct or district, authorized by law to administer oaths. 3Also supported by an affidavit by a registered voter residing 4in such precinct, stating his own residence, and that he knows 5such person; and that he does reside at the place mentioned and 6has resided in such precinct and state for the length of time 7as stated by such person, which shall be subscribed and sworn 8to in the same way. For purposes of this Section, the 9submission of a photo identification issued by a college or 10university, accompanied by either (i) a copy of the 11applicant's contract or lease for a residence or (ii) one 12piece of mail addressed to the person at his or her current 13residence address and postmarked not earlier than 30 days 14prior to the date of the election, shall be sufficient to 15establish proof of residence. Whereupon the vote of such 16person shall be received, and entered as other votes. But such 17judges, having charge of such registers, shall state in their 18respective books the facts in such case, and the affidavits, 19so delivered to the judges, shall be preserved and returned to 20the office of the commissioners of election. Blank affidavits 21of the character aforesaid shall be sent out to the judges of 22all the precincts, and the judges of election shall furnish 23the same on demand and administer the oaths without criticism. 24Such oaths, if administered by any other officer than such 25judge of election, shall not be received. Whenever a proposal 26for a constitutional amendment or for the calling of a   HB2431- 27 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1constitutional convention is to be voted upon at the election, 2the separate blue ballot or ballots pertaining thereto shall 3be placed on top of the other ballots to be voted at the 4election in such manner that the legend appearing on the back 5thereof, as prescribed in Section 16-6 of this Act, shall be 6plainly visible to the voter, and in this fashion the ballots 7shall be handed to the voter by the judge. 8    Immediately after voting, the voter shall be instructed 9whether the voting equipment, if used, accepted or rejected 10the ballot or identified the ballot as under-voted. A voter 11whose ballot is identified as under-voted for an office 12elected by ranked-choice voting a statewide constitutional 13office may return to the voting booth and complete the voting 14of that ballot. A voter whose ballot is not accepted by the 15voting equipment may, upon surrendering the ballot, request 16and vote another ballot. If a ballot for an office elected by 17ranked-choice voting is considered under-voted because the 18ballot has crosses (X) for 2 or more candidates, the voter may, 19upon surrendering the ballot, request and vote upon another 20ballot. The voter's surrendered ballot shall be initialed by 21the election judge and handled as provided in the appropriate 22Article governing that voting equipment.23    The voter shall, upon quitting the voting booth, deliver 24to one of the judges of election all of the ballots, properly 25folded, which he received. The judge of election to whom the 26voter delivers his ballots shall not accept the same unless   HB2431- 28 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1all of the ballots given to the voter are returned by him. If a 2voter delivers less than all of the ballots given to him, the 3judge to whom the same are offered shall advise him in a voice 4clearly audible to the other judges of election that the voter 5must return the remainder of the ballots. The statement of the 6judge to the voter shall clearly express the fact that the 7voter is not required to vote such remaining ballots but that 8whether or not he votes them he must fold and deliver them to 9the judge. In making such statement the judge of election 10shall not indicate by word, gesture or intonation of voice 11that the unreturned ballots shall be voted in any particular 12manner. No new voter shall be permitted to enter the voting 13booth of a voter who has failed to deliver the total number of 14ballots received by him until such voter has returned to the 15voting booth pursuant to the judge's request and again quit 16the booth with all of the ballots required to be returned by 17him. Upon receipt of all such ballots the judges of election 18shall enter the name of the voter, and his number, as above 19provided in this Section, and the judge to whom the ballots are 20delivered shall immediately put the ballots into the ballot 21box. If any voter who has failed to deliver all the ballots 22received by him refuses to return to the voting booth after 23being advised by the judge of election as herein provided, the 24judge shall inform the other judges of such refusal, and 25thereupon the ballot or ballots returned to the judge shall be 26deposited in the ballot box, the voter shall be permitted to   HB2431- 29 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1depart from the polling place, and a new voter shall be 2permitted to enter the voting booth. 3    The judge of election who receives the ballot or ballots 4from the voter shall announce the residence and name of such 5voter in a loud voice. The judge shall put the ballot or 6ballots received from the voter into the ballot box in the 7presence of the voter and the judges of election, and in plain 8view of the public. The judges having charge of such registers 9shall then, in a column prepared thereon, in the same line of, 10the name of the voter, mark "Voted" or the letter "V". 11    No judge of election shall accept from any voter less than 12the full number of ballots received by such voter without 13first advising the voter in the manner above provided of the 14necessity of returning all of the ballots, nor shall any such 15judge advise such voter in a manner contrary to that which is 16herein permitted, or in any other manner violate the 17provisions of this Section; provided, that the acceptance by a 18judge of election of less than the full number of ballots 19delivered to a voter who refuses to return to the voting booth 20after being properly advised by such judge shall not be a 21violation of this Section. 22    Where ranked-choice ballot tallying is used for an office 23elected by ranked-choice voting, the voter may rank his or her 24preferences for the candidates for that office. A voter shall 25not be required to rank all candidates for that office. A cross 26(X) for only one candidate shall be interpreted as a vote of   HB2431- 30 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1rank 1 for that particular candidate, with no other candidate 2being ranked. Crosses (X) for 2 or more candidates shall not 3count as votes for any candidate, and shall cause the ballot to 4be identified as under-voted, shall be subject to the 5provisions for under-voted ballots in this Section. 6(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 7    (10 ILCS 5/18-9)  (from Ch. 46, par. 18-9)8    Sec. 18-9. The judges of election shall first count the 9whole number of ballots in the box. If the ballots shall be 10found to exceed the number of applications for ballot, they 11shall reject the ballots, if any, found folded inside of a 12ballot. And if the ballots and the applications for ballot 13still do not agree after such rejection, the ballots shall be 14replaced in the box and the box closed and well shaken, and 15again opened; and one of the judges shall publicly draw out so 16many ballots unopened as shall be equal to such excess. Such 17excess ballots shall be marked "Excess-Not Counted" and signed 18by a majority of judges and shall be placed in the "After 6:00 19p.m. Defective Ballots Envelope". The number of excess ballots 20shall be noted in the remarks section of the Certificate of 21Results. "Excess" ballots shall not be counted in the total of 22"defective" ballots. And the ballots and applications for 23ballot being made to agree in this way, the judges shall 24proceed to count the votes in the following manner: The judges 25shall open the ballots and place those which contain the same   HB2431- 31 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1names together, so that the several kinds shall be in separate 2piles or on separate files. Each of the judges shall examine 3the separate files which are, or are supposed to be, alike, and 4exclude from such files any which may have a name or an 5erasure, or in any manner shall be different from the others of 6such file. One of the judges shall then take one file of the 7kind of ballots which contain the same names, and count them by 8tens, carefully examining each name on each of the ballots. 9Such judge shall then pass the ten ballots aforesaid to the 10judge sitting next to him, who shall count them in the same 11manner, who shall then pass them to a third judge, who shall 12also count them in the same manner. Then the third judge shall 13call the names of the persons named in the ten ballots, and the 14offices for which they are designated, and 2 of the judges, who 15did not assist in the counting shall tally ten votes for each 16of such persons, except as herein otherwise provided. When the 17judges shall have gone through such file of ballots, 18containing the same names, and shall count them by tens in the 19same way, and shall call the names of the persons named in the 20ballots and the office for which they are designated, the 21tally judges shall tally the votes by tens for each of such 22persons in the same manner as in the first instance. When the 23counting of each file of ballots which contain the same names 24shall be completed, the tally judges shall compare their 25tallies together and ascertain the total number of ballots of 26that kind so canvassed; and when they agree upon the number,   HB2431- 32 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1one of them shall announce it in a loud voice to the other 2judges. The judges shall then canvass the other kinds of 3ballots which do not correspond, those containing names partly 4from one kind of ballots and partly from another, being those 5from which the name of the person proper to be voted for on 6such ballots has been omitted or erased, usually called 7"scratched tickets". They shall be canvassed separately by one 8of the judges sitting between 2 other judges, which judge 9shall call each name to the tally judges and the office for 10which it is designated, and the other judges looking at the 11ballot at the same time, and the tally judges making tally of 12the same. When all the ballots have been canvassed in this 13manner, the tally judges shall compare their tallies together, 14and ascertain the total number of votes received by each 15candidate and when they agree upon the numbers one of them 16shall announce in a loud voice to the judges the number of 17votes received by each candidate on each of the kinds of 18ballots containing his name, the number received by him on 19scratch tickets, and the total number of votes received by 20him. 21    The votes for the offices of Governor and Lieutenant 22Governor shall be counted and tallied jointly.23    Where voting machines or electronic voting systems are 24used, the provisions of this section may be modified as 25required or authorized by Article 24 or Article 24A, whichever 26is applicable.  HB2431- 33 -LRB104 09846 SPS 19914 b1    Where ranked-choice ballot tallying is used for an office 2elected by ranked-choice voting, the provisions of this 3Section may be modified as required or authorized by Section 416-4.2 of this Code and the judges shall abide by Section 517-18.2 of this Code, as applicable. 6(Source: P.A. 89-700, eff. 1-17-97.)
