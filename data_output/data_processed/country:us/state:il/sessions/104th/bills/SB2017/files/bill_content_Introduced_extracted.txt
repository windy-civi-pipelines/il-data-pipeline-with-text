The Illinois Municipal Code is amended by 5changing Section 11-5-9 as follows: 6    (65 ILCS 5/11-5-9)7    Sec. 11-5-9. Truants. The corporate authorities of any 8municipality may adopt ordinances to regulate truants within 9its jurisdiction. These ordinances may not include a graduated 10fine or fee schedule for repeat violations. However, the 11penalty for repeat violations may include , which may not 12exceed $100, or community service, or both, for violators 13 13years of age or older. Such an ordinance and may provide for 14enforcement by citation or through administrative hearings as 15determined by ordinance. If the violator is under 13 years of 16age, the parent or custodian of the violator is subject to the 17fine or community service, or both. As used in this Section, 18"truants" means persons who are within the definition of 19"truant" in Section 26-2a of the School Code. Local officials 20or authorities that enforce, prosecute, or adjudicate 21municipal ordinances adopted under this Section or that work 22with school districts to address truancy problems are 23designated as (i) part of the juvenile justice system,   SB2017- 2 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1established by the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, and (ii) 2"juvenile authorities" within the definition set forth in 3subsection (a)(6.5) of Section 10-6 of the Illinois School 4Student Record Act. Because truancy is a gateway to crime and 5one of the most powerful predictors of juvenile delinquent 6behavior, a school district may disclose education records 7relating to attendance to juvenile authorities if the school 8district determines that the disclosure will enhance the 9juvenile justice system's ability to effectively serve, prior 10to adjudication, the student whose records are released. 11Enforcement of a municipal ordinance adopted under this 12Section is pre-adjudicatory because it helps minors avoid 13adjudicatory hearings under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. A 14school district may make a disclosure authorized under this 15Section only if the juvenile authority certifies in writing to 16the school district that the information will not be 17disclosed, without prior written consent of the parent or 18custodian of the student, to any other individual or entity, 19except as otherwise provided under State law. A home rule unit 20may not regulate truants in a manner inconsistent with the 21provisions of this Section or Sections 10-22.6 and 26-12 of 22the School Code. This Section is a limitation under subsection 23(i) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on 24the concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 25functions exercised by the State.26(Source: P.A. 94-1011, eff. 7-7-06; 95-1016, eff. 6-1-09.)   SB2017- 3 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1    Section 10.

Such request shall be made by registered or 15certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 16the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 17at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 18date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 19hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 20shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 21heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 22as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 23the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 24reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 25is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision   SB2017- 6 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 2the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 3transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 4in Article 13A or 13B of this Code.

For purposes of this 11subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 12other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 13a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 14School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 15such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 16length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.17    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 18out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 19and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 20only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 21disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 22student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 23a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 24the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 25interfere with the operation of the school.

As a matter of public policy, the General 10Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 11privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 12left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 13the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 14conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 15lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 16controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 17illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 18searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 19If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 20evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 21the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 22such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 23disciplinary action may be taken.

For purposes of 23this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 24students, staff, or members of the school community" and 25"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 26operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case   SB2017- 20 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 2(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 3available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 4exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 5shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 6address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 7exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 8suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 9Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 10of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 11interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 12there were no other appropriate and available interventions.13    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 14than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 15support services during the period of their suspension. For 16purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 17support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 18Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 19this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 20to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 21such appropriate and available services. 22    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 23appropriate and available support services.24    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 25re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 26expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In   SB2017- 21 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 2Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 3and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 4suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 5alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 6Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 7    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 8suspended students, including those students suspended from 9the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 10school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 11equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 12a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 13that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 14alternate transportation to school. 15    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 16subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 17subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be 18considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 19parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 20violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 21parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 22emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 23throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 24its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 25student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 26emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany   SB2017- 22 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 2representative or support person must comply with any rules of 3the school district's hearing process. If the representative 4or support person violates the rules or engages in behavior or 5advocacy that harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a 6witness, or anyone else in attendance at the hearing, the 7representative or support person may be prohibited from 8further participation in the hearing or proceeding. A 9suspension or expulsion proceeding under this subsection 10(b-35) must be conducted independently from any ongoing 11criminal investigation or proceeding, and an absence of 12pending or possible criminal charges, criminal investigations, 13or proceedings may not be a factor in school disciplinary 14decisions.15    (b-40) During a suspension review hearing conducted under 16subsection (b) or an expulsion hearing conducted under 17subsection (a) that involves allegations of sexual violence by 18the student who is subject to discipline, neither the student 19nor his or her representative shall directly question nor have 20direct contact with the alleged victim. The student who is 21subject to discipline or his or her representative may, at the 22discretion and direction of the school board or its appointed 23hearing officer, suggest questions to be posed by the school 24board or its appointed hearing officer to the alleged victim. 25    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 26local mental health agency to consult with the board at the   SB2017- 23 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 2the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.3    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 4provide ongoing professional development to all school 5personnel, school board members, and school resource officers 6on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 7adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 8involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 9culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 10environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 11the appropriate and available supportive services for the 12promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 13developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 14positive and healthy school climates. 15    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 16time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 17case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 18brought one of the following objects to school, any 19school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 20that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 21expelled for a period of not less than one year:22        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 23    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 24    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 25    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 26    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section   SB2017- 24 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period 2    under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the 3    superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may 4    be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.5        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon 6    regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other 7    object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily 8    harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in 9    subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). The expulsion 10    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 11    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 12    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 13Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 14consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 15Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 16expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 17transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 18Article 13A of the School Code.19    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 20superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 21principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 22student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 23a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 24calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 25that student has been determined to have made an explicit 26threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a   SB2017- 25 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 2website through which the threat was made is a site that was 3accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 4was available to third parties who worked or studied within 5the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 6the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 7the safety and security of the threatened individual because 8of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 9student inside the school. 10    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 11authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 12lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 13equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 14personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 15without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 16search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 17Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 18privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 19left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 20the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 21conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 22lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 23controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 24illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 25searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 26If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces   SB2017- 26 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 2the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 3such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 4disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also 5turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.6    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or 7expulsion from school and all school activities and a 8prohibition from being present on school grounds.9    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if 10a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any 11public or private school in this or any other state, the 12student must complete the entire term of the suspension or 13expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A 14of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program 15under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the 16school district if there is no threat to the safety of students 17or staff in the alternative program. A school district that 18adopts a policy under this subsection (g) must include a 19provision allowing for consideration of any mitigating 20factors, including, but not limited to, a student's status as 21a parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 22violence, as defined in Article 26A. 23    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 24students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 25difficulties.26    (i) A student is prohibited from being may not be issued a   SB2017- 27 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1monetary fine or fee by any person as a disciplinary 2consequence, though this does shall not preclude requiring a 3student to provide restitution for lost, stolen, or damaged 4property.5    (i-5) As used in this subsection (i-5), "school personnel" 6has the meaning given to that term in Section 27-23.7.7    School personnel of a school district are prohibited from 8referring a student to any other local public entity, as 9defined in Section 1-206 of the Local Governmental and 10Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, or a local law 11enforcement agency for that entity or agency to issue the 12student a monetary fine or fee as a disciplinary consequence. 13This prohibition does not prohibit school personnel from 14referring a matter to that appropriate entity or agency for a 15violation of local, State, or federal law if necessary to 16prevent an imminent threat of serious physical harm to the 17student, other students, school personnel, or other persons, 18for the purpose of self-defense or defense of property, or if 19otherwise required to refer such a matter to the entity or 20agency by local, State, or federal law. 21    (j) Subsections (a) through (i-5) (i) of this Section 22shall apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter 23schools, special charter districts, and school districts 24organized under Article 34 of this Code. 25    (k) Through June 30, 2026, the expulsion of students 26enrolled in programs funded under Section 1C-2 of this Code is   SB2017- 28 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1subject to the requirements under paragraph (7) of subsection 2(a) of Section 2-3.71 of this Code.3    (k-5) On and after July 1, 2026, the expulsion of children 4enrolled in programs funded under Section 15-25 of the 5Department of Early Childhood Act is subject to the 6requirements of paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 715-30 of the Department of Early Childhood Act. 8    (l) An in-school suspension program provided by a school 9district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may 10focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and 11positive interaction with other students and school personnel. 12A school district may employ a school social worker or a 13licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school 14suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12. 15(Source: P.A. 102-466, eff. 7-1-25; 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 16102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-594, eff. 6-25-24; 103-896, eff. 178-9-24; revised 9-25-24.) 18    (105 ILCS 5/26-12)  (from Ch. 122, par. 26-12)19    Sec. 26-12. Punitive action. 20    (a) No punitive action, including out-of-school 21suspensions, expulsions, or court action, shall be taken 22against truant minors for such truancy unless appropriate and 23available supportive services and other school resources have 24been provided to the student. Notwithstanding the provisions 25of Section 10-22.6 of this Code, a truant minor may not be   SB2017- 29 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1expelled for nonattendance unless he or she has accrued 15 2consecutive days of absences without valid cause and the 3student cannot be located by the school district or the school 4district has located the student but cannot, after exhausting 5all available supportive services, compel the student to 6return to school.7    (b) A school district is prohibited from referring may not 8refer a truant, chronic truant, or truant minor to any other 9local public entity, as defined under Section 1-206 of the 10Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity 11Act, for that local public entity to issue the child or the 12child's parent or guardian a fine or a fee as punishment for 13the child's his or her truancy.14    (c) A school district may refer any person having custody 15or control of a truant, chronic truant, or truant minor to any 16other local public entity, as defined under Section 1-206 of 17the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort 18Immunity Act, for that local public entity to issue the person 19a fine or fee for the child's truancy only if the school 20district's truant officer, regional office of education, or 21intermediate service center has been notified of the truant 22behavior and the school district, regional office of 23education, or intermediate service center has offered all 24appropriate and available supportive services and other school 25resources to the child. Before a school district may refer a 26person having custody or control of a child to a municipality,   SB2017- 30 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1as defined under Section 1-1-2 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 2the school district must provide the following appropriate and 3available services:4        (1) For any child who is a homeless child, as defined 5    under Section 1-5 of the Education for Homeless Children 6    Act, a meeting between the child, the person having 7    custody or control of the child, relevant school 8    personnel, and a homeless liaison to discuss any barriers 9    to the child's attendance due to the child's transitional 10    living situation and to construct a plan that removes 11    these barriers.12        (2) For any child with a documented disability, a 13    meeting between the child, the person having custody or 14    control of the child, and relevant school personnel to 15    review the child's current needs and address the 16    appropriateness of the child's placement and services. For 17    any child subject to Article 14 of this Code, this meeting 18    shall be an individualized education program meeting and 19    shall include relevant members of the individualized 20    education program team. For any child with a disability 21    under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 22    1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), this meeting shall be a Section 504 23    plan review and include relevant members of the Section 24    504 plan team.25        (3) For any child currently being evaluated by a 26    school district for a disability or for whom the school   SB2017- 31 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1    has a basis of knowledge that the child is a child with a 2    disability under 20 U.S.C. 1415(k)(5), the completion of 3    the evaluation and determination of the child's 4    eligibility for special education services.5    (d) Before a school district may refer a person having 6custody or control of a child to a local public entity under 7this Section, the school district must document any 8appropriate and available supportive services offered to the 9child. In the event a meeting under this Section does not 10occur, a school district must have documentation that it made 11reasonable efforts to convene the meeting at a mutually 12convenient time and date for the school district and the 13person having custody or control of the child and, but for the 14conduct of that person, the meeting would have occurred. 15(Source: P.A. 100-810, eff. 1-1-19; 100-825, eff. 8-13-18; 16101-81, eff. 7-12-19.) 17    (105 ILCS 5/27-23.7)18    Sec. 27-23.7. Bullying prevention.19    (a) The General Assembly finds that a safe and civil 20school environment is necessary for students to learn and 21achieve and that bullying causes physical, psychological, and 22emotional harm to students and interferes with students' 23ability to learn and participate in school activities. The 24General Assembly further finds that bullying has been linked 25to other forms of antisocial behavior, such as vandalism,   SB2017- 32 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1shoplifting, skipping and dropping out of school, fighting, 2using drugs and alcohol, sexual harassment, and sexual 3violence. Because of the negative outcomes associated with 4bullying in schools, the General Assembly finds that school 5districts, charter schools, and non-public, non-sectarian 6elementary and secondary schools should educate students, 7parents, and school district, charter school, or non-public, 8non-sectarian elementary or secondary school personnel about 9what behaviors constitute prohibited bullying.10    Bullying on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, 11religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, physical appearance, 12socioeconomic status, academic status, pregnancy, parenting 13status, homelessness, age, marital status, physical or mental 14disability, military status, sexual orientation, 15gender-related identity or expression, unfavorable discharge 16from military service, association with a person or group with 17one or more of the aforementioned actual or perceived 18characteristics, or any other distinguishing characteristic is 19prohibited in all school districts, charter schools, and 20non-public, non-sectarian elementary and secondary schools. No 21student shall be subjected to bullying:22        (1) during any school-sponsored education program or 23    activity;24        (2) while in school, on school property, on school 25    buses or other school vehicles, at designated school bus 26    stops waiting for the school bus, or at school-sponsored   SB2017- 33 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1    or school-sanctioned events or activities;2        (3) through the transmission of information from a 3    school computer, a school computer network, or other 4    similar electronic school equipment; or 5        (4) through the transmission of information from a 6    computer that is accessed at a nonschool-related location, 7    activity, function, or program or from the use of 8    technology or an electronic device that is not owned, 9    leased, or used by a school district or school if the 10    bullying causes a substantial disruption to the 11    educational process or orderly operation of a school. This 12    item (4) applies only in cases in which a school 13    administrator or teacher receives a report that bullying 14    through this means has occurred and does not require a 15    district or school to staff or monitor any 16    nonschool-related activity, function, or program. 17    (a-5) Nothing in this Section is intended to infringe upon 18any right to exercise free expression or the free exercise of 19religion or religiously based views protected under the First 20Amendment to the United States Constitution or under Section 3 21of Article I of the Illinois Constitution. 22    (b) In this Section: 23    "Bullying" includes "cyber-bullying" and means any severe 24or pervasive physical or verbal act or conduct, including 25communications made in writing or electronically, directed 26toward a student or students that has or can be reasonably   SB2017- 34 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1predicted to have the effect of one or more of the following:2        (1) placing the student or students in reasonable fear 3    of harm to the student's or students' person or property;4        (2) causing a substantially detrimental effect on the 5    student's or students' physical or mental health;6        (3) substantially interfering with the student's or 7    students' academic performance; or8        (4) substantially interfering with the student's or 9    students' ability to participate in or benefit from the 10    services, activities, or privileges provided by a school.11    Bullying, as defined in this subsection (b), may take 12various forms, including without limitation one or more of the 13following: harassment, threats, intimidation, stalking, 14physical violence, sexual harassment, sexual violence, theft, 15public humiliation, destruction of property, or retaliation 16for asserting or alleging an act of bullying. This list is 17meant to be illustrative and non-exhaustive.18    "Cyber-bullying" means bullying through the use of 19technology or any electronic communication, including without 20limitation any transfer of signs, signals, writing, images, 21sounds, data, or intelligence of any nature transmitted in 22whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic system, 23photoelectronic system, or photooptical system, including 24without limitation electronic mail, Internet communications, 25instant messages, or facsimile communications. 26"Cyber-bullying" includes the creation of a webpage or weblog   SB2017- 35 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1in which the creator assumes the identity of another person or 2the knowing impersonation of another person as the author of 3posted content or messages if the creation or impersonation 4creates any of the effects enumerated in the definition of 5bullying in this Section.

Karina Villa SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: 65 ILCS 5/11-5-9105 ILCS 5/10-20.68105 ILCS 5/10-22.6  from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6105 ILCS 5/26-12  from Ch. 122, par. 26-12105 ILCS 5/27-23.7    Amends the Illinois Municipal Code. Prohibits municipal ordinances that regulate truants from including a fine or fee for violations or providing for enforcement by citation. Amends the School Code. Requires a memorandum of understanding between a local law enforcement agency and a school district for any school district that uses a school resource officer; sets forth requirements for the memorandum. Provides that a student is prohibited from being issued a monetary fine or fee by any person (rather than providing that a student may not be issued a monetary fine or fee) as a disciplinary consequence. Prohibits school personnel of a school district from referring a student to any other local public entity or a local law enforcement agency for that entity or agency to issue the student a monetary fine or fee as a disciplinary consequence.

Makes conforming and other changes.LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 bSTATE MANDATES ACT MAY REQUIRE REIMBURSEMENTMAY APPLY A BILL FOR SB2017LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1    AN ACT concerning education. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. The Illinois Municipal Code is amended by 5changing Section 11-5-9 as follows: 6    (65 ILCS 5/11-5-9)7    Sec. 11-5-9. Truants. The corporate authorities of any 8municipality may adopt ordinances to regulate truants within 9its jurisdiction. These ordinances may not include a graduated 10fine or fee schedule for repeat violations. However, the 11penalty for repeat violations may include , which may not 12exceed $100, or community service, or both, for violators 13 13years of age or older. Such an ordinance and may provide for 14enforcement by citation or through administrative hearings as 15determined by ordinance. If the violator is under 13 years of 16age, the parent or custodian of the violator is subject to the 17fine or community service, or both. As used in this Section, 18"truants" means persons who are within the definition of 19"truant" in Section 26-2a of the School Code. Local officials 20or authorities that enforce, prosecute, or adjudicate 21municipal ordinances adopted under this Section or that work 22with school districts to address truancy problems are 23designated as (i) part of the juvenile justice system,   SB2017- 2 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1established by the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, and (ii) 2"juvenile authorities" within the definition set forth in 3subsection (a)(6.5) of Section 10-6 of the Illinois School 4Student Record Act. Because truancy is a gateway to crime and 5one of the most powerful predictors of juvenile delinquent 6behavior, a school district may disclose education records 7relating to attendance to juvenile authorities if the school 8district determines that the disclosure will enhance the 9juvenile justice system's ability to effectively serve, prior 10to adjudication, the student whose records are released. 11Enforcement of a municipal ordinance adopted under this 12Section is pre-adjudicatory because it helps minors avoid 13adjudicatory hearings under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. A 14school district may make a disclosure authorized under this 15Section only if the juvenile authority certifies in writing to 16the school district that the information will not be 17disclosed, without prior written consent of the parent or 18custodian of the student, to any other individual or entity, 19except as otherwise provided under State law. A home rule unit 20may not regulate truants in a manner inconsistent with the 21provisions of this Section or Sections 10-22.6 and 26-12 of 22the School Code. This Section is a limitation under subsection 23(i) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on 24the concurrent exercise by home rule units of the powers and 25functions exercised by the State.26(Source: P.A. 94-1011, eff. 7-7-06; 95-1016, eff. 6-1-09.)   SB2017- 3 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1    Section 10.

The 13memorandum of understanding must clearly define a school 14resource officer's role in a school and must be in accordance 15with Section 10-22.6. The memorandum of understanding shall 16include provisions that:17        (1) define the role, duties, and responsibilities of a 18    school resource officer in alignment with the school 19    district's disciplinary policies;20        (2) specify procedures to ensure that a school 21    resource officer prioritizes alternative disciplinary 22    measures, including delayed adjudication procedures if a 23    ticket is issued;24        (3) include training requirements for a school   SB2017- 4 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1    resource officer that focuses on alternative methods of 2    discipline and restorative practices to address student 3    behavior in a developmentally appropriate and culturally 4    sensitive manner;5        (4) outline a process for data collection and 6    reporting on tickets or citations issued by a school 7    resource officer, disaggregated by demographic categories; 8    and9        (5) provide for regular review and evaluation of the 10    school resource officer program, including community and 11    stakeholder input. 12    (b) Any Beginning January 1, 2021, any law enforcement 13agency that provides a school resource officer under this 14Section shall provide to the school district a certificate of 15completion, or approved waiver, issued by the Illinois Law 16Enforcement Training Standards Board under Section 10.22 of 17the Illinois Police Training Act indicating that the subject 18officer has completed the requisite course of instruction in 19the applicable subject areas within one year of assignment, or 20has prior experience and training which satisfies this 21requirement. 22    (c) In an effort to defray the related costs, any law 23enforcement agency that provides a school resource officer 24should apply for grant funding through the federal Community 25Oriented Policing Services grant program.26    (d) The State Board of Education may adopt rules to   SB2017- 5 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1implement this Section.2(Source: P.A. 100-984, eff. 1-1-19; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19.) 3    (105 ILCS 5/10-22.6)  (from Ch. 122, par. 10-22.6)4    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 102-466)5    Sec. 10-22.6.

Expulsion shall take place only after the parents 12have been requested to appear at a meeting of the board, or 13with a hearing officer appointed by it, to discuss their 14child's behavior. Such request shall be made by registered or 15certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of 16the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, 17at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the 18date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a 19hearing officer is appointed by the board, the hearing officer 20shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence 21heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon 22as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a student, 23the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific 24reasons why removing the student from the learning environment 25is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision   SB2017- 6 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of 2the expulsion. An expelled student may be immediately 3transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided 4in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A student must not be 5denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in 6which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety 7of students or staff in the alternative program. 8    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 9superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 10principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 11students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 12suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 13the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 14subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 15shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 16policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 17principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 18school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 19to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 20gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 21may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 22reasons. 23    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 24parents or guardian of a student along with a full statement of 25the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right to 26a review. The school board must be given a summary of the   SB2017- 7 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 2suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardian, 3the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall 4review such action of the superintendent or principal, 5assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 6parents or guardian of the student may appear and discuss the 7suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 8officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 9a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 10its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 11hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 12appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 13subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 14decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 15misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 16suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 17specific duration of the suspension.18    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 19and consequences available to school officials, school 20exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 21are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 22and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 23extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 24only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 25students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 26recommended that school officials consider forms of   SB2017- 8 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 2suspensions or expulsions. 3    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this 4Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 5by which school administrators are required to suspend or 6expel students for particular behaviors.7    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 8used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 9pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 10students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 11subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 12other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 13a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 14School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 15such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 16length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.17    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 18out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 19and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 20only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 21disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 22student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 23a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 24the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 25interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 26this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other   SB2017- 9 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1students, staff, or members of the school community" and 2"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 3operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case 4basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 5(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 6available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 7exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 8shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 9address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 10exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 11suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 12Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 13of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 14interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 15there were no other appropriate and available interventions.16    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 17than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 18support services during the period of their suspension. For 19purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 20support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 21Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 22this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 23to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 24such appropriate and available services. 25    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 26appropriate and available support services.  SB2017- 10 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 2re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 3expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In 4consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 5Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 6and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 7suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 8alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 9Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 10    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 11suspended students, including those students suspended from 12the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 13school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 14equivalent academic credit.

A student who is subject to suspension or 9expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 10transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 11Article 13A of the School Code.12    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 13superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 14principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 15student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 16a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 17calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 18that student has been determined to have made an explicit 19threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a 20student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 21website through which the threat was made is a site that was 22accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 23was available to third parties who worked or studied within 24the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 25the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 26the safety and security of the threatened individual because   SB2017- 13 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 2student inside the school. 3    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 4authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 5lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 6equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 7personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 8without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 9search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 10Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 11privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 12left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 13the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 14conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 15lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 16controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 17illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 18searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 19If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces 20evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 21the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 22such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 23disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also 24turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.25    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or 26expulsion from school and all school activities and a   SB2017- 14 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1prohibition from being present on school grounds.2    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if 3a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any 4public or private school in this or any other state, the 5student must complete the entire term of the suspension or 6expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A 7of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program 8under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the 9school district if there is no threat to the safety of students 10or staff in the alternative program.11    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 12students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 13difficulties.14    (i) A student is prohibited from being may not be issued a 15monetary fine or fee by any person as a disciplinary 16consequence, though this does shall not preclude requiring a 17student to provide restitution for lost, stolen, or damaged 18property.19    (i-5) As used in this subsection (i-5), "school personnel" 20has the meaning given to that term in Section 27-23.7.21    School personnel of a school district are prohibited from 22referring a student to any other local public entity, as 23defined in Section 1-206 of the Local Governmental and 24Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, or a local law 25enforcement agency for that entity or agency to issue the 26student a monetary fine or fee as a disciplinary consequence.   SB2017- 15 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1This prohibition does not prohibit school personnel from 2referring a matter to that appropriate entity or agency for a 3violation of local, State, or federal law if necessary to 4prevent an imminent threat of serious physical harm to the 5student, other students, school personnel, or other persons, 6for the purpose of self-defense or defense of property, or if 7otherwise required to refer such a matter to the entity or 8agency by local, State, or federal law. 9    (j) Subsections (a) through (i-5) (i) of this Section 10shall apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter 11schools, special charter districts, and school districts 12organized under Article 34 of this Code. 13    (k) The expulsion of students enrolled in programs funded 14under Section 1C-2 of this Code is subject to the requirements 15under paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 2-3.71 of 16this Code.17    (l) An in-school suspension program provided by a school 18district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may 19focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and 20positive interaction with other students and school personnel. 21A school district may employ a school social worker or a 22licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school 23suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12. 24(Source: P.A. 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 25103-594, eff. 6-25-24; 103-896, eff. 8-9-24; revised 9-25-24.)   SB2017- 16 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 102-466)2    Sec. 10-22.6.

Expulsion shall take place only after the parents 9or guardians have been requested to appear at a meeting of the 10board, or with a hearing officer appointed by it, to discuss 11their child's behavior. Such request shall be made by 12registered or certified mail and shall state the time, place 13and purpose of the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer 14appointed by it, at such meeting shall state the reasons for 15dismissal and the date on which the expulsion is to become 16effective. If a hearing officer is appointed by the board, the 17hearing officer shall report to the board a written summary of 18the evidence heard at the meeting and the board may take such 19action thereon as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to 20expel a student, the written expulsion decision shall detail 21the specific reasons why removing the student from the 22learning environment is in the best interest of the school. 23The expulsion decision shall also include a rationale as to 24the specific duration of the expulsion. An expelled student 25may be immediately transferred to an alternative program in 26the manner provided in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A   SB2017- 17 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1student must not be denied transfer because of the expulsion, 2except in cases in which such transfer is deemed to cause a 3threat to the safety of students or staff in the alternative 4program. 5    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the 6superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 7principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend 8students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to 9suspend students guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on 10the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to 11subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action 12shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by 13policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the 14principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any 15school to suspend students guilty of such acts for a period not 16to exceed 10 school days. If a student is suspended due to 17gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board 18may suspend the student in excess of 10 school days for safety 19reasons. 20    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the 21parents or guardians of a student along with a full statement 22of the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right 23to a review. The school board must be given a summary of the 24notice, including the reason for the suspension and the 25suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardians, 26the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall   SB2017- 18 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1review such action of the superintendent or principal, 2assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the 3parents or guardians of the student may appear and discuss the 4suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing 5officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board 6a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After 7its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its 8hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds 9appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this 10subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension 11decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or 12misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The 13suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the 14specific duration of the suspension.15    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions 16and consequences available to school officials, school 17exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, 18are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number 19and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest 20extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them 21only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that 22students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is 23recommended that school officials consider forms of 24non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school 25suspensions or expulsions. 26    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this   SB2017- 19 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies 2by which school administrators are required to suspend or 3expel students for particular behaviors.4    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be 5used only if the student's continuing presence in school would 6pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other 7students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this 8subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to 9other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on 10a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. 11School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve 12such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the 13length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.14    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, 15out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, 16and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used 17only if other appropriate and available behavioral and 18disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the 19student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose 20a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of 21the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or 22interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of 23this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other 24students, staff, or members of the school community" and 25"substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the 26operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case   SB2017- 20 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection 2(b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and 3available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been 4exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials 5shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, 6address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student 7exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the 8suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this 9Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) 10of this Section, it shall be documented whether other 11interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that 12there were no other appropriate and available interventions.13    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer 14than 3 school days shall be provided appropriate and available 15support services during the period of their suspension. For 16purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available 17support services" shall be determined by school authorities. 18Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of 19this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are 20to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no 21such appropriate and available services. 22    A school district may refer students who are expelled to 23appropriate and available support services.24    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the 25re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, 26expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting. In   SB2017- 21 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1consultation with stakeholders deemed appropriate by the State 2Board of Education, the State Board of Education shall draft 3and publish guidance for the re-engagement of students who are 4suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an 5alternative school setting in accordance with this Section and 6Section 13A-4 on or before July 1, 2025. 7    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which 8suspended students, including those students suspended from 9the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to 10school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for 11equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of 12a student's parents or guardians to notify school officials 13that a student suspended from the school bus does not have 14alternate transportation to school. 15    (b-35) In all suspension review hearings conducted under 16subsection (b) or expulsion hearings conducted under 17subsection (a), a student may disclose any factor to be 18considered in mitigation, including his or her status as a 19parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 20violence, as defined in Article 26A. A representative of the 21parent's or guardian's choice, or of the student's choice if 22emancipated, must be permitted to represent the student 23throughout the proceedings and to address the school board or 24its appointed hearing officer. With the approval of the 25student's parent or guardian, or of the student if 26emancipated, a support person must be permitted to accompany   SB2017- 22 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1the student to any disciplinary hearings or proceedings. The 2representative or support person must comply with any rules of 3the school district's hearing process. If the representative 4or support person violates the rules or engages in behavior or 5advocacy that harasses, abuses, or intimidates either party, a 6witness, or anyone else in attendance at the hearing, the 7representative or support person may be prohibited from 8further participation in the hearing or proceeding. A 9suspension or expulsion proceeding under this subsection 10(b-35) must be conducted independently from any ongoing 11criminal investigation or proceeding, and an absence of 12pending or possible criminal charges, criminal investigations, 13or proceedings may not be a factor in school disciplinary 14decisions.15    (b-40) During a suspension review hearing conducted under 16subsection (b) or an expulsion hearing conducted under 17subsection (a) that involves allegations of sexual violence by 18the student who is subject to discipline, neither the student 19nor his or her representative shall directly question nor have 20direct contact with the alleged victim. The student who is 21subject to discipline or his or her representative may, at the 22discretion and direction of the school board or its appointed 23hearing officer, suggest questions to be posed by the school 24board or its appointed hearing officer to the alleged victim. 25    (c) A school board must invite a representative from a 26local mental health agency to consult with the board at the   SB2017- 23 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be 2the cause of a student's expulsion or suspension.3    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to 4provide ongoing professional development to all school 5personnel, school board members, and school resource officers 6on the requirements of this Section and Section 10-20.14, the 7adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system 8involvement, effective classroom management strategies, 9culturally responsive discipline, trauma-responsive learning 10environments, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 3-11, 11the appropriate and available supportive services for the 12promotion of student attendance and engagement, and 13developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote 14positive and healthy school climates. 15    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of 16time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a 17case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have 18brought one of the following objects to school, any 19school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event 20that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be 21expelled for a period of not less than one year:22        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section, 23    "firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined 24    by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, 25    firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners 26    Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section   SB2017- 24 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1    24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012.

The expulsion 10    requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by 11    the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination 12    may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis. 13Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner 14consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities 15Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or 16expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a 17transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with 18Article 13A of the School Code.19    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the 20superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant 21principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a 22student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel 23a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 24calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) 25that student has been determined to have made an explicit 26threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a   SB2017- 25 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet 2website through which the threat was made is a site that was 3accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or 4was available to third parties who worked or studied within 5the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) 6the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to 7the safety and security of the threatened individual because 8of the individual's duties or employment status or status as a 9student inside the school. 10    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school 11authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as 12lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and 13equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as 14personal effects left in those places and areas by students, 15without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a 16search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General 17Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of 18privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects 19left in these places and areas. School authorities may request 20the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of 21conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking 22lots, and other school property and equipment owned or 23controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other 24illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including 25searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. 26If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces   SB2017- 26 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1evidence that the student has violated or is violating either 2the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, 3such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and 4disciplinary action may be taken.

A school district that 18adopts a policy under this subsection (g) must include a 19provision allowing for consideration of any mitigating 20factors, including, but not limited to, a student's status as 21a parent, expectant parent, or victim of domestic or sexual 22violence, as defined in Article 26A. 23    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage 24students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic 25difficulties.26    (i) A student is prohibited from being may not be issued a   SB2017- 27 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1monetary fine or fee by any person as a disciplinary 2consequence, though this does shall not preclude requiring a 3student to provide restitution for lost, stolen, or damaged 4property.5    (i-5) As used in this subsection (i-5), "school personnel" 6has the meaning given to that term in Section 27-23.7.7    School personnel of a school district are prohibited from 8referring a student to any other local public entity, as 9defined in Section 1-206 of the Local Governmental and 10Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, or a local law 11enforcement agency for that entity or agency to issue the 12student a monetary fine or fee as a disciplinary consequence. 13This prohibition does not prohibit school personnel from 14referring a matter to that appropriate entity or agency for a 15violation of local, State, or federal law if necessary to 16prevent an imminent threat of serious physical harm to the 17student, other students, school personnel, or other persons, 18for the purpose of self-defense or defense of property, or if 19otherwise required to refer such a matter to the entity or 20agency by local, State, or federal law. 21    (j) Subsections (a) through (i-5) (i) of this Section 22shall apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter 23schools, special charter districts, and school districts 24organized under Article 34 of this Code. 25    (k) Through June 30, 2026, the expulsion of students 26enrolled in programs funded under Section 1C-2 of this Code is   SB2017- 28 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1subject to the requirements under paragraph (7) of subsection 2(a) of Section 2-3.71 of this Code.3    (k-5) On and after July 1, 2026, the expulsion of children 4enrolled in programs funded under Section 15-25 of the 5Department of Early Childhood Act is subject to the 6requirements of paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 715-30 of the Department of Early Childhood Act. 8    (l) An in-school suspension program provided by a school 9district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may 10focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and 11positive interaction with other students and school personnel. 12A school district may employ a school social worker or a 13licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school 14suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12. 15(Source: P.A. 102-466, eff. 7-1-25; 102-539, eff. 8-20-21; 16102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 103-594, eff. 6-25-24; 103-896, eff. 178-9-24; revised 9-25-24.) 18    (105 ILCS 5/26-12)  (from Ch. 122, par. 26-12)19    Sec. 26-12.

Bullying prevention.19    (a) The General Assembly finds that a safe and civil 20school environment is necessary for students to learn and 21achieve and that bullying causes physical, psychological, and 22emotional harm to students and interferes with students' 23ability to learn and participate in school activities. The 24General Assembly further finds that bullying has been linked 25to other forms of antisocial behavior, such as vandalism,   SB2017- 32 -LRB104 11330 LNS 21417 b1shoplifting, skipping and dropping out of school, fighting, 2using drugs and alcohol, sexual harassment, and sexual 3violence.
