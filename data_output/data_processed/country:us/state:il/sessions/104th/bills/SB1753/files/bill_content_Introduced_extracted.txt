Effective June 1, 2025.LRB104 09758 KTG 19824 b  A BILL FOR SB1753LRB104 09758 KTG 19824 b1    AN ACT concerning essential services for persons with 2developmental disabilities. 3    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 4represented in the General Assembly: 5    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 6Ensuring Essential Services Act. 7    Section 5. Findings and purposes. 8    (a) The General Assembly finds that the State of Illinois 9administers a program for the provision of home and 10community-based support services for individuals with 11developmental disabilities (IDD) in accordance with a waiver 12program agreement entered into between the State and the 13Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Pursuant to a 14consent decree entered in Ligas v. Hamos, Case No. 151:05-cv-04331 (N.D. Ill.), the State is required to implement 16sufficient measures to ensure the availability of IDD 17services, supports, and other resources of sufficient quality, 18scope, and variety to meet the State's obligations under the 19consent decree and the implementation plan consistent with 20such choices. The number of individuals served each year by 21the program is based on available State appropriation levels.22    The General Assembly finds that the Department of Human 23Services is designated as the State agency having primary   SB1753- 2 -LRB104 09758 KTG 19824 b1responsibility for overseeing the delivery of habilitation 2services to individuals with developmental disabilities under 3the program, and in that capacity procures services for 4approximately 27,000 Illinoisans who, together with their 5families and guardians, depend on the daily and uninterrupted 6provision of these services so that they can attend to the 7necessities of life. An interruption in the delivery of 8services under the program would have disastrous consequences 9for participants, their families, and their communities.10    The General Assembly finds that effects of the ongoing 11COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed hundreds of thousands of 12American lives and disrupted the distribution of essential 13services to the most needy inhabitants of the State has 14affected the provision of services in unforeseen ways, 15exacerbating already existing labor shortage high turnover, 16and causing labor unrest and stoppages. 17    The General Assembly finds that there currently exists an 18acute shortage of frontline and direct support staff 19indicating that the agencies with which the State has 20contracted to provide IDD services under the program have 21inadequately ensured the training, retention, and recruitment 22of the workforce necessary to meet the State's obligations 23under the program, and such shortage and existing labor 24conditions escalate the probability of disruptions in the 25delivery of essential services owing to labor disputes and 26employee dissatisfaction.  SB1753- 3 -LRB104 09758 KTG 19824 b1    The General Assembly finds that as a procurer of services 2comprising the program the State administers, either in the 3form of purchase of service contracts, grants, or otherwise, 4that the State has a proprietary interest in assuring the 5delivery of quality, reliable, and uninterrupted provision of 6services to individuals receiving benefits under the program.7    The General Assembly finds that a strike, labor dispute, 8or other inability to deliver essential service under the 9program would be costly to the State as it struggles to fill 10the gap to provide these essential services, due to the 11excessive cost of locating alternative treatment options on an 12emergent basis, including, but not limited to, the need to pay 13substantial overtime to employees at public hospitals which 14would be forced to admit increasing numbers of patients as a 15matter of last resort. Such disruptions would have 16consequential and dire effects on program recipients, their 17families, and guardians.18     The General Assembly finds that agreements between 19employers and labor organizations to refrain from resolving 20labor disputes through economic action promote the efficient 21and uninterrupted delivery of services. Such agreements are 22common and have been adopted within the behavioral health and 23disability support industries. A program of labor management 24cooperation has proven effective in addressing issues related 25to establishing appropriate wages and compensation, improving 26quality of care, increasing worker retention, reducing   SB1753- 4 -LRB104 09758 KTG 19824 b1workforce turnover, and mitigating the likelihood of service 2disruption.3    (b) The purpose of this Act is to ensure the State meets 4its obligation to provide these essential services at 5consistent quality levels in accordance with its waiver 6agreement with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 7all while allocating scarce taxpayer resources. The State, as 8procurer of home and community-based support services, has 9determined to take steps to ensure the uninterrupted delivery 10of services to individuals receiving IDD services under the 11program.  12    Section 10.
