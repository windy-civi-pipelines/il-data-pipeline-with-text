"Artificial intelligence" or 9"AI" includes machine learning. 10    "Department" means the Department of Insurance. 11    "Machine learning" means a field within artificial 12intelligence that focuses on the ability of computers to learn 13from provided data without being explicitly programmed. 14    "Predictive model" means the processing of historic data 15using algorithms or machine learning to identify patterns and 16predict outcomes that can be used to make decisions or support 17decision-making. 18    "Third party" means an organization other than the insurer 19that provides services, data, or other resources related to 20AI. 21    Section 10.

The Department may 5also request other information or documentation relevant to an 6investigation or market conduct action, and an insurer must 7comply with that request. The Department's inquiries may 8include, but are not limited to, questions regarding any 9specific model, AI system, or application of a model or AI 10system.
