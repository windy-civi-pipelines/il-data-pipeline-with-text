However, for taxable years ending on or after 16    December 31, 1986, net operating loss carryforwards from 17    taxable years ending prior to December 31, 1986, may not 18    exceed the sum of federal taxable income for the taxable 19    year before net operating loss deduction, plus the excess 20    of addition modifications over subtraction modifications 21    for the taxable year. For taxable years ending prior to 22    December 31, 1986, taxable income may never be an amount 23    in excess of the net operating loss for the taxable year as 24    defined in subsections (c) and (d) of Section 172 of the 25    Internal Revenue Code, provided that when taxable income   HB2604- 101 -LRB104 10351 HLH 20425 b1    of a corporation (other than a Subchapter S corporation), 2    trust, or estate is less than zero and addition 3    modifications, other than those provided by subparagraph 4    (E) of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) for corporations or 5    subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of subsection (c) for 6    trusts and estates, exceed subtraction modifications, an 7    addition modification must be made under those 8    subparagraphs for any other taxable year to which the 9    taxable income less than zero (net operating loss) is 10    applied under Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code or 11    under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection 12    (e) applied in conjunction with Section 172 of the 13    Internal Revenue Code.14        (2) Special rule. For purposes of paragraph (1) of 15    this subsection, the taxable income properly reportable 16    for federal income tax purposes shall mean:17            (A) Certain life insurance companies.

In the case of a 11        corporation which is a member of an affiliated group 12        of corporations filing a consolidated income tax 13        return for the taxable year for federal income tax 14        purposes, taxable income determined as if such 15        corporation had filed a separate return for federal 16        income tax purposes for the taxable year and each 17        preceding taxable year for which it was a member of an 18        affiliated group. For purposes of this subparagraph, 19        the taxpayer's separate taxable income shall be 20        determined as if the election provided by Section 21        243(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code had been in 22        effect for all such years;23            (F) Cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative 24        corporation or association, the taxable income of such 25        organization determined in accordance with the 26        provisions of Section 1381 through 1388 of the   HB2604- 103 -LRB104 10351 HLH 20425 b1        Internal Revenue Code, but without regard to the 2        prohibition against offsetting losses from patronage 3        activities against income from nonpatronage 4        activities; except that a cooperative corporation or 5        association may make an election to follow its federal 6        income tax treatment of patronage losses and 7        nonpatronage losses. In the event such election is 8        made, such losses shall be computed and carried over 9        in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of Section 10        207 of this Act and apportioned by the apportionment 11        factor reported by the cooperative on its Illinois 12        income tax return filed for the taxable year in which 13        the losses are incurred. The election shall be 14        effective for all taxable years with original returns 15        due on or after the date of the election. In addition, 16        the cooperative may file an amended return or returns, 17        as allowed under this Act, to provide that the 18        election shall be effective for losses incurred or 19        carried forward for taxable years occurring prior to 20        the date of the election. Once made, the election may 21        only be revoked upon approval of the Director. The 22        Department shall adopt rules setting forth 23        requirements for documenting the elections and any 24        resulting Illinois net loss and the standards to be 25        used by the Director in evaluating requests to revoke 26        elections. Public Act 96-932 is declaratory of   HB2604- 104 -LRB104 10351 HLH 20425 b1        existing law; 2            (G) Subchapter S corporations. In the case of: (i) 3        a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 4        effect an election for the taxable year under Section 5        1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxable income 6        of such corporation determined in accordance with 7        Section 1363(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, except 8        that taxable income shall take into account those 9        items which are required by Section 1363(b)(1) of the 10        Internal Revenue Code to be separately stated; and 11        (ii) a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 12        effect a federal election to opt out of the provisions 13        of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 and have 14        applied instead the prior federal Subchapter S rules 15        as in effect on July 1, 1982, the taxable income of 16        such corporation determined in accordance with the 17        federal Subchapter S rules as in effect on July 1, 18        1982; and19            (H) Partnerships. In the case of a partnership, 20        taxable income determined in accordance with Section 21        703 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that taxable 22        income shall take into account those items which are 23        required by Section 703(a)(1) to be separately stated 24        but which would be taken into account by an individual 25        in calculating his taxable income.26        (3) Recapture of business expenses on disposition of   HB2604- 105 -LRB104 10351 HLH 20425 b1    asset or business. Notwithstanding any other law to the 2    contrary, if in prior years income from an asset or 3    business has been classified as business income and in a 4    later year is demonstrated to be non-business income, then 5    all expenses, without limitation, deducted in such later 6    year and in the 2 immediately preceding taxable years 7    related to that asset or business that generated the 8    non-business income shall be added back and recaptured as 9    business income in the year of the disposition of the 10    asset or business. Such amount shall be apportioned to 11    Illinois using the greater of the apportionment fraction 12    computed for the business under Section 304 of this Act 13    for the taxable year or the average of the apportionment 14    fractions computed for the business under Section 304 of 15    this Act for the taxable year and for the 2 immediately 16    preceding taxable years.  17    (f) Valuation limitation amount.18        (1) In general. The valuation limitation amount 19    referred to in subsections (a)(2)(G), (c)(2)(I) and 20    (d)(2)(E) is an amount equal to:21            (A) The sum of the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 22        amounts (to the extent consisting of gain reportable 23        under the provisions of Section 1245 or 1250 of the 24        Internal Revenue Code) for all property in respect of 25        which such gain was reported for the taxable year;   HB2604- 106 -LRB104 10351 HLH 20425 b1        plus2            (B) The lesser of (i) the sum of the pre-August 1, 3        1969 appreciation amounts (to the extent consisting of 4        capital gain) for all property in respect of which 5        such gain was reported for federal income tax purposes 6        for the taxable year, or (ii) the net capital gain for 7        the taxable year, reduced in either case by any amount 8        of such gain included in the amount determined under 9        subsection (a)(2)(F) or (c)(2)(H).10        (2) Pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation amount.11            (A) If the fair market value of property referred 12        to in paragraph (1) was readily ascertainable on 13        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 14        amount for such property is the lesser of (i) the 15        excess of such fair market value over the taxpayer's 16        basis (for determining gain) for such property on that 17        date (determined under the Internal Revenue Code as in 18        effect on that date), or (ii) the total gain realized 19        and reportable for federal income tax purposes in 20        respect of the sale, exchange or other disposition of 21        such property.22            (B) If the fair market value of property referred 23        to in paragraph (1) was not readily ascertainable on 24        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 25        amount for such property is that amount which bears 26        the same ratio to the total gain reported in respect of   HB2604- 107 -LRB104 10351 HLH 20425 b1        the property for federal income tax purposes for the 2        taxable year, as the number of full calendar months in 3        that part of the taxpayer's holding period for the 4        property ending July 31, 1969 bears to the number of 5        full calendar months in the taxpayer's entire holding 6        period for the property.7            (C) The Department shall prescribe such 8        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the 9        purposes of this paragraph. 10    (g) Double deductions. Unless specifically provided 11otherwise, nothing in this Section shall permit the same item 12to be deducted more than once. 13    (h) Legislative intention. Except as expressly provided by 14this Section there shall be no modifications or limitations on 15the amounts of income, gain, loss or deduction taken into 16account in determining gross income, adjusted gross income or 17taxable income for federal income tax purposes for the taxable 18year, or in the amount of such items entering into the 19computation of base income and net income under this Act for 20such taxable year, whether in respect of property values as of 21August 1, 1969 or otherwise.22(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 23102-658, eff. 8-27-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-1112, eff. 2412-21-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23; 103-478, eff. 1-1-24; 103-592,   HB2604- 108 -LRB104 10351 HLH 20425 b1Article 10, Section 10-900, eff. 6-7-24; 103-592, Article 170, 2Section 170-90, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24; 103-647, 3eff. 7-1-24; revised 8-20-24.) 4    Section 99.

The addition modification 20        required by this subparagraph shall be reduced to the 21        extent that dividends were included in base income of 22        the unitary group for the same taxable year and 23        received by the taxpayer or by a member of the 24        taxpayer's unitary business group (including amounts 25        included in gross income under Sections 951 through 26        964 of the Internal Revenue Code and amounts included   HB2604- 5 -LRB104 10351 HLH 20425 b1        in gross income under Section 78 of the Internal 2        Revenue Code) with respect to the stock of the same 3        person to whom the interest was paid, accrued, or 4        incurred.5            This paragraph shall not apply to the following: 6                (i) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 7            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person who 8            is subject in a foreign country or state, other 9            than a state which requires mandatory unitary 10            reporting, to a tax on or measured by net income 11            with respect to such interest; or12                (ii) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 13            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 14            the taxpayer can establish, based on a 15            preponderance of the evidence, both of the 16            following:17                    (a) the person, during the same taxable 18                year, paid, accrued, or incurred, the interest 19                to a person that is not a related member, and20                    (b) the transaction giving rise to the 21                interest expense between the taxpayer and the 22                person did not have as a principal purpose the 23                avoidance of Illinois income tax, and is paid 24                pursuant to a contract or agreement that 25                reflects an arm's-length interest rate and 26                terms; or   HB2604- 6 -LRB104 10351 HLH 20425 b1                (iii) the taxpayer can establish, based on 2            clear and convincing evidence, that the interest 3            paid, accrued, or incurred relates to a contract 4            or agreement entered into at arm's-length rates 5            and terms and the principal purpose for the 6            payment is not federal or Illinois tax avoidance; 7            or 8                (iv) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 9            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 10            the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing 11            evidence that the adjustments are unreasonable; or 12            if the taxpayer and the Director agree in writing 13            to the application or use of an alternative method 14            of apportionment under Section 304(f). 15                Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the 16            Director from making any other adjustment 17            otherwise allowed under Section 404 of this Act 18            for any tax year beginning after the effective 19            date of this amendment provided such adjustment is 20            made pursuant to regulation adopted by the 21            Department and such regulations provide methods 22            and standards by which the Department will utilize 23            its authority under Section 404 of this Act; 24            (D-18) An amount equal to the amount of intangible 25        expenses and costs otherwise allowed as a deduction in 26        computing base income, and that were paid, accrued, or   HB2604- 7 -LRB104 10351 HLH 20425 b1        incurred, directly or indirectly, (i) for taxable 2        years ending on or after December 31, 2004, to a 3        foreign person who would be a member of the same 4        unitary business group but for the fact that the 5        foreign person's business activity outside the United 6        States is 80% or more of that person's total business 7        activity and (ii) for taxable years ending on or after 8        December 31, 2008, to a person who would be a member of 9        the same unitary business group but for the fact that 10        the person is prohibited under Section 1501(a)(27) 11        from being included in the unitary business group 12        because he or she is ordinarily required to apportion 13        business income under different subsections of Section 14        304. The addition modification required by this 15        subparagraph shall be reduced to the extent that 16        dividends were included in base income of the unitary 17        group for the same taxable year and received by the 18        taxpayer or by a member of the taxpayer's unitary 19        business group (including amounts included in gross 20        income under Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal 21        Revenue Code and amounts included in gross income 22        under Section 78 of the Internal Revenue Code) with 23        respect to the stock of the same person to whom the 24        intangible expenses and costs were directly or 25        indirectly paid, incurred, or accrued.
