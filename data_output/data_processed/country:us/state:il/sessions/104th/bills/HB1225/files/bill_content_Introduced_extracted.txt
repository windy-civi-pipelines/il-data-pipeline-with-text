Effective immediately.LRB104 06111 SPS 16144 b  A BILL FOR HB1225LRB104 06111 SPS 16144 b1    AN ACT concerning State government. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the Best 5Customer Price Act. 6    Section 5. Findings. The General Assembly finds and 7declares that:8        (1) It has been the long-standing public policy of 9    this State to provide a level playing field in procurement 10    for small and mid-sized businesses. Despite this policy, 11    the portion of State funds spent on small and mid-sized 12    businesses, especially minority-owned, women-owned, and 13    veteran-owned businesses, is persistently far below where 14    the General Assembly believes it should be.15        (2) This State has a choice in implementing pricing 16    policy for goods. Manufacturers sometimes give their best 17    price to the largest suppliers and largest resellers, 18    leaving small and mid-sized suppliers and small and 19    mid-sized resellers to pay a higher price. Allowing 20    manufacturers to force smaller suppliers for State 21    purchases to pay a higher price excludes small suppliers 22    from any low-bid State procurement.23        (3) On average, minority-owned, women-owned, and   HB1225- 2 -LRB104 06111 SPS 16144 b1    veteran-owned businesses are smaller than incumbent firms, 2    and policies that level the playing field in procurement 3    for firms that are smaller will disproportionately benefit 4    minority-owned, women-owned and veteran-owned businesses, 5    rectifying past decades of discrimination in a 6    race-neutral and gender-neutral way.7        (4) It has long been public policy to empower State 8    purchasing officials with the ability to require the most 9    favorable terms to be granted to this State on any 10    purchase of supplies or services, and extending this 11    policy to ensure the best customer pricing is extended by 12    manufacturers to this State's suppliers and resellers is 13    consistent with both federal procurement law and State 14    procurement law.15        (5) Requiring the best customer price for procured 16    goods will create a more inclusive choice for State 17    procurement and a level playing field for all suppliers, 18    both from the manufacturers to suppliers or resellers and 19    from suppliers or resellers to this State.20        (6) It is in the best interest of the taxpayers of this 21    State to ensure that this State's purchases of goods 22    always get the best customer pricing from all participants 23    in the transaction, both from the manufacturer to the 24    supplier or reseller and from the supplier or reseller to 25    this State.   HB1225- 3 -LRB104 06111 SPS 16144 b1    Section 10.
