The defendant shall have the 10    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 11    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 12    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 13    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 14    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 15    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 16    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 17    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 18    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 19    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 20    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 21    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 22        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 23    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 24    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 25    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 26    court determines that the physical health and safety of   SB2380- 14 -LRB104 03946 RLC 13970 b1    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 2    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 3    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 4    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 5    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 6    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 7    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 8    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 9    Courts every 6 months. 10        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 11    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 12    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 13    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 14    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 15    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 16    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 17    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 18    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 19    the court shall state on the record the reason for 20    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 21    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 22    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 23    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 24    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 25    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 26    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is   SB2380- 15 -LRB104 03946 RLC 13970 b1    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 2    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 3    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 4    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 5    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 6    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 7    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 8    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 9    criminal history, if available, and any written or 10    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 11    statements made by any person, if in the State's 12    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 13        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 14    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 15    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 16    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 17    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 18    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 19    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 20    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 21    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.22        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 23    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 24    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 25    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 26    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against   SB2380- 16 -LRB104 03946 RLC 13970 b1    the defendant.2        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 3    release, and detention prior to trial must be 4    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 5    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 6    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 7    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 8dangerousness. The court may, in determining whether the 9defendant poses a real and present threat to the safety of any 10person or persons or the community, based on the specific 11articulable facts of the case, consider, but shall not be 12limited to, evidence or testimony concerning:13        (1) The nature and circumstances of any offense 14    charged, including whether the offense is a crime of 15    violence, involving a weapon, or a sex offense.16        (2) The history and characteristics of the defendant 17    including:18            (A) Any evidence of the defendant's prior criminal 19        history indicative of violent, abusive, or assaultive 20        behavior, or lack of such behavior. Such evidence may 21        include testimony or documents received in juvenile 22        proceedings, criminal, quasi-criminal, civil 23        commitment, domestic relations, or other proceedings.24            (B) Any evidence of the defendant's psychological, 25        psychiatric or other similar social history which 26        tends to indicate a violent, abusive, or assaultive   SB2380- 17 -LRB104 03946 RLC 13970 b1        nature, or lack of any such history.2        (3) The identity of any person or persons to whose 3    safety the defendant is believed to pose a threat, and the 4    nature of the threat.5        (4) Any statements made by, or attributed to the 6    defendant, together with the circumstances surrounding 7    them.8        (5) The age and physical condition of the defendant.9        (6) The age and physical condition of any victim or 10    complaining witness. 11        (7) Whether the defendant is known to possess or have 12    access to any weapon or weapons.13        (8) Whether, at the time of the current offense or any 14    other offense or arrest, the defendant was on probation, 15    parole, aftercare release, mandatory supervised release, 16    or other release from custody pending trial, sentencing, 17    appeal, or completion of sentence for an offense under 18    federal or State state law.19        (9) Any other factors, including those listed in 20    Section 110-5 of this Article deemed by the court to have a 21    reasonable bearing upon the defendant's propensity or 22    reputation for violent, abusive, or assaultive behavior, 23    or lack of such behavior.24    (h) Detention order. The court shall, in any order for 25detention:26        (1) make a written finding summarizing the court's   SB2380- 18 -LRB104 03946 RLC 13970 b1    reasons for concluding that the defendant should be denied 2    pretrial release, including why less restrictive 3    conditions would not avoid a real and present threat to 4    the safety of any person or persons or the community, 5    based on the specific articulable facts of the case, or 6    prevent the defendant's willful flight from prosecution;7        (2) direct that the defendant be committed to the 8    custody of the sheriff for confinement in the county jail 9    pending trial;10        (3) direct that the defendant be given a reasonable 11    opportunity for private consultation with counsel, and for 12    communication with others of his or her choice by 13    visitation, mail and telephone; and14        (4) direct that the sheriff deliver the defendant as 15    required for appearances in connection with court 16    proceedings.17    (i) Detention. If the court enters an order for the 18detention of the defendant pursuant to subsection (e) of this 19Section, the defendant shall be brought to trial on the 20offense for which he is detained within 90 days after the date 21on which the order for detention was entered.

The defendant shall have the 10    opportunity to testify, to present witnesses on his or her 11    own behalf, and to cross-examine any witnesses that are 12    called by the State. Defense counsel shall be given 13    adequate opportunity to confer with the defendant before 14    any hearing at which conditions of release or the 15    detention of the defendant are to be considered, with an 16    accommodation for a physical condition made to facilitate 17    attorney/client consultation. If defense counsel needs to 18    confer or consult with the defendant during any hearing 19    conducted via a 2-way two-way audio-visual communication 20    system, such consultation shall not be recorded and shall 21    be undertaken consistent with constitutional protections. 22        (3.5) A hearing at which pretrial release may be 23    denied must be conducted in person (and not by way of 2-way 24    two-way audio visual communication) unless the accused 25    waives the right to be present physically in court, the 26    court determines that the physical health and safety of   SB2380- 14 -LRB104 03946 RLC 13970 b1    any person necessary to the proceedings would be 2    endangered by appearing in court, or the chief judge of 3    the circuit orders use of that system due to operational 4    challenges in conducting the hearing in person. Such 5    operational challenges must be documented and approved by 6    the chief judge of the circuit, and a plan to address the 7    challenges through reasonable efforts must be presented 8    and approved by the Administrative Office of the Illinois 9    Courts every 6 months. 10        (4) If the defense seeks to compel the complaining 11    witness to testify as a witness in its favor, it shall 12    petition the court for permission. When the ends of 13    justice so require, the court may exercise its discretion 14    and compel the appearance of a complaining witness. The 15    court shall state on the record reasons for granting a 16    defense request to compel the presence of a complaining 17    witness only on the issue of the defendant's pretrial 18    detention. In making a determination under this Section, 19    the court shall state on the record the reason for 20    granting a defense request to compel the presence of a 21    complaining witness, and only grant the request if the 22    court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the 23    defendant will be materially prejudiced if the complaining 24    witness does not appear. Cross-examination of a 25    complaining witness at the pretrial detention hearing for 26    the purpose of impeaching the witness' credibility is   SB2380- 15 -LRB104 03946 RLC 13970 b1    insufficient reason to compel the presence of the witness. 2    In deciding whether to compel the appearance of a 3    complaining witness, the court shall be considerate of the 4    emotional and physical well-being of the witness. The 5    pre-trial detention hearing is not to be used for purposes 6    of discovery, and the post arraignment rules of discovery 7    do not apply. The State shall tender to the defendant, 8    prior to the hearing, copies, if any, of the defendant's 9    criminal history, if available, and any written or 10    recorded statements and the substance of any oral 11    statements made by any person, if in the State's 12    Attorney's possession at the time of the hearing. 13        (5) The rules concerning the admissibility of evidence 14    in criminal trials do not apply to the presentation and 15    consideration of information at the hearing. At the trial 16    concerning the offense for which the hearing was conducted 17    neither the finding of the court nor any transcript or 18    other record of the hearing shall be admissible in the 19    State's case-in-chief, but shall be admissible for 20    impeachment, or as provided in Section 115-10.1 of this 21    Code, or in a perjury proceeding.22        (6) The defendant may not move to suppress evidence or 23    a confession, however, evidence that proof of the charged 24    crime may have been the result of an unlawful search or 25    seizure, or both, or through improper interrogation, is 26    relevant in assessing the weight of the evidence against   SB2380- 16 -LRB104 03946 RLC 13970 b1    the defendant.2        (7) Decisions regarding release, conditions of 3    release, and detention prior to trial must be 4    individualized, and no single factor or standard may be 5    used exclusively to order detention. Risk assessment tools 6    may not be used as the sole basis to deny pretrial release. 7    (g) Factors to be considered in making a determination of 8dangerousness.
