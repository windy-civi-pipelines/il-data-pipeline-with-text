Pursuant to subsection (b), in conducting utilization 19review of all covered services and benefits for the diagnosis, 20prevention, and treatment of substance use disorders an 21insurer shall use the most recent edition of the patient 22placement criteria established by the American Society of 23Addiction Medicine.24    (m) In conducting utilization review relating to level of 25care placement, continued stay, transfer, discharge, or any 26other patient care decisions that are within the scope of the   HB3020- 22 -LRB104 08245 BAB 18295 b1sources specified in subsection (l), an insurer shall not 2apply different, additional, conflicting, or more restrictive 3utilization review criteria than the criteria set forth in 4those sources. For all level of care placement decisions, the 5insurer shall authorize placement at the level of care 6consistent with the assessment of the insured using the 7relevant patient placement criteria as specified in subsection 8(l). If that level of placement is not available, the insurer 9shall authorize the next higher level of care. In the event of 10disagreement, the insurer shall provide full detail of its 11assessment using the relevant criteria as specified in 12subsection (l) to the provider of the service and the patient.13    If an insurer purchases or licenses utilization review 14criteria pursuant to this subsection, the insurer shall verify 15and document before use that the criteria were developed in 16accordance with subsection (k). 17    (n) In conducting utilization review that is outside the 18scope of the criteria as specified in subsection (l) or 19relates to the advancements in technology or in the types or 20levels of care that are not addressed in the most recent 21versions of the sources specified in subsection (l), an 22insurer shall conduct utilization review in accordance with 23subsection (k).24    (o) This Section does not in any way limit the rights of a 25patient under the Medical Patient Rights Act.26    (p) This Section does not in any way limit early and   HB3020- 23 -LRB104 08245 BAB 18295 b1periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment benefits as 2defined under 42 U.S.C. 1396d(r).3    (q) To ensure the proper use of the criteria described in 4subsection (l), every insurer shall do all of the following:5        (1) Educate the insurer's staff, including any third 6    parties contracted with the insurer to review claims, 7    conduct utilization reviews, or make medical necessity 8    determinations about the utilization review criteria.9        (2) Make the educational program available to other 10    stakeholders, including the insurer's participating or 11    contracted providers and potential participants, 12    beneficiaries, or covered lives.

For 19    utilization review criteria not concerning level of care 20    placement, continued stay, transfer, discharge, or other 21    patient care decisions used by the insurer pursuant to 22    subsection (m), the insurer may place the criteria on a 23    secure, password-protected website so long as the access 24    requirements of the website do not unreasonably restrict 25    access to insureds or their providers. No restrictions 26    shall be placed upon the insured's or treating provider's   HB3020- 24 -LRB104 08245 BAB 18295 b1    access right to utilization review criteria obtained under 2    this paragraph at any point in time, including before an 3    initial request for authorization.4        (4) Track, identify, and analyze how the utilization 5    review criteria are used to certify care, deny care, and 6    support the appeals process.7        (5) Conduct interrater reliability testing to ensure 8    consistency in utilization review decision making that 9    covers how medical necessity decisions are made; this 10    assessment shall cover all aspects of utilization review 11    as defined in subsection (h).12        (6) Run interrater reliability reports about how the 13    clinical guidelines are used in conjunction with the 14    utilization review process and parity compliance 15    activities.16        (7) Achieve interrater reliability pass rates of at 17    least 90% and, if this threshold is not met, immediately 18    provide for the remediation of poor interrater reliability 19    and interrater reliability testing for all new staff 20    before they can conduct utilization review without 21    supervision.22        (8) Maintain documentation of interrater reliability 23    testing and the remediation actions taken for those with 24    pass rates lower than 90% and submit to the Department of 25    Insurance or, in the case of Medicaid managed care 26    organizations, the Department of Healthcare and Family   HB3020- 25 -LRB104 08245 BAB 18295 b1    Services the testing results and a summary of remedial 2    actions as part of parity compliance reporting set forth 3    in subsection (k) of Section 370c.1.4    (r) This Section applies to all health care services and 5benefits for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of 6mental, emotional, nervous, or substance use disorders or 7conditions covered by an insurance policy, including 8prescription drugs.9    (s) This Section applies to an insurer that amends, 10delivers, issues, or renews a group or individual policy of 11accident and health insurance or a qualified health plan 12offered through the health insurance marketplace in this State 13providing coverage for hospital or medical treatment and 14conducts utilization review as defined in this Section, 15including Medicaid managed care organizations, and any entity 16or contracting provider that performs utilization review or 17utilization management functions on an insurer's behalf.18    (t) If the Director determines that an insurer has 19violated this Section, the Director may, after appropriate 20notice and opportunity for hearing, by order, assess a civil 21penalty between $1,000 and $5,000 for each violation.
