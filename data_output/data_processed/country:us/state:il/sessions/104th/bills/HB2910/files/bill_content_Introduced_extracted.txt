Provides that, beginning January 1, 2026, the staffing percentage used in the calculation of the per diem staffing add-on shall be its PDPM STRIVE Staffing Ratio. Sets forth how to calculate a nursing facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing Ratio, PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target, Illinois Adjusted Facility Case-Mix Hours Per Resident Per Day, and STRIVE staffing fee schedule. Effective immediately or on the date House Bill 4907 of the 103rd General Assembly takes effect, whichever is later.LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b  A BILL FOR HB2910LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    AN ACT concerning public aid. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 5. If and only if House Bill 4907 of the 103rd 5General Assembly becomes law, then the Illinois Public Aid 6Code is amended by changing Section 5-5.2 as follows: 7    (305 ILCS 5/5-5.2)8    Sec. 5-5.2. Payment. 9    (a) All nursing facilities that are grouped pursuant to 10Section 5-5.1 of this Act shall receive the same rate of 11payment for similar services.12    (b) It shall be a matter of State policy that the Illinois 13Department shall utilize a uniform billing cycle throughout 14the State for the long-term care providers.15    (c) (Blank). 16    (c-1) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, 17the methodologies for reimbursement of nursing services as 18provided under this Article shall no longer be applicable for 19bills payable for nursing services rendered on or after a new 20reimbursement system based on the Patient Driven Payment Model 21(PDPM) has been fully operationalized, which shall take effect 22for services provided on or after the implementation of the 23PDPM reimbursement system begins. For the purposes of Public   HB2910- 2 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1Act 102-1035, the implementation date of the PDPM 2reimbursement system and all related provisions shall be July 31, 2022 if the following conditions are met: (i) the Centers 4for Medicare and Medicaid Services has approved corresponding 5changes in the reimbursement system and bed assessment; and 6(ii) the Department has filed rules to implement these changes 7no later than June 1, 2022. Failure of the Department to file 8rules to implement the changes provided in Public Act 102-1035 9no later than June 1, 2022 shall result in the implementation 10date being delayed to October 1, 2022. 11    (d) The new nursing services reimbursement methodology 12utilizing the Patient Driven Payment Model, which shall be 13referred to as the PDPM reimbursement system, taking effect 14July 1, 2022, upon federal approval by the Centers for 15Medicare and Medicaid Services, shall be based on the 16following: 17        (1) The methodology shall be resident-centered, 18    facility-specific, cost-based, and based on guidance from 19    the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 20        (2) Costs shall be annually rebased and case mix index 21    quarterly updated. The nursing services methodology will 22    be assigned to the Medicaid enrolled residents on record 23    as of 30 days prior to the beginning of the rate period in 24    the Department's Medicaid Management Information System 25    (MMIS) as present on the last day of the second quarter 26    preceding the rate period based upon the Assessment   HB2910- 3 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    Reference Date of the Minimum Data Set (MDS). 2        (3) Regional wage adjustors based on the Health 3    Service Areas (HSA) groupings and adjusters in effect on 4    April 30, 2012 shall be included, except no adjuster shall 5    be lower than 1.06. 6        (4) PDPM nursing case mix indices in effect on March 7    1, 2022 shall be assigned to each resident class at no less 8    than 0.7858 of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 9    Services PDPM unadjusted case mix values, in effect on 10    March 1, 2022.11        (5) The pool of funds available for distribution by 12    case mix and the base facility rate shall be determined 13    using the formula contained in subsection (d-1). 14        (6) The Department shall establish a variable per diem 15    staffing add-on in accordance with the most recent 16    available federal staffing report, currently the Payroll 17    Based Journal, for the same period of time, and if 18    applicable adjusted for acuity using the same quarter's 19    MDS. The Department shall rely on Payroll Based Journals 20    provided to the Department of Public Health to make a 21    determination of non-submission. If the Department is 22    notified by a facility of missing or inaccurate Payroll 23    Based Journal data or an incorrect calculation of 24    staffing, the Department must make a correction as soon as 25    the error is verified for the applicable quarter.26        Beginning October 1, 2024, the staffing percentage   HB2910- 4 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    used in the calculation of the per diem staffing add-on 2    shall be its PDPM STRIVE Staffing Ratio which equals: its 3    Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day 4    as published in the most recent federal staffing report 5    (the Provider Information File), divided by the facility's 6    PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target. Each facility's PDPM STRIVE 7    Staffing Target is equal to .82 times the facility's 8    Illinois Adjusted Facility Case-Mix Hours Per Resident Per 9    Day. A facility's Illinois Adjusted Facility Case Mix 10    Hours Per Resident Per Day is equal to its Case-Mix Total 11    Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 12    the most recent federal Provider Information file) times 13    3.662 (which reflects the national resident days-weighted 14    mean Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per 15    Day as calculated using the January 2024 federal Provider 16    Information Files), divided by the national resident 17    days-weighted mean Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per 18    Resident Per Day calculated using the most recent State US 19    Averages file.20        Beginning January 1, 2025, the staffing percentage 21    used in the calculation of the per diem staffing add-on 22    shall be its PDPM STRIVE Staffing Ratio which equals: its 23    Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day 24    as published in the most recent federal staffing report 25    (the Provider Information File), divided by the facility's 26    PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target. Each facility's PDPM STRIVE   HB2910- 5 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    Staffing Target is equal to .7122 times the facility's 2    Illinois Adjusted Facility Case-Mix Hours Per Resident Per 3    Day. A facility's Illinois Adjusted Facility Case Mix 4    Hours Per Resident Per Day is equal to its Case-Mix Total 5    Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 6    the most recent federal staffing report Provider 7    Information file) times 3.79 (which is the Reported Total 8    Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day for the Nation 9    as reported in the January 2024 State US Averages file), 10    divided by the Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per 11    Resident Per Day for the Nation as reported in the most 12    recent State US Averages file. 13        Beginning January 1, 2026, the staffing percentage 14    used in the calculation of the per diem staffing add-on 15    shall be its PDPM STRIVE Staffing Ratio which equals: its 16    Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day 17    as published in the most recent federal staffing report 18    (the Provider Information File), divided by the facility's 19    PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target. Each facility's PDPM STRIVE 20    Staffing Target is equal to .7122 times the facility's 21    Illinois Adjusted Facility Case-Mix Hours Per Resident Per 22    Day. A facility's Illinois Adjusted Facility Case-Mix 23    Hours Per Resident Per Day is equal to its Nursing 24    Case-Mix (as published in the most recent federal staffing 25    report Provider Information File) divided by 1.36671 and 26    then multiplied by 3.79 (which is the Reported Total Nurse   HB2910- 6 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day for the Nation as 2    reported in the January 2024 State US Averages file), 3    divided by the Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per 4    Resident Per Day for the Nation as reported in the most 5    recent State US Averages file. 6        (6.5) Beginning July 1, 2024, the paid per diem 7    staffing add-on shall be the paid per diem staffing add-on 8    in effect April 1, 2024. For dates beginning October 1, 9    2024 and through September 30, 2025, the denominator for 10    the staffing percentage shall be the lesser of the 11    facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target and:12            (A) For the quarter beginning October 1, 2024, the 13        sum of 20% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 14        Target and 80% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 15        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 16        the January 2024 federal staffing report).17            (B) For the quarter beginning January 1, 2025, the 18        sum of 40% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 19        Target and 60% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 20        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 21        the January 2024 federal staffing report).22            (C) For the quarter beginning March 1, 2025, the 23        sum of 60% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 24        Target and 40% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 25        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 26        the January 2024 federal staffing report).  HB2910- 7 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1            (D) For the quarter beginning July 1, 2025, the 2        sum of 80% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 3        Target and 20% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 4        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 5        the January 2024 federal staffing report). 6         Facilities with at least 70% of the staffing 7    indicated by the STRIVE study shall be paid a per diem 8    add-on of $9, increasing by equivalent steps for each 9    whole percentage point until the facilities reach a per 10    diem of $16.52. Facilities with at least 80% of the 11    staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall be paid a per 12    diem add-on of $16.52, increasing by equivalent steps for 13    each whole percentage point until the facilities reach a 14    per diem add-on of $25.77. Facilities with at least 92% of 15    the staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall be paid a 16    per diem add-on of $25.77, increasing by equivalent steps 17    for each whole percentage point until the facilities reach 18    a per diem add-on of $30.98. Facilities with at least 100% 19    of the staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall be 20    paid a per diem add-on of $30.98, increasing by equivalent 21    steps for each whole percentage point until the facilities 22    reach a per diem add-on of $36.44. Facilities with at 23    least 110% of the staffing indicated by the STRIVE study 24    shall be paid a per diem add-on of $36.44, increasing by 25    equivalent steps for each whole percentage point until the 26    facilities reach a per diem add-on of $38.68.

For the quarters beginning July 1, 2022 and 6    October 1, 2022, no facility's variable per diem staffing 7    add-on shall be calculated at a rate lower than 85% of the 8    staffing indicated by the STRIVE study. No facility below 9    70% of the staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall 10    receive a variable per diem staffing add-on after December 11    31, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2026, the STRIVE staffing 12    fee schedule shall be multiplied by the regional wage 13    adjuster in subsection (d) paragraph (3) of this Section. 14        (7) For dates of services beginning July 1, 2022, the 15    PDPM nursing component per diem for each nursing facility 16    shall be the product of the facility's (i) statewide PDPM 17    nursing base per diem rate, $92.25, adjusted for the 18    facility average PDPM case mix index calculated quarterly 19    and (ii) the regional wage adjuster, and then add the 20    Medicaid access adjustment as defined in (e-3) of this 21    Section. Transition rates for services provided between 22    July 1, 2022 and October 1, 2023 shall be the greater of 23    the PDPM nursing component per diem or: 24            (A) for the quarter beginning July 1, 2022, the 25        RUG-IV nursing component per diem;26            (B) for the quarter beginning October 1, 2022, the   HB2910- 9 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1        sum of the RUG-IV nursing component per diem 2        multiplied by 0.80 and the PDPM nursing component per 3        diem multiplied by 0.20;4            (C) for the quarter beginning January 1, 2023, the 5        sum of the RUG-IV nursing component per diem 6        multiplied by 0.60 and the PDPM nursing component per 7        diem multiplied by 0.40;8            (D) for the quarter beginning April 1, 2023, the 9        sum of the RUG-IV nursing component per diem 10        multiplied by 0.40 and the PDPM nursing component per 11        diem multiplied by 0.60;12            (E) for the quarter beginning July 1, 2023, the 13        sum of the RUG-IV nursing component per diem 14        multiplied by 0.20 and the PDPM nursing component per 15        diem multiplied by 0.80; or16            (F) for the quarter beginning October 1, 2023 and 17        each subsequent quarter, the transition rate shall end 18        and a nursing facility shall be paid 100% of the PDPM 19        nursing component per diem.20    (d-1) Calculation of base year Statewide RUG-IV nursing 21base per diem rate. 22        (1) Base rate spending pool shall be: 23            (A) The base year resident days which are 24        calculated by multiplying the number of Medicaid 25        residents in each nursing home as indicated in the MDS 26        data defined in paragraph (4) by 365.  HB2910- 10 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1            (B) Each facility's nursing component per diem in 2        effect on July 1, 2012 shall be multiplied by 3        subsection (A).4            (C) Thirteen million is added to the product of 5        subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (B) to adjust for 6        the exclusion of nursing homes defined in paragraph 7        (5). 8        (2) For each nursing home with Medicaid residents as 9    indicated by the MDS data defined in paragraph (4), 10    weighted days adjusted for case mix and regional wage 11    adjustment shall be calculated. For each home this 12    calculation is the product of:13            (A) Base year resident days as calculated in 14        subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1).15            (B) The nursing home's regional wage adjustor 16        based on the Health Service Areas (HSA) groupings and 17        adjustors in effect on April 30, 2012.18            (C) Facility weighted case mix which is the number 19        of Medicaid residents as indicated by the MDS data 20        defined in paragraph (4) multiplied by the associated 21        case weight for the RUG-IV 48 grouper model using 22        standard RUG-IV procedures for index maximization.23            (D) The sum of the products calculated for each 24        nursing home in subparagraphs (A) through (C) above 25        shall be the base year case mix, rate adjusted 26        weighted days.  HB2910- 11 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1        (3) The Statewide RUG-IV nursing base per diem rate:2            (A) on January 1, 2014 shall be the quotient of the 3        paragraph (1) divided by the sum calculated under 4        subparagraph (D) of paragraph (2);5            (B) on and after July 1, 2014 and until July 1, 6        2022, shall be the amount calculated under 7        subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (3) plus $1.76; and 8            (C) beginning July 1, 2022 and thereafter, $7 9        shall be added to the amount calculated under 10        subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (3) of this 11        Section. 12        (4) Minimum Data Set (MDS) comprehensive assessments 13    for Medicaid residents on the last day of the quarter used 14    to establish the base rate.15        (5) Nursing facilities designated as of July 1, 2012 16    by the Department as "Institutions for Mental Disease" 17    shall be excluded from all calculations under this 18    subsection.

Implementation of 23Medicare's Patient-Driven Payment Model shall, by September 1, 242020, end the collection of the MDS data that is necessary to 25maintain the current RUG-IV Medicaid payment methodology. The 26technical advisory group must consider a revised reimbursement   HB2910- 16 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1methodology that takes into account transparency, 2accountability, actual staffing as reported under the 3federally required Payroll Based Journal system, changes to 4the minimum wage, adequacy in coverage of the cost of care, and 5a quality component that rewards quality improvements.6    (l) The Department shall establish per diem add-on 7payments to improve the quality of care delivered by 8facilities, including:9        (1) Incentive payments determined by facility 10    performance on specified quality measures in an initial 11    amount of $70,000,000. Nothing in this subsection shall be 12    construed to limit the quality of care payments in the 13    aggregate statewide to $70,000,000, and, if quality of 14    care has improved across nursing facilities, the 15    Department shall adjust those add-on payments accordingly. 16    The quality payment methodology described in this 17    subsection must be used for at least State Fiscal Year 18    2023. Beginning with the quarter starting July 1, 2023, 19    the Department may add, remove, or change quality metrics 20    and make associated changes to the quality payment 21    methodology as outlined in subparagraph (E). Facilities 22    designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 23    Services as a special focus facility or a hospital-based 24    nursing home do not qualify for quality payments.25            (A) Each quality pool must be distributed by 26        assigning a quality weighted score for each nursing   HB2910- 17 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1        home which is calculated by multiplying the nursing 2        home's quality base period Medicaid days by the 3        nursing home's star rating weight in that period.4            (B) Star rating weights are assigned based on the 5        nursing home's star rating for the LTS quality star 6        rating. As used in this subparagraph, "LTS quality 7        star rating" means the long-term stay quality rating 8        for each nursing facility, as assigned by the Centers 9        for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the Five-Star 10        Quality Rating System. The rating is a number ranging 11        from 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest).12                (i) Zero-star or one-star rating has a weight 13            of 0.14                (ii) Two-star rating has a weight of 0.75.15                (iii) Three-star rating has a weight of 1.5. 16                (iv) Four-star rating has a weight of 2.5.17                (v) Five-star rating has a weight of 3.5.18            (C) Each nursing home's quality weight score is 19        divided by the sum of all quality weight scores for 20        qualifying nursing homes to determine the proportion 21        of the quality pool to be paid to the nursing home. 22            (D) The quality pool is no less than $70,000,000 23        annually or $17,500,000 per quarter. The Department 24        shall publish on its website the estimated payments 25        and the associated weights for each facility 45 days 26        prior to when the initial payments for the quarter are   HB2910- 18 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1        to be paid. The Department shall assign each facility 2        the most recent and applicable quarter's STAR value 3        unless the facility notifies the Department within 15 4        days of an issue and the facility provides reasonable 5        evidence demonstrating its timely compliance with 6        federal data submission requirements for the quarter 7        of record. If such evidence cannot be provided to the 8        Department, the STAR rating assigned to the facility 9        shall be reduced by one from the prior quarter. 10            (E) The Department shall review quality metrics 11        used for payment of the quality pool and make 12        recommendations for any associated changes to the 13        methodology for distributing quality pool payments in 14        consultation with associations representing long-term 15        care providers, consumer advocates, organizations 16        representing workers of long-term care facilities, and 17        payors. The Department may establish, by rule, changes 18        to the methodology for distributing quality pool 19        payments. 20            (F) The Department shall disburse quality pool 21        payments from the Long-Term Care Provider Fund on a 22        monthly basis in amounts proportional to the total 23        quality pool payment determined for the quarter. 24            (G) The Department shall publish any changes in 25        the methodology for distributing quality pool payments 26        prior to the beginning of the measurement period or   HB2910- 19 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1        quality base period for any metric added to the 2        distribution's methodology. 3        (2) Payments based on CNA tenure, promotion, and CNA 4    training for the purpose of increasing CNA compensation. 5    It is the intent of this subsection that payments made in 6    accordance with this paragraph be directly incorporated 7    into increased compensation for CNAs. As used in this 8    paragraph, "CNA" means a certified nursing assistant as 9    that term is described in Section 3-206 of the Nursing 10    Home Care Act, Section 3-206 of the ID/DD Community Care 11    Act, and Section 3-206 of the MC/DD Act. The Department 12    shall establish, by rule, payments to nursing facilities 13    equal to Medicaid's share of the tenure wage increments 14    specified in this paragraph for all reported CNA employee 15    hours compensated according to a posted schedule 16    consisting of increments at least as large as those 17    specified in this paragraph. The increments are as 18    follows: an additional $1.50 per hour for CNAs with at 19    least one and less than 2 years' experience plus another 20    $1 per hour for each additional year of experience up to a 21    maximum of $6.50 for CNAs with at least 6 years of 22    experience. For purposes of this paragraph, Medicaid's 23    share shall be the ratio determined by paid Medicaid bed 24    days divided by total bed days for the applicable time 25    period used in the calculation. In addition, and additive 26    to any tenure increments paid as specified in this   HB2910- 20 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    paragraph, the Department shall establish, by rule, 2    payments supporting Medicaid's share of the 3    promotion-based wage increments for CNA employee hours 4    compensated for that promotion with at least a $1.50 5    hourly increase. Medicaid's share shall be established as 6    it is for the tenure increments described in this 7    paragraph. Qualifying promotions shall be defined by the 8    Department in rules for an expected 10-15% subset of CNAs 9    assigned intermediate, specialized, or added roles such as 10    CNA trainers, CNA scheduling "captains", and CNA 11    specialists for resident conditions like dementia or 12    memory care or behavioral health.13    (m) The Department shall work with nursing facility 14industry representatives to design policies and procedures to 15permit facilities to address the integrity of data from 16federal reporting sites used by the Department in setting 17facility rates. 18(Source: P.A. 102-77, eff. 7-9-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 19102-1035, eff. 5-31-22; 102-1118, eff. 1-18-23; 103-102, 20Article 40, Section 40-5, eff. 1-1-24; 103-102, Article 50, 21Section 50-5, eff. 1-1-24; 103-593, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 227-1-24; 10300HB4907enr.) 23    Section 99.

For the purposes of Public   HB2910- 2 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1Act 102-1035, the implementation date of the PDPM 2reimbursement system and all related provisions shall be July 31, 2022 if the following conditions are met: (i) the Centers 4for Medicare and Medicaid Services has approved corresponding 5changes in the reimbursement system and bed assessment; and 6(ii) the Department has filed rules to implement these changes 7no later than June 1, 2022. Failure of the Department to file 8rules to implement the changes provided in Public Act 102-1035 9no later than June 1, 2022 shall result in the implementation 10date being delayed to October 1, 2022. 11    (d) The new nursing services reimbursement methodology 12utilizing the Patient Driven Payment Model, which shall be 13referred to as the PDPM reimbursement system, taking effect 14July 1, 2022, upon federal approval by the Centers for 15Medicare and Medicaid Services, shall be based on the 16following: 17        (1) The methodology shall be resident-centered, 18    facility-specific, cost-based, and based on guidance from 19    the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 20        (2) Costs shall be annually rebased and case mix index 21    quarterly updated. The nursing services methodology will 22    be assigned to the Medicaid enrolled residents on record 23    as of 30 days prior to the beginning of the rate period in 24    the Department's Medicaid Management Information System 25    (MMIS) as present on the last day of the second quarter 26    preceding the rate period based upon the Assessment   HB2910- 3 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    Reference Date of the Minimum Data Set (MDS). 2        (3) Regional wage adjustors based on the Health 3    Service Areas (HSA) groupings and adjusters in effect on 4    April 30, 2012 shall be included, except no adjuster shall 5    be lower than 1.06. 6        (4) PDPM nursing case mix indices in effect on March 7    1, 2022 shall be assigned to each resident class at no less 8    than 0.7858 of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 9    Services PDPM unadjusted case mix values, in effect on 10    March 1, 2022.11        (5) The pool of funds available for distribution by 12    case mix and the base facility rate shall be determined 13    using the formula contained in subsection (d-1). 14        (6) The Department shall establish a variable per diem 15    staffing add-on in accordance with the most recent 16    available federal staffing report, currently the Payroll 17    Based Journal, for the same period of time, and if 18    applicable adjusted for acuity using the same quarter's 19    MDS. The Department shall rely on Payroll Based Journals 20    provided to the Department of Public Health to make a 21    determination of non-submission. If the Department is 22    notified by a facility of missing or inaccurate Payroll 23    Based Journal data or an incorrect calculation of 24    staffing, the Department must make a correction as soon as 25    the error is verified for the applicable quarter.26        Beginning October 1, 2024, the staffing percentage   HB2910- 4 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    used in the calculation of the per diem staffing add-on 2    shall be its PDPM STRIVE Staffing Ratio which equals: its 3    Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day 4    as published in the most recent federal staffing report 5    (the Provider Information File), divided by the facility's 6    PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target. Each facility's PDPM STRIVE 7    Staffing Target is equal to .82 times the facility's 8    Illinois Adjusted Facility Case-Mix Hours Per Resident Per 9    Day. A facility's Illinois Adjusted Facility Case Mix 10    Hours Per Resident Per Day is equal to its Case-Mix Total 11    Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 12    the most recent federal Provider Information file) times 13    3.662 (which reflects the national resident days-weighted 14    mean Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per 15    Day as calculated using the January 2024 federal Provider 16    Information Files), divided by the national resident 17    days-weighted mean Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per 18    Resident Per Day calculated using the most recent State US 19    Averages file.20        Beginning January 1, 2025, the staffing percentage 21    used in the calculation of the per diem staffing add-on 22    shall be its PDPM STRIVE Staffing Ratio which equals: its 23    Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day 24    as published in the most recent federal staffing report 25    (the Provider Information File), divided by the facility's 26    PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target. Each facility's PDPM STRIVE   HB2910- 5 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    Staffing Target is equal to .7122 times the facility's 2    Illinois Adjusted Facility Case-Mix Hours Per Resident Per 3    Day. A facility's Illinois Adjusted Facility Case Mix 4    Hours Per Resident Per Day is equal to its Case-Mix Total 5    Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 6    the most recent federal staffing report Provider 7    Information file) times 3.79 (which is the Reported Total 8    Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day for the Nation 9    as reported in the January 2024 State US Averages file), 10    divided by the Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per 11    Resident Per Day for the Nation as reported in the most 12    recent State US Averages file. 13        Beginning January 1, 2026, the staffing percentage 14    used in the calculation of the per diem staffing add-on 15    shall be its PDPM STRIVE Staffing Ratio which equals: its 16    Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day 17    as published in the most recent federal staffing report 18    (the Provider Information File), divided by the facility's 19    PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target. Each facility's PDPM STRIVE 20    Staffing Target is equal to .7122 times the facility's 21    Illinois Adjusted Facility Case-Mix Hours Per Resident Per 22    Day. A facility's Illinois Adjusted Facility Case-Mix 23    Hours Per Resident Per Day is equal to its Nursing 24    Case-Mix (as published in the most recent federal staffing 25    report Provider Information File) divided by 1.36671 and 26    then multiplied by 3.79 (which is the Reported Total Nurse   HB2910- 6 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day for the Nation as 2    reported in the January 2024 State US Averages file), 3    divided by the Reported Total Nurse Staffing Hours Per 4    Resident Per Day for the Nation as reported in the most 5    recent State US Averages file. 6        (6.5) Beginning July 1, 2024, the paid per diem 7    staffing add-on shall be the paid per diem staffing add-on 8    in effect April 1, 2024. For dates beginning October 1, 9    2024 and through September 30, 2025, the denominator for 10    the staffing percentage shall be the lesser of the 11    facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing Target and:12            (A) For the quarter beginning October 1, 2024, the 13        sum of 20% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 14        Target and 80% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 15        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 16        the January 2024 federal staffing report).17            (B) For the quarter beginning January 1, 2025, the 18        sum of 40% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 19        Target and 60% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 20        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 21        the January 2024 federal staffing report).22            (C) For the quarter beginning March 1, 2025, the 23        sum of 60% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 24        Target and 40% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 25        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 26        the January 2024 federal staffing report).  HB2910- 7 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1            (D) For the quarter beginning July 1, 2025, the 2        sum of 80% of the facility's PDPM STRIVE Staffing 3        Target and 20% of the facility's Case-Mix Total Nurse 4        Staffing Hours Per Resident Per Day (as published in 5        the January 2024 federal staffing report). 6         Facilities with at least 70% of the staffing 7    indicated by the STRIVE study shall be paid a per diem 8    add-on of $9, increasing by equivalent steps for each 9    whole percentage point until the facilities reach a per 10    diem of $16.52. Facilities with at least 80% of the 11    staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall be paid a per 12    diem add-on of $16.52, increasing by equivalent steps for 13    each whole percentage point until the facilities reach a 14    per diem add-on of $25.77. Facilities with at least 92% of 15    the staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall be paid a 16    per diem add-on of $25.77, increasing by equivalent steps 17    for each whole percentage point until the facilities reach 18    a per diem add-on of $30.98. Facilities with at least 100% 19    of the staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall be 20    paid a per diem add-on of $30.98, increasing by equivalent 21    steps for each whole percentage point until the facilities 22    reach a per diem add-on of $36.44. Facilities with at 23    least 110% of the staffing indicated by the STRIVE study 24    shall be paid a per diem add-on of $36.44, increasing by 25    equivalent steps for each whole percentage point until the 26    facilities reach a per diem add-on of $38.68. Facilities   HB2910- 8 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    with at least 125% or higher of the staffing indicated by 2    the STRIVE study shall be paid a per diem add-on of $38.68. 3    No nursing facility's variable staffing per diem add-on 4    shall be reduced by more than 5% in 2 consecutive 5    quarters. For the quarters beginning July 1, 2022 and 6    October 1, 2022, no facility's variable per diem staffing 7    add-on shall be calculated at a rate lower than 85% of the 8    staffing indicated by the STRIVE study. No facility below 9    70% of the staffing indicated by the STRIVE study shall 10    receive a variable per diem staffing add-on after December 11    31, 2022. Beginning January 1, 2026, the STRIVE staffing 12    fee schedule shall be multiplied by the regional wage 13    adjuster in subsection (d) paragraph (3) of this Section. 14        (7) For dates of services beginning July 1, 2022, the 15    PDPM nursing component per diem for each nursing facility 16    shall be the product of the facility's (i) statewide PDPM 17    nursing base per diem rate, $92.25, adjusted for the 18    facility average PDPM case mix index calculated quarterly 19    and (ii) the regional wage adjuster, and then add the 20    Medicaid access adjustment as defined in (e-3) of this 21    Section.

Implementation of 23Medicare's Patient-Driven Payment Model shall, by September 1, 242020, end the collection of the MDS data that is necessary to 25maintain the current RUG-IV Medicaid payment methodology. The 26technical advisory group must consider a revised reimbursement   HB2910- 16 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1methodology that takes into account transparency, 2accountability, actual staffing as reported under the 3federally required Payroll Based Journal system, changes to 4the minimum wage, adequacy in coverage of the cost of care, and 5a quality component that rewards quality improvements.6    (l) The Department shall establish per diem add-on 7payments to improve the quality of care delivered by 8facilities, including:9        (1) Incentive payments determined by facility 10    performance on specified quality measures in an initial 11    amount of $70,000,000. Nothing in this subsection shall be 12    construed to limit the quality of care payments in the 13    aggregate statewide to $70,000,000, and, if quality of 14    care has improved across nursing facilities, the 15    Department shall adjust those add-on payments accordingly. 16    The quality payment methodology described in this 17    subsection must be used for at least State Fiscal Year 18    2023. Beginning with the quarter starting July 1, 2023, 19    the Department may add, remove, or change quality metrics 20    and make associated changes to the quality payment 21    methodology as outlined in subparagraph (E). Facilities 22    designated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 23    Services as a special focus facility or a hospital-based 24    nursing home do not qualify for quality payments.25            (A) Each quality pool must be distributed by 26        assigning a quality weighted score for each nursing   HB2910- 17 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1        home which is calculated by multiplying the nursing 2        home's quality base period Medicaid days by the 3        nursing home's star rating weight in that period.4            (B) Star rating weights are assigned based on the 5        nursing home's star rating for the LTS quality star 6        rating. As used in this subparagraph, "LTS quality 7        star rating" means the long-term stay quality rating 8        for each nursing facility, as assigned by the Centers 9        for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the Five-Star 10        Quality Rating System. The rating is a number ranging 11        from 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest).12                (i) Zero-star or one-star rating has a weight 13            of 0.14                (ii) Two-star rating has a weight of 0.75.15                (iii) Three-star rating has a weight of 1.5. 16                (iv) Four-star rating has a weight of 2.5.17                (v) Five-star rating has a weight of 3.5.18            (C) Each nursing home's quality weight score is 19        divided by the sum of all quality weight scores for 20        qualifying nursing homes to determine the proportion 21        of the quality pool to be paid to the nursing home. 22            (D) The quality pool is no less than $70,000,000 23        annually or $17,500,000 per quarter. The Department 24        shall publish on its website the estimated payments 25        and the associated weights for each facility 45 days 26        prior to when the initial payments for the quarter are   HB2910- 18 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1        to be paid. The Department shall assign each facility 2        the most recent and applicable quarter's STAR value 3        unless the facility notifies the Department within 15 4        days of an issue and the facility provides reasonable 5        evidence demonstrating its timely compliance with 6        federal data submission requirements for the quarter 7        of record. If such evidence cannot be provided to the 8        Department, the STAR rating assigned to the facility 9        shall be reduced by one from the prior quarter. 10            (E) The Department shall review quality metrics 11        used for payment of the quality pool and make 12        recommendations for any associated changes to the 13        methodology for distributing quality pool payments in 14        consultation with associations representing long-term 15        care providers, consumer advocates, organizations 16        representing workers of long-term care facilities, and 17        payors. The Department may establish, by rule, changes 18        to the methodology for distributing quality pool 19        payments. 20            (F) The Department shall disburse quality pool 21        payments from the Long-Term Care Provider Fund on a 22        monthly basis in amounts proportional to the total 23        quality pool payment determined for the quarter. 24            (G) The Department shall publish any changes in 25        the methodology for distributing quality pool payments 26        prior to the beginning of the measurement period or   HB2910- 19 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1        quality base period for any metric added to the 2        distribution's methodology. 3        (2) Payments based on CNA tenure, promotion, and CNA 4    training for the purpose of increasing CNA compensation. 5    It is the intent of this subsection that payments made in 6    accordance with this paragraph be directly incorporated 7    into increased compensation for CNAs. As used in this 8    paragraph, "CNA" means a certified nursing assistant as 9    that term is described in Section 3-206 of the Nursing 10    Home Care Act, Section 3-206 of the ID/DD Community Care 11    Act, and Section 3-206 of the MC/DD Act. The Department 12    shall establish, by rule, payments to nursing facilities 13    equal to Medicaid's share of the tenure wage increments 14    specified in this paragraph for all reported CNA employee 15    hours compensated according to a posted schedule 16    consisting of increments at least as large as those 17    specified in this paragraph. The increments are as 18    follows: an additional $1.50 per hour for CNAs with at 19    least one and less than 2 years' experience plus another 20    $1 per hour for each additional year of experience up to a 21    maximum of $6.50 for CNAs with at least 6 years of 22    experience. For purposes of this paragraph, Medicaid's 23    share shall be the ratio determined by paid Medicaid bed 24    days divided by total bed days for the applicable time 25    period used in the calculation. In addition, and additive 26    to any tenure increments paid as specified in this   HB2910- 20 -LRB104 09542 KTG 19605 b1    paragraph, the Department shall establish, by rule, 2    payments supporting Medicaid's share of the 3    promotion-based wage increments for CNA employee hours 4    compensated for that promotion with at least a $1.50 5    hourly increase. Medicaid's share shall be established as 6    it is for the tenure increments described in this 7    paragraph. Qualifying promotions shall be defined by the 8    Department in rules for an expected 10-15% subset of CNAs 9    assigned intermediate, specialized, or added roles such as 10    CNA trainers, CNA scheduling "captains", and CNA 11    specialists for resident conditions like dementia or 12    memory care or behavioral health.13    (m) The Department shall work with nursing facility 14industry representatives to design policies and procedures to 15permit facilities to address the integrity of data from 16federal reporting sites used by the Department in setting 17facility rates. 18(Source: P.A. 102-77, eff. 7-9-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 19102-1035, eff. 5-31-22; 102-1118, eff. 1-18-23; 103-102, 20Article 40, Section 40-5, eff. 1-1-24; 103-102, Article 50, 21Section 50-5, eff. 1-1-24; 103-593, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 227-1-24; 10300HB4907enr.) 23    Section 99.
