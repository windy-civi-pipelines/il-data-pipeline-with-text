Full Text of SJR0019 ILGA.GOV SJR0019 - 104th General Assembly SJ0019LRB104 03459 MST 13482 r1SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION 2    WHEREAS, Policymakers have strongly advocated for efforts 3to elevate the importance of retaining diverse and inclusive 4educators in Illinois; and 5    WHEREAS, The Performance Evaluation Reform Act (PERA), 6Public Act 96-0861, was signed into law by the governor in 7January 2010 and required school districts and other covered 8entities to include student growth as a "significant factor" 9in evaluating principals, assistant principals, and teachers 10by certain implementation dates; the law also required that 11evaluations include a four category rating system and 12regulated training programs for anyone undertaking such 13evaluations; PA 97-8, an offshoot of PERA, introduced the use 14of educators' evaluation rating outcomes into employment 15decisions in a number of ways, including the standards for 16certificate/license actions against an educator for 17incompetency, acquisition of tenure, reductions in 18force/layoffs, and recall rights; and 19    WHEREAS, PERA also created the Illinois Performance 20Evaluation Advisory Council, which recommended the Danielson 21Framework for Teaching to all districts for use in evaluating 22educators' professional practice in 2011; later, the State's 23evaluator training materials incorporated the Danielson   SJ0019- 2 -LRB104 03459 MST 13482 r1Framework for Teaching for use as a training tool for all 2teacher evaluators; and 3    WHEREAS, Teacher diversity has been linked to improved 4student outcomes, including increased academic achievement, 5higher rates of gifted assignment, and lower rates of 6exclusionary discipline; to recognize these benefits, there 7has been a growing research and policy focus on recruiting and 8hiring teachers of color; however, studies have shown that 9teachers of color have high turnover rates, so retention of 10teachers of color has also become an important part of the 11conversation; and 12    WHEREAS, Research from Blazar (2024) finds that Black 13teachers:14        (1) Have statistically significant positive impacts on 15    Black students' self-efficacy;16        (2) Enhance students', particularly Black students', 17    engagement in classes;18        (3) Improve student attendance, reducing absences by 19    47% for Black students and 22% for non-Black students;20        (4) Improve math test scores of both Black and 21    non-Black students; and22        (5) Produce long-term benefits in English language 23    arts test scores, particularly for Black students; and   SJ0019- 3 -LRB104 03459 MST 13482 r1    WHEREAS, The Illinois State Board of Education began 2reporting the three-year teacher retention rate disaggregated 3by race/ethnicity for the first time in 2021; the data showed 4that Illinois schools retain Black teachers at the lowest rate 5of all teacher groups, 80.6 percent, compared to an 87.6 6percent rate for White teachers; and 7    WHEREAS, After a year-long study, the Illinois State Board 8of Education released the Teacher Evaluation Research Project 9(2024), a research report that found the State's current 10evaluation requirements result in the following:11        (1) A heavy workload, and at times, a burden on both 12    teachers and evaluators, which minimizes opportunities to 13    prioritize actionable feedback and professional growth for 14    all educators;15        (2) Concerns about the presence of bias in 16    evaluations, particularly regarding student growth 17    measures; and18        (3) Disparities in rating distributions by educators' 19    race and school district characteristics, with serious and 20    significant negative impacts on Black and Latinx 21    educators; and 22    WHEREAS, Since 2011, when Illinois recommended the 23Danielson Framework for Teaching as an evaluation tool, there 24have been lingering questions about potential biases built   SJ0019- 4 -LRB104 03459 MST 13482 r1into Danielson Framework for Teaching itself, which could be 2contributing to the disparities in rating outcomes that we are 3seeing in Illinois and go beyond potential individual 4evaluator bias, and whether or not the tool is fair to Black 5and Brown educators in their work with all types of students, 6including students with disabilities, multilingual learners, 7and early learners; further, there has yet to be a clear body 8of evidence to demonstrate that the Danielson Framework for 9Teaching is a robust instrument, which would foster the 10equity-based teaching practices and reflective conversations 11that are envisioned in the Illinois Culturally Responsive 12Teaching and Leading Standards; therefore, be it 13    RESOLVED, BY THE SENATE OF THE ONE HUNDRED FOURTH GENERAL 14ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, THE HOUSE OF 15REPRESENTATIVES CONCURRING HEREIN, that we urge the Illinois 16State Board of Education to initiate and complete a research 17study to examine the application and use of the Danielson 18Framework for Teaching, including ways to confront ideological 19barriers to socially just teacher performance evaluation; and 20be it further 21    RESOLVED, That the Illinois State Board of Education is 22urged to deliver this report to the legislature by June 30, 232026; and be it further   SJ0019- 5 -LRB104 03459 MST 13482 r1    RESOLVED, That a suitable copy of this resolution be 2delivered to the Illinois State Board of Education.
