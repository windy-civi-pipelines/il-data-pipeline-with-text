Findings and purpose. 25    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares the following:  SB1512- 5 -LRB104 09816 BAB 19883 b1        (1) The lack of a dedicated financial services 2    regulator with broad authority over providers of financial 3    products and services has left the people of Illinois 4    vulnerable to abuse and forced Illinois businesses to 5    compete with unscrupulous providers. The victimization of 6    Illinois consumers, including those who lack a safety net 7    of personal or household financial resources, not only 8    harms individuals but also has broader social and economic 9    costs to the State, including increased caseloads for 10    social safety net programs. These problems become even 11    more acute in times of crisis, including disasters, 12    financial crises, and economic recessions. Therefore, the 13    General Assembly should enact statutory measures to 14    protect the people of Illinois from abuses in the 15    marketplace for financial products and services.16        (2) Technological innovation offers great promise for 17    the more effective and efficient provision of financial 18    products and services to the people of Illinois but also 19    poses new risks to consumers and challenges to financial 20    services regulators and law enforcement in addressing 21    those risks. These challenges include, but are not limited 22    to, preventing regulatory arbitrage, maintaining effective 23    oversight of new providers of financial products and 24    services, promoting the stability of Illinois financial 25    institutions and the financial system, protecting the 26    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of   SB1512- 6 -LRB104 09816 BAB 19883 b1    information systems and consumer information stored on 2    those information systems, and guarding against fraud, 3    money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial 4    crimes.5        (3) Robust financial protections enable wealth 6    building and promote a vibrant economy. They are 7    especially important among various populations, including, 8    but not limited to, low-income and moderate-income 9    households, historically marginalized communities, 10    military service members, seniors, students, and new 11    residents of this State. Unfair, deceptive, or abusive 12    practices in the provision of financial products and 13    services undermine the public confidence that is essential 14    to the continued functioning of the financial system, 15    sound extensions of credit to consumers, and the 16    protection of consumers.17        (4) It is the intent of the General Assembly to enact 18    this Act to strengthen financial protections by expanding 19    the ability of the Department of Financial and 20    Professional Regulation to improve accountability and 21    transparency in the Illinois financial system, provide 22    financial education, and protect Illinois persons from 23    abusive financial practices, while prioritizing the 24    prevention of unethical businesses from harming the most 25    vulnerable populations, including low-income and 26    moderate-income households, historically marginalized   SB1512- 7 -LRB104 09816 BAB 19883 b1    communities, military service members, seniors, students, 2    and new residents of this State.3    (b) Among the purposes of this Act shall be the promotion 4of general welfare, fair competition, and wealth creation in 5this State, including by doing the following:6        (1) Promoting nondiscriminatory access to responsible, 7    affordable credit on terms that reasonably reflect 8    consumers' ability to repay.9        (2) Promoting nondiscriminatory access to financial 10    products and services that are understandable and not 11    unfair, deceptive, or abusive.12        (3) Protecting Illinois persons from discrimination 13    and unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices in 14    connection with financial practices and services.15        (4) Promoting nondiscriminatory protective innovation 16    in financial products and services. 17    Section 1-15.

Findings and purpose. 25    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares the following:  SB1512- 5 -LRB104 09816 BAB 19883 b1        (1) The lack of a dedicated financial services 2    regulator with broad authority over providers of financial 3    products and services has left the people of Illinois 4    vulnerable to abuse and forced Illinois businesses to 5    compete with unscrupulous providers. The victimization of 6    Illinois consumers, including those who lack a safety net 7    of personal or household financial resources, not only 8    harms individuals but also has broader social and economic 9    costs to the State, including increased caseloads for 10    social safety net programs. These problems become even 11    more acute in times of crisis, including disasters, 12    financial crises, and economic recessions. Therefore, the 13    General Assembly should enact statutory measures to 14    protect the people of Illinois from abuses in the 15    marketplace for financial products and services.16        (2) Technological innovation offers great promise for 17    the more effective and efficient provision of financial 18    products and services to the people of Illinois but also 19    poses new risks to consumers and challenges to financial 20    services regulators and law enforcement in addressing 21    those risks. These challenges include, but are not limited 22    to, preventing regulatory arbitrage, maintaining effective 23    oversight of new providers of financial products and 24    services, promoting the stability of Illinois financial 25    institutions and the financial system, protecting the 26    confidentiality, integrity, and availability of   SB1512- 6 -LRB104 09816 BAB 19883 b1    information systems and consumer information stored on 2    those information systems, and guarding against fraud, 3    money laundering, terrorist financing, and other financial 4    crimes.5        (3) Robust financial protections enable wealth 6    building and promote a vibrant economy. They are 7    especially important among various populations, including, 8    but not limited to, low-income and moderate-income 9    households, historically marginalized communities, 10    military service members, seniors, students, and new 11    residents of this State.
