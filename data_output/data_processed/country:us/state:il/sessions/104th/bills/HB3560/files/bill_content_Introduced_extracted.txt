Kevin John Olickal SYNOPSIS AS INTRODUCED: New Act    Creates the Public Banking Option Act. Establishes the Illinois Bank Account Board under the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation for the purpose of protecting consumers who lack access to traditional banking services from predatory, discriminatory, and costly alternatives. Sets forth provisions concerning the actions required by the Board to create the Illinois Bank Account Program, including establishing a process by which an individual may open an Illinois Bank Account, which shall be designed to maximize Program participation; the mechanisms by which an account holder may deposit funds into an Illinois Bank Account for no fee; a process through which an account holder may elect to have a portion, up to the entirety, of the account holder's paycheck or earnings due for labor or services performed directly deposited by electronic fund transfer into the account holder's Illinois Bank Account; a process through which employers and hiring entities shall be required to remit through a payroll direct deposit arrangement each worker's elected payroll contribution to the worker's Illinois Bank Account in accordance with the worker's election; and mechanisms by which an account holder can withdraw funds from an Illinois Bank Account using an Illinois Bank Account debit card for no fee; a process, available to all account holders for no fee, through which an account holder may arrange for payment to a registered payee using a preauthorized electronic fund transfer from an Illinois Bank Account; a process and terms and conditions for becoming a registered payee; voluntary automatic disbursement rules to assist an account holder in managing automated payments to registered payees based on the availability of funds in the account holder's account; and other specified actions. Establishes duties concerning the Program for employers with more than 25 employees, hiring entities with more than 25 independent contractors performing the same or similar labor or service, and landlords or a landlord's agent. Grants the Department rulemaking authority to implement the provisions of the Act. Effective immediately.LRB104 10432 BAB 20507 b  A BILL FOR HB3560LRB104 10432 BAB 20507 b1    AN ACT concerning regulation. 2    Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois, 3represented in the General Assembly: 4    Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the Public 5Banking Option Act. 6    Section 2. Findings. The General Assembly finds that: 7        (1) Due to high unemployment rates, homelessness 8    rising, and an unprecedented wave of evictions looming as 9    a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial stability 10    of the State's most vulnerable residents has become a 11    matter of particularly urgent concern, not only to those 12    individuals, themselves, but to the economic health of the 13    State as a whole. 14        (2) Access to basic financial services, including 15    demand deposit (checking) and savings accounts, is a 16    critical component of financial stability. 1/5 of Illinois 17    households are unbanked or underbanked. Underbanked 18    households are defined as those that have a bank account 19    but have used alternative financial services (AFS) for 20    transactions, including check cashing and money orders, 21    and for credit, including payday loans. Among underbanked 22    households, AFS transaction use is 3 times more prevalent 23    than the use of AFS for credit. Around 17% of United States   HB3560- 2 -LRB104 10432 BAB 20507 b1    households use AFS transactions. These transaction 2    services can be a significant expense for low-income 3    Illinoisans. For example, check cashers charge as much as 4    10% of the cost of the check being cashed. In 2018, AFS 5    costs for unbanked and underbanked Americans totaled 6    $189,000,000,000 in fees and interest, which means the 7    average annual cost per person for using AFS was $3,000. 8        (3) Predatory banking practices, including expensive 9    overdraft fees, create a vicious cycle leading to the 10    lasting exclusion of Illinois residents from traditional 11    and affordable financial services and disproportionately 12    harm low-income people and people of color. Banking 13    options that target the poor generate significant revenue 14    through these exploitative practices. In 2019, 84% of 15    those fees were paid by 9% of account holders, and those 16    customers typically carried low balances averaging less 17    than $350. 18        (4) Unbanked households pay proportionally more for 19    their financial services, lack secure means of saving, 20    have fewer opportunities to build credit, and are rejected 21    for loans at far higher rates. Basic financial 22    transactions, including the payment of rent, utilities, 23    and other recurring bills or charitable contributions, are 24    a particularly formidable challenge for households lacking 25    access to important tools, including automated bill pay, 26    or whose monthly income fluctuates too much to make   HB3560- 3 -LRB104 10432 BAB 20507 b1    automated processes viable. Because they have fewer 2    options when their money runs short, unbanked households 3    face a far more destructive cycle of punitive action when 4    they default on their recurring bills, which leads to 5    compounding interest and further debt. For all these 6    reasons, exclusion from traditional financial services 7    significantly increases the risk of poverty and 8    homelessness and places an unnecessary burden on the 9    entire economy. 10        (5) Limited access to affordable financial services is 11    a problem that disproportionately impacts low-income 12    communities and communities of color. The racial disparity 13    in banking access in Illinois is stark. The most recent 14    5-year estimate from 2017 through 2021 shows 2.4% of white 15    households were unbanked, whereas 20.4% of black 16    households were unbanked. Hispanic households face similar 17    disparities, with 10.9% of Hispanic households unbanked. 18    Despite improvements as Illinosians recover from the 19    pandemic, the racial gap remains pronounced, with black 20    households having a significantly higher unbanked rate 21    than their white counterparts. In Chicago, where the 22    disparities are amplified, the number of unbanked white 23    households held evenly with the rate across the State at 24    2.5% while black households maintained a persistently high 25    23.7% unbanked rate. 26        (6) Providing Illinois residents with a zero-fee,   HB3560- 4 -LRB104 10432 BAB 20507 b1    zero-penalty, zero-minimum-balance requirement public 2    option for basic financial services would empower 3    Illinoisans by providing a stable, affordable financial 4    platform for all Illinois residents, especially the 5    unbanked and underbanked who currently rely on expensive 6    AFS transactions. The Illinois Bank Account Program would 7    mitigate the demand for exploitative alternatives to 8    banking services with respect to which upselling and 9    cross-selling into expensive accounts and products is the 10    norm. A market analysis of the proposed Illinois Bank 11    Account Program and any modifications that may be 12    necessary for its successful and cost-effective 13    implementation will enhance the State's ability to serve 14    the financial services needs of unbanked and underbanked 15    Illinois residents. 16    Section 5.
