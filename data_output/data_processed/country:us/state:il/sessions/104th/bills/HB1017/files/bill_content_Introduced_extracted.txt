Aggregation of electrical load by 8municipalities, townships, and counties.9    (a) The corporate authorities of a municipality, township 10board, or county board of a county may adopt an ordinance under 11which it may aggregate in accordance with this Section 12residential and small commercial retail electrical loads 13located, respectively, within the municipality, the township, 14or the unincorporated areas of the county and, for that 15purpose, may solicit bids and enter into service agreements to 16facilitate for those loads the sale and purchase of 17electricity and related services and equipment.18    The corporate authorities, township board, or county board 19may also exercise such authority jointly with any other 20municipality, township, or county. Two or more municipalities, 21townships, or counties, or a combination of both, may initiate 22a process jointly to authorize aggregation by a majority vote 23of each particular municipality, township, or county as   HB1017- 2 -LRB104 03421 AAS 13443 b1required by this Section. 2    If the corporate authorities, township board, or the 3county board seek to operate the aggregation program as an 4opt-out program for residential and small commercial retail 5customers, then prior to the adoption of an ordinance with 6respect to aggregation of residential and small commercial 7retail electric loads, the corporate authorities of a 8municipality, the township board, or the county board of a 9county shall submit a referendum to its residents to determine 10whether or not the aggregation program shall operate as an 11opt-out program for residential and small commercial retail 12customers. Any county board that seeks to submit such a 13referendum to its residents shall do so only in unincorporated 14areas of the county where no electric aggregation ordinance 15has been adopted.16    In addition to the notice and conduct requirements of the 17general election law, notice of the referendum shall state 18briefly the purpose of the referendum. The question of whether 19the corporate authorities, the township board, or the county 20board shall adopt an opt-out aggregation program for 21residential and small commercial retail customers shall be 22submitted to the electors of the municipality, township board, 23or county board at a regular election and approved by a 24majority of the electors voting on the question. The corporate 25authorities, township board, or county board must certify to 26the proper election authority, which must submit the question   HB1017- 3 -LRB104 03421 AAS 13443 b1at an election in accordance with the Election Code.2    The election authority must submit the question in 3substantially the following form:4        Shall the (municipality, township, or county in which 5    the question is being voted upon) have the authority to 6    arrange for the supply of electricity for its residential 7    and small commercial retail customers who have not opted 8    out of such program?9The election authority must record the votes as "Yes" or "No".10    If a majority of the electors voting on the question vote 11in the affirmative, then the corporate authorities, township 12board, or county board may implement an opt-out aggregation 13program for residential and small commercial retail customers.14    A referendum must pass in each particular municipality, 15township, or county that is engaged in the aggregation 16program.

Nothing in this 24Section, however, authorizes the aggregation of electric loads 25that are served or authorized to be served by an electric 26cooperative as defined by and pursuant to the Electric   HB1017- 4 -LRB104 03421 AAS 13443 b1Supplier Act or loads served by a municipality that owns and 2operates its own electric distribution system. No aggregation 3shall take effect unless approved by a majority of the members 4of the corporate authority, township board, or county board 5voting upon the ordinance.6    A governmental aggregator under this Section is not a 7public utility or an alternative retail electric supplier.8    For purposes of this Section, "township" means the portion 9of a township that is an unincorporated portion of a county 10that is not otherwise a part of a municipality. In addition to 11such other limitations as are included in this Section, a 12township board shall only have authority to aggregate 13residential and small commercial customer loads in accordance 14with this Section if the county board of the county in which 15the township is located (i) is not also submitting a 16referendum to its residents at the same general election that 17the township board proposes to submit a referendum under this 18subsection (a), (ii) has not received authorization through 19passage of a referendum to operate an opt-out aggregation 20program for residential and small commercial retail customers 21under this subsection (a), and (iii) has not otherwise enacted 22an ordinance under this subsection (a) authorizing the 23operation of an opt-in aggregation program for residential and 24small commercial retail customers as described in this 25Section. 26    (b) Upon the applicable requisite authority under this   HB1017- 5 -LRB104 03421 AAS 13443 b1Section, the corporate authorities, the township board, or the 2county board, with assistance from the Illinois Power Agency, 3shall develop a plan of operation and governance for the 4aggregation program so authorized.

The bid specifications may include a 3    provision requiring the bidder to disclose the fuel type 4    of electricity to be procured or generated on behalf of 5    the aggregation program customers. The corporate 6    authorities, township board, or county board may consider 7    the proposed source of electricity to be procured or 8    generated to be put into the grid on behalf of aggregation 9    program customers in the competitive bidding process. The 10    Agency and Commission may collaborate to issue joint 11    guidance on voluntary uniform standards for bidder 12    disclosures of the source of electricity to be procured or 13    generated to be put into the grid on behalf of aggregation 14    program customers. 15        (1.5) A township board shall request from the electric 16    utility those residential and small commercial customers 17    within their aggregate area either by zip code or zip 18    codes or other means as determined by the electric 19    utility. The electric utility shall then provide to the 20    township board the residential and small commercial 21    customers, including the names and addresses of 22    residential and small commercial customers, 23    electronically. The township board shall be responsible 24    for authenticating the residential and small commercial 25    customers contained in this listing and providing edits of 26    the data to affirm, add, or delete the residential and   HB1017- 7 -LRB104 03421 AAS 13443 b1    small commercial customers located within its 2    jurisdiction.
