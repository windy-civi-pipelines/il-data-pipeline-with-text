Inquiry into an expert's qualifications at the 24pre-test hearing shall not affect either party's right to have 25the expert qualified at trial.   HB2683- 19 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    (b) Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably relied 2upon by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed 3in a testing laboratory accredited by the American Association 4of Blood Banks or a successor to its functions. 5    (c) A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of one 6or more samples, or a combination of samples, of blood, buccal 7cells, bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid. 8    (d) The testing laboratory shall determine the databases 9from which to select frequencies for use in calculation of the 10probability of parentage paternity based on the ethnic or 11racial group of an individual or individuals. If there is 12disagreement as to the testing laboratory's choice, the 13following rules apply: 14        (1) The individual objecting may require the testing 15    laboratory, within 30 days after receipt of the report of 16    the genetic testing, to recalculate the probability of 17    parentage paternity using an ethnic or racial group 18    different from that used by the laboratory. 19        (2) The individual objecting to the testing 20    laboratory's initial choice shall: 21            (A) if the frequencies are not available to the 22        testing laboratory for the ethnic or racial group 23        requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled 24        in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or 25            (B) engage another testing laboratory to perform 26        the calculations.   HB2683- 20 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    (e) If, after recalculation using a different ethnic or 2racial group, genetic testing does not reputably identify a 3person man as the parent father of a child, an individual who 4has been tested may be required to submit to additional 5genetic testing. 6(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 7    (750 ILCS 46/403)8    Sec. 403. Genetic test results. 9    (a) The expert shall prepare a written report of the 10genetic test results. If the genetic test results show that 11the alleged parent father is not excluded, the report shall 12contain statistics based upon the statistical formula of 13combined parentage paternity index (CPI) and the probability 14of parentage paternity as determined by the probability of 15exclusion (Random Person Man Not Excluded = RPNE RMNE). The 16expert may be called by the court as a witness to testify to 17the expert's his or her findings and, if called, shall be 18subject to cross-examination by the parties. If the genetic 19test results show that the alleged parent father is not 20excluded, any party may demand that other experts, qualified 21as examiners of blood or tissue types, perform independent 22genetic testing under order of court, including, but not 23limited to, blood types or other testing of genetic markers. 24The results of the genetic testing may be offered into 25evidence. The number and qualifications of the experts shall   HB2683- 21 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1be determined by the court. 2    (b) Documentation of the chain of custody of the blood or 3tissue samples, accompanied by an affidavit or certification 4in accordance with Section 1-109 of the Code of Civil 5Procedure, is competent evidence to establish the chain of 6custody. 7    (c) The report of the genetic test results prepared by the 8appointed expert shall be made by affidavit or by 9certification as provided in Section 1-109 of the Code of 10Civil Procedure and shall be mailed to all parties. A proof of 11service shall be filed with the court. The verified report 12shall be admitted into evidence at trial without foundation 13testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy, unless a 14written motion challenging the admissibility of the report is 15filed by either party within 28 days of receipt of the report, 16in which case expert testimony shall be required. A party may 17not file such a motion challenging the admissibility of the 18report later than 28 days before commencement of trial. Before 19trial, the court shall determine whether the motion is 20sufficient to deny admission of the report by verification. 21Failure to make that timely motion constitutes a waiver of the 22right to object to admission by verification and shall not be 23grounds for a continuance of the hearing to establish 24parentage paternity. 25(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.)   HB2683- 22 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    (750 ILCS 46/404)2    Sec. 404. Effect of genetic testing. Genetic testing taken 3under this Article shall have the following effect:4        (a) If the court finds that the conclusion of the 5    expert or experts, as disclosed by the evidence based upon 6    the genetic testing, is that the alleged parent father is 7    not the parent of the child, the question of parentage 8    paternity shall be resolved accordingly. 9        (b) If the experts disagree in their findings or 10    conclusions, the question shall be weighed with other 11    competent evidence of parentage paternity. 12        (c) If the genetic testing results indicate that the 13    alleged parent father is not excluded and that the 14    combined parentage paternity index is at least 1,000 to 1, 15    and there is at least a 99.9% probability of parentage 16    paternity, the alleged parent father is presumed to be the 17    parent father, and this evidence shall be admitted. 18        (d) A person man identified under subsection (c) of 19    this Section as the parent father of the child may rebut 20    the genetic testing results by other genetic testing 21    satisfying the requirements of this Article which: 22            (1) excludes the person man as a genetic parent 23        father of the child; or 24            (2) identifies another person man as the possible 25        parent father of the child. 26        (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, if   HB2683- 23 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    more than one person man is identified by genetic testing 2    as the possible parent father of the child, the court 3    shall order them to submit to further genetic testing to 4    identify the genetic parent father. 5(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 6    (750 ILCS 46/405)7    Sec. 405. Cost of genetic testing. The expense of the 8genetic testing shall be paid by the party who requests the 9genetic testing, except that the court may apportion the costs 10between the parties, upon request. When the genetic testing is 11requested by the party seeking to establish parentage 12paternity and that party is found to be indigent by the court, 13the expense shall be paid by the public agency providing 14representation; except that where a public agency is not 15providing representation, the expense shall be paid by the 16county in which the action is brought. When the genetic 17testing is ordered by the court on its own motion or is 18requested by the alleged or presumed parent father and that 19parent father is found to be indigent by the court, the expense 20shall be paid by the county in which the action is brought. Any 21part of the expense may be taxed as costs in the action, except 22that no costs may be taxed against a public agency that has not 23requested the genetic testing.24(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.)   HB2683- 24 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    (750 ILCS 46/407)2    Sec. 407. Independent genetic testing. Nothing in this 3Article shall prevent a party from obtaining genetic testing 4of the party's his or her own blood or tissue independent of 5those ordered by the court or from presenting expert testimony 6interpreting those tests or any other blood tests ordered 7under this Article. Reports of all the independent tests, 8accompanied by affidavit or certification pursuant to Section 91-109 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and notice of any expert 10witnesses to be called to testify to the results of those tests 11shall be submitted to all parties at least 30 days before any 12hearing set to determine the issue of parentage.13(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 14    (750 ILCS 46/408)15    Sec. 408. Additional persons to be tested. 16    (a) Subject to subsection (b), if a genetic-testing 17specimen is not available from a person man who may be the 18parent father of a child, for good cause and under 19circumstances the court considers to be just, the court may 20order the following individuals to submit specimens for 21genetic testing: 22        (1) the parents of the person man; 23        (2) brothers and sisters of the person man; 24        (3) other children of the person and the parent who 25    gave birth to the person man and their mothers; and  HB2683- 25 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1        (4) other relatives of the person man necessary to 2    complete genetic testing. 3    (b) Issuance of an order under this Section requires a 4finding that a need for genetic testing outweighs the 5legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested, 6and in no event shall an order be issued until the individual 7is joined as a party and given notice as required under the 8Code of Civil Procedure. 9(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 10    (750 ILCS 46/501)11    Sec. 501. Temporary orders. 12    (a) On a motion by a party and a showing of clear and 13convincing evidence of parentage, the court shall issue a 14temporary order for support of a child, including a non-minor 15child with a disability, if the order is appropriate and the 16individual ordered to pay support is: 17        (1) a presumed parent of the child; 18        (2) petitioning to have parentage adjudicated; 19        (3) identified as the parent father through genetic 20    testing under Article 4 of this Act; 21        (4) an alleged parent father who has declined to 22    submit to genetic testing; 23        (5) shown by clear and convincing evidence to be the 24    child's parent father; 25        (6) the parent who gave birth to mother of the child   HB2683- 26 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    except under the Gestational Surrogacy Act; or 2        (7) anyone else determined to be the child's parent. 3    In determining the amount of a temporary child support 4award, the court shall use the guidelines and standards set 5forth in Sections 505, 505.2, and 513.5 of the Illinois 6Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. 7    (b) A temporary order may include provisions for the 8allocation of parental responsibilities and parenting time as 9provided by the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage 10Act.

Factors in adjudicating parentage Authority to 11deny motion for genetic testing. 12    (a) Consistent with Sections 205, 309, 608, and 609, in 13cases in which there are competing claims to parentage and in 14proceedings In a proceeding in which the parentage of a child 15having a presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parent is at 16issue, the court shall consider the following factors when 17adjudicating the individual's parentage may deny a motion by a 18parent, presumed parent, acknowledged parent, adjudicated 19parent, alleged parent, or the child seeking an order for 20genetic testing of the parents and child if the court 21determines that: 22        (1) whether the conduct of the parent, acknowledged 23    parent, adjudicated parent, or the presumed parent estops 24    that party from denying parentage;25        (2) whether it would be inequitable to disprove the   HB2683- 39 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    parent-child relationship between the child and the 2    presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parent; and3        (3) it is in the child's best interests to adjudicate 4    the individual to be the child's parent, to deny genetic 5    testing, taking into account the following factors:6            (A) the length of time between the current 7        proceeding to adjudicate parentage and the time that 8        the presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parent was 9        placed on notice that this parent he or she might not 10        be the biological parent; 11            (B) the length of time during which the presumed, 12        acknowledged, or adjudicated parent has assumed the 13        role of parent of the child; 14            (C) the facts surrounding the presumed, 15        acknowledged, or adjudicated parent's discovery of his 16        or her possible non-parentage nonparentage; 17            (D) the nature of the relationship between the 18        child and the presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated 19        parent; 20            (E) the age of the child; 21            (F) the harm that may result to the child if the 22        presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parentage is 23        successfully disproved; 24            (G) the nature of the relationship between the 25        child and any alleged parent; 26            (H) the extent to which the passage of time   HB2683- 40 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1        reduces the chances of establishing the parentage of 2        another person and a child support obligation in favor 3        of the child;4            (I) other factors that may affect the equities 5        arising from the disruption of the parent-child 6        relationship between the child and the presumed, 7        acknowledged, or adjudicated parent or the chance of 8        other harm to the child; and 9            (J) any other factors the court determines to be 10        equitable.11        (b) Consistent with the establishment of parentage 12    under this Act, a court may determine that a child has more 13    than 2 parents if the court finds that it is in the best 14    interests of the child to do so. A finding of best 15    interests of the child under this subsection does not 16    require a finding of unfitness of any parent or person 17    seeking an adjudication of parentage. A determination of 18    best interests may include consideration of evidence of 19    prebirth intent to parent the child. 20    (c) (b) In a proceeding involving the application of this 21Section, a minor or incapacitated child must be represented by 22a guardian ad litem, child's representative, or attorney for 23the child. It shall be presumed to be equitable and in the best 24interests of the child to grant a motion by the child seeking 25an order for genetic testing. The presumption may be overcome 26by clear and convincing evidence that extraordinary   HB2683- 41 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1circumstances exist making the genetic testing contrary to the 2child's best interests. The court's order denying a child's 3request for genetic testing must state the basis for the 4denial upon which the presumption was overcome. The court's 5order granting a child's request for genetic testing must 6specify the ways in which the testing results may be used for 7purposes of protecting the child's best interests.8    (d) (Blank). (c) If the court denies a motion seeking an 9order for genetic testing, it shall issue an order 10adjudicating the presumed parent to be the parent of the 11child. 12(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 13    (750 ILCS 46/612)14    Sec. 612.

Presumption of parentage. 19    (a) A person is presumed to be the parent of a child if: 20        (1) the person and the person who gave birth to mother 21    of the child have entered into a marriage, civil union, or 22    substantially similar legal relationship, and the child is 23    born, to the person who gave birth to the child, mother 24    during the marriage, civil union, or substantially similar 25    legal relationship, except as provided in the Gestational   HB2683- 10 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    Surrogacy Act or other law;2        (2) the person and the person who gave birth to mother 3    of the child were in a marriage, civil union, or 4    substantially similar legal relationship and the child is 5    born, to the person who gave birth to the child, mother 6    within 300 days after the marriage, civil union, or 7    substantially similar legal relationship is terminated by 8    death, declaration of invalidity of marriage, judgment for 9    dissolution of marriage, civil union, or substantially 10    similar legal relationship, or after a judgment for legal 11    separation, except as provided in the Gestational 12    Surrogacy Act or other law; 13        (3) before the birth of the child, the person and the 14    person who gave birth to mother of the child entered into a 15    marriage, civil union, or substantially similar legal 16    relationship in apparent compliance with law, even if the 17    attempted marriage, civil union, or substantially similar 18    legal relationship is or could be declared invalid, and 19    the child is born during the invalid marriage, civil 20    union, or substantially similar legal relationship or 21    within 300 days after its termination by death, 22    declaration of invalidity of marriage, judgment for 23    dissolution of marriage, civil union, or substantially 24    similar legal relationship, or after a judgment for legal 25    separation, except as provided in the Gestational 26    Surrogacy Act or other law; or  HB2683- 11 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1        (4) after the child's birth, the person and the person 2    who gave birth to the child child's mother have entered 3    into a marriage, civil union, or substantially similar 4    legal relationship, even if the marriage, civil union, or 5    substantially similar legal relationship is or could be 6    declared invalid, and the person is named, with the 7    person's written consent, as the child's parent on the 8    child's birth certificate.9        (5) The person, jointly with another parent, resided 10    in the same household with the child and openly held out 11    the child as the person's own child from the time the child 12    was born or adopted and for a period of at least 2 years 13    thereafter, including any period of temporary absence. 14    (b) If 2 or more conflicting presumptions arise under this 15Section, the presumption which on the facts is founded on the 16weightier considerations of policy and logic, especially the 17policy of promoting the child's best interests, controls.18(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 19    (750 ILCS 46/205)20    Sec. 205. Proceedings to declare the non-existence of the 21parent-child relationship. 22    (a) An action to declare the non-existence of the 23parent-child relationship may be brought by the child, the 24person who gave birth to the child mother, or a person presumed 25to be a parent under Section 204 of this Act. Actions brought   HB2683- 12 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1by the child, the person who gave birth to the child mother, or 2a presumed parent shall be brought by verified complaint, 3which shall be designated a petition. After a presumption 4under Section 204 of this Act has been rebutted, parentage of 5the child by another person man or woman may be established in 6the same action, if such person he or she has been made a 7party.8    (b) An action to declare the non-existence of the 9parent-child relationship brought under subsection (a) of this 10Section shall be barred if brought later than 2 years after the 11petitioner knew or should have known of the relevant facts. 12The 2-year period for bringing an action to declare the 13non-existence of the parent-child relationship shall not 14extend beyond the date on which the child reaches the age of 18 15years. Failure to bring an action within 2 years shall not bar 16any party from asserting a defense in any action to declare the 17existence of the parent-child relationship.18    (c) An action to declare the non-existence of the 19parent-child relationship may be brought subsequent to an 20adjudication of parentage in any judgment by the person man 21adjudicated to be the parent pursuant to a presumption in 22paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of Section 204 if, as a 23result of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing, it is 24discovered that the person man adjudicated to be the parent is 25not the parent father of the child. Actions brought by the 26adjudicated parent father shall be brought by verified   HB2683- 13 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1petition. If, as a result of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 2testing that is admissible under Section 614 of this Act, the 3petitioner is determined not to be the parent father of the 4child, the adjudication of parentage paternity and any orders 5regarding the allocation of parental responsibilities, 6parenting time, and future payments of support may be vacated. 7This provision shall not apply to actions involving parentage 8of children born through assisted reproduction. 9    (d) An action to declare the non-existence of the 10parent-child relationship brought under subsection (c) of this 11Section shall be barred if brought more than 2 years after the 12petitioner obtains actual knowledge of relevant facts. The 132-year period shall not apply to periods of time where the 14person who gave birth to the child mother or the child refuses 15to submit to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing. The 2-year 16period for bringing an action to declare the non-existence of 17the parent-child relationship shall not extend beyond the date 18on which the child reaches the age of 18 years. 19(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 20    (750 ILCS 46/206)21    Sec. 206. Presumption; burden of proof. A person 22challenging a presumption under Section 204 of this Act may 23rebut the presumption with a preponderance of the clear and 24convincing evidence.25(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.)   HB2683- 14 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    (750 ILCS 46/301)2    Sec. 301. Voluntary acknowledgment. A parent-child 3relationship may be established voluntarily by the signing and 4witnessing of a voluntary acknowledgment in accordance with 5Section 12 of the Vital Records Act and Section 10-17.7 of the 6Illinois Public Aid Code. A person who gave birth to a child 7and an alleged genetic parent of the child, a presumed parent 8under Section 204, or an intended parent under Article 7, may 9sign an acknowledgment of parentage to establish the parentage 10of the child. The voluntary acknowledgment shall contain the 11social security numbers or tax identification numbers of the 12persons signing the voluntary acknowledgment; however, failure 13to include the social security numbers of the persons signing 14a voluntary acknowledgment does not invalidate the voluntary 15acknowledgment.16(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 17    (750 ILCS 46/302)18    Sec. 302. Execution of voluntary acknowledgment. 19    (a) A voluntary acknowledgment described in Section 301 of 20this Act must: 21        (1) be in a record; 22        (2) be signed, or otherwise authenticated, under 23    penalty of perjury by the person who gave birth to the 24    child mother and by the person man seeking to establish   HB2683- 15 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    his parentage; 2        (3) state that the child whose parentage is being 3    acknowledged: 4            (A) does not have a presumed parent, or has a 5        presumed parent whose full name is stated; and 6            (B) does not have another acknowledged or 7        adjudicated parent; 8        (4) be witnessed; and 9        (5) state that the signatories understand that the 10    voluntary acknowledgment is the equivalent of a judicial 11    adjudication of parentage of the child and that: (i) a 12    challenge by a signatory to the voluntary acknowledgment 13    may be permitted only upon a showing of fraud, duress, or 14    material mistake of fact; and (ii) a challenge to the 15    voluntary acknowledgment is barred after 2 years unless 16    that period is tolled pursuant to the law. 17    (b) An acknowledgment is void if it: 18        (1) states that another person is a presumed parent, 19    unless a denial signed or otherwise authenticated by the 20    presumed parent is filed with the Department of Healthcare 21    and Family Services, as provided by law; 22        (2) states that another person is an acknowledged or 23    adjudicated parent; or 24        (3) falsely denies the existence of a presumed, 25    acknowledged, or adjudicated parent of the child. 26    (c) A presumed parent father may sign or otherwise   HB2683- 16 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1authenticate a voluntary acknowledgment. 2(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 3    (750 ILCS 46/303)4    Sec. 303. Denial of parentage. A presumed parent may sign 5a denial of parentage. The denial is valid only if:6        (a) a voluntary acknowledgment described in Section 7    301 of this Act signed, or otherwise authenticated, by a 8    person man is filed pursuant to Section 305 of this Act; 9        (b) the denial is in a record, and is signed, or 10    otherwise authenticated, under penalty of perjury; and 11        (c) the presumed parent has not previously: 12            (1) acknowledged his parentage, unless the 13        previous voluntary acknowledgment has been rescinded 14        under Section 307 of this Act or successfully 15        challenged under Section 308 of this Act; or 16            (2) been adjudicated to be the parent of the 17        child. 18(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 19    (750 ILCS 46/305)20    Sec. 305. Effect of voluntary acknowledgment or denial of 21parentage. 22    (a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 307 and 308 23of this Act, a valid voluntary acknowledgment filed with the 24Department of Healthcare and Family Services, as provided by   HB2683- 17 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1law, is equivalent to an adjudication of the parentage of a 2child and confers upon the acknowledged parent father all of 3the rights and duties of a parent. 4    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, 5parentage established in accordance with Section 301 of this 6Act has the full force and effect of a judgment entered under 7this Act and serves as a basis for seeking a child support 8order without any further proceedings to establish parentage. 9    (c) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 307 and 308 10of this Act, a valid denial by a presumed parent filed with the 11Department of Healthcare and Family Services, as provided by 12law, in conjunction with a voluntary acknowledgment, is 13equivalent to an adjudication of the nonparentage of the 14presumed parent and discharges the presumed parent from all 15rights and duties of a parent. 16(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 17    (750 ILCS 46/401)18    Sec. 401. Proceeding authorized. As soon as practicable, a 19court or an administrative hearing officer in an Expedited 20Child Support System may, and upon the request of a party 21except as provided in Section 610 of this Act, or of the child, 22shall order or direct the parent who gave birth to the child 23mother, the child, and the alleged parent father to submit to 24deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing to determine inherited 25characteristics. If any party refuses to submit to genetic   HB2683- 18 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1testing, the court may resolve the question of parentage 2paternity against that party or enforce its order if the 3rights of others and the interests of justice so require. 4Genetic testing may not be used to: (1) challenge the 5parentage of a person who is a parent under Article 7 or the 6Gestational Surrogacy Act, inclusive; or (2) establish the 7parentage of a person who is a donor. 8(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 9    (750 ILCS 46/402)10    Sec. 402. Requirements for genetic testing. 11    (a) The genetic testing shall be conducted by an expert 12qualified as an examiner of blood or tissue types and 13appointed by the court. The expert shall determine the genetic 14testing procedures. However, any interested party, for good 15cause shown, in advance of the scheduled genetic testing, may 16request a hearing to object to the qualifications of the 17expert or the genetic testing procedures. The expert appointed 18by the court shall testify at the pre-test hearing at the 19expense of the party requesting the hearing, except for an 20indigent party as provided in Section 405 of this Act. An 21expert not appointed by the court shall testify at the 22pre-test hearing at the expense of the party retaining the 23expert. Inquiry into an expert's qualifications at the 24pre-test hearing shall not affect either party's right to have 25the expert qualified at trial.   HB2683- 19 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    (b) Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably relied 2upon by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed 3in a testing laboratory accredited by the American Association 4of Blood Banks or a successor to its functions. 5    (c) A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of one 6or more samples, or a combination of samples, of blood, buccal 7cells, bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid. 8    (d) The testing laboratory shall determine the databases 9from which to select frequencies for use in calculation of the 10probability of parentage paternity based on the ethnic or 11racial group of an individual or individuals. If there is 12disagreement as to the testing laboratory's choice, the 13following rules apply: 14        (1) The individual objecting may require the testing 15    laboratory, within 30 days after receipt of the report of 16    the genetic testing, to recalculate the probability of 17    parentage paternity using an ethnic or racial group 18    different from that used by the laboratory. 19        (2) The individual objecting to the testing 20    laboratory's initial choice shall: 21            (A) if the frequencies are not available to the 22        testing laboratory for the ethnic or racial group 23        requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled 24        in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or 25            (B) engage another testing laboratory to perform 26        the calculations.   HB2683- 20 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    (e) If, after recalculation using a different ethnic or 2racial group, genetic testing does not reputably identify a 3person man as the parent father of a child, an individual who 4has been tested may be required to submit to additional 5genetic testing. 6(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 7    (750 ILCS 46/403)8    Sec. 403. Genetic test results. 9    (a) The expert shall prepare a written report of the 10genetic test results. If the genetic test results show that 11the alleged parent father is not excluded, the report shall 12contain statistics based upon the statistical formula of 13combined parentage paternity index (CPI) and the probability 14of parentage paternity as determined by the probability of 15exclusion (Random Person Man Not Excluded = RPNE RMNE). The 16expert may be called by the court as a witness to testify to 17the expert's his or her findings and, if called, shall be 18subject to cross-examination by the parties. If the genetic 19test results show that the alleged parent father is not 20excluded, any party may demand that other experts, qualified 21as examiners of blood or tissue types, perform independent 22genetic testing under order of court, including, but not 23limited to, blood types or other testing of genetic markers. 24The results of the genetic testing may be offered into 25evidence. The number and qualifications of the experts shall   HB2683- 21 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1be determined by the court. 2    (b) Documentation of the chain of custody of the blood or 3tissue samples, accompanied by an affidavit or certification 4in accordance with Section 1-109 of the Code of Civil 5Procedure, is competent evidence to establish the chain of 6custody. 7    (c) The report of the genetic test results prepared by the 8appointed expert shall be made by affidavit or by 9certification as provided in Section 1-109 of the Code of 10Civil Procedure and shall be mailed to all parties. A proof of 11service shall be filed with the court. The verified report 12shall be admitted into evidence at trial without foundation 13testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy, unless a 14written motion challenging the admissibility of the report is 15filed by either party within 28 days of receipt of the report, 16in which case expert testimony shall be required. A party may 17not file such a motion challenging the admissibility of the 18report later than 28 days before commencement of trial. Before 19trial, the court shall determine whether the motion is 20sufficient to deny admission of the report by verification. 21Failure to make that timely motion constitutes a waiver of the 22right to object to admission by verification and shall not be 23grounds for a continuance of the hearing to establish 24parentage paternity. 25(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.)   HB2683- 22 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    (750 ILCS 46/404)2    Sec. 404. Effect of genetic testing. Genetic testing taken 3under this Article shall have the following effect:4        (a) If the court finds that the conclusion of the 5    expert or experts, as disclosed by the evidence based upon 6    the genetic testing, is that the alleged parent father is 7    not the parent of the child, the question of parentage 8    paternity shall be resolved accordingly. 9        (b) If the experts disagree in their findings or 10    conclusions, the question shall be weighed with other 11    competent evidence of parentage paternity. 12        (c) If the genetic testing results indicate that the 13    alleged parent father is not excluded and that the 14    combined parentage paternity index is at least 1,000 to 1, 15    and there is at least a 99.9% probability of parentage 16    paternity, the alleged parent father is presumed to be the 17    parent father, and this evidence shall be admitted. 18        (d) A person man identified under subsection (c) of 19    this Section as the parent father of the child may rebut 20    the genetic testing results by other genetic testing 21    satisfying the requirements of this Article which: 22            (1) excludes the person man as a genetic parent 23        father of the child; or 24            (2) identifies another person man as the possible 25        parent father of the child. 26        (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, if   HB2683- 23 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    more than one person man is identified by genetic testing 2    as the possible parent father of the child, the court 3    shall order them to submit to further genetic testing to 4    identify the genetic parent father. 5(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 6    (750 ILCS 46/405)7    Sec. 405. Cost of genetic testing. The expense of the 8genetic testing shall be paid by the party who requests the 9genetic testing, except that the court may apportion the costs 10between the parties, upon request. When the genetic testing is 11requested by the party seeking to establish parentage 12paternity and that party is found to be indigent by the court, 13the expense shall be paid by the public agency providing 14representation; except that where a public agency is not 15providing representation, the expense shall be paid by the 16county in which the action is brought. When the genetic 17testing is ordered by the court on its own motion or is 18requested by the alleged or presumed parent father and that 19parent father is found to be indigent by the court, the expense 20shall be paid by the county in which the action is brought. Any 21part of the expense may be taxed as costs in the action, except 22that no costs may be taxed against a public agency that has not 23requested the genetic testing.24(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.)   HB2683- 24 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    (750 ILCS 46/407)2    Sec. 407. Independent genetic testing. Nothing in this 3Article shall prevent a party from obtaining genetic testing 4of the party's his or her own blood or tissue independent of 5those ordered by the court or from presenting expert testimony 6interpreting those tests or any other blood tests ordered 7under this Article. Reports of all the independent tests, 8accompanied by affidavit or certification pursuant to Section 91-109 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and notice of any expert 10witnesses to be called to testify to the results of those tests 11shall be submitted to all parties at least 30 days before any 12hearing set to determine the issue of parentage.13(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 14    (750 ILCS 46/408)15    Sec. 408. Additional persons to be tested. 16    (a) Subject to subsection (b), if a genetic-testing 17specimen is not available from a person man who may be the 18parent father of a child, for good cause and under 19circumstances the court considers to be just, the court may 20order the following individuals to submit specimens for 21genetic testing: 22        (1) the parents of the person man; 23        (2) brothers and sisters of the person man; 24        (3) other children of the person and the parent who 25    gave birth to the person man and their mothers; and  HB2683- 25 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1        (4) other relatives of the person man necessary to 2    complete genetic testing. 3    (b) Issuance of an order under this Section requires a 4finding that a need for genetic testing outweighs the 5legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested, 6and in no event shall an order be issued until the individual 7is joined as a party and given notice as required under the 8Code of Civil Procedure. 9(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 10    (750 ILCS 46/501)11    Sec. 501. Temporary orders. 12    (a) On a motion by a party and a showing of clear and 13convincing evidence of parentage, the court shall issue a 14temporary order for support of a child, including a non-minor 15child with a disability, if the order is appropriate and the 16individual ordered to pay support is: 17        (1) a presumed parent of the child; 18        (2) petitioning to have parentage adjudicated; 19        (3) identified as the parent father through genetic 20    testing under Article 4 of this Act; 21        (4) an alleged parent father who has declined to 22    submit to genetic testing; 23        (5) shown by clear and convincing evidence to be the 24    child's parent father; 25        (6) the parent who gave birth to mother of the child   HB2683- 26 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    except under the Gestational Surrogacy Act; or 2        (7) anyone else determined to be the child's parent. 3    In determining the amount of a temporary child support 4award, the court shall use the guidelines and standards set 5forth in Sections 505, 505.2, and 513.5 of the Illinois 6Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. 7    (b) A temporary order may include provisions for the 8allocation of parental responsibilities and parenting time as 9provided by the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage 10Act. A temporary order may, in accordance with the provisions 11of subsection (a) of Section 508 of the Illinois Marriage and 12Dissolution of Marriage Act that relate to proceedings other 13than pre-judgment dissolution proceedings, include an award 14for interim attorney's fees and costs. 15    (c) Temporary orders issued under this Section shall not 16have prejudicial effect with respect to final child support, 17the allocation of parental responsibilities, or parenting time 18orders. 19(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 20    (750 ILCS 46/502)21    Sec. 502.

Factors in adjudicating parentage Authority to 11deny motion for genetic testing. 12    (a) Consistent with Sections 205, 309, 608, and 609, in 13cases in which there are competing claims to parentage and in 14proceedings In a proceeding in which the parentage of a child 15having a presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parent is at 16issue, the court shall consider the following factors when 17adjudicating the individual's parentage may deny a motion by a 18parent, presumed parent, acknowledged parent, adjudicated 19parent, alleged parent, or the child seeking an order for 20genetic testing of the parents and child if the court 21determines that: 22        (1) whether the conduct of the parent, acknowledged 23    parent, adjudicated parent, or the presumed parent estops 24    that party from denying parentage;25        (2) whether it would be inequitable to disprove the   HB2683- 39 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1    parent-child relationship between the child and the 2    presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parent; and3        (3) it is in the child's best interests to adjudicate 4    the individual to be the child's parent, to deny genetic 5    testing, taking into account the following factors:6            (A) the length of time between the current 7        proceeding to adjudicate parentage and the time that 8        the presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parent was 9        placed on notice that this parent he or she might not 10        be the biological parent; 11            (B) the length of time during which the presumed, 12        acknowledged, or adjudicated parent has assumed the 13        role of parent of the child; 14            (C) the facts surrounding the presumed, 15        acknowledged, or adjudicated parent's discovery of his 16        or her possible non-parentage nonparentage; 17            (D) the nature of the relationship between the 18        child and the presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated 19        parent; 20            (E) the age of the child; 21            (F) the harm that may result to the child if the 22        presumed, acknowledged, or adjudicated parentage is 23        successfully disproved; 24            (G) the nature of the relationship between the 25        child and any alleged parent; 26            (H) the extent to which the passage of time   HB2683- 40 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1        reduces the chances of establishing the parentage of 2        another person and a child support obligation in favor 3        of the child;4            (I) other factors that may affect the equities 5        arising from the disruption of the parent-child 6        relationship between the child and the presumed, 7        acknowledged, or adjudicated parent or the chance of 8        other harm to the child; and 9            (J) any other factors the court determines to be 10        equitable.11        (b) Consistent with the establishment of parentage 12    under this Act, a court may determine that a child has more 13    than 2 parents if the court finds that it is in the best 14    interests of the child to do so. A finding of best 15    interests of the child under this subsection does not 16    require a finding of unfitness of any parent or person 17    seeking an adjudication of parentage. A determination of 18    best interests may include consideration of evidence of 19    prebirth intent to parent the child. 20    (c) (b) In a proceeding involving the application of this 21Section, a minor or incapacitated child must be represented by 22a guardian ad litem, child's representative, or attorney for 23the child. It shall be presumed to be equitable and in the best 24interests of the child to grant a motion by the child seeking 25an order for genetic testing. The presumption may be overcome 26by clear and convincing evidence that extraordinary   HB2683- 41 -LRB104 07510 JRC 17554 b1circumstances exist making the genetic testing contrary to the 2child's best interests. The court's order denying a child's 3request for genetic testing must state the basis for the 4denial upon which the presumption was overcome. The court's 5order granting a child's request for genetic testing must 6specify the ways in which the testing results may be used for 7purposes of protecting the child's best interests.8    (d) (Blank). (c) If the court denies a motion seeking an 9order for genetic testing, it shall issue an order 10adjudicating the presumed parent to be the parent of the 11child. 12(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 13    (750 ILCS 46/612)14    Sec. 612.
