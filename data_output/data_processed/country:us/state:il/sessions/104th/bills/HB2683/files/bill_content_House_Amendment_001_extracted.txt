Actions brought by the 8adjudicated parent father shall be brought by verified 9petition. If, as a result of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 10testing that is admissible under Section 614 of this Act, the 11petitioner is determined not to be the parent father of the 12child, the adjudication of parentage paternity and any orders 13regarding the allocation of parental responsibilities, 14parenting time, and future payments of support may be vacated. 15This provision shall not apply to actions involving parentage 16of children born through assisted reproduction. 17    (d) An action to declare the non-existence of the 18parent-child relationship brought under subsection (c) of this 19Section shall be barred if brought more than 2 years after the 20petitioner obtains actual knowledge of relevant facts.

The expert appointed 19by the court shall testify at the pre-test hearing at the 20expense of the party requesting the hearing, except for an 21indigent party as provided in Section 405 of this Act. An 22expert not appointed by the court shall testify at the 23pre-test hearing at the expense of the party retaining the 24expert. Inquiry into an expert's qualifications at the 25pre-test hearing shall not affect either party's right to have   10400HB2683ham001- 19 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1the expert qualified at trial. 2    (b) Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably relied 3upon by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed 4in a testing laboratory accredited by the American Association 5of Blood Banks or a successor to its functions. 6    (c) A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of one 7or more samples, or a combination of samples, of blood, buccal 8cells, bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid. 9    (d) The testing laboratory shall determine the databases 10from which to select frequencies for use in calculation of the 11probability of parentage paternity based on the ethnic or 12racial group of an individual or individuals. If there is 13disagreement as to the testing laboratory's choice, the 14following rules apply: 15        (1) The individual objecting may require the testing 16    laboratory, within 30 days after receipt of the report of 17    the genetic testing, to recalculate the probability of 18    parentage paternity using an ethnic or racial group 19    different from that used by the laboratory. 20        (2) The individual objecting to the testing 21    laboratory's initial choice shall: 22            (A) if the frequencies are not available to the 23        testing laboratory for the ethnic or racial group 24        requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled 25        in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or 26            (B) engage another testing laboratory to perform   10400HB2683ham001- 20 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1        the calculations. 2    (e) If, after recalculation using a different ethnic or 3racial group, genetic testing does not reputably identify a 4person man as the parent father of a child, an individual who 5has been tested may be required to submit to additional 6genetic testing. 7(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 8    (750 ILCS 46/403)9    Sec. 403. Genetic test results. 10    (a) The expert shall prepare a written report of the 11genetic test results. If the genetic test results show that 12the alleged genetic parent father is not excluded, the report 13shall contain statistics based upon the statistical formula of 14combined parentage paternity index (CPI) and the probability 15of parentage paternity as determined by the probability of 16exclusion (Random Person Man Not Excluded = RPNE RMNE). The 17expert may be called by the court as a witness to testify to 18the expert's his or her findings and, if called, shall be 19subject to cross-examination by the parties. If the genetic 20test results show that the alleged genetic parent father is 21not excluded, any party may demand that other experts, 22qualified as examiners of blood or tissue types, perform 23independent genetic testing under order of court, including, 24but not limited to, blood types or other testing of genetic 25markers. The results of the genetic testing may be offered   10400HB2683ham001- 21 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1into evidence. The number and qualifications of the experts 2shall be determined by the court. 3    (b) Documentation of the chain of custody of the blood or 4tissue samples, accompanied by an affidavit or certification 5in accordance with Section 1-109 of the Code of Civil 6Procedure, is competent evidence to establish the chain of 7custody. 8    (c) The report of the genetic test results prepared by the 9appointed expert shall be made by affidavit or by 10certification as provided in Section 1-109 of the Code of 11Civil Procedure and shall be mailed to all parties. A proof of 12service shall be filed with the court. The verified report 13shall be admitted into evidence at trial without foundation 14testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy, unless a 15written motion challenging the admissibility of the report is 16filed by either party within 28 days of receipt of the report, 17in which case expert testimony shall be required. A party may 18not file such a motion challenging the admissibility of the 19report later than 28 days before commencement of trial. Before 20trial, the court shall determine whether the motion is 21sufficient to deny admission of the report by verification. 22Failure to make that timely motion constitutes a waiver of the 23right to object to admission by verification and shall not be 24grounds for a continuance of the hearing to establish 25parentage paternity. 26(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.)   10400HB2683ham001- 22 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1    (750 ILCS 46/404)2    Sec. 404. Effect of genetic testing. Genetic testing taken 3under this Article shall have the following effect:4        (a) If the court finds that the conclusion of the 5    expert or experts, as disclosed by the evidence based upon 6    the genetic testing, is that the alleged genetic parent 7    father is not the parent of the child, the question of 8    parentage paternity shall be resolved accordingly. 9        (b) If the experts disagree in their findings or 10    conclusions, the question shall be weighed with other 11    competent evidence of parentage paternity. 12        (c) If the genetic testing results indicate that the 13    alleged genetic parent father is not excluded and that the 14    combined parentage paternity index is at least 1,000 to 1, 15    and there is at least a 99.9% probability of parentage 16    paternity, the alleged genetic parent father is presumed 17    to be the parent father, and this evidence shall be 18    admitted. 19        (d) A person man identified under subsection (c) of 20    this Section as the parent father of the child may rebut 21    the genetic testing results by other genetic testing 22    satisfying the requirements of this Article which: 23            (1) excludes the person man as a genetic parent 24        father of the child; or 25            (2) identifies another person man as the possible   10400HB2683ham001- 23 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1        parent father of the child. 2        (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, if 3    more than one person man is identified by genetic testing 4    as the possible parent father of the child, the court 5    shall order them to submit to further genetic testing to 6    identify the genetic parent father. 7(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 8    (750 ILCS 46/405)9    Sec. 405. Cost of genetic testing. The expense of the 10genetic testing shall be paid by the party who requests the 11genetic testing, except that the court may apportion the costs 12between the parties, upon request. When the genetic testing is 13requested by the party seeking to establish parentage 14paternity and that party is found to be indigent by the court, 15the expense shall be paid by the public agency providing 16representation; except that where a public agency is not 17providing representation, the expense shall be paid by the 18county in which the action is brought. When the genetic 19testing is ordered by the court on its own motion or is 20requested by the alleged or presumed parent father and that 21parent father is found to be indigent by the court, the expense 22shall be paid by the county in which the action is brought. Any 23part of the expense may be taxed as costs in the action, except 24that no costs may be taxed against a public agency that has not 25requested the genetic testing.  10400HB2683ham001- 24 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 2    (750 ILCS 46/407)3    Sec. 407. Independent genetic testing. Nothing in this 4Article shall prevent a party from obtaining genetic testing 5of the party's his or her own blood or tissue independent of 6those ordered by the court or from presenting expert testimony 7interpreting those tests or any other blood tests ordered 8under this Article. Reports of all the independent tests, 9accompanied by affidavit or certification pursuant to Section 101-109 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and notice of any expert 11witnesses to be called to testify to the results of those tests 12shall be submitted to all parties at least 30 days before any 13hearing set to determine the issue of parentage.14(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 15    (750 ILCS 46/408)16    Sec. 408. Additional persons to be tested. 17    (a) Subject to subsection (b), if a genetic-testing 18specimen is not available from a person man who may be the 19parent father of a child, for good cause and under 20circumstances the court considers to be just, the court may 21order the following individuals to submit specimens for 22genetic testing: 23        (1) the parents of the person man; 24        (2) brothers and sisters of the person man;   10400HB2683ham001- 25 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1        (3) other children of the person and the parent who 2    gave birth to the person man and their mothers; and3        (4) other relatives of the person man necessary to 4    complete genetic testing. 5    (b) Issuance of an order under this Section requires a 6finding that a need for genetic testing outweighs the 7legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested, 8and in no event shall an order be issued until the individual 9is joined as a party and given notice as required under the 10Code of Civil Procedure. 11(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 12    (750 ILCS 46/501)13    Sec. 501. Temporary orders. 14    (a) On a motion by a party and a showing of clear and 15convincing evidence of parentage, the court shall issue a 16temporary order for support of a child, including a non-minor 17child with a disability, if the order is appropriate and the 18individual ordered to pay support is: 19        (1) a presumed parent of the child; 20        (2) petitioning to have parentage adjudicated; 21        (3) identified as the parent father through genetic 22    testing under Article 4 of this Act; 23        (4) an alleged genetic parent father who has declined 24    to submit to genetic testing; 25        (5) shown by clear and convincing evidence to be the   10400HB2683ham001- 26 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1    child's parent father; 2        (6) the parent who gave birth to mother of the child 3    except under the Gestational Surrogacy Act; or 4        (7) anyone else determined to be the child's parent. 5    In determining the amount of a temporary child support 6award, the court shall use the guidelines and standards set 7forth in Sections 505, 505.2, and 513.5 of the Illinois 8Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. 9    (b) A temporary order may include provisions for the 10allocation of parental responsibilities and parenting time as 11provided by the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage 12Act.

It shall be presumed to be equitable and in the best 9interests of the child to grant a motion by the child seeking 10an order for genetic testing. The presumption may be overcome 11by clear and convincing evidence that extraordinary 12circumstances exist making the genetic testing contrary to the 13child's best interests. The court's order denying a child's 14request for genetic testing must state the basis for the 15denial upon which the presumption was overcome. The court's 16order granting a child's request for genetic testing must 17specify the ways in which the testing results may be used for 18purposes of protecting the child's best interests.19    (d) (Blank).

After a presumption 11under Section 204 of this Act has been rebutted, parentage of 12the child by another person man or woman may be established in 13the same action, if such person he or she has been made a 14party.15    (b) An action to declare the non-existence of the 16parent-child relationship brought under subsection (a) of this 17Section shall be barred if brought later than 2 years after the 18petitioner knew or should have known of the relevant facts. 19The 2-year period for bringing an action to declare the 20non-existence of the parent-child relationship shall not 21extend beyond the date on which the child reaches the age of 18 22years. Failure to bring an action within 2 years shall not bar 23any party from asserting a defense in any action to declare the 24existence of the parent-child relationship.25    (c) An action to declare the non-existence of the   10400HB2683ham001- 13 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1parent-child relationship may be brought subsequent to an 2adjudication of parentage in any judgment by the person man 3adjudicated to be the parent pursuant to a presumption in 4paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of Section 204 if, as a 5result of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing, it is 6discovered that the person man adjudicated to be the parent is 7not the parent father of the child. Actions brought by the 8adjudicated parent father shall be brought by verified 9petition. If, as a result of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) 10testing that is admissible under Section 614 of this Act, the 11petitioner is determined not to be the parent father of the 12child, the adjudication of parentage paternity and any orders 13regarding the allocation of parental responsibilities, 14parenting time, and future payments of support may be vacated. 15This provision shall not apply to actions involving parentage 16of children born through assisted reproduction. 17    (d) An action to declare the non-existence of the 18parent-child relationship brought under subsection (c) of this 19Section shall be barred if brought more than 2 years after the 20petitioner obtains actual knowledge of relevant facts. The 212-year period shall not apply to periods of time where the 22person who gave birth to the child mother or the child refuses 23to submit to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing. The 2-year 24period for bringing an action to declare the non-existence of 25the parent-child relationship shall not extend beyond the date 26on which the child reaches the age of 18 years.   10400HB2683ham001- 14 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 2    (750 ILCS 46/301)3    Sec. 301. Voluntary acknowledgment. A parent-child 4relationship may be established voluntarily by the signing and 5witnessing of a voluntary acknowledgment in accordance with 6Section 12 of the Vital Records Act and Section 10-17.7 of the 7Illinois Public Aid Code. A person who gave birth to a child 8and an alleged genetic parent of the child, a presumed parent 9under Section 204, or an intended parent under Article 7, may 10sign an acknowledgment of parentage to establish the parentage 11of the child. The voluntary acknowledgment shall contain the 12social security numbers or tax identification numbers of the 13persons signing the voluntary acknowledgment; however, failure 14to include the social security numbers of the persons signing 15a voluntary acknowledgment does not invalidate the voluntary 16acknowledgment.17(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 18    (750 ILCS 46/302)19    Sec. 302. Execution of voluntary acknowledgment. 20    (a) A voluntary acknowledgment described in Section 301 of 21this Act must: 22        (1) be in a record; 23        (2) be signed, or otherwise authenticated, under 24    penalty of perjury by the person who gave birth to the   10400HB2683ham001- 15 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1    child mother and by the person man seeking to establish 2    his parentage; 3        (3) state that the child whose parentage is being 4    acknowledged: 5            (A) does not have a presumed parent, or has a 6        presumed parent whose full name is stated; and 7            (B) does not have another acknowledged or 8        adjudicated parent; 9        (4) be witnessed; and 10        (5) state that the signatories understand that the 11    voluntary acknowledgment is the equivalent of a judicial 12    adjudication of parentage of the child and that: (i) a 13    challenge by a signatory to the voluntary acknowledgment 14    may be permitted only upon a showing of fraud, duress, or 15    material mistake of fact; and (ii) a challenge to the 16    voluntary acknowledgment is barred after 2 years unless 17    that period is tolled pursuant to the law. 18    (b) An acknowledgment is void if it: 19        (1) states that another person is a presumed parent, 20    unless a denial signed or otherwise authenticated by the 21    presumed parent is filed with the Department of Healthcare 22    and Family Services, as provided by law; 23        (2) states that another person is an acknowledged or 24    adjudicated parent; or 25        (3) falsely denies the existence of a presumed, 26    acknowledged, or adjudicated parent of the child.   10400HB2683ham001- 16 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1    (c) A presumed parent father may sign or otherwise 2authenticate a voluntary acknowledgment. 3(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 4    (750 ILCS 46/303)5    Sec. 303. Denial of parentage. A presumed parent may sign 6a denial of parentage. The denial is valid only if:7        (a) a voluntary acknowledgment described in Section 8    301 of this Act signed, or otherwise authenticated, by a 9    person man is filed pursuant to Section 305 of this Act; 10        (b) the denial is in a record, and is signed, or 11    otherwise authenticated, under penalty of perjury; and 12        (c) the presumed parent has not previously: 13            (1) acknowledged his parentage, unless the 14        previous voluntary acknowledgment has been rescinded 15        under Section 307 of this Act or successfully 16        challenged under Section 308 of this Act; or 17            (2) been adjudicated to be the parent of the 18        child. 19(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 20    (750 ILCS 46/305)21    Sec. 305. Effect of voluntary acknowledgment or denial of 22parentage. 23    (a) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 307 and 308 24of this Act, a valid voluntary acknowledgment filed with the   10400HB2683ham001- 17 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1Department of Healthcare and Family Services, as provided by 2law, is equivalent to an adjudication of the parentage of a 3child and confers upon the acknowledged parent father all of 4the rights and duties of a parent. 5    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, 6parentage established in accordance with Section 301 of this 7Act has the full force and effect of a judgment entered under 8this Act and serves as a basis for seeking a child support 9order without any further proceedings to establish parentage. 10    (c) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 307 and 308 11of this Act, a valid denial by a presumed parent filed with the 12Department of Healthcare and Family Services, as provided by 13law, in conjunction with a voluntary acknowledgment, is 14equivalent to an adjudication of the nonparentage of the 15presumed parent and discharges the presumed parent from all 16rights and duties of a parent. 17(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 18    (750 ILCS 46/401)19    Sec. 401. Proceeding authorized. As soon as practicable, a 20court or an administrative hearing officer in an Expedited 21Child Support System may, and upon the request of a party 22except as provided in Section 610 of this Act, or of the child, 23shall order or direct the parent who gave birth to the child 24mother, the child, and the alleged genetic parent father to 25submit to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing to determine   10400HB2683ham001- 18 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1inherited characteristics. If any party refuses to submit to 2genetic testing, the court may resolve the question of 3parentage paternity against that party or enforce its order if 4the rights of others and the interests of justice so require. 5Genetic testing may not be used to: (1) challenge the 6parentage of a person who is a parent under Article 7 or the 7Gestational Surrogacy Act, inclusive; or (2) establish the 8parentage of a person who is a donor. 9(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 10    (750 ILCS 46/402)11    Sec. 402. Requirements for genetic testing. 12    (a) The genetic testing shall be conducted by an expert 13qualified as an examiner of blood or tissue types and 14appointed by the court. The expert shall determine the genetic 15testing procedures. However, any interested party, for good 16cause shown, in advance of the scheduled genetic testing, may 17request a hearing to object to the qualifications of the 18expert or the genetic testing procedures. The expert appointed 19by the court shall testify at the pre-test hearing at the 20expense of the party requesting the hearing, except for an 21indigent party as provided in Section 405 of this Act. An 22expert not appointed by the court shall testify at the 23pre-test hearing at the expense of the party retaining the 24expert. Inquiry into an expert's qualifications at the 25pre-test hearing shall not affect either party's right to have   10400HB2683ham001- 19 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1the expert qualified at trial. 2    (b) Genetic testing must be of a type reasonably relied 3upon by experts in the field of genetic testing and performed 4in a testing laboratory accredited by the American Association 5of Blood Banks or a successor to its functions. 6    (c) A specimen used in genetic testing may consist of one 7or more samples, or a combination of samples, of blood, buccal 8cells, bone, hair, or other body tissue or fluid. 9    (d) The testing laboratory shall determine the databases 10from which to select frequencies for use in calculation of the 11probability of parentage paternity based on the ethnic or 12racial group of an individual or individuals. If there is 13disagreement as to the testing laboratory's choice, the 14following rules apply: 15        (1) The individual objecting may require the testing 16    laboratory, within 30 days after receipt of the report of 17    the genetic testing, to recalculate the probability of 18    parentage paternity using an ethnic or racial group 19    different from that used by the laboratory. 20        (2) The individual objecting to the testing 21    laboratory's initial choice shall: 22            (A) if the frequencies are not available to the 23        testing laboratory for the ethnic or racial group 24        requested, provide the requested frequencies compiled 25        in a manner recognized by accrediting bodies; or 26            (B) engage another testing laboratory to perform   10400HB2683ham001- 20 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1        the calculations. 2    (e) If, after recalculation using a different ethnic or 3racial group, genetic testing does not reputably identify a 4person man as the parent father of a child, an individual who 5has been tested may be required to submit to additional 6genetic testing. 7(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 8    (750 ILCS 46/403)9    Sec. 403. Genetic test results. 10    (a) The expert shall prepare a written report of the 11genetic test results. If the genetic test results show that 12the alleged genetic parent father is not excluded, the report 13shall contain statistics based upon the statistical formula of 14combined parentage paternity index (CPI) and the probability 15of parentage paternity as determined by the probability of 16exclusion (Random Person Man Not Excluded = RPNE RMNE). The 17expert may be called by the court as a witness to testify to 18the expert's his or her findings and, if called, shall be 19subject to cross-examination by the parties. If the genetic 20test results show that the alleged genetic parent father is 21not excluded, any party may demand that other experts, 22qualified as examiners of blood or tissue types, perform 23independent genetic testing under order of court, including, 24but not limited to, blood types or other testing of genetic 25markers. The results of the genetic testing may be offered   10400HB2683ham001- 21 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1into evidence. The number and qualifications of the experts 2shall be determined by the court. 3    (b) Documentation of the chain of custody of the blood or 4tissue samples, accompanied by an affidavit or certification 5in accordance with Section 1-109 of the Code of Civil 6Procedure, is competent evidence to establish the chain of 7custody. 8    (c) The report of the genetic test results prepared by the 9appointed expert shall be made by affidavit or by 10certification as provided in Section 1-109 of the Code of 11Civil Procedure and shall be mailed to all parties. A proof of 12service shall be filed with the court. The verified report 13shall be admitted into evidence at trial without foundation 14testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy, unless a 15written motion challenging the admissibility of the report is 16filed by either party within 28 days of receipt of the report, 17in which case expert testimony shall be required. A party may 18not file such a motion challenging the admissibility of the 19report later than 28 days before commencement of trial. Before 20trial, the court shall determine whether the motion is 21sufficient to deny admission of the report by verification. 22Failure to make that timely motion constitutes a waiver of the 23right to object to admission by verification and shall not be 24grounds for a continuance of the hearing to establish 25parentage paternity. 26(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.)   10400HB2683ham001- 22 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1    (750 ILCS 46/404)2    Sec. 404. Effect of genetic testing. Genetic testing taken 3under this Article shall have the following effect:4        (a) If the court finds that the conclusion of the 5    expert or experts, as disclosed by the evidence based upon 6    the genetic testing, is that the alleged genetic parent 7    father is not the parent of the child, the question of 8    parentage paternity shall be resolved accordingly. 9        (b) If the experts disagree in their findings or 10    conclusions, the question shall be weighed with other 11    competent evidence of parentage paternity. 12        (c) If the genetic testing results indicate that the 13    alleged genetic parent father is not excluded and that the 14    combined parentage paternity index is at least 1,000 to 1, 15    and there is at least a 99.9% probability of parentage 16    paternity, the alleged genetic parent father is presumed 17    to be the parent father, and this evidence shall be 18    admitted. 19        (d) A person man identified under subsection (c) of 20    this Section as the parent father of the child may rebut 21    the genetic testing results by other genetic testing 22    satisfying the requirements of this Article which: 23            (1) excludes the person man as a genetic parent 24        father of the child; or 25            (2) identifies another person man as the possible   10400HB2683ham001- 23 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1        parent father of the child. 2        (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, if 3    more than one person man is identified by genetic testing 4    as the possible parent father of the child, the court 5    shall order them to submit to further genetic testing to 6    identify the genetic parent father. 7(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 8    (750 ILCS 46/405)9    Sec. 405. Cost of genetic testing. The expense of the 10genetic testing shall be paid by the party who requests the 11genetic testing, except that the court may apportion the costs 12between the parties, upon request. When the genetic testing is 13requested by the party seeking to establish parentage 14paternity and that party is found to be indigent by the court, 15the expense shall be paid by the public agency providing 16representation; except that where a public agency is not 17providing representation, the expense shall be paid by the 18county in which the action is brought. When the genetic 19testing is ordered by the court on its own motion or is 20requested by the alleged or presumed parent father and that 21parent father is found to be indigent by the court, the expense 22shall be paid by the county in which the action is brought. Any 23part of the expense may be taxed as costs in the action, except 24that no costs may be taxed against a public agency that has not 25requested the genetic testing.  10400HB2683ham001- 24 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 2    (750 ILCS 46/407)3    Sec. 407. Independent genetic testing. Nothing in this 4Article shall prevent a party from obtaining genetic testing 5of the party's his or her own blood or tissue independent of 6those ordered by the court or from presenting expert testimony 7interpreting those tests or any other blood tests ordered 8under this Article. Reports of all the independent tests, 9accompanied by affidavit or certification pursuant to Section 101-109 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and notice of any expert 11witnesses to be called to testify to the results of those tests 12shall be submitted to all parties at least 30 days before any 13hearing set to determine the issue of parentage.14(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 15    (750 ILCS 46/408)16    Sec. 408. Additional persons to be tested. 17    (a) Subject to subsection (b), if a genetic-testing 18specimen is not available from a person man who may be the 19parent father of a child, for good cause and under 20circumstances the court considers to be just, the court may 21order the following individuals to submit specimens for 22genetic testing: 23        (1) the parents of the person man; 24        (2) brothers and sisters of the person man;   10400HB2683ham001- 25 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1        (3) other children of the person and the parent who 2    gave birth to the person man and their mothers; and3        (4) other relatives of the person man necessary to 4    complete genetic testing. 5    (b) Issuance of an order under this Section requires a 6finding that a need for genetic testing outweighs the 7legitimate interests of the individual sought to be tested, 8and in no event shall an order be issued until the individual 9is joined as a party and given notice as required under the 10Code of Civil Procedure. 11(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16.) 12    (750 ILCS 46/501)13    Sec. 501. Temporary orders. 14    (a) On a motion by a party and a showing of clear and 15convincing evidence of parentage, the court shall issue a 16temporary order for support of a child, including a non-minor 17child with a disability, if the order is appropriate and the 18individual ordered to pay support is: 19        (1) a presumed parent of the child; 20        (2) petitioning to have parentage adjudicated; 21        (3) identified as the parent father through genetic 22    testing under Article 4 of this Act; 23        (4) an alleged genetic parent father who has declined 24    to submit to genetic testing; 25        (5) shown by clear and convincing evidence to be the   10400HB2683ham001- 26 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1    child's parent father; 2        (6) the parent who gave birth to mother of the child 3    except under the Gestational Surrogacy Act; or 4        (7) anyone else determined to be the child's parent. 5    In determining the amount of a temporary child support 6award, the court shall use the guidelines and standards set 7forth in Sections 505, 505.2, and 513.5 of the Illinois 8Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. 9    (b) A temporary order may include provisions for the 10allocation of parental responsibilities and parenting time as 11provided by the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage 12Act. A temporary order may, in accordance with the provisions 13of subsection (a) of Section 508 of the Illinois Marriage and 14Dissolution of Marriage Act that relate to proceedings other 15than pre-judgment dissolution proceedings, include an award 16for interim attorney's fees and costs. 17    (c) Temporary orders issued under this Section shall not 18have prejudicial effect with respect to final child support, 19the allocation of parental responsibilities, or parenting time 20orders. 21(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.) 22    (750 ILCS 46/502)23    Sec. 502. Injunctive relief. 24    (a) In any action brought under this Act for the initial 25determination of parentage, the allocation of parental   10400HB2683ham001- 27 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1responsibilities or parenting time, or for modification of a 2prior allocation order or judgment or parenting time order, 3the court, upon application of a party, may enjoin a party 4having physical possession or an allocation order or judgment 5from temporarily relocating the child from this State pending 6the adjudication of the issues of parentage, the allocation of 7parental responsibilities, and parenting time. When deciding 8whether to enjoin relocation of a child, or to order a party to 9return the child to this State, the court shall consider 10factors including, but not limited to: 11        (1) the extent of previous involvement with the child 12    by the party seeking to enjoin relocation or to have the 13    absent party return the child to this State; 14        (2) the likelihood that parentage will be established; 15    and 16        (3) the impact on the financial, physical, and 17    emotional health of the party being enjoined from 18    relocating the child or the party being ordered to return 19    the child to this State. 20    (b) A temporary restraining order or preliminary 21injunction under this Act shall be governed by the relevant 22provisions of Part 1 of Article XI of the Code of Civil 23Procedure.24    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of 25this Section, the court may decline to enjoin a domestic 26violence victim having physical possession or an allocation   10400HB2683ham001- 28 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1order or judgment from temporarily or permanently relocating 2the child from this State pending an allocation of parental 3responsibilities or an adjudication of parenting time. In 4determining whether a person is a domestic violence victim, 5the court shall consider the following factors: 6        (1) a sworn statement by the person that the person 7    has good reason to believe that the person he or she is the 8    victim of domestic violence or stalking; 9        (2) a sworn statement that the person fears for the 10    person's his or her safety or the safety of the person's 11    his or her children; 12        (3) evidence from police, court, or other government 13    agency records or files; 14        (4) documentation from a domestic violence program if 15    the person is alleged to be a victim of domestic violence; 16        (5) documentation from a legal, clerical, medical, or 17    other professional from whom the person has sought 18    assistance in dealing with the alleged domestic violence; 19    and 20        (6) any other evidence that supports the sworn 21    statements, such as a statement from any other individual 22    with knowledge of the circumstances that provides the 23    basis for the claim, or physical evidence of the domestic 24    violence. 25(Source: P.A. 99-85, eff. 1-1-16; 99-769, eff. 1-1-17.)   10400HB2683ham001- 29 -LRB104 07510 JRC 23573 a1    (750 ILCS 46/601)2    Sec. 601.

It shall be presumed to be equitable and in the best 9interests of the child to grant a motion by the child seeking 10an order for genetic testing. The presumption may be overcome 11by clear and convincing evidence that extraordinary 12circumstances exist making the genetic testing contrary to the 13child's best interests. The court's order denying a child's 14request for genetic testing must state the basis for the 15denial upon which the presumption was overcome. The court's 16order granting a child's request for genetic testing must 17specify the ways in which the testing results may be used for 18purposes of protecting the child's best interests.19    (d) (Blank).
