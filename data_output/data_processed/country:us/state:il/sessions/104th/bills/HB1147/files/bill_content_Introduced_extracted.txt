The credit 19must be applied to the earliest year for which there is a tax 20liability. If there are credits from more than one tax year 21that are available to offset a liability, then the earlier 22credit must be applied first. Credits that are initially 23claimed against taxes imposed by the Illinois Income Tax Act 24may be carried forward only against the taxpayer's future 25Illinois Income Tax liability. Credits that are initially 26claimed against taxes, penalties, fees, charges, and payments   HB1147- 10 -LRB104 03040 HLH 15937 b1imposed by the Illinois Insurance Code may be carried forward 2only against taxes, penalties, fees, charges, and payments 3imposed by the Illinois Insurance Code.

An 18Authority may exercise the option to impose a compliance fee 19or a penalty in the exercise of its compliance monitoring 20function under this Act. 21    Section 20. Recapture. If, under Section 42 of the 22Internal Revenue Code, a portion of any federal tax credit 23claimed with respect to a qualified development for which a 24credit has been awarded under this Act is required by a final 25determination by the Internal Revenue Service or a court of   HB1147- 11 -LRB104 03040 HLH 15937 b1law with competent jurisdiction to be recaptured during the 2first 6 years after a project is placed in service, then, 3within 60 days after becoming aware of the federal tax credit 4recapture, unless the taxpayer successfully disputes the 5recapture, the project owner shall provide the Department, the 6Department of Insurance, and the applicable Authority with 7notice of the federal tax credit recapture. Notice shall be 8provided in the manner and form as provided by the Department, 9the Department of Insurance, and the Authority, respectively. 10If an Authority issues a federal Form 8823 to the owner of a 11qualified development that has been awarded a credit under 12this Act, and an Authority has not been notified within 6 13months of filing the Form 8823 that the noncompliance has been 14remedied, an Authority shall submit the Form 8823 to the 15Department or Department of Insurance, as applicable. The 16amount of credit subject to recapture shall be proportionately 17equal to the amount of the qualified development's federal tax 18credits that are subject to recapture. If the project owner 19(or one of the project owner's direct or indirect members) 20fails to notify the Department or the Department of Insurance, 21as applicable, of any final determination of recapture of the 22federal tax credit, then the entire amount of the State tax 23credit awarded for the qualified development may be subject to 24recapture. The qualified taxpayer subject to recapture shall 25increase the qualified taxpayer's tax by the amount of any 26credit subject to recapture in the tax year the qualified   HB1147- 12 -LRB104 03040 HLH 15937 b1taxpayer is notified of the recapture. If multiple taxpayers 2claimed credit with respect to the building for which credit 3is to be recaptured, each of those taxpayers shall be liable 4for a portion of the recapture equal to the percentages of 5credit with respect to the building originally claimed by the 6taxpayer. 7    Section 25.

If multiple taxpayers 2claimed credit with respect to the building for which credit 3is to be recaptured, each of those taxpayers shall be liable 4for a portion of the recapture equal to the percentages of 5credit with respect to the building originally claimed by the 6taxpayer. 7    Section 25.
