A voter 4whose ballot is identified as under-voted for a statewide 5constitutional office may return to the voting booth and 6complete the voting of that ballot. A voter whose ballot is not 7accepted by the voting equipment may, upon surrendering the 8ballot, request and vote another ballot.

The judge of election to whom the 15voter delivers his ballots shall not accept the same unless 16all of the ballots given to the voter are returned by him. If a 17voter delivers less than all of the ballots given to him, the 18judge to whom the same are offered shall advise him in a voice 19clearly audible to the other judges of election that the voter 20must return the remainder of the ballots. The statement of the 21judge to the voter shall clearly express the fact that the 22voter is not required to vote such remaining ballots but that 23whether or not he votes them he must fold and deliver them to 24the judge. In making such statement the judge of election 25shall not indicate by word, gesture or intonation of voice 26that the unreturned ballots shall be voted in any particular   HB1769- 15 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1manner. No new voter shall be permitted to enter the voting 2booth of a voter who has failed to deliver the total number of 3ballots received by him until such voter has returned to the 4voting booth pursuant to the judge's request and again quit 5the booth with all of the ballots required to be returned by 6him. Upon receipt of all such ballots the judges of election 7shall enter the name of the voter, and his number, as above 8provided in this Section, and the judge to whom the ballots are 9delivered shall immediately put the ballots into the ballot 10box. If any voter who has failed to deliver all the ballots 11received by him refuses to return to the voting booth after 12being advised by the judge of election as herein provided, the 13judge shall inform the other judges of such refusal, and 14thereupon the ballot or ballots returned to the judge shall be 15deposited in the ballot box, the voter shall be permitted to 16depart from the polling place, and a new voter shall be 17permitted to enter the voting booth. 18    The judge of election who receives the ballot or ballots 19from the voter shall announce the residence and name of such 20voter in a loud voice. The judge shall put the ballot or 21ballots received from the voter into the ballot box in the 22presence of the voter and the judges of election, and in plain 23view of the public. The judges having charge of such registers 24shall then, in a column prepared thereon, in the same line of, 25the name of the voter, mark "Voted" or the letter "V". 26    No judge of election shall accept from any voter less than   HB1769- 16 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1the full number of ballots received by such voter without 2first advising the voter in the manner above provided of the 3necessity of returning all of the ballots, nor shall any such 4judge advise such voter in a manner contrary to that which is 5herein permitted, or in any other manner violate the 6provisions of this Section; provided, that the acceptance by a 7judge of election of less than the full number of ballots 8delivered to a voter who refuses to return to the voting booth 9after being properly advised by such judge shall not be a 10violation of this Section. 11(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 12    (10 ILCS 5/18A-5)13    Sec. 18A-5.

Each county clerk or board of election 11    commissioners, as the case may be, must design, obtain or 12    procure self-adhesive clear plastic packing list envelopes 13    and provisional ballot envelopes that are suitable for 14    implementing this subsection (b)(4) of this Section.15        (5) The election judge shall provide the person with a 16    provisional ballot, written instructions for casting a 17    provisional ballot, and the provisional ballot envelope 18    with the clear plastic packing list envelope affixed to 19    it, which contains the person's original written affidavit 20    and, if any, information provided by the provisional voter 21    to support his or her claim that he or she is a duly 22    registered voter. An election judge must also give the 23    person written information that states that any person who 24    casts a provisional ballot shall be able to ascertain, 25    pursuant to guidelines established by the State Board of 26    Elections, whether the provisional vote was counted in the   HB1769- 21 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1    official canvass of votes for that election and, if the 2    provisional vote was not counted, the reason that the vote 3    was not counted.4        (6) After the person has completed marking his or her 5    provisional ballot, he or she shall place the marked 6    ballot inside of the provisional ballot envelope, close 7    and seal the envelope, and return the envelope to an 8    election judge, who shall then deposit the sealed 9    provisional ballot envelope into a securable container 10    separately identified and utilized for containing sealed 11    provisional ballot envelopes. Ballots that are provisional 12    because they are cast after 7:00 p.m. by court order shall 13    be kept separate from other provisional ballots. Upon the 14    closing of the polls, the securable container shall be 15    sealed with filament tape provided for that purpose, which 16    shall be wrapped around the box lengthwise and crosswise, 17    at least twice each way, and each of the election judges 18    shall sign the seal.19    (c) Instead of the affidavit form described in subsection 20(b), the county clerk or board of election commissioners, as 21the case may be, may design and use a multi-part affidavit form 22that is imprinted upon or attached to the provisional ballot 23envelope described in subsection (b). If a county clerk or 24board of election commissioners elects to design and use its 25own multi-part affidavit form, then the county clerk or board 26of election commissioners shall establish a mechanism for   HB1769- 22 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1accepting any information the provisional voter has supplied 2to the election judge to support his or her claim that he or 3she is a duly registered voter. In all other respects, a county 4clerk or board of election commissioners shall establish 5procedures consistent with subsection (b).6    (d) The county clerk or board of election commissioners, 7as the case may be, shall use the completed affidavit form 8described in subsection (b) to update the person's voter 9registration information in the State voter registration 10database and voter registration database of the county clerk 11or board of election commissioners, as the case may be. If a 12person is later determined not to be a registered voter based 13on Section 18A-15 of this Code, then the affidavit shall be 14processed by the county clerk or board of election 15commissioners, as the case may be, as a voter registration 16application.17(Source: P.A. 100-201, eff. 8-18-17.) 18    (10 ILCS 5/18A-15)19    Sec. 18A-15. Validating and counting provisional ballots. 20    (a) The county clerk or board of election commissioners 21shall complete the validation and counting of provisional 22ballots within 14 calendar days of the day of the election. The 23county clerk or board of election commissioners shall have 7 24calendar days from the completion of the validation and 25counting of provisional ballots to conduct its final canvass.   HB1769- 23 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1The State Board of Elections shall complete within 31 calendar 2days of the election or sooner if all the returns are received, 3its final canvass of the vote for all public offices.4    (b) If a county clerk or board of election commissioners 5determines that all of the following apply, then a provisional 6ballot is valid and shall be counted as a vote:7        (1) the provisional voter cast the provisional ballot 8    in the correct precinct based on the address provided by 9    the provisional voter. The provisional voter's affidavit 10    shall serve as a change of address request by that voter 11    for registration purposes for the next ensuing election if 12    it bears an address different from that in the records of 13    the election authority. Votes for federal and statewide 14    offices on a provisional ballot cast in the incorrect 15    precinct that meet the other requirements of this 16    subsection shall be valid and counted in accordance with 17    this Article. As used in this item, "federal office" is 18    defined as provided in Section 20-1 and "statewide office" 19    means the Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, 20    Comptroller, and Treasurer. Votes for General Assembly, 21    countywide, citywide, or township office on a provisional 22    ballot cast in the incorrect precinct but in the correct 23    legislative district, representative district, county, 24    municipality, or township, as the case may be, shall be 25    valid and counted in accordance with this Article. As used 26    in this item, "citywide office" means an office elected by   HB1769- 24 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1    the electors of an entire municipality. As used in this 2    item, "township office" means an office elected by the 3    electors of an entire township;4        (2) the affidavit executed by the provisional voter 5    pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5 contains, 6    at a minimum, the provisional voter's first and last name, 7    house number and street name, and signature or mark;8        (3) except as permitted by item (5) of subsection (b) 9    of this Section, the provisional voter is a registered 10    voter based on information available to the county clerk 11    or board of election commissioners provided by or obtained 12    from any of the following:13            i. the provisional voter;14            ii. an election judge;15            iii. the statewide voter registration database 16        maintained by the State Board of Elections;17            iv. the records of the county clerk or board of 18        election commissioners' database; or19            v. the records of the Secretary of State; and20        (4) for a provisional ballot cast under item (6) of 21    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter did not vote by 22    mail ballot in the election at which the provisional 23    ballot was cast; or 24        (5) for a provisional ballot cast under item (7) of 25    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter provides the 26    election authority with the necessary documentation within   HB1769- 25 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1    7 days of election day. 2    (c) With respect to subsection (b)(3) of this Section, the 3county clerk or board of election commissioners shall 4investigate and record whether or not the specified 5information is available from each of the 5 identified 6sources. If the information is available from one or more of 7the identified sources, then the county clerk or board of 8election commissioners shall seek to obtain the information 9from each of those sources until satisfied, with information 10from at least one of those sources, that the provisional voter 11is registered and entitled to vote. The county clerk or board 12of election commissioners shall use any information it obtains 13as the basis for determining the voter registration status of 14the provisional voter. If a conflict exists among the 15information available to the county clerk or board of election 16commissioners as to the registration status of the provisional 17voter, then the county clerk or board of election 18commissioners shall make a determination based on the totality 19of the circumstances. In a case where the above information 20equally supports or opposes the registration status of the 21voter, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 22shall decide in favor of the provisional voter as being duly 23registered to vote. If the statewide voter registration 24database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 25that the provisional voter is registered to vote, but the 26county clerk's or board of election commissioners' voter   HB1769- 26 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1registration database indicates that the provisional voter is 2not registered to vote, then the information found in the 3statewide voter registration database shall control the matter 4and the provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to 5vote. If the records of the county clerk or board of election 6commissioners indicates that the provisional voter is 7registered to vote, but the statewide voter registration 8database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 9that the provisional voter is not registered to vote, then the 10information found in the records of the county clerk or board 11of election commissioners shall control the matter and the 12provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to vote. If 13the provisional voter's signature on his or her provisional 14ballot request varies from the signature on an otherwise valid 15registration application solely because of the substitution of 16initials for the first or middle name, the election authority 17may not reject the provisional ballot.18    (d) In validating the registration status of a person 19casting a provisional ballot, the county clerk or board of 20election commissioners shall not require a provisional voter 21to complete any form other than the affidavit executed by the 22provisional voter under subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5. In 23addition, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 24shall not require all provisional voters or any particular 25class or group of provisional voters to appear personally 26before the county clerk or board of election commissioners or   HB1769- 27 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1as a matter of policy require provisional voters to submit 2additional information to verify or otherwise support the 3information already submitted by the provisional voter. Within 42 calendar days after the election, the election authority 5shall transmit by electronic means pursuant to a process 6established by the State Board of Elections the name, street 7address, e-mail address, and precinct, ward, township, and 8district numbers, as the case may be, of each person casting a 9provisional ballot to the State Board of Elections, which 10shall maintain those names and that information in an 11electronic format on its website, arranged by county and 12accessible to State and local political committees. The 13provisional voter may, within 7 calendar days after the 14election, submit additional information to the county clerk or 15board of election commissioners, except that in the case of 16provisional voting under paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of 17Section 18A-5, the provisional voter has 10 days to provide 18the county clerk or board of election commissioners with the 19required photo identification card. This information must be 20received by the county clerk or board of election 21commissioners within the applicable 7-calendar-day or 2210-calendar-day period.23    (e) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 24determines that subsection (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) does not 25apply, then the provisional ballot is not valid and may not be 26counted. The provisional ballot envelope containing the ballot   HB1769- 28 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1cast by the provisional voter may not be opened. The county 2clerk or board of election commissioners shall write on the 3provisional ballot envelope the following: "Provisional ballot 4determined invalid.".5    (f) If the county clerk or board of election commissioners 6determines that a provisional ballot is valid under this 7Section, then the provisional ballot envelope shall be opened. 8The outside of each provisional ballot envelope shall also be 9marked to identify the precinct and the date of the election.10    (g) Provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be 11counted at the election authority's central ballot counting 12location and shall not be counted in precincts. The 13provisional ballots determined to be valid shall be added to 14the vote totals for the precincts from which they were cast in 15the order in which the ballots were opened. The validation and 16counting of provisional ballots shall be subject to the 17provisions of this Code that apply to pollwatchers. If the 18provisional ballots are a ballot of a punch card voting 19system, then the provisional ballot shall be counted in a 20manner consistent with Article 24A. If the provisional ballots 21are a ballot of optical scan or other type of approved 22electronic voting system, then the provisional ballots shall 23be counted in a manner consistent with Article 24B.24    (h) As soon as the ballots have been counted, the election 25judges or election officials shall, in the presence of the 26county clerk or board of election commissioners, place each of   HB1769- 29 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1the following items in a separate envelope or bag: (1) all 2provisional ballots, voted or spoiled; (2) all provisional 3ballot envelopes of provisional ballots voted or spoiled; and 4(3) all executed affidavits of the provisional ballots voted 5or spoiled.

The county clerk or board of election 8commissioners shall treat the provisional ballot envelope 9containing the written affidavit as a voter registration 10application for that person for the next election and process 11that application. The election judges or election officials 12shall then securely seal each envelope or bag, initial the 13envelope or bag, and plainly mark on the outside of the 14envelope or bag in ink the precinct in which the provisional 15ballots were cast. The election judges or election officials 16shall then place each sealed envelope or bag into a box, secure 17and seal it in the same manner as described in item (6) of 18subsection (b) of Section 18A-5. Each election judge or 19election official shall take and subscribe an oath before the 20county clerk or board of election commissioners that the 21election judge or election official securely kept the ballots 22and papers in the box, did not permit any person to open the 23box or otherwise touch or tamper with the ballots and papers in 24the box, and has no knowledge of any other person opening the 25box. For purposes of this Section, the term "election 26official" means the county clerk, a member of the board of   HB1769- 30 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1election commissioners, as the case may be, and their 2respective employees.3(Source: P.A. 97-766, eff. 7-6-12; 98-115, eff. 7-29-13; 498-691, eff. 7-1-14; 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 5    (10 ILCS 5/19A-35)6    Sec. 19A-35.

Any person desiring to vote and whose name is 2found upon the register of voters by the person having charge 3thereof, shall (i) present to the judges of election for 4verification of the person's identity a government-issued 5photo identification card, as defined in Section 3-8, or his 6or her Voter Identification Card, (ii) shall then be 7questioned by one of the judges as to his nativity, his term of 8residence at present address, precinct, State and United 9States, his age, whether naturalized and if so the date of 10naturalization papers and court from which secured, and (iii) 11he shall be asked to state his residence when last previously 12registered and the date of the election for which he then 13registered. The judges of elections shall check each 14application for ballot against the list of voters registered 15in that precinct to whom grace period, vote by mail, and early 16ballots have been issued for that election, which shall be 17provided by the election authority and which list shall be 18available for inspection by pollwatchers. A voter applying to 19vote in the precinct on election day whose name appears on the 20list as having been issued a grace period, vote by mail, or 21early ballot shall not be permitted to vote in the precinct, 22except that a voter to whom a vote by mail ballot was issued 23may vote in the precinct if the voter submits to the election 24judges that vote by mail ballot for cancellation. If the voter 25is unable to submit the vote by mail ballot, it shall be 26sufficient for the voter to submit to the election judges (i) a   HB1769- 11 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1portion of the vote by mail ballot if the vote by mail ballot 2was torn or mutilated or (ii) an affidavit executed before the 3election judges specifying that (A) the voter never received a 4vote by mail ballot or (B) the voter completed and returned a 5vote by mail ballot and was informed that the election 6authority did not receive that vote by mail ballot. If such 7person so registered shall be challenged as disqualified, the 8party challenging shall assign his reasons therefor, and 9thereupon one of the judges shall administer to him an oath to 10answer questions, and if he shall take the oath he shall then 11be questioned by the judge or judges touching such cause of 12challenge, and touching any other cause of disqualification. 13And he may also be questioned by the person challenging him in 14regard to his qualifications and identity. But if a majority 15of the judges are of the opinion that he is the person so 16registered and a qualified voter, his vote shall then be 17received accordingly. But if his vote be rejected by such 18judges, such person may afterward produce and deliver an 19affidavit to such judges, subscribed and sworn to by him 20before one of the judges, in which it shall be stated how long 21he has resided in such precinct, and state; that he is a 22citizen of the United States, and is a duly qualified voter in 23such precinct, and that he is the identical person so 24registered. In addition to such an affidavit, the person so 25challenged shall provide to the judges of election proof of 26residence by producing 2 forms of identification showing the   HB1769- 12 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1person's current residence address, provided that such 2identification may include a lease or contract for a residence 3and not more than one piece of mail addressed to the person at 4his current residence address and postmarked not earlier than 530 days prior to the date of the election, or the person shall 6procure a witness personally known to the judges of election, 7and resident in the precinct (or district), or who shall be 8proved by some legal voter of such precinct or district, known 9to the judges to be such, who shall take the oath following, 10viz: 11    I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am a resident of 12this election precinct (or district), and entitled to vote at 13this election, and that I have been a resident of this State 14for 30 days last past, and am well acquainted with the person 15whose vote is now offered; that he is an actual and bona fide 16resident of this election precinct (or district), and has 17resided herein 30 days, and as I verily believe, in this State, 1830 days next preceding this election. 19    The oath in each case may be administered by one of the 20judges of election, or by any officer, resident in the 21precinct or district, authorized by law to administer oaths. 22Also supported by an affidavit by a registered voter residing 23in such precinct, stating his own residence, and that he knows 24such person; and that he does reside at the place mentioned and 25has resided in such precinct and state for the length of time 26as stated by such person, which shall be subscribed and sworn   HB1769- 13 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1to in the same way. For purposes of this Section, the 2submission of a photo identification issued by a college or 3university, accompanied by either (i) a copy of the 4applicant's contract or lease for a residence or (ii) one 5piece of mail addressed to the person at his or her current 6residence address and postmarked not earlier than 30 days 7prior to the date of the election, shall be sufficient to 8establish proof of residence. Whereupon the vote of such 9person shall be received, and entered as other votes. But such 10judges, having charge of such registers, shall state in their 11respective books the facts in such case, and the affidavits, 12so delivered to the judges, shall be preserved and returned to 13the office of the commissioners of election. Blank affidavits 14of the character aforesaid shall be sent out to the judges of 15all the precincts, and the judges of election shall furnish 16the same on demand and administer the oaths without criticism. 17Such oaths, if administered by any other officer than such 18judge of election, shall not be received. Whenever a proposal 19for a constitutional amendment or for the calling of a 20constitutional convention is to be voted upon at the election, 21the separate blue ballot or ballots pertaining thereto shall 22be placed on top of the other ballots to be voted at the 23election in such manner that the legend appearing on the back 24thereof, as prescribed in Section 16-6 of this Act, shall be 25plainly visible to the voter, and in this fashion the ballots 26shall be handed to the voter by the judge.   HB1769- 14 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1    Immediately after voting, the voter shall be instructed 2whether the voting equipment, if used, accepted or rejected 3the ballot or identified the ballot as under-voted. A voter 4whose ballot is identified as under-voted for a statewide 5constitutional office may return to the voting booth and 6complete the voting of that ballot. A voter whose ballot is not 7accepted by the voting equipment may, upon surrendering the 8ballot, request and vote another ballot. The voter's 9surrendered ballot shall be initialed by the election judge 10and handled as provided in the appropriate Article governing 11that voting equipment.12    The voter shall, upon quitting the voting booth, deliver 13to one of the judges of election all of the ballots, properly 14folded, which he received. The judge of election to whom the 15voter delivers his ballots shall not accept the same unless 16all of the ballots given to the voter are returned by him. If a 17voter delivers less than all of the ballots given to him, the 18judge to whom the same are offered shall advise him in a voice 19clearly audible to the other judges of election that the voter 20must return the remainder of the ballots. The statement of the 21judge to the voter shall clearly express the fact that the 22voter is not required to vote such remaining ballots but that 23whether or not he votes them he must fold and deliver them to 24the judge. In making such statement the judge of election 25shall not indicate by word, gesture or intonation of voice 26that the unreturned ballots shall be voted in any particular   HB1769- 15 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1manner. No new voter shall be permitted to enter the voting 2booth of a voter who has failed to deliver the total number of 3ballots received by him until such voter has returned to the 4voting booth pursuant to the judge's request and again quit 5the booth with all of the ballots required to be returned by 6him. Upon receipt of all such ballots the judges of election 7shall enter the name of the voter, and his number, as above 8provided in this Section, and the judge to whom the ballots are 9delivered shall immediately put the ballots into the ballot 10box. If any voter who has failed to deliver all the ballots 11received by him refuses to return to the voting booth after 12being advised by the judge of election as herein provided, the 13judge shall inform the other judges of such refusal, and 14thereupon the ballot or ballots returned to the judge shall be 15deposited in the ballot box, the voter shall be permitted to 16depart from the polling place, and a new voter shall be 17permitted to enter the voting booth. 18    The judge of election who receives the ballot or ballots 19from the voter shall announce the residence and name of such 20voter in a loud voice. The judge shall put the ballot or 21ballots received from the voter into the ballot box in the 22presence of the voter and the judges of election, and in plain 23view of the public. The judges having charge of such registers 24shall then, in a column prepared thereon, in the same line of, 25the name of the voter, mark "Voted" or the letter "V". 26    No judge of election shall accept from any voter less than   HB1769- 16 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1the full number of ballots received by such voter without 2first advising the voter in the manner above provided of the 3necessity of returning all of the ballots, nor shall any such 4judge advise such voter in a manner contrary to that which is 5herein permitted, or in any other manner violate the 6provisions of this Section; provided, that the acceptance by a 7judge of election of less than the full number of ballots 8delivered to a voter who refuses to return to the voting booth 9after being properly advised by such judge shall not be a 10violation of this Section. 11(Source: P.A. 98-1171, eff. 6-1-15.) 12    (10 ILCS 5/18A-5)13    Sec. 18A-5.

The election 4    judge shall place the original written affidavit in a 5    self-adhesive clear plastic packing list envelope that 6    must be attached to a separate envelope marked as a 7    "provisional ballot envelope". The election judge shall 8    also place any information provided by the person who 9    casts a provisional ballot in the clear plastic packing 10    list envelope. Each county clerk or board of election 11    commissioners, as the case may be, must design, obtain or 12    procure self-adhesive clear plastic packing list envelopes 13    and provisional ballot envelopes that are suitable for 14    implementing this subsection (b)(4) of this Section.15        (5) The election judge shall provide the person with a 16    provisional ballot, written instructions for casting a 17    provisional ballot, and the provisional ballot envelope 18    with the clear plastic packing list envelope affixed to 19    it, which contains the person's original written affidavit 20    and, if any, information provided by the provisional voter 21    to support his or her claim that he or she is a duly 22    registered voter.

The provisional voter's affidavit 10    shall serve as a change of address request by that voter 11    for registration purposes for the next ensuing election if 12    it bears an address different from that in the records of 13    the election authority. Votes for federal and statewide 14    offices on a provisional ballot cast in the incorrect 15    precinct that meet the other requirements of this 16    subsection shall be valid and counted in accordance with 17    this Article. As used in this item, "federal office" is 18    defined as provided in Section 20-1 and "statewide office" 19    means the Governor, Attorney General, Secretary of State, 20    Comptroller, and Treasurer. Votes for General Assembly, 21    countywide, citywide, or township office on a provisional 22    ballot cast in the incorrect precinct but in the correct 23    legislative district, representative district, county, 24    municipality, or township, as the case may be, shall be 25    valid and counted in accordance with this Article. As used 26    in this item, "citywide office" means an office elected by   HB1769- 24 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1    the electors of an entire municipality. As used in this 2    item, "township office" means an office elected by the 3    electors of an entire township;4        (2) the affidavit executed by the provisional voter 5    pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5 contains, 6    at a minimum, the provisional voter's first and last name, 7    house number and street name, and signature or mark;8        (3) except as permitted by item (5) of subsection (b) 9    of this Section, the provisional voter is a registered 10    voter based on information available to the county clerk 11    or board of election commissioners provided by or obtained 12    from any of the following:13            i. the provisional voter;14            ii. an election judge;15            iii. the statewide voter registration database 16        maintained by the State Board of Elections;17            iv. the records of the county clerk or board of 18        election commissioners' database; or19            v. the records of the Secretary of State; and20        (4) for a provisional ballot cast under item (6) of 21    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter did not vote by 22    mail ballot in the election at which the provisional 23    ballot was cast; or 24        (5) for a provisional ballot cast under item (7) of 25    subsection (a) of Section 18A-5, the voter provides the 26    election authority with the necessary documentation within   HB1769- 25 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1    7 days of election day. 2    (c) With respect to subsection (b)(3) of this Section, the 3county clerk or board of election commissioners shall 4investigate and record whether or not the specified 5information is available from each of the 5 identified 6sources. If the information is available from one or more of 7the identified sources, then the county clerk or board of 8election commissioners shall seek to obtain the information 9from each of those sources until satisfied, with information 10from at least one of those sources, that the provisional voter 11is registered and entitled to vote. The county clerk or board 12of election commissioners shall use any information it obtains 13as the basis for determining the voter registration status of 14the provisional voter. If a conflict exists among the 15information available to the county clerk or board of election 16commissioners as to the registration status of the provisional 17voter, then the county clerk or board of election 18commissioners shall make a determination based on the totality 19of the circumstances. In a case where the above information 20equally supports or opposes the registration status of the 21voter, the county clerk or board of election commissioners 22shall decide in favor of the provisional voter as being duly 23registered to vote. If the statewide voter registration 24database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 25that the provisional voter is registered to vote, but the 26county clerk's or board of election commissioners' voter   HB1769- 26 -LRB104 07773 SPS 17818 b1registration database indicates that the provisional voter is 2not registered to vote, then the information found in the 3statewide voter registration database shall control the matter 4and the provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to 5vote. If the records of the county clerk or board of election 6commissioners indicates that the provisional voter is 7registered to vote, but the statewide voter registration 8database maintained by the State Board of Elections indicates 9that the provisional voter is not registered to vote, then the 10information found in the records of the county clerk or board 11of election commissioners shall control the matter and the 12provisional voter shall be deemed to be registered to vote. If 13the provisional voter's signature on his or her provisional 14ballot request varies from the signature on an otherwise valid 15registration application solely because of the substitution of 16initials for the first or middle name, the election authority 17may not reject the provisional ballot.18    (d) In validating the registration status of a person 19casting a provisional ballot, the county clerk or board of 20election commissioners shall not require a provisional voter 21to complete any form other than the affidavit executed by the 22provisional voter under subsection (b)(2) of Section 18A-5.
