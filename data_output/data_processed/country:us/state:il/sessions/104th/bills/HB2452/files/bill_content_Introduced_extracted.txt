In all other 19counties, the amount of the exemption is as follows: (i) 20through taxable year 2005 and for taxable year 2007 and 21thereafter, the amount of this exemption shall be the 22equalized assessed value of the residence in the taxable year 23for which application is made minus the base amount; and (ii) 24for taxable year 2006, the amount of the exemption is as 25follows:26        (1) For an applicant who has a household income of   HB2452- 23 -LRB104 03125 HLH 13146 b1    $45,000 or less, the amount of the exemption is the 2    equalized assessed value of the residence in the taxable 3    year for which application is made minus the base amount.4        (2) For an applicant who has a household income 5    exceeding $45,000 but not exceeding $46,250, the amount of 6    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 7    residence in the taxable year for which application is 8    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.8.9        (3) For an applicant who has a household income 10    exceeding $46,250 but not exceeding $47,500, the amount of 11    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 12    residence in the taxable year for which application is 13    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.6.14        (4) For an applicant who has a household income 15    exceeding $47,500 but not exceeding $48,750, the amount of 16    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 17    residence in the taxable year for which application is 18    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.4.19        (5) For an applicant who has a household income 20    exceeding $48,750 but not exceeding $50,000, the amount of 21    the exemption is (i) the equalized assessed value of the 22    residence in the taxable year for which application is 23    made minus the base amount (ii) multiplied by 0.2. 24    When the applicant is a surviving spouse of an applicant 25for a prior year for the same residence for which an exemption 26under this Section has been granted, the base year and base   HB2452- 24 -LRB104 03125 HLH 13146 b1amount for that residence are the same as for the applicant for 2the prior year.3    Each year at the time the assessment books are certified 4to the County Clerk, the Board of Review or Board of Appeals 5shall give to the County Clerk a list of the assessed values of 6improvements on each parcel qualifying for this exemption that 7were added after the base year for this parcel and that 8increased the assessed value of the property.9    In the case of land improved with an apartment building 10owned and operated as a cooperative or a building that is a 11life care facility that qualifies as a cooperative, the 12maximum reduction from the equalized assessed value of the 13property is limited to the sum of the reductions calculated 14for each unit occupied as a residence by a person or persons 15(i) 65 years of age or older, (ii) with a household income that 16does not exceed the maximum income limitation, (iii) who is 17liable, by contract with the owner or owners of record, for 18paying real property taxes on the property, and (iv) who is an 19owner of record of a legal or equitable interest in the 20cooperative apartment building, other than a leasehold 21interest. In the instance of a cooperative where a homestead 22exemption has been granted under this Section, the cooperative 23association or its management firm shall credit the savings 24resulting from that exemption only to the apportioned tax 25liability of the owner who qualified for the exemption. Any 26person who willfully refuses to credit that savings to an   HB2452- 25 -LRB104 03125 HLH 13146 b1owner who qualifies for the exemption is guilty of a Class B 2misdemeanor.3    When a homestead exemption has been granted under this 4Section and an applicant then becomes a resident of a facility 5licensed under the Assisted Living and Shared Housing Act, the 6Nursing Home Care Act, the Specialized Mental Health 7Rehabilitation Act of 2013, the ID/DD Community Care Act, or 8the MC/DD Act, the exemption shall be granted in subsequent 9years so long as the residence (i) continues to be occupied by 10the qualified applicant's spouse or (ii) if remaining 11unoccupied, is still owned by the qualified applicant for the 12homestead exemption.13    Beginning January 1, 1997, when an individual dies who 14would have qualified for an exemption under this Section, and 15the surviving spouse does not independently qualify for this 16exemption because of age, the exemption under this Section 17shall be granted to the surviving spouse for the taxable year 18preceding and the taxable year of the death, provided that, 19except for age, the surviving spouse meets all other 20qualifications for the granting of this exemption for those 21years.22    When married persons maintain separate residences, the 23exemption provided for in this Section may be claimed by only 24one of such persons and for only one residence.25    For taxable year 1994 only, in counties having less than 263,000,000 inhabitants, to receive the exemption, a person   HB2452- 26 -LRB104 03125 HLH 13146 b1shall submit an application by February 15, 1995 to the Chief 2County Assessment Officer of the county in which the property 3is located.

Each 2application shall contain or be verified by a written 3declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury. A 4taxpayer's signing a fraudulent application under this Act is 5perjury, as defined in Section 32-2 of the Criminal Code of 62012. The applications shall be clearly marked as applications 7for the Low-Income Senior Citizens Assessment Freeze Homestead 8Exemption and must contain a notice that any taxpayer who 9receives the exemption is subject to an audit by the Chief 10County Assessment Officer.11    Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, in 12counties having fewer than 3,000,000 inhabitants, if an 13applicant fails to file the application required by this 14Section in a timely manner and this failure to file is due to a 15mental or physical condition sufficiently severe so as to 16render the applicant incapable of filing the application in a 17timely manner, the Chief County Assessment Officer may extend 18the filing deadline for a period of 30 days after the applicant 19regains the capability to file the application, but in no case 20may the filing deadline be extended beyond 3 months of the 21original filing deadline.
