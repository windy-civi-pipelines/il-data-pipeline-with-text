Subject to the approval of 10such amendments, the Department shall extend the provisions of 11Section 5-4 of the Illinois Public Aid Code to persons who, but 12for the provision of home or community-based services, would 13require the level of care provided in an institution, as is 14provided for in federal law. Those persons no longer found to 15be eligible for receiving noninstitutional services due to 16changes in the eligibility criteria shall be given 45 days 17notice prior to actual termination.

The target population identified for the 21purposes of this Section are persons age 60 and older with an 22identified service need. Priority shall be given to those who 23are at imminent risk of institutionalization. The services 24shall be provided to eligible persons age 60 and older to the 25extent that the cost of the services together with the other 26personal maintenance expenses of the persons are reasonably   SB1845- 4 -LRB104 10567 KTG 20643 b1related to the standards established for care in a group 2facility appropriate to the person's condition.

The Illinois Act on the Aging is amended by 5changing Section 4.02 as follows: 6    (20 ILCS 105/4.02)7    Sec. 4.02. Community Care Program. The Department shall 8establish a program of services to prevent unnecessary 9institutionalization of persons age 60 and older in need of 10long term care or who are established as persons who suffer 11from Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder under the 12Alzheimer's Disease Assistance Act, thereby enabling them to 13remain in their own homes or in other living arrangements. 14Such preventive services, which may be coordinated with other 15programs for the aged, may include, but are not limited to, any 16or all of the following:17        (a) (blank);18        (b) (blank);19        (c) home care aide services;20        (d) personal assistant services;21        (e) adult day services;22        (f) home-delivered meals;23        (g) education in self-care;  SB1845- 2 -LRB104 10567 KTG 20643 b1        (h) personal care services;2        (i) adult day health services;3        (j) habilitation services;4        (k) respite care;5        (k-5) community reintegration services; 6        (k-6) flexible senior services;7        (k-7) medication management;8        (k-8) emergency home response; 9        (l) other nonmedical social services that may enable 10    the person to become self-supporting; or11        (m) (blank).12    The Department shall establish eligibility standards for 13such services. In determining the amount and nature of 14services for which a person may qualify, consideration shall 15not be given to the value of cash, property, or other assets 16held in the name of the person's spouse pursuant to a written 17agreement dividing marital property into equal but separate 18shares or pursuant to a transfer of the person's interest in a 19home to his spouse, provided that the spouse's share of the 20marital property is not made available to the person seeking 21such services.22    The Department shall require as a condition of eligibility 23that all new financially eligible applicants apply for and 24enroll in medical assistance under Article V of the Illinois 25Public Aid Code in accordance with rules promulgated by the 26Department.   SB1845- 3 -LRB104 10567 KTG 20643 b1    The Department shall, in conjunction with the Department 2of Public Aid (now Department of Healthcare and Family 3Services), seek appropriate amendments under Sections 1915 and 41924 of the Social Security Act.

Subject to the approval of 10such amendments, the Department shall extend the provisions of 11Section 5-4 of the Illinois Public Aid Code to persons who, but 12for the provision of home or community-based services, would 13require the level of care provided in an institution, as is 14provided for in federal law. Those persons no longer found to 15be eligible for receiving noninstitutional services due to 16changes in the eligibility criteria shall be given 45 days 17notice prior to actual termination. Those persons receiving 18notice of termination may contact the Department and request 19the determination be appealed at any time during the 45 day 20notice period. The target population identified for the 21purposes of this Section are persons age 60 and older with an 22identified service need. Priority shall be given to those who 23are at imminent risk of institutionalization. The services 24shall be provided to eligible persons age 60 and older to the 25extent that the cost of the services together with the other 26personal maintenance expenses of the persons are reasonably   SB1845- 4 -LRB104 10567 KTG 20643 b1related to the standards established for care in a group 2facility appropriate to the person's condition. These 3noninstitutional non-institutional services, pilot projects, 4or experimental facilities may be provided as part of or in 5addition to those authorized by federal law or those funded 6and administered by the Department of Human Services. The 7Departments of Human Services, Healthcare and Family Services, 8Public Health, Veterans' Affairs, and Commerce and Economic 9Opportunity and other appropriate agencies of State, federal, 10and local governments shall cooperate with the Department on 11Aging in the establishment and development of the 12noninstitutional non-institutional services.

The audit is a public record under the 20Freedom of Information Act. The Department shall execute, 21relative to the nursing home prescreening project, written 22inter-agency agreements with the Department of Human Services 23and the Department of Healthcare and Family Services, to 24effect the following: (1) intake procedures and common 25eligibility criteria for those persons who are receiving 26noninstitutional non-institutional services; and (2) the   SB1845- 5 -LRB104 10567 KTG 20643 b1establishment and development of noninstitutional 2non-institutional services in areas of the State where they 3are not currently available or are undeveloped.
