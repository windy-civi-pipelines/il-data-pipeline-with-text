This may include a government regulation 13    combined with a private remedy including third-party or 14    consumer-created ratings and reviews, or private 15    certification.16    (h) The designated staff's recommendation shall include a 17written analysis of the need for the occupational regulation 18and shall address the following:19        (1) each factor in paragraph (5) of subsection (b), 20    including the effects of the legislation on opportunities 21    for workers, consumer choices, costs and benefits, general 22    unemployment, market competition, governmental costs, and 23    any other perceived effects;24        (2) the type of occupational regulation recommended, 25    if any, including the proper scope of practice for the 26    occupation and the requisite personal qualifications;  HB3651- 12 -LRB104 10372 AAS 20447 b1        (3) penalties for violating the proposed regulation; 2    and3        (4) whether the legislation requires the creation of a 4    new board and how much responsibility the legislation 5    delegates to a licensing board or agency, including 6    whether the board or agency would have to promulgate rules 7    and have increased costs to regulate the occupation.8    (i) The designated staff shall have a minimum of 9 months 9from receipt of the Pre-Regulatory Impact Application to 10complete the analysis and issue the Pre-Regulatory Impact 11Assessment.12    (j) The Pre-Regulatory Impact Assessment shall be 13considered with the applicable legislation when it is 14considered by the relevant legislative committees and the 15General Assembly. 16    Section 25.

If evidence of such unmanageable harm is 14found, the designated staff will recommend the least 15restrictive government regulation to address the harm, as 16listed in paragraphs (5) through (11) of subsection (g) of 17this Section.18    (g) For any harm under subsection (f), the designated 19staff shall use the following guidelines to form the 20recommendation in the Pre-Regulatory Impact Assessment:21        (1) If the harm arises from contractual disputes, 22    including pricing disputes, staff may recommend enacting a 23    specific civil cause of action in small-claims court or 24    district court to remedy consumer harm. This cause of 25    action may provide for reimbursement of the attorney's 26    fees or court costs, if a consumer's claim is successful;  HB3651- 10 -LRB104 10372 AAS 20447 b1        (2) If the harm arises from fraud, staff may recommend 2    strengthening powers under the state's deceptive trade 3    practices acts or requiring disclosures that will reduce 4    misleading attributes of the specific good or service;5        (3) If the harm arises from general health and safety 6    risks, staff may recommend enacting a regulation on the 7    related process or requiring a facility license;8        (4) If the harm arises from unclean facilities, staff 9    may recommend requiring periodic facility inspections;10        (5) If the harm arises from a provider's failure to 11    complete a contract fully or to standards, staff may 12    recommend requiring the provider to be bonded;13        (6) If the harm arises from a lack of protection for a 14    person who is not a party to a contract between providers 15    and consumers, staff may recommend requiring the provider 16    have insurance;17        (7) If the harm arises from transactions with 18    transient, out-of-state, or fly-by-night providers, staff 19    may recommend requiring the provider register its business 20    with the secretary of state;21        (8) If the harm arises from a shortfall or imbalance 22    in the consumer's knowledge about the good or service 23    relative to the provider's knowledge, staff may recommend 24    enacting government certification;25        (9) If the harm arises from an inability to qualify 26    providers of new or highly-specialized medical services   HB3651- 11 -LRB104 10372 AAS 20447 b1    for reimbursement by the state, staff may recommend 2    enacting a specialty certification solely for medical 3    reimbursement;4        (10) If the harm arises from a systematic information 5    shortfall in which a reasonable consumer of the service is 6    permanently unable to distinguish between the quality of 7    providers and there is an absence of institutions that 8    provide guidance to consumers, staff may recommend 9    enacting an occupational license; and10        (11) If the harm arises from the need to address 11    multiple types of harm, staff may recommend a combination 12    of regulations. This may include a government regulation 13    combined with a private remedy including third-party or 14    consumer-created ratings and reviews, or private 15    certification.16    (h) The designated staff's recommendation shall include a 17written analysis of the need for the occupational regulation 18and shall address the following:19        (1) each factor in paragraph (5) of subsection (b), 20    including the effects of the legislation on opportunities 21    for workers, consumer choices, costs and benefits, general 22    unemployment, market competition, governmental costs, and 23    any other perceived effects;24        (2) the type of occupational regulation recommended, 25    if any, including the proper scope of practice for the 26    occupation and the requisite personal qualifications;  HB3651- 12 -LRB104 10372 AAS 20447 b1        (3) penalties for violating the proposed regulation; 2    and3        (4) whether the legislation requires the creation of a 4    new board and how much responsibility the legislation 5    delegates to a licensing board or agency, including 6    whether the board or agency would have to promulgate rules 7    and have increased costs to regulate the occupation.8    (i) The designated staff shall have a minimum of 9 months 9from receipt of the Pre-Regulatory Impact Application to 10complete the analysis and issue the Pre-Regulatory Impact 11Assessment.12    (j) The Pre-Regulatory Impact Assessment shall be 13considered with the applicable legislation when it is 14considered by the relevant legislative committees and the 15General Assembly. 16    Section 25. Temporary moratorium on the creation of new 17occupational regulations.18    (a) Except as provided for in subsection (d) of this 19Section, beginning January 1, 2026, no Pre-Regulatory Impact 20Application shall be submitted and the General Assembly shall 21not consider legislation governed by this Act until January 1, 222027.23    (b) Beginning January 1, 2026, a political subdivision 24shall promulgate rules imposing new licensure requirements 25until the moratorium in this Section is repealed.  HB3651- 13 -LRB104 10372 AAS 20447 b1    (c) The moratorium in this Section shall be repealed on 2January 1, 2027 unless otherwise extended by the General 3Assembly.4    (d) A political subdivision may initiate a Pre-Regulatory 5Impact Application during the moratorium period if it can 6provide evidence of significant and discernible harm related 7to the unregulated practice of the occupation. 8    Section 97.
