However, for taxable years ending on or after 23    December 31, 1986, net operating loss carryforwards from 24    taxable years ending prior to December 31, 1986, may not 25    exceed the sum of federal taxable income for the taxable   HB1750- 101 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1    year before net operating loss deduction, plus the excess 2    of addition modifications over subtraction modifications 3    for the taxable year. For taxable years ending prior to 4    December 31, 1986, taxable income may never be an amount 5    in excess of the net operating loss for the taxable year as 6    defined in subsections (c) and (d) of Section 172 of the 7    Internal Revenue Code, provided that when taxable income 8    of a corporation (other than a Subchapter S corporation), 9    trust, or estate is less than zero and addition 10    modifications, other than those provided by subparagraph 11    (E) of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) for corporations or 12    subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of subsection (c) for 13    trusts and estates, exceed subtraction modifications, an 14    addition modification must be made under those 15    subparagraphs for any other taxable year to which the 16    taxable income less than zero (net operating loss) is 17    applied under Section 172 of the Internal Revenue Code or 18    under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection 19    (e) applied in conjunction with Section 172 of the 20    Internal Revenue Code.21        (2) Special rule. For purposes of paragraph (1) of 22    this subsection, the taxable income properly reportable 23    for federal income tax purposes shall mean:24            (A) Certain life insurance companies. In the case 25        of a life insurance company subject to the tax imposed 26        by Section 801 of the Internal Revenue Code, life   HB1750- 102 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1        insurance company taxable income, plus the amount of 2        distribution from pre-1984 policyholder surplus 3        accounts as calculated under Section 815a of the 4        Internal Revenue Code;5            (B) Certain other insurance companies.

In the case of 14        a real estate investment trust subject to the tax 15        imposed by Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code, 16        real estate investment trust taxable income;17            (E) Consolidated corporations. In the case of a 18        corporation which is a member of an affiliated group 19        of corporations filing a consolidated income tax 20        return for the taxable year for federal income tax 21        purposes, taxable income determined as if such 22        corporation had filed a separate return for federal 23        income tax purposes for the taxable year and each 24        preceding taxable year for which it was a member of an 25        affiliated group. For purposes of this subparagraph, 26        the taxpayer's separate taxable income shall be   HB1750- 103 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1        determined as if the election provided by Section 2        243(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code had been in 3        effect for all such years;4            (F) Cooperatives. In the case of a cooperative 5        corporation or association, the taxable income of such 6        organization determined in accordance with the 7        provisions of Section 1381 through 1388 of the 8        Internal Revenue Code, but without regard to the 9        prohibition against offsetting losses from patronage 10        activities against income from nonpatronage 11        activities; except that a cooperative corporation or 12        association may make an election to follow its federal 13        income tax treatment of patronage losses and 14        nonpatronage losses. In the event such election is 15        made, such losses shall be computed and carried over 16        in a manner consistent with subsection (a) of Section 17        207 of this Act and apportioned by the apportionment 18        factor reported by the cooperative on its Illinois 19        income tax return filed for the taxable year in which 20        the losses are incurred. The election shall be 21        effective for all taxable years with original returns 22        due on or after the date of the election. In addition, 23        the cooperative may file an amended return or returns, 24        as allowed under this Act, to provide that the 25        election shall be effective for losses incurred or 26        carried forward for taxable years occurring prior to   HB1750- 104 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1        the date of the election. Once made, the election may 2        only be revoked upon approval of the Director. The 3        Department shall adopt rules setting forth 4        requirements for documenting the elections and any 5        resulting Illinois net loss and the standards to be 6        used by the Director in evaluating requests to revoke 7        elections. Public Act 96-932 is declaratory of 8        existing law; 9            (G) Subchapter S corporations. In the case of: (i) 10        a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 11        effect an election for the taxable year under Section 12        1362 of the Internal Revenue Code, the taxable income 13        of such corporation determined in accordance with 14        Section 1363(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, except 15        that taxable income shall take into account those 16        items which are required by Section 1363(b)(1) of the 17        Internal Revenue Code to be separately stated; and 18        (ii) a Subchapter S corporation for which there is in 19        effect a federal election to opt out of the provisions 20        of the Subchapter S Revision Act of 1982 and have 21        applied instead the prior federal Subchapter S rules 22        as in effect on July 1, 1982, the taxable income of 23        such corporation determined in accordance with the 24        federal Subchapter S rules as in effect on July 1, 25        1982; and26            (H) Partnerships. In the case of a partnership,   HB1750- 105 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1        taxable income determined in accordance with Section 2        703 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that taxable 3        income shall take into account those items which are 4        required by Section 703(a)(1) to be separately stated 5        but which would be taken into account by an individual 6        in calculating his taxable income.7        (3) Recapture of business expenses on disposition of 8    asset or business. Notwithstanding any other law to the 9    contrary, if in prior years income from an asset or 10    business has been classified as business income and in a 11    later year is demonstrated to be non-business income, then 12    all expenses, without limitation, deducted in such later 13    year and in the 2 immediately preceding taxable years 14    related to that asset or business that generated the 15    non-business income shall be added back and recaptured as 16    business income in the year of the disposition of the 17    asset or business. Such amount shall be apportioned to 18    Illinois using the greater of the apportionment fraction 19    computed for the business under Section 304 of this Act 20    for the taxable year or the average of the apportionment 21    fractions computed for the business under Section 304 of 22    this Act for the taxable year and for the 2 immediately 23    preceding taxable years.  24    (f) Valuation limitation amount.25        (1) In general. The valuation limitation amount   HB1750- 106 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1    referred to in subsections (a)(2)(G), (c)(2)(I) and 2    (d)(2)(E) is an amount equal to:3            (A) The sum of the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 4        amounts (to the extent consisting of gain reportable 5        under the provisions of Section 1245 or 1250 of the 6        Internal Revenue Code) for all property in respect of 7        which such gain was reported for the taxable year; 8        plus9            (B) The lesser of (i) the sum of the pre-August 1, 10        1969 appreciation amounts (to the extent consisting of 11        capital gain) for all property in respect of which 12        such gain was reported for federal income tax purposes 13        for the taxable year, or (ii) the net capital gain for 14        the taxable year, reduced in either case by any amount 15        of such gain included in the amount determined under 16        subsection (a)(2)(F) or (c)(2)(H).17        (2) Pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation amount.18            (A) If the fair market value of property referred 19        to in paragraph (1) was readily ascertainable on 20        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 21        amount for such property is the lesser of (i) the 22        excess of such fair market value over the taxpayer's 23        basis (for determining gain) for such property on that 24        date (determined under the Internal Revenue Code as in 25        effect on that date), or (ii) the total gain realized 26        and reportable for federal income tax purposes in   HB1750- 107 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1        respect of the sale, exchange or other disposition of 2        such property.3            (B) If the fair market value of property referred 4        to in paragraph (1) was not readily ascertainable on 5        August 1, 1969, the pre-August 1, 1969 appreciation 6        amount for such property is that amount which bears 7        the same ratio to the total gain reported in respect of 8        the property for federal income tax purposes for the 9        taxable year, as the number of full calendar months in 10        that part of the taxpayer's holding period for the 11        property ending July 31, 1969 bears to the number of 12        full calendar months in the taxpayer's entire holding 13        period for the property.14            (C) The Department shall prescribe such 15        regulations as may be necessary to carry out the 16        purposes of this paragraph. 17    (g) Double deductions. Unless specifically provided 18otherwise, nothing in this Section shall permit the same item 19to be deducted more than once. 20    (h) Legislative intention. Except as expressly provided by 21this Section there shall be no modifications or limitations on 22the amounts of income, gain, loss or deduction taken into 23account in determining gross income, adjusted gross income or 24taxable income for federal income tax purposes for the taxable   HB1750- 108 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1year, or in the amount of such items entering into the 2computation of base income and net income under this Act for 3such taxable year, whether in respect of property values as of 4August 1, 1969 or otherwise.5(Source: P.A. 102-16, eff. 6-17-21; 102-558, eff. 8-20-21; 6102-658, eff. 8-27-21; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 102-1112, eff. 712-21-22; 103-8, eff. 6-7-23; 103-478, eff. 1-1-24; 103-592, 8Article 10, Section 10-900, eff. 6-7-24; 103-592, Article 170, 9Section 170-90, eff. 6-7-24; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24; 103-647, 10eff. 7-1-24; revised 8-20-24.) 11    Section 99.

The addition modification 20        required by this subparagraph shall be reduced to the 21        extent that dividends were included in base income of 22        the unitary group for the same taxable year and 23        received by the taxpayer or by a member of the 24        taxpayer's unitary business group (including amounts 25        included in gross income under Sections 951 through 26        964 of the Internal Revenue Code and amounts included   HB1750- 5 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1        in gross income under Section 78 of the Internal 2        Revenue Code) with respect to the stock of the same 3        person to whom the interest was paid, accrued, or 4        incurred.5            This paragraph shall not apply to the following: 6                (i) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 7            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person who 8            is subject in a foreign country or state, other 9            than a state which requires mandatory unitary 10            reporting, to a tax on or measured by net income 11            with respect to such interest; or12                (ii) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 13            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 14            the taxpayer can establish, based on a 15            preponderance of the evidence, both of the 16            following:17                    (a) the person, during the same taxable 18                year, paid, accrued, or incurred, the interest 19                to a person that is not a related member, and20                    (b) the transaction giving rise to the 21                interest expense between the taxpayer and the 22                person did not have as a principal purpose the 23                avoidance of Illinois income tax, and is paid 24                pursuant to a contract or agreement that 25                reflects an arm's-length interest rate and 26                terms; or   HB1750- 6 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1                (iii) the taxpayer can establish, based on 2            clear and convincing evidence, that the interest 3            paid, accrued, or incurred relates to a contract 4            or agreement entered into at arm's-length rates 5            and terms and the principal purpose for the 6            payment is not federal or Illinois tax avoidance; 7            or 8                (iv) an item of interest paid, accrued, or 9            incurred, directly or indirectly, to a person if 10            the taxpayer establishes by clear and convincing 11            evidence that the adjustments are unreasonable; or 12            if the taxpayer and the Director agree in writing 13            to the application or use of an alternative method 14            of apportionment under Section 304(f). 15                Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the 16            Director from making any other adjustment 17            otherwise allowed under Section 404 of this Act 18            for any tax year beginning after the effective 19            date of this amendment provided such adjustment is 20            made pursuant to regulation adopted by the 21            Department and such regulations provide methods 22            and standards by which the Department will utilize 23            its authority under Section 404 of this Act; 24            (D-18) An amount equal to the amount of intangible 25        expenses and costs otherwise allowed as a deduction in 26        computing base income, and that were paid, accrued, or   HB1750- 7 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1        incurred, directly or indirectly, (i) for taxable 2        years ending on or after December 31, 2004, to a 3        foreign person who would be a member of the same 4        unitary business group but for the fact that the 5        foreign person's business activity outside the United 6        States is 80% or more of that person's total business 7        activity and (ii) for taxable years ending on or after 8        December 31, 2008, to a person who would be a member of 9        the same unitary business group but for the fact that 10        the person is prohibited under Section 1501(a)(27) 11        from being included in the unitary business group 12        because he or she is ordinarily required to apportion 13        business income under different subsections of Section 14        304. The addition modification required by this 15        subparagraph shall be reduced to the extent that 16        dividends were included in base income of the unitary 17        group for the same taxable year and received by the 18        taxpayer or by a member of the taxpayer's unitary 19        business group (including amounts included in gross 20        income under Sections 951 through 964 of the Internal 21        Revenue Code and amounts included in gross income 22        under Section 78 of the Internal Revenue Code) with 23        respect to the stock of the same person to whom the 24        intangible expenses and costs were directly or 25        indirectly paid, incurred, or accrued. The preceding 26        sentence does not apply to the extent that the same   HB1750- 8 -LRB104 06073 HLH 16106 b1        dividends caused a reduction to the addition 2        modification required under Section 203(a)(2)(D-17) of 3        this Act.
