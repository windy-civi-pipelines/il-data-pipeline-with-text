If the technician determines that 2    the vehicle speed was not determined by a calibrated, 3    certified speed equipment device based upon the speed 4    equipment documentation, or if the vehicle was an 5    emergency vehicle, a citation may not be issued. The 6    automated speed enforcement ordinance shall require that 7    all determinations by a technician that a violation 8    occurred be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement 9    officer or retired law enforcement officer of the 10    municipality issuing the violation or by an additional 11    fully trained reviewing technician who is not employed by 12    the contractor who employs the technician who made the 13    initial determination. Routine and independent calibration 14    of the speeds produced by automated speed enforcement 15    systems and equipment shall be conducted annually by a 16    qualified technician. Speeds produced by an automated 17    speed enforcement system shall be compared with speeds 18    produced by lidar or other independent equipment. Radar or 19    lidar equipment shall undergo an internal validation test 20    no less frequently than once each week. Qualified 21    technicians shall test loop-based equipment no less 22    frequently than once a year.

Radar equipment shall be checked with the   SB1251- 8 -LRB104 05681 LNS 15711 b1    internal frequency generator and the internal circuit test 2    whenever the radar is turned on. Technicians must be alert 3    for any unusual or suspect readings, and if unusual or 4    suspect readings of a radar unit persist, that unit shall 5    immediately be removed from service and not returned to 6    service until it has been checked by a qualified 7    technician and determined to be functioning properly. 8    Documentation of the annual calibration results, including 9    the equipment tested, test date, technician performing the 10    test, and test results, shall be maintained and available 11    for use in the determination of an automated speed 12    enforcement system violation and issuance of a citation. 13    The technician performing the calibration and testing of 14    the automated speed enforcement equipment shall be trained 15    and certified in the use of equipment for speed 16    enforcement purposes. Training on the speed enforcement 17    equipment may be conducted by law enforcement, civilian, 18    or manufacturer's personnel and if applicable may be 19    equivalent to the equipment use and operations training 20    included in the Speed Measuring Device Operator Program 21    developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety 22    Administration (NHTSA). The vendor or technician who 23    performs the work shall keep accurate records on each 24    piece of equipment the technician calibrates and tests. As 25    used in this paragraph, "fully trained reviewing 26    technician" means a person who has received at least 40   SB1251- 9 -LRB104 05681 LNS 15711 b1    hours of supervised training in subjects which shall 2    include image inspection and interpretation, the elements 3    necessary to prove a violation, license plate 4    identification, and traffic safety and management.

An order issued 25    after the hearing is a final administrative decision 26    within the meaning of Section 3-101 of the Code of Civil   SB1251- 18 -LRB104 05681 LNS 15711 b1    Procedure.2        (4) A post immobilization and post-towing notice 3    advising the registered owner of the vehicle of the right 4    to a hearing to challenge the validity of the impoundment.5    (d) Judicial review of final determinations of parking, 6standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or 7automated traffic law violations and final administrative 8decisions issued after hearings regarding vehicle 9immobilization and impoundment made under this Section shall 10be subject to the provisions of the Administrative Review Law.11    (e) Any fine, penalty, incomplete traffic education 12program, or part of any fine or any penalty remaining unpaid 13after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, 14administrative remedies created under this Section and the 15conclusion of any judicial review procedures shall be a debt 16due and owing the municipality or county and, as such, may be 17collected in accordance with applicable law. Completion of any 18required traffic education program and payment in full of any 19fine or penalty resulting from a standing, parking, 20compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated 21traffic law violation shall constitute a final disposition of 22that violation. 23    (f) After the expiration of the period within which 24judicial review may be sought for a final determination of 25parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement 26system, or automated traffic law violation, the municipality   SB1251- 19 -LRB104 05681 LNS 15711 b1or county may commence a proceeding in the Circuit Court for 2purposes of obtaining a judgment on the final determination of 3violation. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a 4municipality or county from consolidating multiple final 5determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated 6speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations 7against a person in a proceeding.

If the technician determines that 2    the vehicle speed was not determined by a calibrated, 3    certified speed equipment device based upon the speed 4    equipment documentation, or if the vehicle was an 5    emergency vehicle, a citation may not be issued. The 6    automated speed enforcement ordinance shall require that 7    all determinations by a technician that a violation 8    occurred be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement 9    officer or retired law enforcement officer of the 10    municipality issuing the violation or by an additional 11    fully trained reviewing technician who is not employed by 12    the contractor who employs the technician who made the 13    initial determination. Routine and independent calibration 14    of the speeds produced by automated speed enforcement 15    systems and equipment shall be conducted annually by a 16    qualified technician. Speeds produced by an automated 17    speed enforcement system shall be compared with speeds 18    produced by lidar or other independent equipment. Radar or 19    lidar equipment shall undergo an internal validation test 20    no less frequently than once each week. Qualified 21    technicians shall test loop-based equipment no less 22    frequently than once a year. Radar equipment shall be 23    checked for accuracy by a qualified technician when the 24    unit is serviced, when unusual or suspect readings 25    persist, or when deemed necessary by a reviewing 26    technician. Radar equipment shall be checked with the   SB1251- 8 -LRB104 05681 LNS 15711 b1    internal frequency generator and the internal circuit test 2    whenever the radar is turned on. Technicians must be alert 3    for any unusual or suspect readings, and if unusual or 4    suspect readings of a radar unit persist, that unit shall 5    immediately be removed from service and not returned to 6    service until it has been checked by a qualified 7    technician and determined to be functioning properly. 8    Documentation of the annual calibration results, including 9    the equipment tested, test date, technician performing the 10    test, and test results, shall be maintained and available 11    for use in the determination of an automated speed 12    enforcement system violation and issuance of a citation. 13    The technician performing the calibration and testing of 14    the automated speed enforcement equipment shall be trained 15    and certified in the use of equipment for speed 16    enforcement purposes. Training on the speed enforcement 17    equipment may be conducted by law enforcement, civilian, 18    or manufacturer's personnel and if applicable may be 19    equivalent to the equipment use and operations training 20    included in the Speed Measuring Device Operator Program 21    developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety 22    Administration (NHTSA). The vendor or technician who 23    performs the work shall keep accurate records on each 24    piece of equipment the technician calibrates and tests. As 25    used in this paragraph, "fully trained reviewing 26    technician" means a person who has received at least 40   SB1251- 9 -LRB104 05681 LNS 15711 b1    hours of supervised training in subjects which shall 2    include image inspection and interpretation, the elements 3    necessary to prove a violation, license plate 4    identification, and traffic safety and management. In all 5    municipalities and counties, the automated speed 6    enforcement system or automated traffic law ordinance 7    shall require that no additional fee shall be charged to 8    the alleged violator for exercising his or her right to an 9    administrative hearing, and persons shall be given at 10    least 25 days following an administrative hearing to pay 11    any civil penalty imposed by a finding that Section 12    11-208.6, 11-208.8, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a similar 13    local ordinance has been violated.
