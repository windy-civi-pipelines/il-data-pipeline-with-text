On July 221, 2022 and on July 1 of each year thereafter, the Agency shall 23determine the available amount of resources in the Fund that 24can be allocated to the activities identified under this 25Section and shall allocate the moneys accordingly.26    Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the Lead   HB3855- 22 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b1Service Line Replacement Fund is not subject to sweeps, 2administrative charge-backs, or any other fiscal maneuver that 3would in any way transfer any amounts from the Lead Service 4Line Replacement Fund into any other fund of the State.5    (cc) Within one year after January 1, 2022 (the effective 6date of Public Act 102-613), the Agency shall design rules for 7a program for the purpose of administering lead service line 8replacement funds. The rules must, at minimum, contain:9        (1) the process by which community water supplies may 10    apply for funding; and11        (2) the criteria for determining unit of local 12    government eligibility and prioritization for funding, 13    including the prevalence of low-income households, as 14    measured by median household income, the prevalence of 15    lead service lines, and the prevalence of water samples 16    that demonstrate elevated levels of lead.17    (dd) Funding under subsection (cc) shall be available for 18costs directly attributable to the planning, design, or 19construction directly related to the replacement of lead 20service lines and restoration of property.21    Funding shall not be used for the general operating 22expenses of a municipality or community water supply. 23    (ee) An owner or operator of any community water supply 24receiving grant funding under subsection (cc) shall bear the 25entire expense of full lead service line replacement for all 26lead service lines in the scope of the grant.   HB3855- 23 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b1    (ff) When replacing a lead service line, the owner or 2operator of the community water supply shall replace the 3service line in its entirety, including, but not limited to, 4any portion of the service line (i) running on private 5property and (ii) within the building's plumbing at the first 6shut-off valve. Partial lead service line replacements are 7expressly prohibited. Exceptions shall be made under the 8following circumstances: 9        (1) In the event of an emergency repair that affects a 10    lead service line or a suspected lead service line, a 11    community water supply must contact the building owner to 12    begin the process of replacing the entire service line. If 13    the building owner is not able to be contacted or the 14    building owner or occupant refuses to grant access and 15    permission to replace the entire service line at the time 16    of the emergency repair, then the community water supply 17    may perform a partial lead service line replacement. Where 18    an emergency repair on a service line constructed of lead 19    or galvanized steel pipe results in a partial service line 20    replacement, the water supply responsible for commencing 21    the repair shall perform the following: 22            (A) Notify the building's owner or operator and 23        the resident or residents served by the lead service 24        line in writing that a repair has been completed. The 25        notification shall include, at a minimum:26                (i) a warning that the work may result in   HB3855- 24 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b1            sediment, possibly containing lead, in the 2            building's water supply system;3                (ii) information concerning practices for 4            preventing the consumption of any lead in drinking 5            water, including a recommendation to flush water 6            distribution pipe during and after the completion 7            of the repair or replacement work and to clean 8            faucet aerator screens; and9                (iii) information regarding the dangers of 10            lead to young children and pregnant women. 11            (B) Provide filters for at least one fixture 12        supplying potable water for consumption. The filter 13        must be certified by an accredited third-party 14        certification body to NSF/ANSI 53 and NSF/ANSI 42 for 15        the reduction of lead and particulate. The filter must 16        be provided until such time that the remaining 17        portions of the service line have been replaced with a 18        material approved by the Department or a waiver has 19        been issued under subsection (ii).20            (C) Replace the remaining portion of the lead 21        service line within 30 days of the repair, or 120 days 22        in the event of weather or other circumstances beyond 23        reasonable control that prohibits construction. If a 24        complete lead service line replacement cannot be made 25        within the required period, the community water supply 26        responsible for commencing the repair shall notify the   HB3855- 25 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b1        Department in writing, at a minimum, of the following 2        within 24 hours of the repair: 3                (i) an explanation of why it is not feasible 4            to replace the remaining portion of the lead 5            service line within the allotted time; and6                (ii) a timeline for when the remaining portion 7            of the lead service line will be replaced. 8            (D) If complete repair of a lead service line 9        cannot be completed due to denial by the property 10        owner, the community water supply commencing the 11        repair shall request the affected property owner to 12        sign a waiver developed by the Department. If a 13        property owner of a nonresidential building or 14        residence operating as rental properties denies a 15        complete lead service line replacement, the property 16        owner shall be responsible for installing and 17        maintaining point-of-use filters certified by an 18        accredited third-party certification body to NSF/ANSI 19        53 and NSF/ANSI 42 for the reduction of lead and 20        particulate at all fixtures intended to supply water 21        for the purposes of drinking, food preparation, or 22        making baby formula. The filters shall continue to be 23        supplied by the property owner until such time that 24        the property owner has affected the remaining portions 25        of the lead service line to be replaced.26            (E) Document any remaining lead service line,   HB3855- 26 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b1        including a portion on the private side of the 2        property, in the community water supply's distribution 3        system materials inventory required under subsection 4        (d). 5        For the purposes of this paragraph (1), written notice 6    shall be provided in the method and according to the 7    provisions of subsection (jj).8        (2) Lead service lines that are physically 9    disconnected from the distribution system are exempt from 10    this subsection. 11    (gg) Except as provided in subsection (hh), on and after 12January 1, 2022, when the owner or operator of a community 13water supply replaces a water main, the community water supply 14shall identify all lead service lines connected to the water 15main and shall replace the lead service lines by:16        (1) identifying the material or materials of each lead 17    service line connected to the water main, including, but 18    not limited to, any portion of the service line (i) 19    running on private property and (ii) within the building 20    plumbing at the first shut-off valve or 18 inches inside 21    the building, whichever is shorter;22        (2) in conjunction with replacement of the water main, 23    replacing any and all portions of each lead service line 24    connected to the water main that are composed of lead; and25        (3) if a property owner or customer refuses to grant 26    access to the property, following prescribed notice   HB3855- 27 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b1    provisions as outlined in subsection (ff). 2    If an owner of a potentially affected building intends to 3replace a portion of a lead service line or a galvanized 4service line and the galvanized service line is or was 5connected downstream to lead piping, then the owner of the 6potentially affected building shall provide the owner or 7operator of the community water supply with notice at least 45 8days before commencing the work. In the case of an emergency 9repair, the owner of the potentially affected building must 10provide filters for each kitchen area that are certified by an 11accredited third-party certification body to NSF/ANSI 53 and 12NSF/ANSI 42 for the reduction of lead and particulate. If the 13owner of the potentially affected building notifies the owner 14or operator of the community water supply that replacement of 15a portion of the lead service line after the emergency repair 16is completed, then the owner or operator of the community 17water supply shall replace the remainder of the lead service 18line within 30 days after completion of the emergency repair. 19A community water supply may take up to 120 days if necessary 20due to weather conditions. If a replacement takes longer than 2130 days, filters provided by the owner of the potentially 22affected building must be replaced in accordance with the 23manufacturer's recommendations. Partial lead service line 24replacements by the owners of potentially affected buildings 25are otherwise prohibited.26    (hh) For municipalities with a population in excess of   HB3855- 28 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b11,000,000 inhabitants, the requirements of subsection (gg) 2shall commence on January 1, 2023. 3    (ii) At least 45 days before conducting planned lead 4service line replacement, the owner or operator of a community 5water supply shall, by mail, attempt to contact the owner of 6the potentially affected building serviced by the lead service 7line to request access to the building and permission to 8replace the lead service line in accordance with the lead 9service line replacement plan. If the owner of the potentially 10affected building does not respond to the request within 15 11days after the request is sent, the owner or operator of the 12community water supply shall attempt to post the request on 13the entrance of the potentially affected building. 14    If the owner or operator of a community water supply is 15unable to obtain approval to access and replace a lead service 16line, the owner or operator of the community water supply 17shall request that the owner of the potentially affected 18building sign a waiver. The waiver shall be developed by the 19Department and should be made available in the owner's 20language. If the owner of the potentially affected building 21refuses to sign the waiver or fails to respond to the community 22water supply after the community water supply has complied 23with this subsection, then the community water supply shall 24notify the Department in writing within 15 working days. 25    (jj) When replacing a lead service line or repairing or 26replacing water mains with lead service lines or partial lead   HB3855- 29 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b1service lines attached to them, the owner or operator of a 2community water supply shall provide the owner of each 3potentially affected building that is serviced by the affected 4lead service lines or partial lead service lines, as well as 5the occupants of those buildings, with an individual written 6notice. The notice shall be delivered by mail or posted at the 7primary entranceway of the building. The notice must, in 8addition, be electronically mailed where an electronic mailing 9address is known or can be reasonably obtained. Written notice 10shall include, at a minimum, the following: 11        (1) a warning that the work may result in sediment, 12    possibly containing lead from the service line, in the 13    building's water;14        (2) information concerning the best practices for 15    preventing exposure to or risk of consumption of lead in 16    drinking water, including a recommendation to flush water 17    lines during and after the completion of the repair or 18    replacement work and to clean faucet aerator screens; and19        (3) information regarding the dangers of lead exposure 20    to young children and pregnant women. 21    When the individual written notice described in the first 22paragraph of this subsection is required as a result of 23planned work other than the repair or replacement of a water 24meter, the owner or operator of the community water supply 25shall provide the notice not less than 14 days before work 26begins. When the individual written notice described in the   HB3855- 30 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b1first paragraph of this subsection is required as a result of 2emergency repairs other than the repair or replacement of a 3water meter, the owner or operator of the community water 4supply shall provide the notice at the time the work is 5initiated. When the individual written notice described in the 6first paragraph of this subsection is required as a result of 7the repair or replacement of a water meter, the owner or 8operator of the community water supply shall provide the 9notice at the time the work is initiated. 10    The notifications required under this subsection must 11contain the following statement in Spanish, Polish, Chinese, 12Tagalog, Arabic, Korean, German, Urdu, and Gujarati: "This 13notice contains important information about your water service 14and may affect your rights. We encourage you to have this 15notice translated in full into a language you understand and 16before you make any decisions that may be required under this 17notice."18    An owner or operator of a community water supply that is 19required under this subsection to provide an individual 20written notice to the owner and occupant of a potentially 21affected building that is a multi-dwelling building may 22satisfy that requirement and the requirements of this 23subsection regarding notification to non-English speaking 24customers by posting the required notice on the primary 25entranceway of the building and at the location where the 26occupant's mail is delivered as reasonably as possible.   HB3855- 31 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b1    When this subsection would require the owner or operator 2of a community water supply to provide an individual written 3notice to the entire community served by the community water 4supply or would require the owner or operator of a community 5water supply to provide individual written notices as a result 6of emergency repairs or when the community water supply that 7is required to comply with this subsection is a small system, 8the owner or operator of the community water supply may 9provide the required notice through local media outlets, 10social media, or other similar means in lieu of providing the 11individual written notices otherwise required under this 12subsection. 13    No notifications are required under this subsection for 14work performed on water mains that are used to transmit 15treated water between community water supplies and properties 16that have no service connections. 17    (kk) No community water supply that sells water to any 18wholesale or retail consecutive community water supply may 19pass on any costs associated with compliance with this Section 20to consecutive systems.21    (ll) To the extent allowed by law, when a community water 22supply replaces or installs a lead service line in a public 23right-of-way or enters into an agreement with a private 24contractor for replacement or installation of a lead service 25line, the community water supply shall be held harmless for 26all damage to property when replacing or installing the lead   HB3855- 32 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b1service line. If dangers are encountered that prevent the 2replacement of the lead service line, the community water 3supply shall notify the Department within 15 working days of 4why the replacement of the lead service line could not be 5accomplished.6    (mm) The Agency may propose to the Board, and the Board may 7adopt, any rules necessary to implement and administer this 8Section. The Department may adopt rules necessary to address 9lead service lines attached to non-community water supplies.10    (nn) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section, 11no requirement in this Section shall be construed as being 12less stringent than existing applicable federal requirements.13    (oo) All lead service line replacements financed in whole 14or in part with funds obtained under this Section shall be 15considered public works for purposes of the Prevailing Wage 16Act. 17    (pp) Beginning in 2023, each municipality with a 18population of more than 1,000,000 inhabitants shall publicly 19post on its website data describing progress the municipality 20has made toward replacing lead service lines within the 21municipality. The data required to be posted under this 22subsection shall be the same information required to be 23reported under paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (t-5) 24of this Section. Beginning in 2024, each municipality that is 25subject to this subsection shall annually update the data 26posted on its website under this subsection. A municipality's   HB3855- 33 -LRB104 11065 BDA 21147 b1duty to post data under this subsection terminates only when 2all lead service lines within the municipality have been 3replaced. Nothing in this subsection (pp) shall be construed 4to replace, undermine, conflict with, or otherwise amend the 5responsibilities and requirements set forth in subsection 6(t-5) of this Section. 7(Source: P.A. 102-613, eff. 1-1-22; 102-813, eff. 5-13-22; 8103-167, eff. 6-30-23; 103-605, eff. 7-1-24.)
