Additional staffing transparency and reporting 12requirements.13    (a) Definitions.

Hospital worker competency validation and 2assignment despite objection.3    (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds that:4        (1) The State of Illinois has an obligation to ensure 5    hospitals provide quality patient care.6        (2) Numerous studies have linked patient outcomes, 7    including in-hospital mortality rates, to hospital worker 8    staffing.9        (3) Despite the preponderance of evidence that 10    adequate staffing improves patient outcomes, hospitals in 11    Illinois and elsewhere too often systemically and 12    intentionally understaff to maximize profit, even at the 13    expense of quality patient care.14        (4) The COVID-19 pandemic both exposed and exacerbated 15    these unsafe staffing practices.16        (5) The State asserts that, based on their 17    demonstrated competencies and training, hospital workers 18    are best positioned to identify unsafe conditions that 19    jeopardize quality patient care, especially short 20    staffing.21        (6) Hospitals perform competency validations and 22    ongoing verifications to ensure hospital workers know how 23    to perform their jobs safely and to identify unsafe 24    practices, including short staffing.25        (7) The State should require hospitals to affirm that 26    hospital workers have received the necessary training to   SB0021- 7 -LRB104 06121 BAB 16154 b1    safely perform their work via competency validations and 2    ongoing verification and empower these hospital workers to 3    identify and formally object to unsafe working conditions, 4    including short staffing.5        (8) To facilitate this, the State should create a 6    dispute resolution process for hospital workers to 7    formally object to unsafe working conditions.8    (b) Definitions. As used in this Section:9    "Assignment despite objection" means a formal process by 10which hospital workers notify management when they receive an 11assignment that, based on their training, is potentially 12unsafe.13    "Competency validation" means a determination based on a 14hospital worker's satisfactory performance of each specific 15element of the hospital worker's job description and of 16specific requirements of the unit in which the hospital worker 17is employed in a safe and ethical manner.18    "Competent employee" means a hospital worker whose 19employer has received a competency validation or ongoing 20verification during a given calendar year.21    "Hospital worker" means any person who receives an hourly 22wage, directly or indirectly via a subcontractor, from a 23hospital licensed under this Act.24    "Ongoing verification" means an annual redetermination 25based on a hospital worker's satisfactory performance of each 26specific element of the hospital worker's job description and   SB0021- 8 -LRB104 06121 BAB 16154 b1the specific requirements of the unit in which the hospital 2worker is employed in a safe and ethical manner.3    "Subcontractor" means any entity, including an individual 4or individuals, that contracts with a hospital licensed under 5this Act to supply a service. "Subcontractor" includes an 6organization that, to a significant extent, is associated or 7affiliated with, owns or is owned by, or has control of or is 8controlled by, the entity furnishing services to a hospital 9licensed under this Act.10    (c) Competency validation credential.11        (1) Hospitals licensed under this Act shall conduct a 12    competency validation for each hospital worker hired, as a 13    condition of employment, within the first month of 14    employment and at no cost to the new hire.15        (2) The competency validation formally affirms the 16    hospital has adequately trained a hospital worker to 17    perform all aspects of the hospital worker's job safely 18    and to identify unsafe conditions, including inadequate 19    staffing.20        (3) Hospitals must submit documentation of each 21    hospital worker's competency validation to the Department 22    within 2 weeks after the hospital worker's start date.23        (4) Hospitals licensed under this Act shall also 24    conduct an ongoing verification for each hospital worker 25    employed during the calendar year to determine each 26    hospital worker's continued competency to perform the   SB0021- 9 -LRB104 06121 BAB 16154 b1    hospital worker's job. The hospitals shall submit 2    documentation of each hospital worker's ongoing 3    verification to the Department within 2 weeks after 4    completion.5        (5) Hospitals licensed under this Act shall submit a 6    list of all competent employees currently employed at the 7    end of each calendar year.8        (6) The Department shall maintain, and make available 9    to the public, a registry of all competent employees, 10    including the hospital worker's name, address, contact 11    information, and current employer.12        (7) Hospital employers that fail to comply with the 13    requirements of this Section shall receive a fine equal to 14    0.1% of annual revenue reported during the most recently 15    completed fiscal year each day until the hospital complies 16    with the law.17    (d) Assignment despite objection.18        (1) A hospital licensed under this Act must create an 19    assignment despite objection form that is applicable and 20    accessible to all hospital workers that enables the 21    hospital workers to formally object to unsafe working 22    conditions (including unsafe staffing levels) and shifts 23    liability for the unsafe working conditions to the 24    hospital.25        (2) The assignment despite objection form must include 26    the following language: "This is to confirm that I   SB0021- 10 -LRB104 06121 BAB 16154 b1    notified you that, in my professional judgment derived 2    from my competency validation, today's assignment is 3    unsafe and places patients at risk. As a result, the 4    facility is responsible for any adverse effects on patient 5    care."6        (3) A hospital must retain a copy of each assignment 7    despite objection form and provide copies to the hospital 8    worker's union (where relevant) and the Department. 9    Hospitals must provide a report of all assignment despite 10    objection forms filed annually at the end of each calendar 11    year and maintain these records for a minimum of 5 years.12        (4) A hospital must not retaliate against hospital 13    workers for filing an assignment despite objection form or 14    for reporting or objecting to unsafe conditions.15    (e) Resolution process.16        (1) A hospital must develop a transparent, fair, and 17    expedient assignment despite objection resolution process 18    for all hospital workers either via collective bargaining 19    or in accordance with the Department process described in 20    paragraph (3).21        (2) Hospital workers currently covered by a collective 22    bargaining agreement that includes an assignment despite 23    objection resolution process shall abide by the process 24    included in the collective bargaining agreement.25        (3) Hospital workers not covered by a collective 26    bargaining agreement that includes an assignment despite   SB0021- 11 -LRB104 06121 BAB 16154 b1    objection resolution process may use the Department's 2    resolution process. The Department's resolution process 3    for an assignment despite objection shall be as follows:4            (A) Step 1: The objecting hospital worker shall 5        make a good faith effort to inform the manager or 6        supervisor at the time of the objection to assignment.7            (B) Step 2: If the manager or supervisor fails to 8        resolve the unsafe situation to the reporting hospital 9        worker's satisfaction, the hospital worker shall then 10        complete an assignment despite objection form and 11        submit a copy to the manager or supervisor, submit a 12        copy to the representative organization if covered by 13        a collective bargaining agreement, and keep a copy for 14        the hospital worker's records.15            (C) Hospital management must respond in writing to 16        the assignment despite objection within one week of 17        its receipt and shall provide a copy of the response to 18        the hospital worker's representative organization if 19        the hospital worker is covered by a collective 20        bargaining agreement.21            (D) If the affected hospital worker is unsatisfied 22        with the management's response, the hospital must 23        convene a Safety Review Panel composed of 3 24        representatives selected by the hospital and 3 25        representatives selected by hospital workers via a 26        transparent democratic process (the hospital workers'   SB0021- 12 -LRB104 06121 BAB 16154 b1        representatives need not be hospital employees). The 2        panel shall attempt to resolve the dispute within 15 3        days of referral, unless extended by mutual consent.4            (E) If the Safety Review Panel cannot resolve the 5        dispute within 15 days of referral, the Department 6        shall appoint a mutually agreed upon third-party 7        neutral to assist in resolving the dispute. The 8        third-party neutral shall make a binding decision to 9        resolve the dispute.10        (4) Hospital employers that refuse to honor the 11    Department's assignment despite objection resolution 12    process shall receive a fine equal to 0.1% of annual 13    revenue reported each day during the most recently 14    completed fiscal year until the hospital complies with the 15    resolution process.16        (5) The Department shall create a Hospital Safety 17    Advocate position responsible for enforcing the new 18    competency credentialing and assignment despite objection 19    requirements and developing additional rules, as needed.

"Subcontractor" includes an 6organization that, to a significant extent, is associated or 7affiliated with, owns or is owned by, or has control of or is 8controlled by, the entity furnishing services to a hospital 9licensed under this Act.10    (c) Competency validation credential.11        (1) Hospitals licensed under this Act shall conduct a 12    competency validation for each hospital worker hired, as a 13    condition of employment, within the first month of 14    employment and at no cost to the new hire.15        (2) The competency validation formally affirms the 16    hospital has adequately trained a hospital worker to 17    perform all aspects of the hospital worker's job safely 18    and to identify unsafe conditions, including inadequate 19    staffing.20        (3) Hospitals must submit documentation of each 21    hospital worker's competency validation to the Department 22    within 2 weeks after the hospital worker's start date.23        (4) Hospitals licensed under this Act shall also 24    conduct an ongoing verification for each hospital worker 25    employed during the calendar year to determine each 26    hospital worker's continued competency to perform the   SB0021- 9 -LRB104 06121 BAB 16154 b1    hospital worker's job. The hospitals shall submit 2    documentation of each hospital worker's ongoing 3    verification to the Department within 2 weeks after 4    completion.5        (5) Hospitals licensed under this Act shall submit a 6    list of all competent employees currently employed at the 7    end of each calendar year.8        (6) The Department shall maintain, and make available 9    to the public, a registry of all competent employees, 10    including the hospital worker's name, address, contact 11    information, and current employer.12        (7) Hospital employers that fail to comply with the 13    requirements of this Section shall receive a fine equal to 14    0.1% of annual revenue reported during the most recently 15    completed fiscal year each day until the hospital complies 16    with the law.17    (d) Assignment despite objection.18        (1) A hospital licensed under this Act must create an 19    assignment despite objection form that is applicable and 20    accessible to all hospital workers that enables the 21    hospital workers to formally object to unsafe working 22    conditions (including unsafe staffing levels) and shifts 23    liability for the unsafe working conditions to the 24    hospital.25        (2) The assignment despite objection form must include 26    the following language: "This is to confirm that I   SB0021- 10 -LRB104 06121 BAB 16154 b1    notified you that, in my professional judgment derived 2    from my competency validation, today's assignment is 3    unsafe and places patients at risk. As a result, the 4    facility is responsible for any adverse effects on patient 5    care."6        (3) A hospital must retain a copy of each assignment 7    despite objection form and provide copies to the hospital 8    worker's union (where relevant) and the Department. 9    Hospitals must provide a report of all assignment despite 10    objection forms filed annually at the end of each calendar 11    year and maintain these records for a minimum of 5 years.12        (4) A hospital must not retaliate against hospital 13    workers for filing an assignment despite objection form or 14    for reporting or objecting to unsafe conditions.15    (e) Resolution process.16        (1) A hospital must develop a transparent, fair, and 17    expedient assignment despite objection resolution process 18    for all hospital workers either via collective bargaining 19    or in accordance with the Department process described in 20    paragraph (3).21        (2) Hospital workers currently covered by a collective 22    bargaining agreement that includes an assignment despite 23    objection resolution process shall abide by the process 24    included in the collective bargaining agreement.25        (3) Hospital workers not covered by a collective 26    bargaining agreement that includes an assignment despite   SB0021- 11 -LRB104 06121 BAB 16154 b1    objection resolution process may use the Department's 2    resolution process. The Department's resolution process 3    for an assignment despite objection shall be as follows:4            (A) Step 1: The objecting hospital worker shall 5        make a good faith effort to inform the manager or 6        supervisor at the time of the objection to assignment.7            (B) Step 2: If the manager or supervisor fails to 8        resolve the unsafe situation to the reporting hospital 9        worker's satisfaction, the hospital worker shall then 10        complete an assignment despite objection form and 11        submit a copy to the manager or supervisor, submit a 12        copy to the representative organization if covered by 13        a collective bargaining agreement, and keep a copy for 14        the hospital worker's records.15            (C) Hospital management must respond in writing to 16        the assignment despite objection within one week of 17        its receipt and shall provide a copy of the response to 18        the hospital worker's representative organization if 19        the hospital worker is covered by a collective 20        bargaining agreement.21            (D) If the affected hospital worker is unsatisfied 22        with the management's response, the hospital must 23        convene a Safety Review Panel composed of 3 24        representatives selected by the hospital and 3 25        representatives selected by hospital workers via a 26        transparent democratic process (the hospital workers'   SB0021- 12 -LRB104 06121 BAB 16154 b1        representatives need not be hospital employees). The 2        panel shall attempt to resolve the dispute within 15 3        days of referral, unless extended by mutual consent.4            (E) If the Safety Review Panel cannot resolve the 5        dispute within 15 days of referral, the Department 6        shall appoint a mutually agreed upon third-party 7        neutral to assist in resolving the dispute. The 8        third-party neutral shall make a binding decision to 9        resolve the dispute.10        (4) Hospital employers that refuse to honor the 11    Department's assignment despite objection resolution 12    process shall receive a fine equal to 0.1% of annual 13    revenue reported each day during the most recently 14    completed fiscal year until the hospital complies with the 15    resolution process.16        (5) The Department shall create a Hospital Safety 17    Advocate position responsible for enforcing the new 18    competency credentialing and assignment despite objection 19    requirements and developing additional rules, as needed.
