Prohibiting voter suppression. 12    (a) A political subdivision, State agency, or any other 13government official or entity responsible for election 14administration shall not implement or enforce any election 15policy or practice, or take any other action or fail to take 16any action that results in, is likely to result in, or is 17intended to result in, either of the following:18        (1) a material disparity in voter participation, 19    access to voting opportunities, or the opportunity or 20    ability to participate in any stage of the political 21    process between members of a protected class and other 22    members of the electorate; or23        (2) based on the totality of the circumstances, the 24    opportunity or ability of members of a protected class to 25    participate in any stage of the political process is   HB3047- 6 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1    impaired.2    (b) There shall be no violation under paragraph (1) of 3subsection (a) if the political subdivision, State agency, or 4any other government official or entity demonstrates by clear 5and convincing evidence that (i) the election policy or 6practice is necessary to significantly further an important 7and particularized governmental interest and (ii) there is no 8alternative election policy or practice that results in a 9smaller disparity between protected class members and other 10members of the electorate.11    (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), a violation exists 12under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) in circumstances that 13include, but are not limited to, any of the following:14        (1) a political subdivision closes, moves, or 15    consolidates one or more precincts, polling places, early 16    voting sites, or ballot drop boxes or reassigns precincts 17    to polling places in a manner that makes it more difficult 18    for members of a protected class to cast their ballot or 19    results in a disparity in geographic access between 20    members of a protected class and other members of the 21    electorate;22        (2) a political subdivision provides or changes the 23    hours or date of an election or for early voting in a 24    manner that impairs the right to vote of members of a 25    protected class, including, but not limited to, making the 26    change without proper notice as required by law; and  HB3047- 7 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1        (3) a political subdivision or State agency fails to 2    provide voting or election materials in languages other 3    than English as required by federal, State, county, or 4    other local law.5    (d) Implementing a reorganization of a political 6subdivision, including, but not limited to, an annexation, 7incorporation, dissolution, consolidation, or division of a 8political subdivision, violates subsection (a) if, based on 9the totality of the circumstances, the reorganization impairs 10the opportunity of protected class members to nominate or 11elect candidates of the protected class member's choice, or 12otherwise influence the outcome of elections. 13    (10 ILCS 5/3A-20 new)14    Sec. 3A-20.

For the purpose of satisfying this 11    requirement, it is not necessary for the total number or 12    share of protected class members to exceed any numerical 13    threshold in any district or in the political subdivision 14    as a whole.15    (c) Members of different protected classes may jointly 16file an action under this Section if that they demonstrate 17that the combined voting preferences of the multiple protected 18classes are polarized against the rest of the electorate. 19    (10 ILCS 5/3A-25 new)20    Sec. 3A-25. Prohibiting vote dilution in Legislative and 21Representative Districts. 22    (a) As required by Section 3 of Article III of the Illinois 23Constitution which declares that "All elections shall be free 24and equal," in any redistricting plan under Section 3 of 25Article IV of the Illinois Constitution, the districts shall   HB3047- 9 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1be configured in such a way as to provide adequate 2representation to protected classes protected by federal and 3State law. Therefore, as explained in subsection (b), no 4Legislative Districts and Representative Districts shall be 5drawn such that the redistricting plan has the effect, or is 6motived in part by the intent, of impairing the opportunity or 7ability of members of a protected class to participate in the 8political process and elect or nominate candidates of their 9choice or otherwise influence the outcome of elections as a 10result of diluting the vote of such protected class members. 11The requirements imposed by this subsection (a) are in 12addition and subordinate to any requirements or obligations 13imposed by the United States Constitution, any federal law 14regarding redistricting Legislative Districts or 15Representative Districts, including, but not limited to, the 16federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Illinois 17Constitution.18    (b) A redistricting plan under Section 3 of Article IV of 19the Illinois Constitution for Legislative Districts and 20Representative Districts violates this subsection if:21        (1) either: (A) elections in one or more Legislative 22    or Representative districts exhibit racially polarized 23    voting resulting in an impairment of the equal opportunity 24    or ability of protected class members to nominate or elect 25    candidates of their choice; or (B) based on the totality 26    of the circumstances, the equal opportunity or ability of   HB3047- 10 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1    protected class members to nominate or elect candidates of 2    their choice or otherwise influence the outcome of 3    elections is impaired; and4        (2) one or more reasonably configured alternative 5    redistricting plans exist which would cure or mitigate the 6    impairment described in sub-subparagraph (1) by providing 7    members of a protected class an equal opportunity or 8    ability to nominate and elect candidates of their choice.9    For any such reasonably configured alternative 10redistricting plan, it is not necessary to show that members 11of a protected class comprise a majority in any such 12districts.13    (c) A civil action to cure a violation of this Section may 14be brought by the Attorney General or any individual or entity 15aggrieved by a violation of this Section in the Illinois 16Supreme Court, which holds exclusive jurisdiction over 17redistricting matters.18    (d) An entity aggrieved by a violation of this Section 19includes, but is not limited to, any entity (1) whose 20membership includes individuals aggrieved by a violation of 21this Section; or (2) whose mission would be frustrated by a 22violation of this Section, including, but not limited to, an 23entity who would expend or divert resources to fulfill its 24mission as a result of such violation or who shall expend 25greater resources or efforts to advocate before an elected 26body that is less responsive to the entity or its members due   HB3047- 11 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1to the alleged violation. An entity shall not be compelled to 2disclose the identity of any specific member to pursue a claim 3on behalf of its members.4    (e) In an action involving a districting plan, any 5individual who resides in the defendant jurisdiction and is a 6member of the affected protected class or classes, whether 7they reside in any particular district, may challenge the 8districting plan as a whole.9    (f) A person whose rights have been violated under this 10Section is entitled to injunctive relief against district maps 11that constitute a violation of subsection (b).12    (g) This Section is intended to benefit and protect the 13rights of individual voters and to provide a remedy for 14infringing on the rights granted under this Section. This 15Section shall be construed liberally to confer standing as 16broadly as the Illinois Constitution permits. 17    (10 ILCS 5/3A-30 new)18    Sec. 3A-30.

and13            (L) other factors deemed relevant;14        (2) no set number or combination of these factors 15    shall be required to determine that a violation occurred; 16    and17        (3) evidence of these factors is most probative if it 18    relates to the political subdivision in which the alleged 19    violation occurred, but is still probative if it relates 20    to the geographic region in which that political 21    subdivision is located or to this State.22    (b) When evaluating whether a violation of Section 3A-15, 23Section 3A-20, or Section 3A-25 has occurred:24        (1) the following circumstances are never relevant:25            (A) the total number or share of members of a 26        protected class on whom the election policy or   HB3047- 14 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1        practice does not impose a material burden;2            (B) the degree to which the election policy or 3        practice has a long pedigree or was in widespread use 4        at some earlier date;5            (C) the use of an identical or similar election 6        policy or practice in another political subdivision; 7        and8            (D) the availability of other forms of voting not 9        impacted by the election policy or practice;10        (2) evidence concerning the intent of voters, elected 11    officials, or public officials to discriminate against 12    protected class members is never required;13        (3) a State interest in preventing voter fraud or 14    bolstering voter confidence in the integrity of elections 15    is not relevant unless there is substantial evidence that 16    criminal activity by individual voters has occurred in the 17    local government in substantial numbers and the connection 18    between the election policy or practice and a State 19    interest in preventing voter fraud or bolstering voter 20    confidence in the integrity of elections is supported by 21    substantial evidence;22        (4) whether protected class members typically elect 23    candidates of their choice to the governing body in 24    approximate proportion to their total number or share of 25    the population may be relevant under Sections 3A-20 or 26    3A-25.  HB3047- 15 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1    (c) For the purposes of demonstrating that a violation of 2subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 33A-20 or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subsection (A) 4of Section 3A-25 has occurred, including for the purposes of 5demonstrating that racially polarized voting exists:6        (1) racially polarized voting shall be assessed based 7    on relevant election results, which may include, but are 8    not limited to, elections for offices of the political 9    subdivision;

24        and25            (D) low turnout or registration rates among 26        protected class members shall not preclude a finding   HB3047- 16 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1        of racially polarized voting;2        (2) racially polarized voting shall be assessed based 3    only on the combined electoral preferences of members of a 4    protected class or classes. There is no requirement that 5    the electoral preferences of each protected class or any 6    subgroup within a protected class be separately polarized 7    from those of other voters; and8        (3) the causes of or reasons for racially polarized 9    voting, including partisan explanations or discriminatory 10    intent, are not relevant. 11    (10 ILCS 5/3A-35 new)12    Sec. 3A-35.

The 19prospective plaintiff shall not commence an action against 20that political subdivision or State agency within 60 days 21after sending that notification letter. If a political 22subdivision or State agency passes a resolution, ordinance, or 23takes other official action approved by its legislative or 24governing body or its chief executive that indicates a good 25faith intention to seek a remedy to the alleged violation, a   HB3047- 17 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1prospective plaintiff shall not commence an action against 2that political subdivision or State agency for 60 days from 3the approval date of such resolution, ordinance or other 4official action.5    (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a pre-litigation 6notice letter is not required if:7        (1) the prospect of obtaining relief would be futile;8        (2) another party has already submitted a notification 9    letter alleging a substantially similar violation and that 10    party is eligible to bring a cause of action;11        (3) the prospective plaintiff is seeking preliminary 12    injunctive relief;13        (4) the prospective plaintiff is seeking preliminary 14    relief with respect to an upcoming election;15        (5) the prospective plaintiff is seeking to intervene 16    in or join an existing action;17        (6) following the prospective plaintiff's submission 18    of a notice letter, the political subdivision or State 19    agency enacted a remedy that would not remedy the 20    violation identified in the letter;21        (7) the prospective plaintiff is challenging an action 22    taken by the political subdivision or State agency in the 23    past year; or24        (8) the prospective plaintiff is facing other exigent 25    circumstances.   HB3047- 18 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1    (10 ILCS 5/3A-50 new)2    Sec. 3A-50.

Prohibiting vote dilution in political 15subdivisions. 16    (a) No political subdivision shall employ (i) an at-large 17method of election, (ii) a district-based method of election, 18(iii) a share-based method of election, or (iv) any other 19method of election for any office that has the effect, will 20likely have the effect, or is motivated in part by the intent, 21of diluting the vote of protected class members.22    (b) A political subdivision violates subsection (a) if:23        (1) either: (A) elections in the political subdivision 24    exhibit racially polarized voting resulting in an 25    impairment of the equal opportunity or ability of   HB3047- 8 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1    protected class members to nominate or elect candidates of 2    their choice; or (B) based on the totality of the 3    circumstances, the equal opportunity or ability of members 4    of a protected class to nominate or elect candidates of 5    their choice or influence the outcome of elections is 6    impaired; and7        (2) one or more modifications to the existing method 8    of election or one or more new methods of election exist 9    which would cure or mitigate the impairment described in 10    subparagraph (1). For the purpose of satisfying this 11    requirement, it is not necessary for the total number or 12    share of protected class members to exceed any numerical 13    threshold in any district or in the political subdivision 14    as a whole.15    (c) Members of different protected classes may jointly 16file an action under this Section if that they demonstrate 17that the combined voting preferences of the multiple protected 18classes are polarized against the rest of the electorate. 19    (10 ILCS 5/3A-25 new)20    Sec. 3A-25. Prohibiting vote dilution in Legislative and 21Representative Districts. 22    (a) As required by Section 3 of Article III of the Illinois 23Constitution which declares that "All elections shall be free 24and equal," in any redistricting plan under Section 3 of 25Article IV of the Illinois Constitution, the districts shall   HB3047- 9 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1be configured in such a way as to provide adequate 2representation to protected classes protected by federal and 3State law. Therefore, as explained in subsection (b), no 4Legislative Districts and Representative Districts shall be 5drawn such that the redistricting plan has the effect, or is 6motived in part by the intent, of impairing the opportunity or 7ability of members of a protected class to participate in the 8political process and elect or nominate candidates of their 9choice or otherwise influence the outcome of elections as a 10result of diluting the vote of such protected class members. 11The requirements imposed by this subsection (a) are in 12addition and subordinate to any requirements or obligations 13imposed by the United States Constitution, any federal law 14regarding redistricting Legislative Districts or 15Representative Districts, including, but not limited to, the 16federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Illinois 17Constitution.18    (b) A redistricting plan under Section 3 of Article IV of 19the Illinois Constitution for Legislative Districts and 20Representative Districts violates this subsection if:21        (1) either: (A) elections in one or more Legislative 22    or Representative districts exhibit racially polarized 23    voting resulting in an impairment of the equal opportunity 24    or ability of protected class members to nominate or elect 25    candidates of their choice; or (B) based on the totality 26    of the circumstances, the equal opportunity or ability of   HB3047- 10 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1    protected class members to nominate or elect candidates of 2    their choice or otherwise influence the outcome of 3    elections is impaired; and4        (2) one or more reasonably configured alternative 5    redistricting plans exist which would cure or mitigate the 6    impairment described in sub-subparagraph (1) by providing 7    members of a protected class an equal opportunity or 8    ability to nominate and elect candidates of their choice.9    For any such reasonably configured alternative 10redistricting plan, it is not necessary to show that members 11of a protected class comprise a majority in any such 12districts.13    (c) A civil action to cure a violation of this Section may 14be brought by the Attorney General or any individual or entity 15aggrieved by a violation of this Section in the Illinois 16Supreme Court, which holds exclusive jurisdiction over 17redistricting matters.18    (d) An entity aggrieved by a violation of this Section 19includes, but is not limited to, any entity (1) whose 20membership includes individuals aggrieved by a violation of 21this Section; or (2) whose mission would be frustrated by a 22violation of this Section, including, but not limited to, an 23entity who would expend or divert resources to fulfill its 24mission as a result of such violation or who shall expend 25greater resources or efforts to advocate before an elected 26body that is less responsive to the entity or its members due   HB3047- 11 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1to the alleged violation. An entity shall not be compelled to 2disclose the identity of any specific member to pursue a claim 3on behalf of its members.4    (e) In an action involving a districting plan, any 5individual who resides in the defendant jurisdiction and is a 6member of the affected protected class or classes, whether 7they reside in any particular district, may challenge the 8districting plan as a whole.9    (f) A person whose rights have been violated under this 10Section is entitled to injunctive relief against district maps 11that constitute a violation of subsection (b).12    (g) This Section is intended to benefit and protect the 13rights of individual voters and to provide a remedy for 14infringing on the rights granted under this Section. This 15Section shall be construed liberally to confer standing as 16broadly as the Illinois Constitution permits. 17    (10 ILCS 5/3A-30 new)18    Sec. 3A-30.

and13            (L) other factors deemed relevant;14        (2) no set number or combination of these factors 15    shall be required to determine that a violation occurred; 16    and17        (3) evidence of these factors is most probative if it 18    relates to the political subdivision in which the alleged 19    violation occurred, but is still probative if it relates 20    to the geographic region in which that political 21    subdivision is located or to this State.22    (b) When evaluating whether a violation of Section 3A-15, 23Section 3A-20, or Section 3A-25 has occurred:24        (1) the following circumstances are never relevant:25            (A) the total number or share of members of a 26        protected class on whom the election policy or   HB3047- 14 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1        practice does not impose a material burden;2            (B) the degree to which the election policy or 3        practice has a long pedigree or was in widespread use 4        at some earlier date;5            (C) the use of an identical or similar election 6        policy or practice in another political subdivision; 7        and8            (D) the availability of other forms of voting not 9        impacted by the election policy or practice;10        (2) evidence concerning the intent of voters, elected 11    officials, or public officials to discriminate against 12    protected class members is never required;13        (3) a State interest in preventing voter fraud or 14    bolstering voter confidence in the integrity of elections 15    is not relevant unless there is substantial evidence that 16    criminal activity by individual voters has occurred in the 17    local government in substantial numbers and the connection 18    between the election policy or practice and a State 19    interest in preventing voter fraud or bolstering voter 20    confidence in the integrity of elections is supported by 21    substantial evidence;22        (4) whether protected class members typically elect 23    candidates of their choice to the governing body in 24    approximate proportion to their total number or share of 25    the population may be relevant under Sections 3A-20 or 26    3A-25.  HB3047- 15 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1    (c) For the purposes of demonstrating that a violation of 2subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of Section 33A-20 or subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of subsection (A) 4of Section 3A-25 has occurred, including for the purposes of 5demonstrating that racially polarized voting exists:6        (1) racially polarized voting shall be assessed based 7    on relevant election results, which may include, but are 8    not limited to, elections for offices of the political 9    subdivision; elections held in the political subdivision 10    for other offices, such as State or federal offices; 11    ballot measures; and other electoral choices that bear on 12    the rights and privileges of the protected class;13            (A) no set number or combination of elections 14        shall be required to establish the existence of 15        racially polarized voting;16            (B) evidence of non-polarized voting in elections 17        for offices outside the political subdivision shall 18        not preclude a finding of racially polarized voting 19        based on elections for offices of the political 20        subdivision;21            (C) non-statistical or non-quantitative evidence 22        shall not preclude a finding of racially polarized 23        voting based on statistical or quantitative evidence; 24        and25            (D) low turnout or registration rates among 26        protected class members shall not preclude a finding   HB3047- 16 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1        of racially polarized voting;2        (2) racially polarized voting shall be assessed based 3    only on the combined electoral preferences of members of a 4    protected class or classes. There is no requirement that 5    the electoral preferences of each protected class or any 6    subgroup within a protected class be separately polarized 7    from those of other voters; and8        (3) the causes of or reasons for racially polarized 9    voting, including partisan explanations or discriminatory 10    intent, are not relevant. 11    (10 ILCS 5/3A-35 new)12    Sec. 3A-35. Pre-litigation notification letter for 13political subdivisions. 14    (a) Before commencing legal action alleging a violation of 15Sections 3A-15 or 3A-20, a prospective plaintiff shall send a 16notification letter to the political subdivision or State 17agency asserting that the political subdivision or State 18agency may be in violation of Sections 3A-15 or 3A-20. The 19prospective plaintiff shall not commence an action against 20that political subdivision or State agency within 60 days 21after sending that notification letter. If a political 22subdivision or State agency passes a resolution, ordinance, or 23takes other official action approved by its legislative or 24governing body or its chief executive that indicates a good 25faith intention to seek a remedy to the alleged violation, a   HB3047- 17 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1prospective plaintiff shall not commence an action against 2that political subdivision or State agency for 60 days from 3the approval date of such resolution, ordinance or other 4official action.5    (b) Notwithstanding subsection (a), a pre-litigation 6notice letter is not required if:7        (1) the prospect of obtaining relief would be futile;8        (2) another party has already submitted a notification 9    letter alleging a substantially similar violation and that 10    party is eligible to bring a cause of action;11        (3) the prospective plaintiff is seeking preliminary 12    injunctive relief;13        (4) the prospective plaintiff is seeking preliminary 14    relief with respect to an upcoming election;15        (5) the prospective plaintiff is seeking to intervene 16    in or join an existing action;17        (6) following the prospective plaintiff's submission 18    of a notice letter, the political subdivision or State 19    agency enacted a remedy that would not remedy the 20    violation identified in the letter;21        (7) the prospective plaintiff is challenging an action 22    taken by the political subdivision or State agency in the 23    past year; or24        (8) the prospective plaintiff is facing other exigent 25    circumstances.   HB3047- 18 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1    (10 ILCS 5/3A-50 new)2    Sec. 3A-50.

Otherwise, the court 6    may retain jurisdiction following a violation described in 7    subsection (b) based on the severity of the violation and 8    whether the local government has any previous violations; 9    and10        (2) a request for judicial preapproval submitted to a 11    court under this subsection may be granted only if the 12    court concludes that:13            (A) the proposed election policy or practice will 14        not diminish, in relation to the status quo before the 15        enactment or implementation of the election policy or 16        practice, the equal opportunity or ability of members 17        of a protected class whose voting rights are 18        implicated by the election policy or practice to 19        participate in any stage of the political process or 20        to nominate or elect candidates of their choice; and21            (B) that the proposed election policy or practice 22        is unlikely to violate any of the provisions of this 23        Article.24    (c) In any action brought under this Article, the court 25may order a remedy only if the remedy will not impair the 26ability of protected class members to participate in the   HB3047- 22 -LRB104 11050 SPS 21132 b1political process and elect the protected class member's 2preferred candidates, or otherwise influence the outcome of 3elections.4    (d) In any action brought under this Article, the court 5shall consider remedies proposed by any parties and interested 6non-parties and shall not provide deference or priority to a 7proposed remedy offered by the defendant or the political 8subdivision simply because the remedy has been proposed by the 9defendant or the political subdivision. 10    (10 ILCS 5/3A-60 new)11    Sec. 3A-60.
