By the 15th of each month of the 16fiscal year, the Board shall voucher to the Comptroller 17one-twelfth of each public university's total distribution. A 18public university shall receive the distribution on behalf of 19each eligible public institution that is part of that public 20university and then distribute funding to each eligible public 21institution.22    The sum of the initial funding amount, as calculated for 23Fiscal Year 2026 by the Board per subsection (b), shall be 24appropriated in Fiscal Year 2026 and in each fiscal year 25thereafter from the State to the board of trustees of each 26public university to meet its operational expenses.  10400SB0013sam001- 31 -LRB104 07750 LNS 24977 a1    (e) In each fiscal year in which there is new State formula 2funding, 50% of the new State formula funding shall be 3distributed using the dollar gap formula and the remaining 50% 4shall be distributed using the adequacy gap formula through 5the following calculations:6        (1) The dollar gap formula distribution shall be 7    calculated for each eligible public institution as 8    follows: 9            (A) First, add the total dollar value of the 10        adequacy gap of all eligible public institutions for 11        the fiscal year, which shall be the total adequacy 12        gap. 13            (B) Second, divide the dollar value of the 14        adequacy gap of the eligible public institution by the 15        dollar value of the total adequacy gap, which shall be 16        the gap percentage A. 17            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 18        institution's gap percentage A times the amount 19        available for the dollar gap formula for the fiscal 20        year. 21            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 22        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) 23        shall be the dollar gap formula distribution for the 24        eligible public institution.25        (2) The adequacy gap formula distribution shall be 26    calculated for each eligible public institution as   10400SB0013sam001- 32 -LRB104 07750 LNS 24977 a1    follows: 2            (A) First, add the percentage gaps of all eligible 3        public institutions for the fiscal year, which shall 4        be the total percentage gap. 5            (B) Second, divide the percentage gap of the 6        eligible public institution by the total percentage 7        gap, which shall be the gap percentage B.8            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 9        institution's gap percentage B by the amount available 10        for the adequacy gap formula for the fiscal year. 11            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 12        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (2) 13        shall be the adequacy gap formula distribution for the 14        eligible public institution.15    (f) The reduction formula shall be used in a fiscal year in 16which the State reduces its annual formula funding 17appropriations relative to the previous fiscal year such that 18funds are insufficient to provide each public university with 19its base funding minimum. The reduction formula shall be 20determined as follows:21        (1) By dividing the statewide adequacy gap by each 22    eligible public institution's adequacy gap and multiplying 23    the result by the percentage decrease in the current 24    fiscal year's appropriation compared to the prior fiscal 25    year's appropriation. The resulting percentage for each 26    eligible public institution is then multiplied by its base   10400SB0013sam001- 33 -LRB104 07750 LNS 24977 a1    funding minimum.2        (2) Scale this by calculating the ratio of each 3    institutional ratio cut to the statewide sum of 4    institutional ratio cuts and then multiplying this result 5    for each eligible public institution by the amount of 6    reduction in funds.7        (3) The total cut to each public university shall be 8    the aggregate sum of the cuts to all eligible public 9    institutions that are a part of that public university. 10    Section 40.

Thereafter, the minimum target increase 2in a fiscal year shall be the annual formula funding amount for 3the immediately preceding fiscal year, increased by a 4percentage equal to the percentage increase, if any, in the 5Employment Cost Index (Midwest Economy) published by the 6Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of 7Labor for the 4-quarter period ending on December 31 of the 8immediately preceding fiscal year. 9    (d) In Fiscal Year 2026 and in each fiscal year thereafter 10in which the State appropriates formula funding, each public 11university shall receive a distribution from the Board to meet 12its operational expenses equal to its pro rata share of State 13formula funding for the fiscal year, minus the sum of its base 14funding minimum, as calculated for Fiscal Year 2026 by the 15Board per subsection (b). By the 15th of each month of the 16fiscal year, the Board shall voucher to the Comptroller 17one-twelfth of each public university's total distribution. A 18public university shall receive the distribution on behalf of 19each eligible public institution that is part of that public 20university and then distribute funding to each eligible public 21institution.22    The sum of the initial funding amount, as calculated for 23Fiscal Year 2026 by the Board per subsection (b), shall be 24appropriated in Fiscal Year 2026 and in each fiscal year 25thereafter from the State to the board of trustees of each 26public university to meet its operational expenses.  10400SB0013sam001- 31 -LRB104 07750 LNS 24977 a1    (e) In each fiscal year in which there is new State formula 2funding, 50% of the new State formula funding shall be 3distributed using the dollar gap formula and the remaining 50% 4shall be distributed using the adequacy gap formula through 5the following calculations:6        (1) The dollar gap formula distribution shall be 7    calculated for each eligible public institution as 8    follows: 9            (A) First, add the total dollar value of the 10        adequacy gap of all eligible public institutions for 11        the fiscal year, which shall be the total adequacy 12        gap. 13            (B) Second, divide the dollar value of the 14        adequacy gap of the eligible public institution by the 15        dollar value of the total adequacy gap, which shall be 16        the gap percentage A. 17            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 18        institution's gap percentage A times the amount 19        available for the dollar gap formula for the fiscal 20        year. 21            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 22        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (1) 23        shall be the dollar gap formula distribution for the 24        eligible public institution.25        (2) The adequacy gap formula distribution shall be 26    calculated for each eligible public institution as   10400SB0013sam001- 32 -LRB104 07750 LNS 24977 a1    follows: 2            (A) First, add the percentage gaps of all eligible 3        public institutions for the fiscal year, which shall 4        be the total percentage gap. 5            (B) Second, divide the percentage gap of the 6        eligible public institution by the total percentage 7        gap, which shall be the gap percentage B.8            (C) Third, multiply the eligible public 9        institution's gap percentage B by the amount available 10        for the adequacy gap formula for the fiscal year. 11            (D) The dollar value of the product obtained after 12        calculating subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (2) 13        shall be the adequacy gap formula distribution for the 14        eligible public institution.15    (f) The reduction formula shall be used in a fiscal year in 16which the State reduces its annual formula funding 17appropriations relative to the previous fiscal year such that 18funds are insufficient to provide each public university with 19its base funding minimum. The reduction formula shall be 20determined as follows:21        (1) By dividing the statewide adequacy gap by each 22    eligible public institution's adequacy gap and multiplying 23    the result by the percentage decrease in the current 24    fiscal year's appropriation compared to the prior fiscal 25    year's appropriation. The resulting percentage for each 26    eligible public institution is then multiplied by its base   10400SB0013sam001- 33 -LRB104 07750 LNS 24977 a1    funding minimum.2        (2) Scale this by calculating the ratio of each 3    institutional ratio cut to the statewide sum of 4    institutional ratio cuts and then multiplying this result 5    for each eligible public institution by the amount of 6    reduction in funds.7        (3) The total cut to each public university shall be 8    the aggregate sum of the cuts to all eligible public 9    institutions that are a part of that public university. 10    Section 40.
