Full Text of HR0137 ILGA.GOV HR0137 - 104th General Assembly HR0137LRB104 12178 MST 22280 r1HOUSE RESOLUTION 2    WHEREAS, Decades of research demonstrate that high-quality 3early care and education programs are effective in supporting 4the learning and development of young children, increasing 5their likelihood of success in school and in later life; and 6    WHEREAS, Studies similarly reflect the substantial 7contributions that early childhood services make in 8strengthening the well-being of communities, the stability of 9our workforce, and the quality of our economy, as well as 10public safety and national security; and 11    WHEREAS, The quality of early childhood services depends 12largely upon the quality of their infrastructure, ranging from 13well-qualified teachers to supportive data systems; and 14    WHEREAS, Such infrastructure also includes safe, 15developmentally appropriate classrooms and related physical 16space for young children's care and learning; and 17    WHEREAS, The availability and quality of early childhood 18facilities are an equitability concern for many underserved 19populations of Illinois, including communities of color, areas 20of pronounced socio-economic pressure, and rural regions; and   HR0137- 2 -LRB104 12178 MST 22280 r1    WHEREAS, The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis has 2stated that high-quality environments not only help keep 3children safe and healthy but also facilitate concentration, 4ease of play, and more positive child-teacher and child-child 5interactions; providing a high-quality environment includes 6ensuring such conditions as adequate space, ventilation, 7thermal comfort, and lighting; and 8    WHEREAS, The national Bipartisan Policy Center has 9reported that investments in early care and learning 10facilities should be an element of federal, state, and local 11economic-development strategies; and 12    WHEREAS, The State of Illinois reflected these realities 13in establishing the Early Childhood Construction Grants (ECCG) 14initiative in 2009 and growing the grant's resources to $100 15million in 2019, with approximately $40 million of that amount 16still remaining to be awarded to qualified building-and-repair 17projects; and 18    WHEREAS, Owing to resource limitations, the number of ECCG 19grant applications and the needs they represent have vastly 20outpaced the number of actual grant awards that could be made 21to early childhood providers over the years; and 22    WHEREAS, In Illinois' mixed-delivery system of early   HR0137- 3 -LRB104 12178 MST 22280 r1childhood services, community-based providers play an 2important role by helping relieve capacity pressures on 3maxed-out school facilities while also meeting the specific 4needs and choices of many parents in their own localities; and 5    WHEREAS, Community-based service providers typically have 6far less access to capital, including the technical assistance 7required to seek building resources, than do schools; and 8    WHEREAS, The vast scope of the State's 9construction-and-renovation needs is also evidenced by Early 10Childhood Regional Needs Assessments produced in 2023 by Birth 11to Five Illinois in which stakeholders from approximately 12one-fifth of Illinois counties, ranging from Jo Daviess to 13Kankakee to Pope and beyond, expressly named capital matters 14among their most pressing concerns; and 15    WHEREAS, School districts participating in the Illinois 16State Board of Education (ISBE) 2024 Capital Needs Assessment 17Survey identified the need for building 269 additional 18school-based preK classrooms statewide; and 19    WHEREAS, ISBE's biennial Capital Needs Assessment Survey 20captures only a portion of Illinois' early childhood 21facilities needs, considering that fewer than half of 22elementary and unit districts took part in the most recent   HR0137- 4 -LRB104 12178 MST 22280 r1assessment and that the assessment does not extend to 2community-based service providers; and 3    WHEREAS, A national report from the Reinvestment Fund and 4National Children's Facilities Network declared that "limited 5supply of licensable facilities, cramped spaces, and deferred 6maintenance have been common features of child care 7infrastructure for decades," adding that their findings 8"suggest a significant remaining need for funding for 9facilities infrastructure, from maintaining and repairing 10facilities, expanding existing programs, to developing new 11high-quality learning environments; and 12    WHEREAS, In 2019, the Governor appointed a bipartisan 13Illinois Commission on Equitable Early Childhood Education and 14Care Funding (Early Childhood Funding Commission) that, after 15a year of research and expert deliberation, issued 16recommendations for making the State's system of birth-to-five 17services "simpler, better, fairer" for children and families; 18and 19    WHEREAS, The Funding Commission's report expressly 20acknowledged the significance of Illinois' urgent 21bricks-and-mortar needs, stating that future studies must 22assess the costs of facility footprint expansion across the 23mixed delivery system to help adjust projections of future   HR0137- 5 -LRB104 12178 MST 22280 r1funding needs; and 2    WHEREAS, The Funding Commission recommended substantial 3increases in birth-to-five programmatic resources that 4Illinois has begun to pursue through the Governor's multi-year 5Smart Start Illinois initiative, representing important and 6desperately needed growth in early childhood program capacity 7that will understandably increase physical-infrastructure 8needs even further, over time, as more families are helped to 9access the services they seek; and 10    WHEREAS, The Commission and the Governor also recommended 11the creation of a single State agency to streamline, improve, 12and assume responsibility for the administration of core 13birth-to-five services that historically have been spread 14across multiple other departments; and 15    WHEREAS, By an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, the General 16Assembly accordingly authorized the establishment of the 17State's new Department of Early Childhood via Public Act 18103-0594, which also launched a two-year planning process for 19development of the new agency; therefore, be it 20    RESOLVED, BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE 21HUNDRED FOURTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, that 22the new Department of Early Childhood and its planning process   HR0137- 6 -LRB104 12178 MST 22280 r1should prioritize appropriate attention to the facilities 2needs of our State's mixed-delivery system of early care and 3education; and be it further 4    RESOLVED, That such prioritization should include 5development of a biennial measure of physical-infrastructure 6needs among community-based providers of child care, 7preschool, and other core early childhood services for 8children from birth to age five, as well as continue to assess 9the capital needs of school-based providers of such programs, 10to better inform state policy decision-making, and reflect the 11Funding Commission's call for deliberate assessment of 12facility-expansion costs; and be it further 13    RESOLVED, That the State should move expeditiously to 14award its remaining Early Childhood Construction Grant monies 15to qualified applicants, to assist providers of critical 16birth-to-five programs in meeting their growing 17building-and-repair demands; and be it further 18    RESOLVED, That the State should also move as quickly as 19feasible to replenish Early Childhood Construction Grant 20resources to help Illinois achieve the long-term vision of the 21bipartisan Funding Commission for making services "simpler, 22better, fairer" for young children, their families, and 23communities statewide; and be it further   HR0137- 7 -LRB104 12178 MST 22280 r1    RESOLVED, That suitable copies of this resolution be 2delivered to the offices of the Governor, the Illinois 3Department of Early Childhood, the Illinois State Board of 4Education, the Illinois Department of Human Services, the 5Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, and the 6Capital Development Board.
