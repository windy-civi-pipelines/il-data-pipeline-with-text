Whistleblower protections.2    (a) A large developer that has one or more employees in 3this State shall provide a reasonable internal process through 4which an employee may anonymously disclose information to the 5large developer if the employee believes in good faith that 6information indicates that the large developer's activities 7pose critical risk, including a monthly update to the person 8who made the disclosure regarding the status of the large 9developer's investigation of the disclosure and the actions 10taken by the large developer in response to the disclosure.11    (b) The disclosures and responses of the process required 12by subsection (a) shall be maintained for a minimum of 7 years 13after the date when the disclosure is made to the large 14developer or the response to the disclosure is made by the 15large developer.

In 9calculating the civil penalty assessed under this subsection, 10a court shall consider the severity of the violation and 11whether the violation resulted in, or could have resulted in, 12the materialization of a critical risk.13    (b) The Attorney General may seek injunctive or 14declaratory relief for any violation of this Act. The Attorney 15General may also seek injunctive relief if a large developer's 16activities present an imminent threat of catastrophic harm to 17the public. 18    (c) In determining whether a large developer's act or 19omission breached its common law duty to take reasonable care 20with respect to critical risks, the following considerations 21are relevant but not conclusive:22        (1) the quality of the large developer's safety and 23    security protocol and the extent of the large developer's 24    adherence to it;25        (2) whether, in quality and implementation, the large   10400HB3506ham001- 15 -LRB104 12155 SPS 23919 a1    developer's investigation, documentation, evaluation, and 2    management of critical risks was inferior, comparable, or 3    superior to other large developers of foundation models 4    that may pose comparable critical risk;5        (3) the extent to which the large developer 6    responsibly informed the public of critical risks posed by 7    its foundation models; and8        (4) whether the societal benefit produced by the large 9    developer's act or omission outweighed the associated 10    critical risk. 11    Section 40. Enforcement of whistleblower protections.12    (a) Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to 13believe that any large developer has engaged in a practice 14prohibited by Section 30, the Attorney General may, pursuant 15to the authority conferred by Section 6.3 of the Attorney 16General Act, initiate or intervene in a civil action in the 17name of the People of the State in any appropriate court to 18obtain appropriate relief.19    (b) Before initiating an action, the Attorney General may 20conduct an investigation and may:21        (1) require a large developer to file a statement or 22    report in writing, under oath or otherwise, as to all 23    information the Attorney General may consider necessary;24        (2) examine under oath any person alleged to have 25    participated in, or with knowledge of, the alleged   10400HB3506ham001- 16 -LRB104 12155 SPS 23919 a1    violation; or2        (3) issue subpoenas or conduct hearings in aid of any 3    investigation.4    (c) Service by the Attorney General of any notice 5requiring a large developer to file a statement or report, or 6of a subpoena upon any large developer, shall be made:7        (1) personally by delivery of a duly executed copy 8    thereof to the person to be served or, if a person is not a 9    natural person, in the manner provided in the Code of 10    Civil Procedure when a complaint is filed; or11        (2) by mailing by certified mail a duly executed copy 12    thereof to the person to be served at the person's last 13    known abode or principal place of business within this 14    State or, if the person is not a natural person, in the 15    manner provided in the Code of Civil Procedure when a 16    complaint is filed. The Attorney General may compel 17    compliance with investigative demands under this Section 18    through an order by any court of competent jurisdiction.19    (d)(1) In an action brought under this Act, the Attorney 20General may obtain, as a remedy, monetary damages to the 21State, restitution, and equitable relief, including any 22permanent or preliminary injunction, temporary restraining 23order, or other order, including an order enjoining the 24defendant from engaging in a violation, or order any action as 25may be appropriate.

Additionally, 2the Attorney General may request and the court may impose a 3civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each repeat violation 4within a 5-year period. For purposes of this Section, each 5violation of this Act for each employee that the large 6developer took or threatened to take retaliatory action 7against shall constitute a separate and distinct violation.8    (2) A civil penalty imposed under this subsection shall be 9deposited into the Attorney General Court Ordered and 10Voluntary Compliance Payment Projects Fund. 11    Section 45.

Additionally, 2the Attorney General may request and the court may impose a 3civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 for each repeat violation 4within a 5-year period. For purposes of this Section, each 5violation of this Act for each employee that the large 6developer took or threatened to take retaliatory action 7against shall constitute a separate and distinct violation.8    (2) A civil penalty imposed under this subsection shall be 9deposited into the Attorney General Court Ordered and 10Voluntary Compliance Payment Projects Fund. 11    Section 45.
