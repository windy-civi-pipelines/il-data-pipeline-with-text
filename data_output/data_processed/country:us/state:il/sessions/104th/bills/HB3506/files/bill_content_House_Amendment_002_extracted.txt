Amend House Bill 3506, AS AMENDED, 3by replacing everything after the enacting clause with the 4following: 5    "Section 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the 6Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Protocol Act. 7    Section 5. Legislative findings and purpose. The General 8Assembly finds and declares:9    (a) Artificial intelligence, including new advances in 10generative artificial intelligence, has the potential to 11catalyze innovation and the rapid development of a wide range 12of benefits for Illinoisans and the Illinois economy, 13including advances in medicine, climate science, and 14education, and to push the bounds of human creativity and 15capacity.16    (b) If not properly subject to human controls, future   10400HB3506ham002- 2 -LRB104 12155 SPS 24972 a1development in artificial intelligence may also have the 2potential to be used to create novel threats to public safety 3and security, including by enabling the creation and the 4proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, such as 5biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons, as well as weapons 6with cyber-offensive capabilities.7    (c) If not properly subject to human controls, future 8artificial intelligence models may be able to cause serious 9harm with limited human intervention.10    (d) This State has an essential role in fostering 11transparency, security, and reasonable care in the development 12of the most powerful artificial intelligence systems, in order 13to protect the safety, health, and economic interests of this 14State.15    (e) Actions taken by large developers that reduce consumer 16prices for access to foundation models, increase the ability 17of artificial intelligence safety and security researchers to 18conduct research, increase interoperability between foundation 19models produced by different large developers, improve the 20ability for small businesses to use foundation models, and 21promote privacy of user inputs to foundation models provide 22important societal benefits. 23    Section 10. Definitions. As used in this Act:24    "Adverse employment action" means an action that a 25reasonable employee would find materially adverse. For the   10400HB3506ham002- 3 -LRB104 12155 SPS 24972 a1purpose of this definition, an action is materially adverse if 2it could dissuade a reasonable worker from disclosing or 3threatening to disclose information protected under Section 430.5    "Artificial intelligence model" means an engineered or 6machine-based system that varies in its level of autonomy and 7that can, for explicit or implicit objectives, infer from the 8input it receives how to generate outputs that can influence 9physical or virtual environments.10    "Critical risk" means a foreseeable and material risk that 11a large developer's development, storage, or deployment of a 12foundation model will result in the death of, or serious 13injury to, more than 100 people, or more than $1,000,000,000 14in damage to rights in money or property, through an incident 15of the following types:16        (1) the creation and release of a chemical, 17    biological, radiological, or nuclear weapon;18        (2) a cyber-attack conducted by or assisted by a 19    foundation model; or20        (3) a foundation model engaging in conduct that would, 21    if committed by a human, constitute a crime specified 22    under the Criminal Code of 2012 that requires intent, 23    recklessness, or gross negligence, or the solicitation or 24    aiding and abetting of the crime, if that conduct occurs 25    with limited human intervention.26    For the purposes of this definition, a harm inflicted by   10400HB3506ham002- 4 -LRB104 12155 SPS 24972 a1an intervening human actor does not result from the large 2developer's activities unless those activities make it 3substantially easier or more likely for the actor to inflict 4the harm.5    "Deploy" means to use a foundation model or to make a 6foundation model foreseeably available to one or more third 7parties for use, modification, copying, or combination with 8other software, except as reasonably necessary for developing 9the foundation model or evaluating the foundation model or 10other foundation models.11    "Employee" means any individual permitted to work by a 12large developer. 13     "Foundation model" means an artificial intelligence model 14that:15        (1) is trained on a broad data set;16        (2) is designed for generality of output; and17        (3) can be adapted to a wide range of distinctive 18    tasks.19    "Large developer" means a person that has:20        (1) developed a foundation model with a quantity of 21    computing power that costs at least $5,000,000 when 22    measured using prevailing market prices of cloud computing 23    in the United States at the time that training of the 24    foundation model commences; and25        (2) within the immediately preceding 12 months, 26    developed one or more foundation models using a total   10400HB3506ham002- 5 -LRB104 12155 SPS 24972 a1    quantity of computing power that costs at least 2    $100,000,000 as measured by the average cost of an 3    equivalent amount of cloud computing in the United States 4    at the time the computational power was used.5    "Retaliatory action" means an adverse employment action or 6the threat of an adverse employment action by a large 7developer or a large developer's agent to penalize or any 8non-employment action that would dissuade a reasonable worker 9from disclosing information under this Act. "Retaliatory 10action" includes, but is not limited to:11        (1) taking, or threatening to take, any action that 12    would intentionally interfere with an employee's ability 13    to obtain future employment or post-termination 14    retaliation to intentionally interfere with a former 15    employee's employment;16        (2) taking, or threatening to take, any action 17    prohibited by subsection (G) of Section 2-102 of the 18    Illinois Human Rights Act; or19        (3) contacting, or threatening to contact, United 20    States immigration authorities, or otherwise reporting, or 21    threatening to report, an employee's suspected or actual 22    citizenship or immigration status or the suspected or 23    actual citizenship or immigration status of an employee's 24    family or household member to a federal, State, or local 25    agency.26    "Retaliatory action" does not include:  10400HB3506ham002- 6 -LRB104 12155 SPS 24972 a1        (1) conduct undertaken at the express and specific 2    direction or request of the federal government;3        (2) truthful, performance-related information about an 4    employee or former employee provided in good faith to a 5    prospective large developer at the request of the 6    prospective large developer; or7        (3) conduct undertaken if specifically required by 8    State or federal law.9    "Safety and security protocol" means a set of documented 10technical and organizational protocols used by a large 11developer to manage critical risks that describes in detail:12        (1) how, if at all, the large developer excludes 13    certain foundation models from being covered by its safety 14    and security protocol when those foundation models pose 15    limited critical risks;16        (2) thresholds at which critical risks would be deemed 17    intolerable and justifications for these thresholds and 18    what the large developer will do if one or more thresholds 19    are surpassed;20        (3) the testing and assessment procedures the large 21    developer uses to investigate critical risks and how these 22    tests account for the possibility that a foundation model 23    could evade the control of its large developer or user or 24    be misused, modified, executed with increased 25    computational resources, or used to create another 26    foundation model;  10400HB3506ham002- 7 -LRB104 12155 SPS 24972 a1        (4) the procedure the large developer will use to 2    determine whether and how to deploy a foundation model 3    when doing so poses critical risks;4        (5) the physical, digital, and organizational security 5    protections the large developer will implement to prevent 6    insiders or third parties from accessing foundation models 7    within the large developer's control in a manner that is 8    unauthorized by the large developer and could create 9    critical risk;10        (6) any safeguards and risk mitigation measures the 11    large developer uses to reduce critical risks from its 12    foundation models and how the large developer assesses 13    their efficacy and limitations;14        (7) how the large developer will respond if a critical 15    risk materializes or is imminently about to materialize;16        (8) the procedure that the large developer uses to 17    determine whether to conduct additional assessments for 18    critical risk when it modifies or expands access to its 19    foundation models or combines its foundation models with 20    other software and how the assessments are conducted;21        (9) the conditions under which the large developer 22    will report incidents relevant to critical risk that have 23    occurred in connection with one or more of its foundation 24    models and the entities to which the large developer will 25    make those reports;26        (10) the conditions under which the large developer   10400HB3506ham002- 8 -LRB104 12155 SPS 24972 a1    may or will make modifications to its safety and security 2    protocol;3        (11) the parts of the safety and security protocol, if 4    any, that the large developer believes provide sufficient 5    scientific detail to allow for the independent assessment 6    of the methods used to generate the results, evidence, and 7    analysis, and to which experts, if any, unredacted 8    versions are made available; and9        (12) any other role, if any, financially disinterested 10    third parties play in the implementation of the other 11    items of this definition.12    "Supervisor" means any individual who has the authority to 13direct and control the work performance of the affected 14employee or any individual who has managerial authority to 15take corrective action concerning critical risk in accordance 16with Section 30. 17    Section 15.

A large 14developer found guilty of violating Sections 15 or 25 may be 15assessed a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000,000. In 16calculating the civil penalty assessed under this subsection, 17a court shall consider the severity of the violation and 18whether the violation resulted in, or could have resulted in, 19the materialization of a critical risk.20    (b) The Attorney General may seek injunctive or 21declaratory relief for any violation of this Act. The Attorney 22General may also seek injunctive relief if a large developer's 23activities present an imminent threat of catastrophic harm to 24the public. 25    (c) In determining whether a large developer's act or   10400HB3506ham002- 15 -LRB104 12155 SPS 24972 a1omission breached its common law duty to take reasonable care 2with respect to critical risks, the following considerations 3are relevant but not conclusive:4        (1) the quality of the large developer's safety and 5    security protocol and the extent of the large developer's 6    adherence to it;7        (2) whether, in quality and implementation, the large 8    developer's investigation, documentation, evaluation, and 9    management of critical risks was inferior, comparable, or 10    superior to other large developers of foundation models 11    that may pose comparable critical risk;12        (3) the extent to which the large developer 13    responsibly informed the public of critical risks posed by 14    its foundation models; and15        (4) whether the societal benefit produced by the large 16    developer's act or omission outweighed the associated 17    critical risk. 18    Section 40. Enforcement of whistleblower protections.19    (a) Whenever the Attorney General has reasonable cause to 20believe that any large developer has engaged in a practice 21prohibited by Section 30, the Attorney General may, pursuant 22to the authority conferred by Section 6.3 of the Attorney 23General Act, initiate or intervene in a civil action in the 24name of the People of the State in any appropriate court to 25obtain appropriate relief.  10400HB3506ham002- 16 -LRB104 12155 SPS 24972 a1    (b) Before initiating an action, the Attorney General may 2conduct an investigation and may:3        (1) require a large developer to file a statement or 4    report in writing, under oath or otherwise, as to all 5    information the Attorney General may consider necessary;6        (2) examine under oath any person alleged to have 7    participated in, or with knowledge of, the alleged 8    violation; or9        (3) issue subpoenas or conduct hearings in aid of any 10    investigation.11    (c) Service by the Attorney General of any notice 12requiring a large developer to file a statement or report, or 13of a subpoena upon any large developer, shall be made:14        (1) personally by delivery of a duly executed copy 15    thereof to the person to be served or, if a person is not a 16    natural person, in the manner provided in the Code of 17    Civil Procedure when a complaint is filed; or18        (2) by mailing by certified mail a duly executed copy 19    thereof to the person to be served at the person's last 20    known abode or principal place of business within this 21    State or, if the person is not a natural person, in the 22    manner provided in the Code of Civil Procedure when a 23    complaint is filed. The Attorney General may compel 24    compliance with investigative demands under this Section 25    through an order by any court of competent jurisdiction.26    (d)(1) In an action brought under this Act, the Attorney   10400HB3506ham002- 17 -LRB104 12155 SPS 24972 a1General may obtain, as a remedy, monetary damages to the 2State, restitution, and equitable relief, including any 3permanent or preliminary injunction, temporary restraining 4order, or other order, including an order enjoining the 5defendant from engaging in a violation, or order any action as 6may be appropriate.
