Section 1:
Full Text of HR0129 ILGA.GOV HR0129 - 104th General Assembly HR0129LRB104 12087 MST 22185 r1HOUSE RESOLUTION 2    WHEREAS, Vaccination is proven to be a safe, invaluable 3tool to proactively safeguard public health and prevent the 4devastating effects of vaccine-preventable diseases; and 5    WHEREAS, Vaccination has averted over 154 million deaths 6globally since 1974, of which 146 million were among children 7younger than five years of age; and 8    WHEREAS, Vaccination has greatly reduced morbidity and 9mortality by eradicating vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., 10smallpox) and has greatly reduced the incidence of infections 11such as meningitis, measles, polio, and rubella; and 12    WHEREAS, Timely meningococcal vaccination in children and 13young adults helps protect against the debilitating effects of 14meningococcal disease, including death, and has led to a 15significant decrease in incidence; and 16    WHEREAS, Vaccination for highly contagious diseases such 17as measles is incredibly important; in order to achieve herd 18immunity against measles, 95% of the population must be 19vaccinated; if measles vaccination coverage rates drop below 20that threshold, outbreaks and preventable deaths will 21ultimately occur; therefore, maintaining high vaccine coverage   HR0129- 2 -LRB104 12087 MST 22185 r1rates is critical to protect the public and prevent 2transmission; and 3    WHEREAS, An analysis of costs associated with invasive 4meningococcal disease outbreaks found that the average cost 5per outbreak containment strategy was almost $440,000 6($299,641 and $579,851 for small and large containment 7strategies, respectively); and 8    WHEREAS, Among the approximately 117 million children born 9during 1994-2023 in the United States, vaccination averted 508 10million lifetime cases of illness, 32 million 11hospitalizations, and 1.1 million deaths, resulting in 12estimated savings of $540 billion in direct medical costs and 13$2.7 trillion in societal costs; and 14    WHEREAS, Vaccination can prevent the development of 15cancers later in life (e.g., human papillomavirus vaccination, 16which has contributed to a 65% reduction in cervical cancer 17incidence over the last decade); and 18    WHEREAS, Vaccination for four common diseases in older 19adults, including shingles, is estimated to prevent 64 million 20cases and $185 billion in treatment costs over the next 30 21years in the United States; and   HR0129- 3 -LRB104 12087 MST 22185 r1    WHEREAS, While vaccinating children provides substantial 2health and economic benefit, vaccinating adults is also 3important; many childhood vaccines provide life-long 4protection; however, immunity can decrease over a person's 5lifetime, and some vaccine-preventable diseases can be more 6severe in adults; and 7    WHEREAS, There continues to be disease burden in adults, 8especially in those with comorbidities, advanced age, or 9immunocompromising conditions, warranting continued, timely 10vaccination, especially against viruses that change frequently 11(e.g., influenza, COVID-19); and 12    WHEREAS, For example, vaccination against shingles for 13high-risk adults aged 19 and older, as well as all adults aged 1450 and older, has proven highly effective in preventing both 15the infection and its transmission, offering long-lasting 16protection for several years after immunization; and 17    WHEREAS, For example, respiratory syncytial virus 18vaccination in older adults is an effective preventive measure 19that reduces the likelihood of hospitalization and critical 20illness due to respiratory syncytial virus infection; and 21    WHEREAS, Vaccines remain a safe and effective public 22health measure; in the United States, vaccines undergo a   HR0129- 4 -LRB104 12087 MST 22185 r1thorough regulatory review process, which includes Food and 2Drug Administration (FDA) approval and a recommendation from 3the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) after 4careful evaluation; therefore, be it 5    RESOLVED, BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ONE 6HUNDRED FOURTH GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, that 7we declare April 10, 2025 as Vaccine Awareness Day in the State 8of Illinois to educate the public about the importance of 9vaccinations, initiate meaningful dialogue around 10vaccinations, and encourage the uptake of vaccines; and be it 11further 12    RESOLVED, That we urge the Illinois Department of Health 13to continue to promote to healthcare providers and the people 14of this state that vaccinations are a highly effective and 15safe public health measure and increase public awareness about 16the importance of all Illinois residents receiving recommended 17immunizations, and to promote outreach and education efforts 18concerning vaccinations; and be it further 19    RESOLVED, That we urge the Illinois Department of Health 20to continue to prioritize immunization initiatives, develop 21policies, and invest in immunization infrastructure to ensure 22broad and open access to immunizations to safeguard public 23health and protect the well-being of Illinois residents.
