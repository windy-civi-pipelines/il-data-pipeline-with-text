Amends the Property Tax Code. Provides that a municipality, upon adoption of an ordinance or resolution by majority vote of its corporate authorities, may order the county clerk to abate, for 20 years, the portion of the taxes levied upon an improved parcel of real property that is attributable to the increase in the current equalized assessed valuation of the parcel over and above the equalized assessed valuation of the parcel immediately before the demolition of the dilapidated structure on the parcel. Provides that "improved parcel of real property" means a parcel where redevelopment project costs have been used by the municipality for the construction of a new single-family residence on a parcel zoned for residential use after demolition or removal of a dilapidated structure from that parcel. Provides that an abatement approved under the provisions shall be extended to all subsequent owners of the improved parcel of real property during the abatement period.

An advanced state of disrepair 15        or neglect of necessary repairs to the primary 16        structural components of buildings or improvements in 17        such a combination that a documented building 18        condition analysis determines that major repair is 19        required or the defects are so serious and so 20        extensive that the buildings must be removed.21            (B) Obsolescence. The condition or process of 22        falling into disuse. Structures have become ill-suited 23        for the original use.24            (C) Deterioration. With respect to buildings, 25        defects including, but not limited to, major defects 26        in the secondary building components such as doors,   SB1832- 4 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        windows, porches, gutters and downspouts, and fascia. 2        With respect to surface improvements, that the 3        condition of roadways, alleys, curbs, gutters, 4        sidewalks, off-street parking, and surface storage 5        areas evidence deterioration, including, but not 6        limited to, surface cracking, crumbling, potholes, 7        depressions, loose paving material, and weeds 8        protruding through paved surfaces.9            (D) Presence of structures below minimum code 10        standards. All structures that do not meet the 11        standards of zoning, subdivision, building, fire, and 12        other governmental codes applicable to property, but 13        not including housing and property maintenance codes.14            (E) Illegal use of individual structures.

The presence of buildings 20        that are unoccupied or under-utilized and that 21        represent an adverse influence on the area because of 22        the frequency, extent, or duration of the vacancies.23            (G) Lack of ventilation, light, or sanitary 24        facilities. The absence of adequate ventilation for 25        light or air circulation in spaces or rooms without 26        windows, or that require the removal of dust, odor,   SB1832- 5 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        gas, smoke, or other noxious airborne materials. 2        Inadequate natural light and ventilation means the 3        absence of skylights or windows for interior spaces or 4        rooms and improper window sizes and amounts by room 5        area to window area ratios. Inadequate sanitary 6        facilities refers to the absence or inadequacy of 7        garbage storage and enclosure, bathroom facilities, 8        hot water and kitchens, and structural inadequacies 9        preventing ingress and egress to and from all rooms 10        and units within a building.11            (H) Inadequate utilities. Underground and overhead 12        utilities such as storm sewers and storm drainage, 13        sanitary sewers, water lines, and gas, telephone, and 14        electrical services that are shown to be inadequate. 15        Inadequate utilities are those that are: (i) of 16        insufficient capacity to serve the uses in the 17        redevelopment project area, (ii) deteriorated, 18        antiquated, obsolete, or in disrepair, or (iii) 19        lacking within the redevelopment project area.20            (I) Excessive land coverage and overcrowding of 21        structures and community facilities. The 22        over-intensive use of property and the crowding of 23        buildings and accessory facilities onto a site. 24        Examples of problem conditions warranting the 25        designation of an area as one exhibiting excessive 26        land coverage are: (i) the presence of buildings   SB1832- 6 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        either improperly situated on parcels or located on 2        parcels of inadequate size and shape in relation to 3        present-day standards of development for health and 4        safety and (ii) the presence of multiple buildings on 5        a single parcel. For there to be a finding of excessive 6        land coverage, these parcels must exhibit one or more 7        of the following conditions: insufficient provision 8        for light and air within or around buildings, 9        increased threat of spread of fire due to the close 10        proximity of buildings, lack of adequate or proper 11        access to a public right-of-way, lack of reasonably 12        required off-street parking, or inadequate provision 13        for loading and service.14            (J) Deleterious land use or layout. The existence 15        of incompatible land-use relationships, buildings 16        occupied by inappropriate mixed-uses, or uses 17        considered to be noxious, offensive, or unsuitable for 18        the surrounding area.19            (K) Environmental clean-up. The proposed 20        redevelopment project area has incurred Illinois 21        Environmental Protection Agency or United States 22        Environmental Protection Agency remediation costs for, 23        or a study conducted by an independent consultant 24        recognized as having expertise in environmental 25        remediation has determined a need for, the clean-up of 26        hazardous waste, hazardous substances, or underground   SB1832- 7 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        storage tanks required by State or federal law, 2        provided that the remediation costs constitute a 3        material impediment to the development or 4        redevelopment of the redevelopment project area.5            (L) Lack of community planning. The proposed 6        redevelopment project area was developed prior to or 7        without the benefit or guidance of a community plan. 8        This means that the development occurred prior to the 9        adoption by the municipality of a comprehensive or 10        other community plan or that the plan was not followed 11        at the time of the area's development. This factor 12        must be documented by evidence of adverse or 13        incompatible land-use relationships, inadequate street 14        layout, improper subdivision, parcels of inadequate 15        shape and size to meet contemporary development 16        standards, or other evidence demonstrating an absence 17        of effective community planning.18            (M) The total equalized assessed value of the 19        proposed redevelopment project area has declined for 3 20        of the last 5 calendar years prior to the year in which 21        the redevelopment project area is designated or is 22        increasing at an annual rate that is less than the 23        balance of the municipality for 3 of the last 5 24        calendar years for which information is available or 25        is increasing at an annual rate that is less than the 26        Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published   SB1832- 8 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        by the United States Department of Labor or successor 2        agency for 3 of the last 5 calendar years prior to the 3        year in which the redevelopment project area is 4        designated.5        (2) If vacant, the sound growth of the redevelopment 6    project area is impaired by a combination of 2 or more of 7    the following factors, each of which is (i) present, with 8    that presence documented, to a meaningful extent so that a 9    municipality may reasonably find that the factor is 10    clearly present within the intent of the Act and (ii) 11    reasonably distributed throughout the vacant part of the 12    redevelopment project area to which it pertains:13            (A) Obsolete platting of vacant land that results 14        in parcels of limited or narrow size or configurations 15        of parcels of irregular size or shape that would be 16        difficult to develop on a planned basis and in a manner 17        compatible with contemporary standards and 18        requirements, or platting that failed to create 19        rights-of-ways for streets or alleys or that created 20        inadequate right-of-way widths for streets, alleys, or 21        other public rights-of-way or that omitted easements 22        for public utilities.23            (B) Diversity of ownership of parcels of vacant 24        land sufficient in number to retard or impede the 25        ability to assemble the land for development.26            (C) Tax and special assessment delinquencies exist   SB1832- 9 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        or the property has been the subject of tax sales under 2        the Property Tax Code within the last 5 years.3            (D) Deterioration of structures or site 4        improvements in neighboring areas adjacent to the 5        vacant land.6            (E) The area has incurred Illinois Environmental 7        Protection Agency or United States Environmental 8        Protection Agency remediation costs for, or a study 9        conducted by an independent consultant recognized as 10        having expertise in environmental remediation has 11        determined a need for, the clean-up of hazardous 12        waste, hazardous substances, or underground storage 13        tanks required by State or federal law, provided that 14        the remediation costs constitute a material impediment 15        to the development or redevelopment of the 16        redevelopment project area.17            (F) The total equalized assessed value of the 18        proposed redevelopment project area has declined for 3 19        of the last 5 calendar years prior to the year in which 20        the redevelopment project area is designated or is 21        increasing at an annual rate that is less than the 22        balance of the municipality for 3 of the last 5 23        calendar years for which information is available or 24        is increasing at an annual rate that is less than the 25        Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published 26        by the United States Department of Labor or successor   SB1832- 10 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        agency for 3 of the last 5 calendar years prior to the 2        year in which the redevelopment project area is 3        designated.4        (3) If vacant, the sound growth of the redevelopment 5    project area is impaired by one of the following factors 6    that (i) is present, with that presence documented, to a 7    meaningful extent so that a municipality may reasonably 8    find that the factor is clearly present within the intent 9    of the Act and (ii) is reasonably distributed throughout 10    the vacant part of the redevelopment project area to which 11    it pertains:12            (A) The area consists of one or more unused 13        quarries, mines, or strip mine ponds.14            (B) The area consists of unused rail yards, rail 15        tracks, or railroad rights-of-way.16            (C) The area, prior to its designation, is subject 17        to (i) chronic flooding that adversely impacts on real 18        property in the area as certified by a registered 19        professional engineer or appropriate regulatory agency 20        or (ii) surface water that discharges from all or a 21        part of the area and contributes to flooding within 22        the same watershed, but only if the redevelopment 23        project provides for facilities or improvements to 24        contribute to the alleviation of all or part of the 25        flooding.26            (D) The area consists of an unused or illegal   SB1832- 11 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        disposal site containing earth, stone, building 2        debris, or similar materials that were removed from 3        construction, demolition, excavation, or dredge sites.4            (E) Prior to November 1, 1999, the area is not less 5        than 50 nor more than 100 acres and 75% of which is 6        vacant (notwithstanding

of the factors 10        itemized in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the area 11        has been designated as a town or village center by 12        ordinance or comprehensive plan adopted prior to 13        January 1, 1982, and the area has not been developed 14        for that designated purpose.15            (F) The area qualified as a blighted improved area 16        immediately prior to becoming vacant, unless there has 17        been substantial private investment in the immediately 18        surrounding area.19    (b) For any redevelopment project area that has been 20designated pursuant to this Section by an ordinance adopted 21prior to November 1, 1999 (the effective date of Public Act 2291-478), "conservation area" shall have the meaning set forth 23in this Section prior to that date.24    On and after November 1, 1999, "conservation area" means 25any improved area within the boundaries of a redevelopment 26project area located within the territorial limits of the   SB1832- 12 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1municipality in which 50% or more of the structures in the area 2have an age of 35 years or more. Such an area is not yet a 3blighted area but because of a combination of 3 or more of the 4following factors is detrimental to the public safety, health, 5morals or welfare and such an area may become a blighted area:6        (1) Dilapidation. An advanced state of disrepair or 7    neglect of necessary repairs to the primary structural 8    components of buildings or improvements in such a 9    combination that a documented building condition analysis 10    determines that major repair is required or the defects 11    are so serious and so extensive that the buildings must be 12    removed.13        (2) Obsolescence. The condition or process of falling 14    into disuse. Structures have become ill-suited for the 15    original use.16        (3) Deterioration. With respect to buildings, defects 17    including, but not limited to, major defects in the 18    secondary building components such as doors, windows, 19    porches, gutters and downspouts, and fascia.

The percentage of 75% shall be 23        substituted for 30% in subparagraphs (B) and (D) of 24        paragraph (11); and25            (F) instead of the eligible costs provided by 26        subparagraphs (B) and (D) of paragraph (11), as   SB1832- 49 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        modified by this subparagraph, and notwithstanding any 2        other provisions of this Act to the contrary, the 3        municipality may pay from tax increment revenues up to 4        50% of the cost of construction of new housing units to 5        be occupied by low-income households and very 6        low-income households as defined in Section 3 of the 7        Illinois Affordable Housing Act. The cost of 8        construction of those units may be derived from the 9        proceeds of bonds issued by the municipality under 10        this Act or other constitutional or statutory 11        authority or from other sources of municipal revenue 12        that may be reimbursed from tax increment revenues or 13        the proceeds of bonds issued to finance the 14        construction of that housing.15            The eligible costs provided under this 16        subparagraph (F) of paragraph (11) shall be an 17        eligible cost for the construction, renovation, and 18        rehabilitation of all low and very low-income housing 19        units, as defined in Section 3 of the Illinois 20        Affordable Housing Act, within the redevelopment 21        project area. If the low and very low-income units are 22        part of a residential redevelopment project that 23        includes units not affordable to low and very 24        low-income households, only the low and very 25        low-income units shall be eligible for benefits under 26        this subparagraph (F) of paragraph (11).

The responsibility for 8        annually documenting the initial occupancy of the 9        units by low-income households and very low-income 10        households, as defined in Section 3 of the Illinois 11        Affordable Housing Act, shall be that of the then 12        current owner of the property. For ownership units, 13        the guidelines will provide, at a minimum, for a 14        reasonable recapture of funds, or other appropriate 15        methods designed to preserve the original 16        affordability of the ownership units. For rental 17        units, the guidelines will provide, at a minimum, for 18        the affordability of rent to low and very low-income 19        households. As units become available, they shall be 20        rented to income-eligible tenants. The municipality 21        may modify these guidelines from time to time; the 22        guidelines, however, shall be in effect for as long as 23        tax increment revenue is being used to pay for costs 24        associated with the units or for the retirement of 25        bonds issued to finance the units or for the life of 26        the redevelopment project area, whichever is later;  SB1832- 51 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        (11.5) If the redevelopment project area is located 2    within a municipality with a population of more than 3    100,000, the cost of day care services for children of 4    employees from low-income families working for businesses 5    located within the redevelopment project area and all or a 6    portion of the cost of operation of day care centers 7    established by redevelopment project area businesses to 8    serve employees from low-income families working in 9    businesses located in the redevelopment project area. For 10    the purposes of this paragraph, "low-income families" 11    means families whose annual income does not exceed 80% of 12    the municipal, county, or regional median income, adjusted 13    for family size, as the annual income and municipal, 14    county, or regional median income are determined from time 15    to time by the United States Department of Housing and 16    Urban Development.17        (12) Costs relating to the development of urban 18    agricultural areas under Division 15.2 of the Illinois 19    Municipal Code. 20    Unless explicitly stated herein the cost of construction 21of new privately-owned buildings shall not be an eligible 22redevelopment project cost.23    After November 1, 1999 (the effective date of Public Act 2491-478), none of the redevelopment project costs enumerated in 25this subsection shall be eligible redevelopment project costs 26if those costs would provide direct financial support to a   SB1832- 52 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1retail entity initiating operations in the redevelopment 2project area while terminating operations at another Illinois 3location within 10 miles of the redevelopment project area but 4outside the boundaries of the redevelopment project area 5municipality. For purposes of this paragraph, termination 6means a closing of a retail operation that is directly related 7to the opening of the same operation or like retail entity 8owned or operated by more than 50% of the original ownership in 9a redevelopment project area, but it does not mean closing an 10operation for reasons beyond the control of the retail entity, 11as documented by the retail entity, subject to a reasonable 12finding by the municipality that the current location 13contained inadequate space, had become economically obsolete, 14or was no longer a viable location for the retailer or 15serviceman.16    No cost shall be a redevelopment project cost in a 17redevelopment project area if used to demolish, remove, or 18substantially modify a historic resource, after August 26, 192008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-934), unless no 20prudent and feasible alternative exists.

An advanced state of disrepair 15        or neglect of necessary repairs to the primary 16        structural components of buildings or improvements in 17        such a combination that a documented building 18        condition analysis determines that major repair is 19        required or the defects are so serious and so 20        extensive that the buildings must be removed.21            (B) Obsolescence. The condition or process of 22        falling into disuse. Structures have become ill-suited 23        for the original use.24            (C) Deterioration. With respect to buildings, 25        defects including, but not limited to, major defects 26        in the secondary building components such as doors,   SB1832- 4 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        windows, porches, gutters and downspouts, and fascia. 2        With respect to surface improvements, that the 3        condition of roadways, alleys, curbs, gutters, 4        sidewalks, off-street parking, and surface storage 5        areas evidence deterioration, including, but not 6        limited to, surface cracking, crumbling, potholes, 7        depressions, loose paving material, and weeds 8        protruding through paved surfaces.9            (D) Presence of structures below minimum code 10        standards. All structures that do not meet the 11        standards of zoning, subdivision, building, fire, and 12        other governmental codes applicable to property, but 13        not including housing and property maintenance codes.14            (E) Illegal use of individual structures.

The presence of buildings 20        that are unoccupied or under-utilized and that 21        represent an adverse influence on the area because of 22        the frequency, extent, or duration of the vacancies.23            (G) Lack of ventilation, light, or sanitary 24        facilities. The absence of adequate ventilation for 25        light or air circulation in spaces or rooms without 26        windows, or that require the removal of dust, odor,   SB1832- 5 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        gas, smoke, or other noxious airborne materials. 2        Inadequate natural light and ventilation means the 3        absence of skylights or windows for interior spaces or 4        rooms and improper window sizes and amounts by room 5        area to window area ratios. Inadequate sanitary 6        facilities refers to the absence or inadequacy of 7        garbage storage and enclosure, bathroom facilities, 8        hot water and kitchens, and structural inadequacies 9        preventing ingress and egress to and from all rooms 10        and units within a building.11            (H) Inadequate utilities. Underground and overhead 12        utilities such as storm sewers and storm drainage, 13        sanitary sewers, water lines, and gas, telephone, and 14        electrical services that are shown to be inadequate. 15        Inadequate utilities are those that are: (i) of 16        insufficient capacity to serve the uses in the 17        redevelopment project area, (ii) deteriorated, 18        antiquated, obsolete, or in disrepair, or (iii) 19        lacking within the redevelopment project area.20            (I) Excessive land coverage and overcrowding of 21        structures and community facilities. The 22        over-intensive use of property and the crowding of 23        buildings and accessory facilities onto a site. 24        Examples of problem conditions warranting the 25        designation of an area as one exhibiting excessive 26        land coverage are: (i) the presence of buildings   SB1832- 6 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        either improperly situated on parcels or located on 2        parcels of inadequate size and shape in relation to 3        present-day standards of development for health and 4        safety and (ii) the presence of multiple buildings on 5        a single parcel. For there to be a finding of excessive 6        land coverage, these parcels must exhibit one or more 7        of the following conditions: insufficient provision 8        for light and air within or around buildings, 9        increased threat of spread of fire due to the close 10        proximity of buildings, lack of adequate or proper 11        access to a public right-of-way, lack of reasonably 12        required off-street parking, or inadequate provision 13        for loading and service.14            (J) Deleterious land use or layout. The existence 15        of incompatible land-use relationships, buildings 16        occupied by inappropriate mixed-uses, or uses 17        considered to be noxious, offensive, or unsuitable for 18        the surrounding area.19            (K) Environmental clean-up. The proposed 20        redevelopment project area has incurred Illinois 21        Environmental Protection Agency or United States 22        Environmental Protection Agency remediation costs for, 23        or a study conducted by an independent consultant 24        recognized as having expertise in environmental 25        remediation has determined a need for, the clean-up of 26        hazardous waste, hazardous substances, or underground   SB1832- 7 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        storage tanks required by State or federal law, 2        provided that the remediation costs constitute a 3        material impediment to the development or 4        redevelopment of the redevelopment project area.5            (L) Lack of community planning. The proposed 6        redevelopment project area was developed prior to or 7        without the benefit or guidance of a community plan. 8        This means that the development occurred prior to the 9        adoption by the municipality of a comprehensive or 10        other community plan or that the plan was not followed 11        at the time of the area's development. This factor 12        must be documented by evidence of adverse or 13        incompatible land-use relationships, inadequate street 14        layout, improper subdivision, parcels of inadequate 15        shape and size to meet contemporary development 16        standards, or other evidence demonstrating an absence 17        of effective community planning.18            (M) The total equalized assessed value of the 19        proposed redevelopment project area has declined for 3 20        of the last 5 calendar years prior to the year in which 21        the redevelopment project area is designated or is 22        increasing at an annual rate that is less than the 23        balance of the municipality for 3 of the last 5 24        calendar years for which information is available or 25        is increasing at an annual rate that is less than the 26        Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published   SB1832- 8 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        by the United States Department of Labor or successor 2        agency for 3 of the last 5 calendar years prior to the 3        year in which the redevelopment project area is 4        designated.5        (2) If vacant, the sound growth of the redevelopment 6    project area is impaired by a combination of 2 or more of 7    the following factors, each of which is (i) present, with 8    that presence documented, to a meaningful extent so that a 9    municipality may reasonably find that the factor is 10    clearly present within the intent of the Act and (ii) 11    reasonably distributed throughout the vacant part of the 12    redevelopment project area to which it pertains:13            (A) Obsolete platting of vacant land that results 14        in parcels of limited or narrow size or configurations 15        of parcels of irregular size or shape that would be 16        difficult to develop on a planned basis and in a manner 17        compatible with contemporary standards and 18        requirements, or platting that failed to create 19        rights-of-ways for streets or alleys or that created 20        inadequate right-of-way widths for streets, alleys, or 21        other public rights-of-way or that omitted easements 22        for public utilities.23            (B) Diversity of ownership of parcels of vacant 24        land sufficient in number to retard or impede the 25        ability to assemble the land for development.26            (C) Tax and special assessment delinquencies exist   SB1832- 9 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        or the property has been the subject of tax sales under 2        the Property Tax Code within the last 5 years.3            (D) Deterioration of structures or site 4        improvements in neighboring areas adjacent to the 5        vacant land.6            (E) The area has incurred Illinois Environmental 7        Protection Agency or United States Environmental 8        Protection Agency remediation costs for, or a study 9        conducted by an independent consultant recognized as 10        having expertise in environmental remediation has 11        determined a need for, the clean-up of hazardous 12        waste, hazardous substances, or underground storage 13        tanks required by State or federal law, provided that 14        the remediation costs constitute a material impediment 15        to the development or redevelopment of the 16        redevelopment project area.17            (F) The total equalized assessed value of the 18        proposed redevelopment project area has declined for 3 19        of the last 5 calendar years prior to the year in which 20        the redevelopment project area is designated or is 21        increasing at an annual rate that is less than the 22        balance of the municipality for 3 of the last 5 23        calendar years for which information is available or 24        is increasing at an annual rate that is less than the 25        Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published 26        by the United States Department of Labor or successor   SB1832- 10 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        agency for 3 of the last 5 calendar years prior to the 2        year in which the redevelopment project area is 3        designated.4        (3) If vacant, the sound growth of the redevelopment 5    project area is impaired by one of the following factors 6    that (i) is present, with that presence documented, to a 7    meaningful extent so that a municipality may reasonably 8    find that the factor is clearly present within the intent 9    of the Act and (ii) is reasonably distributed throughout 10    the vacant part of the redevelopment project area to which 11    it pertains:12            (A) The area consists of one or more unused 13        quarries, mines, or strip mine ponds.14            (B) The area consists of unused rail yards, rail 15        tracks, or railroad rights-of-way.16            (C) The area, prior to its designation, is subject 17        to (i) chronic flooding that adversely impacts on real 18        property in the area as certified by a registered 19        professional engineer or appropriate regulatory agency 20        or (ii) surface water that discharges from all or a 21        part of the area and contributes to flooding within 22        the same watershed, but only if the redevelopment 23        project provides for facilities or improvements to 24        contribute to the alleviation of all or part of the 25        flooding.26            (D) The area consists of an unused or illegal   SB1832- 11 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        disposal site containing earth, stone, building 2        debris, or similar materials that were removed from 3        construction, demolition, excavation, or dredge sites.4            (E) Prior to November 1, 1999, the area is not less 5        than 50 nor more than 100 acres and 75% of which is 6        vacant (notwithstanding

of the factors 10        itemized in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the area 11        has been designated as a town or village center by 12        ordinance or comprehensive plan adopted prior to 13        January 1, 1982, and the area has not been developed 14        for that designated purpose.15            (F) The area qualified as a blighted improved area 16        immediately prior to becoming vacant, unless there has 17        been substantial private investment in the immediately 18        surrounding area.19    (b) For any redevelopment project area that has been 20designated pursuant to this Section by an ordinance adopted 21prior to November 1, 1999 (the effective date of Public Act 2291-478), "conservation area" shall have the meaning set forth 23in this Section prior to that date.24    On and after November 1, 1999, "conservation area" means 25any improved area within the boundaries of a redevelopment 26project area located within the territorial limits of the   SB1832- 12 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1municipality in which 50% or more of the structures in the area 2have an age of 35 years or more. Such an area is not yet a 3blighted area but because of a combination of 3 or more of the 4following factors is detrimental to the public safety, health, 5morals or welfare and such an area may become a blighted area:6        (1) Dilapidation. An advanced state of disrepair or 7    neglect of necessary repairs to the primary structural 8    components of buildings or improvements in such a 9    combination that a documented building condition analysis 10    determines that major repair is required or the defects 11    are so serious and so extensive that the buildings must be 12    removed.13        (2) Obsolescence. The condition or process of falling 14    into disuse. Structures have become ill-suited for the 15    original use.16        (3) Deterioration.

The percentage of 75% shall be 23        substituted for 30% in subparagraphs (B) and (D) of 24        paragraph (11); and25            (F) instead of the eligible costs provided by 26        subparagraphs (B) and (D) of paragraph (11), as   SB1832- 49 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        modified by this subparagraph, and notwithstanding any 2        other provisions of this Act to the contrary, the 3        municipality may pay from tax increment revenues up to 4        50% of the cost of construction of new housing units to 5        be occupied by low-income households and very 6        low-income households as defined in Section 3 of the 7        Illinois Affordable Housing Act. The cost of 8        construction of those units may be derived from the 9        proceeds of bonds issued by the municipality under 10        this Act or other constitutional or statutory 11        authority or from other sources of municipal revenue 12        that may be reimbursed from tax increment revenues or 13        the proceeds of bonds issued to finance the 14        construction of that housing.15            The eligible costs provided under this 16        subparagraph (F) of paragraph (11) shall be an 17        eligible cost for the construction, renovation, and 18        rehabilitation of all low and very low-income housing 19        units, as defined in Section 3 of the Illinois 20        Affordable Housing Act, within the redevelopment 21        project area. If the low and very low-income units are 22        part of a residential redevelopment project that 23        includes units not affordable to low and very 24        low-income households, only the low and very 25        low-income units shall be eligible for benefits under 26        this subparagraph (F) of paragraph (11).

The responsibility for 8        annually documenting the initial occupancy of the 9        units by low-income households and very low-income 10        households, as defined in Section 3 of the Illinois 11        Affordable Housing Act, shall be that of the then 12        current owner of the property. For ownership units, 13        the guidelines will provide, at a minimum, for a 14        reasonable recapture of funds, or other appropriate 15        methods designed to preserve the original 16        affordability of the ownership units. For rental 17        units, the guidelines will provide, at a minimum, for 18        the affordability of rent to low and very low-income 19        households. As units become available, they shall be 20        rented to income-eligible tenants. The municipality 21        may modify these guidelines from time to time; the 22        guidelines, however, shall be in effect for as long as 23        tax increment revenue is being used to pay for costs 24        associated with the units or for the retirement of 25        bonds issued to finance the units or for the life of 26        the redevelopment project area, whichever is later;  SB1832- 51 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1        (11.5) If the redevelopment project area is located 2    within a municipality with a population of more than 3    100,000, the cost of day care services for children of 4    employees from low-income families working for businesses 5    located within the redevelopment project area and all or a 6    portion of the cost of operation of day care centers 7    established by redevelopment project area businesses to 8    serve employees from low-income families working in 9    businesses located in the redevelopment project area. For 10    the purposes of this paragraph, "low-income families" 11    means families whose annual income does not exceed 80% of 12    the municipal, county, or regional median income, adjusted 13    for family size, as the annual income and municipal, 14    county, or regional median income are determined from time 15    to time by the United States Department of Housing and 16    Urban Development.17        (12) Costs relating to the development of urban 18    agricultural areas under Division 15.2 of the Illinois 19    Municipal Code. 20    Unless explicitly stated herein the cost of construction 21of new privately-owned buildings shall not be an eligible 22redevelopment project cost.23    After November 1, 1999 (the effective date of Public Act 2491-478), none of the redevelopment project costs enumerated in 25this subsection shall be eligible redevelopment project costs 26if those costs would provide direct financial support to a   SB1832- 52 -LRB104 03760 RTM 13784 b1retail entity initiating operations in the redevelopment 2project area while terminating operations at another Illinois 3location within 10 miles of the redevelopment project area but 4outside the boundaries of the redevelopment project area 5municipality. For purposes of this paragraph, termination 6means a closing of a retail operation that is directly related 7to the opening of the same operation or like retail entity 8owned or operated by more than 50% of the original ownership in 9a redevelopment project area, but it does not mean closing an 10operation for reasons beyond the control of the retail entity, 11as documented by the retail entity, subject to a reasonable 12finding by the municipality that the current location 13contained inadequate space, had become economically obsolete, 14or was no longer a viable location for the retailer or 15serviceman.16    No cost shall be a redevelopment project cost in a 17redevelopment project area if used to demolish, remove, or 18substantially modify a historic resource, after August 26, 192008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-934), unless no 20prudent and feasible alternative exists.
