Upon 23    becoming aware, officers must as soon as practical 24    document and notify the appropriate supervisor of any 25    technical difficulties, failures, or problems with the 26    officer-worn body camera or associated equipment. Upon   HB3515- 18 -LRB104 12175 BDA 22277 b1    receiving notice, the appropriate supervisor shall make 2    every reasonable effort to correct and repair any of the 3    officer-worn body camera equipment.4        (11) No officer may hinder or prohibit any person, not 5    a law enforcement officer, from recording a law 6    enforcement officer in the performance of his or her 7    duties in a public place or when the officer has no 8    reasonable expectation of privacy. The law enforcement 9    agency's written policy shall indicate the potential 10    criminal penalties, as well as any departmental 11    discipline, which may result from unlawful confiscation or 12    destruction of the recording medium of a person who is not 13    a law enforcement officer. However, an officer may take 14    reasonable action to maintain safety and control, secure 15    crime scenes and accident sites, protect the integrity and 16    confidentiality of investigations, and protect the public 17    safety and order.18    (b) Recordings made with the use of an officer-worn body 19camera are not subject to disclosure under the Freedom of 20Information Act, except that:21        (1) if the subject of the encounter has a reasonable 22    expectation of privacy, at the time of the recording, any 23    recording which is flagged, due to the filing of a 24    complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of force, arrest or 25    detention, or resulting death or bodily harm, shall be 26    disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of Information   HB3515- 19 -LRB104 12175 BDA 22277 b1    Act if:2            (A) the subject of the encounter captured on the 3        recording is a victim or witness; and4            (B) the law enforcement agency obtains written 5        permission of the subject or the subject's legal 6        representative;7        (2) except as provided in paragraph (1) of this 8    subsection (b), and unless disclosure is requested for a 9    commercial purpose, as defined in the Freedom of 10    Information Act, any recording which is flagged due to the 11    filing of a complaint, discharge of a firearm, use of 12    force, arrest or detention, or resulting death or bodily 13    harm shall be disclosed in accordance with the Freedom of 14    Information Act; and15        (3) upon request, the law enforcement agency shall 16    disclose, in accordance with the Freedom of Information 17    Act, the recording to the subject of the encounter 18    captured on the recording or to the subject's attorney, or 19    the officer or his or her legal representative.20    For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection (b), 21the subject of the encounter does not have a reasonable 22expectation of privacy if the subject was arrested as a result 23of the encounter.
